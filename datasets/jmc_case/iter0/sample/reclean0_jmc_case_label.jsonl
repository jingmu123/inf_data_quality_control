Although used most commonly to control fluid balance, an uncommon adverse effect of the thiazide diuretics is hyperglycemia. We present a 6-year-old girl with congenital heart disease (CHD) who developed profound hyperglycemia when a thiazide diuretic was added to her medication regimen. Previous reports of similar responses are reviewed, physiologic mechanisms are postulated, and treatment strategies are proposed.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 6.5-year-old, 17.75 kg girl who was sent to the emergency department after clinical blood work revealed an elevated blood glucose level. She had originally been brought in for outpatient blood work 1 week after the addition of an additional diuretic, chlorothiazide, to her medication regimen. The laboratory analysis at the outpatient clinic revealed a blood glucose level greater than 700 mg/dL. Additional complaints included that she seemed more tired than usual and there had been a 2.1 kg weight loss from the prior week’s appointment. There was no history of other constitutional symptoms such as fever, cough or diarrhea. Her past medical history was significant for a congenital hyperinsulin state controlled with oral diazoxide, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), and coarctation of the aorta. Her past surgical history included multiple cardiac procedures for surgical palliation of HLHS including: a stage 1 hybrid procedure in 2009 which was followed by balloon atrial septostomy 6 - 8 weeks later, surgical atrial septectomy later that year, and a modified comprehensive stage II procedure with a Glenn shunt, followed most recently by a Fontan procedure in 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The Fontan procedure was complicated by a chronic pleural effusion requiring an implanted pleural catheter. Other associated co-morbid conditions included gastroesophageal reflux, a seizure disorder, previous hypoxic-ischemic insults, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Her home medications included spironolactone 20 mg twice a day, aspirin 81 mg once a day, diazoxide 50 mg three times a day as well as the recently added chlorothiazide 250 mg once a day. There were no known drug allergies. Following admission to the Cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU), the blood glucose values remained elevated ranging from 569 to 702 mg/dL along with low sodium and chloride values. The venous blood gas at the time of admission to the CTICU showed a normal pH and normal lactate levels (pH 7.36, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 52 mm Hg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 47 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> 22 mmol/L, base excess +3.3 mmol/L, and lactate 1.3 mmol/L). The chlorothiazide and diazoxide were stopped; however, the blood glucose values did not return to normal so an intravenous insulin infusion was started at 0.02 units/kg/h. This was continued for 3 days which resulted in control of her blood glucose values. Her insulin regimen was then transitioned to intermittent subcutaneous insulin for 1 week at which time chlorothiazide was restarted. Following the restarting of chlorothiazide, the insulin therapy was slowly withdrawn without any clinically significant change in her blood glucose values. The remainder of the hospital stay was uneventful with close monitoring of blood glucose values which remained within normal limits. The patient was discharged home 18 days after the initial admission date.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Hyperglycemia in children may present simply as increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue or in the later stages as severe as nausea, vomiting, alterations in the pattern of respiration (Kussmaul breathing), abdominal pain, and even coma. While there are several potential causes of hyperglycemia, the most common in children is a decrease in the production of insulin by the pancreas which results in diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is generally classified as type 1 or type 2. Type 1 DM is the result of an autoimmune process with destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. In contrast, various pathophysiologic processes contribute to type 2 DM including varying degrees of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7-11 \\]</u>. The clinical features of DM may be modified by genetic or environmental influences.\n\n【6】There are major metabolic derangements that may occur in patients with either DM type 1 or type 2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) generally occurs as a complication of DM type 1 and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia (HHS) as a complication of DM type 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Both of these are life-threatening emergencies requiring hospitalization and aggressive therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality. A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as was noted in our patient, was previously known as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic coma (HHNC). It is a less common consequence of profound hyperglycemia, seen most commonly in the adult patient with DM type 2. The terminology was changed because coma occurred in less than 20% of patients. HHS most commonly occurs in patients with type 2 DM who have a concomitant illness that leads to reduced fluid intake. HHS is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity and dehydration without ketoacidosis; however, it carries a higher mortality rate than DKA estimated at approximately 10-20%. Most patients present with severe dehydration and focal or global neurological deficits. In as many as one-third of patients, the clinical features of HHS and DKA overlap. In our patient, hyperglycemia and subsequently HHS coincided with initiation of therapy with the diuretic, chlorothiazide. This interaction has been documented by other reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13-16 \\]</u>. Treatment with thiazide diuretics has been shown to be an independent predictor of the onset of new diabetes among patients with hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. While the exact process responsible for the hyperglycemia associated with the thiazides diuretics remains speculative, it has been postulated that they may increase serum glucose values by activating the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. These mechanisms are supported by the fact that the effects of thiazides on serum glucose can be mitigated by inhibiting the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone axis. Alternatively, it has been suggested that hypokalemia causes an indirect reduction in insulin secretion, thereby leading others to suggest strategies that maintaining normal potassium concentrations may prevent glucose intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】In summary, we present the development of clinically significant hyperglycemia following the addition of a thiazide diuretic to the medication regimen of a 6-year-old girl with associated CHD. The clinical consequences were likely magnified by the accompanying administration of diazoxide to treat a previously diagnosed hyperinsulin state. Once the diazoxide was discontinued, it was then feasible to reinstitute chlorothiazide therapy without alterations in serum glucose levels. Given this and additional adverse effects of the thiazide class of medications, other agents are generally used as first-line treatment of hypertension in adults. Although uncommon, when such effects are seen in the pediatric population, alternative diuretics should be used. Alternatively, it appears that the response may be mitigated by maintaining the serum potassium value within the normal range through the use of potassium-sparing diuretics and/or oral potassium supplementation. In specific patient populations, close monitoring of blood glucose values may be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Coronary artery fistulas (CAFs) are known as terminating defects and are considered severe congenital anomalies. A CAF involves a sizable comminucation between a coronary artery, bypassing the myocardial capillary bed and entering either a chamber of the heart or any segment of the systemic or pulmonary circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These lesions are similar in their pathophysiology, and often referred to as coronary arteriovenous fistulas (CAVFs). The relation of the coronary artery to the pulmonary artery may also be included under this category. However, if the so-called artery occurs only from the pulmonary trunk without a clear connection to the aorta, it is known as the pulmonary artery’s unusual origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In most cases, small fistulas never compromise the circulation of the hemodynamic imbalances. The larger fistulas can cause the phenomenon of coronary artery steal, ultimately causing ischemic myocardial segment perfusion at the segment of the coronary artery that is being fed by the fistulization-related structures. The pathophysiological feature of the coronary fistula is myocardial leak or decrease in myocardial blood flow distal to the direction of the coronary fistula. The mechanism is connected to the gradient of diastolic pressure and to a low-pressure receiving cavity runoff from the coronary vasculature. When the fistula is large, the intracoronary diastolic infusion pressure decreases gradually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Based on results in traditional coronary angiography trials, the prevalence of CAFs was considered to be 0.05-0.25% in the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The majority of CAFs are diagnosed incidentally during cardiac catheterization. However, some studies have shown that coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography detects coronary artery anomalies at a higher rate than traditional coronary angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 53-year-old female was admitted to the hospital due to chest pain. She had a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. She had no drug history. Her cardiovascular physical examination was normal. All blood investigations were normal including renal parameters. The patient’s resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. She underwent an elective coronary (CAG) due to indications of stable.\n\n【4】Coronary angiography revealed no stenosis in the coronary arteries but there was a fistulation between the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the pulmonary artery . After the coronary angiography, her chest pain disappeared. No catheterization or surgical intervention was done. Due to her atrial fibrillation, she was discharged with anticoagulants and beta-blockers. The patient has remained asymptomatic with no clinical or hemodynamic effects during the clinical follow-up.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. The fistula of the coronary artery (arrow). Angiography reveals the pulmonary fistula to proximal LAD. LAD: left anterior descending. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】The fistula of the coronary artery is characterized as unusual contact between the coronary arteries and a systemic or pulmonary circulation component. In several studies, the incidence of CAF has been reported as less than 1%. The word “coronary-cameral fistula” refers to the contact between a cardiac chamber and the coronary arteries. Although most are congenital, in cases of trauma, as a complication of coronary artery bypass surgery and in some cases of Takayasu’s arteritis, acquired fistulas have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Most patients are asymptomatic and may develop signs of angina and dyspnea if other disorders are diagnosed, such as coronary artery disease or heart failure. For coronary fistulas, there is no specific treatment procedure, but both surgical intervention and trans-catheter embolization have been reported. Surgical treatment rather than embolization can be a realistic choice for patients who are symptomatic secondary to the CAF but remains controversial in patients who are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Research published in 2017 reported that none of the 21 adult patients who had surgery with CAF ligation had surgical or any hospital mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Surgical ligation or transcatheter closure (TCC) therapeutic intervention is typically performed in patients with symptomatic fistula, or in the event of a complication. The preferred approach is percutaneous TCC, since it is less invasive and prevents the potential risks of surgery. Anatomy, however, may not be conducive to TCC, especially when the vessel is tortuous or has a large fistula; surgical closure is preferred in these cases. In terms of treatment for asymptomatic patients, there is no general consensus. Closer follow-up can be considered in patients that have small fistulas with significant shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n\n【9】The general consensus in symptomatic patients recommends surgical treatment if the fistula has a compromised cardiac function or if the etiology underlies any other related sequelae. However, there was a discussion about the size and location of fistulas in relation to surgical treatment in an asymptomatic patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the current case, an asymptomatic coronary fistula has originally been described with no clinical or hemodynamic effect, therefore a clinical follow-up with the patient remaining asymptomatic was chosen. This report demonstrates once again that individualized consideration is important when the asymptomatic CAF is diagnosed.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>First and foremost, we are very grateful to Dr. Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital Cardiology Specialist Dr. Osman Beton and Dr. Gulgun Vaiz for their invaluable advice, continued support and patience during our case study.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We declare that we have neither a conflict of interest nor a suggestion of interest regarding the content of this paper.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>In this case, informed consent was not required.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Musa Muhtaroglu presented the proposal, collected data, made an angiography CD and edited the manuscript.

HD is usually a congenital disorder, occurring in approximately one in 5000 live births, with an overall male: female ratio of 3:1 to 4:1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, however, roughly 5% of HD cases are diagnosed in the adult population; it is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic constipation in these individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, and a common presentation is with volvulus of a colonic segment.\n\n【2】We present a case of chronic constipation with a clinical history and radiologic findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> which mimicked Hirschsprung Disease diagnosed in the adult as described by case reports and series by others \\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\].\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Our subject is a 65 years old male, skilled nursing facility resident, with a history of schizoaffective disorder and chronic constipation, with a recent admission to our institution one month prior with bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid volvulus. The patient was surgically managed by subtotal colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis with an uneventful hospital course and was safely discharged. On present admission, one month later, he returned with three episodes of projectile vomiting of food and bilious material. Review of systems was positive for constipation, chronic in nature for our subject, as well as nausea. Abdominal X-ray showed distended bowel loops with a non-specific pattern, given the patient's history a CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast was pursued , which showed massive dilation of the remaining rectum and Ileal loops filled with impacted stool. He was managed conservatively with rectal tube decompression of the bowel as well as an aggressive bowel regimen. The patient's presentation and imagery prompted us to review the literature and begin a workup for possible adult presentation of Hirschsprung Disease. Ano-rectal manometry demonstrated an absent recto-anal inhibitory reflex. From these suggestive findings we proceeded to perform a full thickness mucosal biopsy of the patient's remaining rectal mucosa, the gold standard diagnostic tool for HD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, which failed to show aganglionosis of the remaining rectal mucosa, therefore discarding Hirschsprung of our differential diagnoses.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In the majority of patients, the disorder affects a short segment of the distal colon, with a transition zone in the rectosigmoid colon. This condition was first described by Harald Hirschsprung in 1886 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The majority of patients with HD are diagnosed in the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, and though adult onset HD was thought to be rare, Hirschsprung himself had suggested as early as 1900, that the disease was not confined to children and several cases of adult HD have been reported since then 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. About 5% of patients with less severe disease may not be diagnosed until early adulthood, most of them between the second and third decade of life, and are frequently misdiagnosed as chronic constipation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, these may not be truly diagnosed until an acute presentation with complications such as obstructive colitis, sigmoid volvulus or sub-acute obstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Several cases have been diagnosed after presenting with a volvulus of the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, likely due to an aganglionic segment of gut below the sigmoid colon and a freely mobile mesosigmoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The above described clinical vignette in addition to manifest radiologic imagery similar to that described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> prompted the authors to consider Hirschsprung disease in the adult setting for this patient whose most likely problem is rather chronic constipation.

Stroke has been proven to produce changes in autonomic function, increase the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and increase the serum levels of catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Most deaths occurring after an ischemic stroke can be directly attributed to the neurological injury, but 2-6% of all stroke patients will die from cardiac causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】In clinical studies, the most important control sites of autonomic function are the insular cortex, amygdala and lateral hypothalamus. Further analysis has shown that strokes in the right hemisphere produce more significant sympathetic effect than left-sided strokes. Localization and mapping of the right hemisphere has actually shown the right insular cortex in particular to be very significant in producing some of the more deadly cardiac arrhythmias after a cerebrovascular accident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.

In addition to the weakness, she was complaining of a day of chest pain and shortness of breath but was denying any other accompanying symptoms. Upon presentation, her vitals were significant only for mild hypotension. A stroke code was immediately called and she had lab work done and was sent for a head CT. Labs including cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. Initially, the head CT was within normal limits, but a repeat CT showed a new hypodensity in the right posterior insular cortex . MRI was unable to be performed in this patient due to implants. EKG on admission showed a prolonged QTc, poor R wave progression, Q waves . Echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with global cardiomyopathy. She was admitted and treated medically, and her weakness resolved. During her stay, she had multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and upon discharge, she was sent home with a beta-blocker, aspirin, high-dose statin and a life vest.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Upon arrival, her vitals were significant for tachycardia into the 120 s. Her labs were significant for an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. During her stay, she had multiple runs of premature ventricular complexes and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient was sent for a coronary angiogram that showed normal coronary vessels. She was treated with amiodarone and digoxin and then evaluated by electrophysiology regarding the placement of an internal defibrillator. Due to her ejection fraction being above 35%, the team felt she did not qualify for the defibrillator and was sent home with her beta-blocker, amiodarone and apixaban once she was diuresed and asymptomatic.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】In humans, stroke in both hemispheres has been shown to produce changes in autonomic function leading to arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. In a study by Lane et al, it was determined that right hemisphere infarction is associated with a greater number of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). They speculated that this was due to a decrease in parasympathetic activity in the right-sided infarcts leading to a reciprocal rise in sympathetic tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Of all the areas involved in autonomic function, studies have shown the insular cortex to play a major role. This area within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is of particular importance as it has been shown to play a role both in the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular regulation. Usually the insula is involved in MCA occlusion, which is a major cause of ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】It has been shown that focal cerebral ischemia in animals tends to lead to fluctuation in heart rate and blood pressure only if the insular cortex is involved. In fact, stimulation of different areas within the insular cortex will invoke different cardiac autonomic responses. Microstimulation of a rat left insula resulted in QT interval prolongation, ST depression, bradycardia and complete heart block. On examination, the plasma noradrenaline levels were elevated without a change in adrenaline, indicating a neural rather than an adrenal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Lesions in the right posterior insula have been shown to increase blood pressure and heart rate without altering baroreceptor sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spectral analysis of the heart rate can often be used as a surrogate for measuring sympathovagal balance. Stimulation of the area of the right posterior insular area increases sympathetic tone in the absence of heart rate, blood pressure or respiration changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, in a study by Li et al, it was determined that SVTs were more frequently encountered after right insular infarction compared with strokes in other locations. Additionally, higher serum noradrenaline levels, longer QTc prolongation and more cardiac arrhythmias were observed after a right hemisphere infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It is proposed that the sympathetic overactivity and the catecholamine surge following a stroke in the right insular cortex increases myocardial oxygen demand, limiting coronary perfusion. This results in a calcium overload in the ventricular myocytes. This cascade of events is considered pro-arrhythmogenic and can trigger ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Furthermore, in the absence of coronary artery disease, this sympathetic hyperactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> together with reduced cardiac parasympathetic innervation and baroreceptor function prolongs the repolarization duration and accounts for ventricular repolarization changes and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Continuous activation of β1 adrenergic receptors leads to opening of the calcium channels which induces the stimulation of the actin-myosin complex and causes cardiac muscle contraction with an inability to relax, consequently leading to metabolic imbalance and cell death. When this area of myocyte cell death involves the cardiac conducting system, it frequently presents as QTc prolongation and tachyarrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The association between tachycardia and cardiomyopathy has been known for some time. Virtually every form of SVT including ectopic atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia and atrial fibrillation has been associated with reversible cardiomyopathy. Very frequent ventricular ectopic beats like premature ventricular contractions have also been associated with cardiomyopathy. Chronic tachycardia produces significant cardiac structural changes, including left ventricular dilatation and cellular morphological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with the described variability in autonomic function. Following his stroke, the patient was found to have heart rate lability. After a period of time, this continuous onslaught of tachycardia and ventricular ectopy lead to left ventricular dilatation and a reduction in systolic function.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Cardiac death is the second most common cause of death following an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event. This is especially true when there is an ischemic stroke involving the right MCA. Lesions to the right insular cortex lead to a surge of catecholamines leading to heart rate variability and a multitude of tachyarrhythmias. Untreated, the tachycardia will lead to cardiac structural changes and left ventricular dilatation causing a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. This case highlights the importance of monitoring for and treating tachyarrhythmias in stroke patients especially in the territory of the right MCA. When deemed necessary, these patients would benefit from strict rate control, thus preventing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\n【16】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【17】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the writing of this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Therefore, RT is not recommended as a standard treatment, except for in a palliative setting, including for localized metastases or uncontrolled bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Radiation gives rise to denudation of the surface of blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and capillary necrosis as the result of acute damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Favorable results of prolonging the survival time in BTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and the reported efficacy for TAB in other cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> suggest the hemostatic effect of RT in BTC; however, we found no reports describing the efficacy and safety of TAB from BTC in detail.\n\n【16】The effect of palliative RT on bleeding from gastric cancer has received more attention than that on bleeding from BTC. Small retrospective studies have shown a treatment success rate of 54-91% and a median duration of response ranging from 1.5 to 11.4 months with dose fractionation regimens of 6 - 60 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Grade 3 - 4 acute toxicities occurred in up to 15% of patients treated with RT alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, hemostatic RT for gastric cancer is suggested not only to be an effective and safe treatment option but to improve the patient’s quality of life, although the optimum dose fractionation regimen is unclear.\n\n【17】In our cases, treatment success was achieved in both patients, and they were able to spend their remaining life at home with no restriction on their oral intake. Furthermore, no adverse events were seen in any of the two patients after palliative RT. Therefore, palliative RT for TAB from BTC with 30 Gy in 10 - 12 fractions is expected to be an effective and safe treatment modality.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Palliative RT for TAB from BTC is suggested not only to be an effective and safe treatment option, but to improve the patient’s quality of life. The further accumulation of cases will be required in order to confirm the usefulness of hemostatic RT for BTC.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No competing financial interests exist.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Listeriosis can be clinically divided into noninvasive and invasive forms. Invasive listeriosis usually develops in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, while noninvasive listeriosis is either asymptomatic or presents as acute self-limited febrile gastroenteritis in immunocompromised hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Invasive listeriosis has a wide clinical spectrum. It exhibits central nervous system (CNS)-specific tropism and is associated with high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Meningitis is the most common symptom of CNS listeriosis, while brain abscess is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Most cases of Listeria brain abscess occur in patients with underlying hematological malignancies or in those receiving solid organ transplants \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. To date, only 70 cases of Listeria brain abscess have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】To the best of our knowledge, Listeria brain abscess in patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis has not been previously reported. Here, we report a case of Listeria brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus in a 61-year-old man with crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital because of intermittent fever, shaking chills, and progressive lethargy since the past 4 days. He had developed bloody stools 4 days before admission owing to consumption of a substantial amount of refrigerated foods several days before disease onset. Two years ago, he had biopsy-proven crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease stage V, requiring hemodialysis. The patient discontinued dialysis after 8 months because his renal function improved with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and maintenance therapy with 20 mg prednisolone/day. Approximately 12 h after arrival, the patient developed shaking chills and high fever (38.7 °C) again. Two sets of blood samples were collected. Initial physical examination was noncontributory. His initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,400/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 93%; lymphocytes, 4%; and monocytes, 3%), low hemoglobin level (8.7 g/dL), and impaired renal function (blood urea nitrogen, 147 mg/dL and creatinine, 5.0 mg/dL). His chest radiograph was unremarkable. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed superficial gastritis with no signs of recent bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy up to 15 cm was normal. The fever subsided after the administration of an antipyretic, and the patient was referred to the Gastroenterology clinic from the emergency department on the same day.\n\n【6】Three days later, he was re-admitted to the emergency department because of fever (38.3 °C), chills, and lethargy. Because L. monocytogenes was isolated from the 2 sets of blood cultures collected during his first visit, ampicillin with renal dose adjustment (2 g every 12 h) plus gentamicin (60 mg every 24 h) were administered parenterally, and the patient was then admitted to the medical ward.\n\n【7】On arrival, his blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature were 183/90 mmHg, 100 beats/min, 20 breaths/min, and 37.8 °C, respectively. His conjunctivae were pale with anicteric sclera. His neck was supple without jugular venous engorgement, bruits, or lymphadenopathy. He had a regular heart rate without murmur. Lung auscultation revealed no wheezing or rales. His abdomen was soft with normal active bowel sounds, while the liver and spleen were not palpable. On neurological examination, he was alert and well oriented. His higher cortical function and cranial nerve and motor system examination were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were equal and plantar reflexes were flexor. Sensory examination and coordination were normal as well.\n\n【8】The next morning, however, our patient went into a coma. Brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe, a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of the occipital horns . Brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus was highly suspected. Urgent external ventricular drainage was recommended by emergent neurosurgery consultation, owing to a rapid decline in the patient’s mental status. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was found to be slightly turbid in appearance and under high pressure during surgery. Ventricular CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis (WBC count, 115 cells/mL) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 78%; lymphocytes, 22%) and red blood cells (622 cells/mL). The CSF protein concentration was elevated (321 mg/dL; reference range 10 - 45 mg/dL), and the CSF glucose concentration was 55 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose level was 204 mg/dL). CSF gram staining and cultures were negative. On day 3 after admission, our patient’s blood pressure dropped and despite management, his condition continued to deteriorate and he eventually died on day 4.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Axial non-contrast brain computed tomography scan of our patient revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe (black arrow), a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of occipital horns . |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】In retrospect, long-term steroid use in our patient suppressed his cell-mediated immunity and increased his susceptibility to listeriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our patient, the steroids may have masked the symptoms and signs of Listeria , delaying its diagnosis.\n\n【12】L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod that has been recognized as an emerging foodborne pathogen since the 1980s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Its main mode of transmission is contaminated food. After entering the host via the gastrointestinal tract, L. monocytogenes can survive and spread intracellularly without extracellular exposure to humoral immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, cell-mediated immunity is the host’s primary defense mechanism against L. monocytogenes infection.\n\n【13】Invasive listeriosis most frequently presents as primary bacteremia, CNS infections, maternal-fetal/neonatal infections, or localized infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Meningitis is the most common form of CNS listeriosis, while rhombencephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> and brain abscess are rarely detected.\n\n【14】Brain abscess occurs in approximately 10% cases of CNS listeriosis \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Most cases of Listeria brain abscess occur in patients with underlying hematological malignancies or in those receiving solid organ transplants \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Listeria brain abscesses are usually single and located in the frontal and/or parietal lobe. Involvement of the subcortical gray matter has been observed in one-fifth of the affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Listeria brain abscess is associated with positive blood culture in 85% patients and concomitant meningitis in nearly 25% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The high rate of positive blood culture suggests that the pathogenesis of Listeria brain abscess is secondary to spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Axial non-contrast brain CT of our patient revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe, a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of the occipital horns . The most likely differential diagnoses could be brain abscess with intraventricular rupture, primary or metastatic tumor with subacute or old hemorrhage, and resolving hematoma. Although brain contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive in lesion differentiation, this modality could not be applied to our patient because of his rapid clinical deterioration and severe renal dysfunction. However, the differential diagnoses could be narrowed down based on the clinical course, positive blood cultures, ventricular CSF study, and location of the lesion, making Listeria brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus the most likely diagnosis. Even though gram staining of the CSF and CSF bacterial culture were negative in our patient, Al-Khatti et al diagnosis of Listeria brain abscess, presenting with frontal hypodensity on the initial brain CT scan, in which the pathogen was isolated only from the blood cultures drawn at the time of admission, supports our diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Our patient acquired L. monocytogenes probably by consumption of refrigerated foods several days before disease onset, and developed bloody stool. Although diarrhea associated with Listeria gastroenteritis is usually non-bloody, bloody diarrhea has been reported in 3% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Listeria gastroenteritis is self-limiting in most cases; however, invasive listeriosis can occur if bacteremia presents. The factors determining the transformation of self-limiting listeriosis to the fatal invasive form include virulence factors produced by the pathogen, number of pathogens ingested, and host immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The incidence of listeriosis in Taiwan remains unknown. Recently, 2 retrospective single-center studies in Taiwan reported that the incidence of listeriosis has increased from 2005 to 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Although the main reason for this increase remains unclear, most affected patients had predisposing factors that lowered their immunity, such as malignancy, renal failure, and type II diabetes mellitus.\n\n【18】The treatment choice for Listeria brain abscess is high-dose ampicillin (2 g every 4 h) for at least 6 - 8 weeks and serial monitoring by MRI or CT \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Gentamicin was administered in our case for its synergic effect. For patients allergic to penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice. Third-generation cephalosporins are ineffective against L. monocytogenes. Surgical drainage had been indicated if the abscess is > 2.5 cm or is located in the deep brain matter, and it can facilitate correct identification of the infectious pathogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although ventricular drainage with intravenous and/or intrathecal antibiotics are recommended in ruptured brain abscess with hydrocephalus and ventriculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, no definitive therapeutic regimens for intraventricular rupture of Listeria brain abscess have been reported in the literature.\n\n【19】In conclusion, Listeria brain abscess in patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis is uncommon, and long-term steroid treatment in such patients may increase the risk of opportunistic infections. The prognosis of Listeria brain abscess is poor with intraventricular rupture. Early diagnosis in patients undergoing long-term immunosuppression therapy is challenging. Thus, clinicians should consider the possibility of CNS listeriosis in patients presenting with rapidly progressing CNS manifestations that appear after acute gastrointestinal illness, and should provide adequate antibiotic therapy.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declaration</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It has been prescribed mainly in Japan and other Asian countries since 1959. As it acts on the central nervous system, overdose can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms; however, there have been few reports of tipepidine intoxication, including six cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> in children and no cases in adults. We report a case of an elderly woman who presented with acute confusional state and choreiform movements of the lower extremities due to tipepidine hibenzate intoxication. Over-ingestion of thick precipitate of suspended tipepidine syrup possibly caused acute intoxication in this case.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 75-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for altered mental status, dysarthria, and choreiform movements of the lower extremities. On arrival, systolic blood pressure was 134 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure was 72 mmHg, heart rate was 107 beats per minute, and body temperature was 35.9 °C. The pupils were equal and not dilated. Meningeal sign was not observed. Laboratory results demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count (white blood cell count 7,920/µL, red blood cell count 416 х 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, and platelet count 26.8 х 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL), and blood glucose was 106 mg/dL. Analysis of arterial blood gas was also normal (pH 7.480, PCO <sub>2 </sub> 40.1 Torr, PO <sub>2 </sub> 80.6 Torr, HCO <sup>3- </sup> 29.6 mmol/L, and base excess 5.6 mmol/L). Other laboratory tests, including hepatic and renal function tests and serum electrolytes, were within normal limits. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was also normal.\n\n【4】She had a history of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue malignant lymphoma of the lung, which developed at age 67. It was in complete remission, but was complicated by chronic cough from radiation pneumonitis. She had been prescribed syrup with 83 mg/day of tipepidine hibenzate 6 days prior to admission. Prescription dosage was within the recommended adult dosage of 60 - 120 mg/day. Detailed history from her family revealed that she might have been taking this medicine more than twice the indicated dosage, accumulated in the lower part of the bottle.\n\n【5】As her confusional state and involuntary movements of lower extremities continued, 10 mg of benzodiazepine was administered intramusculary. After 12 h of intravenous fluid administration, her mental status recovered to being alert and the involuntary movements disappeared, but she developed retrograde amnesia. Serum tipepidine hibenzate level on admission was 940.9 ng/mL, which was about 25 times the maximum concentration after 40 mg of tipepidine hibenzate ingestion. It decreased to 36.4 ng/mL after 36 h.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Determining the cause of altered mental status is often challenging. Drug intoxication is one important cause that must be considered.\n\n【8】While dependence and abuse of centrally acting antitussive agents has been well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the acute adverse neurological effects of these medications, including tipepidine hibenzate, remain relatively unknown. Imai et al summarized six pediatric cases of acute tipepidine hibenzate intoxication, all of which presented with delirium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In adults, Cuomo reported a 21-year-old woman who developed convulsions after a therapeutic dose of tipepidine ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. To date, however, no cases of acute intoxication in adults have been reported.\n\n【9】Tipepidine hibenzate suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla, but the mechanism of its neurological side effects is unclear. It has been suggested that tipepidine inhibits the G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. GIRK channels hyperpolarize neurons in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors and play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Increased neuronal excitability by GIRK channel inhibition has been speculated to be one of the causes of convulsions and other neurological side effects in overdose of antidepressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the present case, tipepidine might have caused the acute confusional state and involuntary movements via inhibition of GIRK channels, leading to increased excitability of the central nervous system.\n\n【10】The serum tipepidine hibenzate level on admission was markedly elevated. Tipepidine is metabolized mainly by the liver, but this patient’s hepatic and renal functions were both normal. In general, it is easier to lose track of the dosage of syrup than tablets. Although it is likely that this patient took about twice the indicated dose, this still does not explain the severely elevated serum tipepidine concentration. Tipepidine hibenzate was prescribed in the form of suspended syrup. As tipepidine syrup is suspended in solution, sediment could have formed at the bottom of the bottle. Tipepidine syrup has been reported to form sediment easily when mixed with other drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but this may also occur with tipepidine syrup alone. Ingestion of excessive amounts of thickened syrup with sediment might explain why this patient became acutely intoxicated.\n\n【11】In conclusion, tipepidine hibenzate, a commonly prescribed antitussive drug in Asia, can cause acute intoxication accompanied by neurological symptoms not only in children but also in adults. When prescribing the suspended syrup form of drug, it is important to educate the patient not to ingest excess amounts or take sediments of the syrup, by agitating the bottle before ingestion.\n\n【12】Disclosure\n\n【13】The authors affirm that there are no potential conflicts (financial, professional, or personal) and that no company has provided any financial arrangement for this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the organs with a high quantity of virus targeted receptor protein: angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which includes the lungs, heart, kidney, and small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations include mild symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath and cough to severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, widespread thrombosis, renal failure, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Current treatment modalities for moderate and severe for COVID-19 include antiviral agents, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and supportive management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Recently mAbs have emerged as a beneficial tool for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 based on their specificity, ability to prevent disease progression and reduction of disease period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It follows the hypothesis that passive immunotherapy might be useful for the management of COVID-19 since patients who develop antibodies soon after disease occurrence have better prognosis than those with delayed antibody response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The mAbs are derived from the B cells. These antibodies neutralize the virus by binding to the spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 and block the entry of the virus into the host cells thereby reducing the viral load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of mAbs for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease within 10 days of symptom onset including bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, bebtelovimab and sotrovimab; however, the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab against Omicron variant was later revised in January 2022 due to lack of efficacy against the variant. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2) binds to the epitopes of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 and blocks the virus binding to the human receptors causing decrease in the viral load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Bamlanivimab-etesevimab also has a similar mechanism of action and can be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and high risk of progression to severe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Clinical trials for the efficacy, rate of hospitalization and mortality benefits of mAbs for COVID-19 are currently underway for patients with early disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, limited benefit has been observed in patients with severe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】A study conducted by Bariola et al showed that 15 out of 232 propensity matched patients were hospitalized after treatment with bamlanivimab and only four of these patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. This study emphasized that bamlanivimab therapy reduced the hospitalization and mortality in patients more than 65 years of age with COVID-19. Another study conducted by Gupta et al showed that only three out of 291 patients with COVID-19 treated with sotrovimab had disease progression leading to hospitalization and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The emergence of viral variants, however, is an issue of concern since it may undermine the clinical effectiveness of current mAbs therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Omicron (B1.1.529) is a new variant with missense substitutions in the spike protein receptor domain that might not be neutralized by casirivimab and imdevimab as per unpublished in vitro studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. If this hypothesis proves true, then it will significantly compromise the efficacy of mAbs against the Omicron variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines also recommend against the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab for Omicron variant and as such have revoked the EUA of these mAbs due to lack of efficacy against the Omicron variant as of January 2022 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】We compiled the data of 125 patients with mild and moderate symptoms of COVID-19 who received mAbs over the course of 2 months from October 2021 to December 2021. Twelve patients out of 125 received sotrovimab whereas 55 received casirivimab/imdevimab and 58 received bamlanivimab/etesevimab. Most of the patients were Hispanic. Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. Majority of the patients were male. We report three cases of hospitalization out of these 125 patients post mAbs treatment. One patient received bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1,400 mg transfusion whereas the remaining two received casirivimab-imdevimab 1,200 mg mAb treatment. Out of the three, one patient who received casirivimab-imdevimab, passed away due to progression of disease. It is to be noted that the patient had multiple comorbidities which might be a cofounder to the efficacy of mAbs. All patients were above 54 years of age. Two patients were hospitalized within a week of mAb administration whereas one patient was hospitalized after 2 weeks for worsening clinical symptoms. Only one patient was upgraded to the ICU due to progression of the disease. All the patients were given prophylactic anticoagulation whereas, only two patients received remdesivir and dexamethasone. One patient had no significant PMH except obesity whereas the other two had multiple comorbidities. All of the patients showed progression of disease on imaging; however, the only patient with unfavorable outcome had significant co-morbidities which might have played a role in the severity of his symptoms. A study conducted by Lovett et al demonstrated that out of 270 patients treated with bamlanivimab only five patients (1.9%) required hospitalization and the risk of hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb treated patients as compared to untreated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. These cases coincide with the beginning of the spread of the Omicron variant and even though the viral genome was not sequenced due to the paucity of funds in the community hospital, the timing of the cases suggest infection with the Omicron variant and the therapeutic failure of the mAbs might be due to the reduced activity of mAbs against the newer variant. It is to be noted that mAbs are susceptible to mutations and not useful for permanent intervention.\n\n【42】Future prospective studies are required to explore medical conditions and viral variants that may benefit from mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19. Outpatient strategies to decrease the rate of hospitalization and death are imperative to reduce the disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 and as such also supports the investment of funds for the development of infusion infrastructure.\n\n【43】Learning points\n\n【44】The use of neutralizing antibodies has a potential utility as a treatment option for COVID-19 and clinical trials are underway to determine the optimum strategic use. The emergence of viral variants is a limiting factor for the treatment with mAbs and should be kept in consideration while using the mAbs.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consents were obtained from the patients for publication of the case report.</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RA, AP, MW, and KT contributed to diagnosis and management of the patient, discussion, writing and drafting of the case, final approval of the case reports.

When polyarthritis is also present, this represents a rare disease known as pancreatitis panniculitis polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome. Due to the absence of abdominal symptoms in most cases of PPP syndrome, a delay in diagnosis is not unusual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Alcoholism is one of the most common causes of chronic pancreatitis, and alcoholics often present with gouty arthritis. PPP syndrome in these patients may therefore be misdiagnosed. We report a case of arthritis being initially treated as gouty arthritis before the correct diagnosis of PPP syndrome was established.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 49-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse for at least 20 years, chronic pancreatitis with many acute episodes over 5 years, and gouty arthritis, presented with pain, swelling, and erythema involving the right thumb, right 4th metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and left heel  for 1 week.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Swelling and erythema of the left heel with pus formation. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were administered initially for presumed gouty arthritis; unfortunately, the symptoms progressed. The right knee, right heel, and left 3rd and 5th MTP joints became painful, swollen, and erythematous. The right knee joint was aspirated, and examination of the synovial fluid was positive for monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were continued; however, purulent fluid developed over the right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel, and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Aspiration was performed from left heel, followed by administration of oxacillin 2,000 mg IV every 6 hours. The fluid culture grew Escherichia coli , so the antibiotics were changed to gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and cefazolin 1 g IV every 8 hours; methylprednisolone was tapered to 40 mg IV once a day. However, the patient developed a fever, and purulent fluid continued to accumulate in bilateral knees, right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Arthrocentesis was again performed from right knee, and synovial fluid examination this time failed to show MSU or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The synovial fluid culture was negative. Due to an elevated white blood cell count (WBC 22,500/µL) with a left shift (neutrophils 90.1%) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 15.4 mg/dL, cefazolin was changed to ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g IV every 6 hours. Methylprednisolone was tapered and switched to oral prednisolone 5 mg twice a day. Gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day were continued. Fever persisted, and new erythematous nodules formed on the thighs and upper arms bilaterally . A skin biopsy was then performed. While awaiting the pathology report, the antibiotics were changed to cefpirome, and prednisolone and colchicine were continued. The right thumb required debridement due to the persistence of purulent fluid, and vancomycin was prescribed. The skin biopsy pathology report showed fat necrosis as well as ghost cells, which suggested pancreatic panniculitis.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Erythematous nodules over the posterior thighs bilaterally. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】After the pathology report, serum amylase and lipase levels were 4,840 U/L and 7,200 U/L, respectively. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan identified edema involving the pancreas with peripancreatic fat infiltrations. Interestingly, the patient denied abdominal pain throughout the entire hospitalization. The amylase and lipase continued to increase (7,520 U/L and 12,200 U/L, respectively). A third arthrocentesis was performed on the right knee. Synovial fluid showed amylase 1,970 U/L, lipase 1,260 U/L, cholesterol 79 mg/dL, and triglycerides 78 mg/dL. A Sudan stain performed on aspirate from the left heel lesion was negative. All antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient received nothing by mouth for 48 hours. He was then started on a low-fat diet; however, the serum amylase and lipase remained significantly elevated (13,180 U/L and 21,900 U/L, respectively). The erythematous nodules over the thighs and upper arms subsided gradually, and the purulent fluid accumulated over the dorsum of the feet also decreased. The patient was discharged on December 21, 2009.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Many cases of PPP syndrome have been reported. Although there are some patients with panniculitis and elevated serum lipase levels without pancreatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, most patients with PPP syndrome have acute or chronic pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and some have pancreatic tumors or ischemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The patient discussed in the case report had a history of chronic pancreatitis with many acute flare-ups over a 5-year period.\n\n【10】The typical patient with PPP syndrome is a middle-aged male with heavy alcohol use. Approximately two-thirds of patients present either without abdominal symptoms or with only mild symptoms, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our 49-year-old male patient with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol use matches the aforementioned criteria for PPP syndrome. The lack of abdominal symptoms combined with his history of gouty arthritis and presence of MSU crystals in his right knee synovial fluid led to an initial diagnosis of gouty arthritis. Without the presence of erythematous nodules in the first few days after admission, pancreatic polyarthritis was not included in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【11】A symmetric or an asymmetric polyarthritis that includes both the small and large joints is typical for PPP syndrome; however, a few cases of oligoarthritis or monoarthritis have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Although there is no case report of coexisting gouty arthritis, septic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis with PPP syndrome, these diseases should all be considered in the differential diagnosis because their initial presentations may be similar.\n\n【12】Elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes can induce fat necrosis in the joint and adjacent periarticular tissues and lead to arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Thick creamy synovial fluid with a high viscosity is typical for PPP syndrome . Microscopic examination can reveal birefringent crystal-like structures, which are due to the presence of lipid crystals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We identified elevated pancreatic enzyme levels in synovial fluid aspirated from the knee joint and checked the cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well. However, the Sudan stain of the aspirate was negative, and microscopic examination failed to reveal evidence of lipid crystals.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Right knee synovial fluid. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】The serum pancreatic enzyme level does not always correlate with the severity of the arthritis, but it does correlate with the progression of the fat necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, in our case, the serum amylase and lipase levels increased gradually after PPP syndrome was diagnosed, and the arthritis and erythematous nodules slowly improved. Based on this case, amylase and lipase may not be suitable markers for the progression or improvement of PPP syndrome.\n\n【15】There is currently no case report with PPP syndrome coexistent with gouty arthritis, in both multiple joint involved, and we reported the case to illustrate the difficulty associated with establishing the correct diagnosis prior to the appearance of erythematous nodules.

Even if joint fluid occurs in rheumatoid arthrosis (RA) patients after TKA, we have to distinguish other causes, such as infection, excluding an increase in RA activity. Because there have been only a few systematic reports of joint fluid after TKA in RA patients, the causes and frequency have not been clearly established.\n\n【2】We herein describe four cases of joint fluid after TKA in RA patients, and review the literature.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A total of 34 consecutive patients (50 knees) with RA receiving TKA who visited a regional center hospital in Akita, Japan between April 2002 and March 2012 were investigated in this study. There were four males and 30 females, with a mean age at the time of surgery of 67.3 years (47 - 80 years). The mean postoperative observation period was 6.6 years (3 - 12 years).\n\n【5】In these patients, there were four patients (four knees) with knee joint fluid more than 1 year after surgery. The ages of the four patients at the time of joint fluid ranged from 52 to 74 years, with a mean of 67.3 years, and all patients were female. The period up to joint fluid onset after surgery ranged from 14 to 63 months, with a mean of 39.5 months.\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】A 74-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with joint fluid of the left knee with a year and 4-month history. She had been treated for RA in another hospital for 34 years, and had received left TKA surgery in our hospital 2 years and 6 months ago. She had been prescribed methotrexate (MTX) for RA treatment. Although her left knee showed joint fluid, redness and heart sensation were not present. On laboratory examinations, C-reactive protein (CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) of the plasma were high (CRP: 10.4 mg/dL, MMP-3: 265 ng/mL). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed the accumulation of joint fluid and a contrasted, thickened synovium . Because bacteria were not detected in the joint fluid, we thought that reservoir of joint fluid was caused by increasing RA activity, and prescribed etanercept.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the left knee joint at the initial visit (axial section). CT showed the accumulation of joint fluid and a contrasted, thickened synovium. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Although inflammation decreased, it exacerbated again 1 year and 2 months after the initial visit, and we prescribed tocilizumab. Although inflammation was again decreased (CRP: 0.1 mg/dL, MMP-3: 220 ng/mL), joint fluid of the left knee was continuously present. In addition, erosion around the tibial implant was seen on plain radiographs . We performed arthroscopic synovectomy of the left knee 1 year and 4 months after the initial visit. White and red synovial tissue filled the joint . Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of RA, and fibrin deposits, a synovium with degenerative necrosis, hyperplastic capillaries, and lymphocyte infiltration were observed. There was no evidence of bacteria . At 3 months postoperatively, inflammation was decreased (CRP: 0.0 mg/dL, MMP-3: 144 ng/mL), and erosion around the tibial implant disappeared on plain radiographs . Joint fluid then disappeared, and she did not have any joint fluid in the left knee at the most recent follow-up at 3 years postoperatively.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

She had been treated for RA for 9 years. She had been prescribed MTX and etanercept for RA treatment. Although her right knee showed joint fluid, redness and a local heart were not shown. Laboratory examinations showed marked inflammation (CRP: 3.1 mg/dL, MMP-3: 332 ng/mL), but bacteria were not detected in the joint fluid. Enhanced CT showed the accumulation of joint fluid and a contrasted, thickened synovium. We adjusted the medication, and inflammation decreased. Although joint fluid accumulation did not improve, we observed her because she reported the absence of pain.\n\n【15】She complained of pain and a local heat of the right knee 2 years and 6 months after the initial visit. Although inflammatory reaction increased again (CRP: 5.4 mg/dL, MMP-3: 283 ng/mL), bacteria were again not detected in the joint fluid. We performed arthroscopic synovectomy of the right knee 2 years and 9 months after the initial visit. White synovial tissue mainly filled the joint. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of RA, and there was no evidence of bacteria. At 2 months postoperatively, inflammation was decreased (CRP: 0.0 mg/dL, MMP-3: 90.6 ng/mL), and joint fluid disappeared. She did not show any joint fluid accumulation at the most recent follow-up of 2 years postoperatively.\n\n【16】Case 3\n\n【17】A 69-year-old woman presented with joint fluid of the left knee 4 years and 2 months after right TKA. She had been treated for RA for 14 years. She had been prescribed MTX, steroid, and etanercept for RA treatment. Although she had pain of the left knee, redness and a local heart were not shown. Laboratory examinations showed marked inflammation (CRP: 12.5 mg/dL, MMP-3: 231.9 ng/mL), but bacteria were not detected in the joint fluid. We increased the amount of etanercept, and inflammation was decreased (CRP: 0.7 mg/dL, MMP-3: 141.9 ng/mL) only 2 months after the initial visit. Joint fluid and pain disappeared, and she did not show any joint fluid accumulation at the most recent follow-up at 1 year and 4 months after the initial visit.\n\n【18】Case 4\n\n【19】A 52-year-old woman presented with joint fluid of the right knee 2 years and 3 months after right TKA. She had been treated for RA for 3 years. She had been prescribed MTX, steroid, tacrolimus, and tocilizumab for RA treatment. Although she had mild pain of the right knee, redness and a local heart were not shown. Laboratory examinations showed no inflammation (CRP: 0.0 mg/dL, MMP-3: 40.3 ng/mL), and bacteria were not detected in the joint fluid. Because of only mild pain of the right knee and the absence of inflammation, we observed her and continued the administration of medicine until the most recent follow-up at 2 years after the initial visit.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】Although both the amount of joint fluid and protein in the fluid increase due to surgical invasion until 3 months after TKA, these decrease gradually 3 months later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. So, we can consider that there are causes other than surgical invasion if joint fluid occurs at 3 months or more after surgery. As causes of joint fluid after TKA, we can classify them into five different groups: deep infection (DI), temporarily increased activity of RA (IRA), wear particle-induced synovitis (PS), metal sensitivity to implant metals (MS), and nonspecific synovitis (NS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>. Because DI, PS, and MS can not be treated conservatively, it is important to clarify their causes. Although we may easily consider IRA as the cause of joint fluid in RA patients, joint disorder may deteriorate when we use some RA medicines for DI patients. Although there is a report of a differential test using fluorescence-activated cell sorter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, various examination results, such as a bacterial culture test, detection of wear debris, and the RA activity index, are needed for a confident diagnosis. Although a bacterial culture test for joint fluid is important, DI can not be completely ruled out even if bacteria are not detected by this examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. If the cause is not clear, it is possible to diagnose more accurately by ablating the synovium as in the present cases.\n\n【22】If the cause of joint fluid is IRA, it is important to treat it using medicines for RA, such as biologics, to control RA activity. In the present case 3, joint fluid decreased only on treatment with drugs. Although pathological examination and a bacterial culture test of the synovium are needed to fully rule out infection, actually, we often initially start medical treatment to control RA activity if we consider IRA based on some examinations, even if we do not carry out synovium examinations. However, when it is difficult to decrease joint fluid, we should conduct synovectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the present cases, surgical treatment by arthroscopy brought about favorable results, and this can be expected to facilitate a reliable diagnosis and marked therapeutic effect.\n\n【23】Niki et al reported that the incidence of joint fluid after TKA was less than 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In their data, the incidence was high (8%), although the study involved a small number of cases. In RA patients only, the incidence of joint fluid after TKA may have been high because of IRA. In addition, they investigated joint fluid in patients after TKA whose original diagnosis was osteoarthritis (OA) or RA, and the most frequent cause of post TKA effusion was IRA in RA, and NS in OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although the cause of joint fluid in patients was mostly IRA in the present cases, we need to perform further studies with a larger number of cases.\n\n【24】In conclusion, we present four cases of joint fluid after TKA in RA patients showing some courses on synovectomy or prescribing RA medicines. When a definitive diagnosis or treatment of joint fluid is difficult, synovectomy by arthroscopy may be effective both for the diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We do not have any conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The present report describes a case of a tooth displaced into the ITF, its diagnostic imaging and immediate surgical management.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A healthy 34-year-old man was referred for consultation from a community dental clinic, one hour after an attempt to extract the third molar of the left maxilla, however the tooth \"disappeared\". Panoramic radiograph  demonstrated that the tooth is displaced superiorly toward the maxillary sinus. Axial computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the tooth is located in the ITF between the maxillary sinus and the zygomatic arch . Alternatives of treatment, either surgical or conservative were discussed with the patient, who prefered to go ahead with the surgical. Then, under local anesthesia, via the extended intraoral incision, the tooth was retrieved through the incision and the displacement tract, using a curved hemostate. Within two weeks postsurgically, the patient was fully recovered, without any adverse sequelae.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative panoramic radiograph.

Once it is suspected, the exact anatomic location is very important to be determined radiographically. The maxillary third molars may displace either palatally, into the antrum or buccaly into the ITF.\n\n【9】For the radiographic work-up, panoramic, occlusal, occipitomental radiographs can be used. However, CT-scan is the most useful technique, as it provides 3-D anatomical localization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.

A polyomavirus was identified as the etiological agent in 1967, named in 1971 as JC Virus (JCV), after the initials of the patient where the virus was first isolated (John Cunningham) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. It occurs in immunocompromised patients, nowadays mainly in HIV infected ones. HIV infection accounts for 85% of all cases of PML, with a prevalence estimated of 4-5% in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. The probability of an HIV patient developing neurological symptoms and PML lesions is higher amongst the ones with a lower immunological status, expressed by a CD4 T cell count lower than 200/mm <sup>3 </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. There are very few reports of PML among HIV infected patients with a better immunological condition, with more than 500 CD4/mm <sup>3 </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The diagnosis may be presumptive with the combination of neurological symptoms (visual disturbance, cognitive and behavioural alterations, seizures, and motor disorders with paralysis or akinesia) and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Positive JCV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue specific anomalies, in association with clinical features and MRI findings, confirm PML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients with suspicion of having PML should undergo a lumbar puncture with JCV search by means of PCR. Some authors discourage the search for JCV in CSF of HIV patients with normal CD4 T cell counts, due to the low sensitivity of the exam in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Diagnostic sensitivity on detection of JCV DNA in CSF by PCR in patients with PML not treated with antiretroviral therapy is of 72-92% and specificity of 92-100%, but the likelihood of detecting JCV in CSF in patients undergoing combined antiretroviral therapy (cARV) is lower (58%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We describe a clinical case of an HIV infected woman under cARV with a high CD4 T cell count that developed neurological symptoms and characteristic PML brain lesions, with JCV becoming positive in CSF only at the 5th determination. Differential diagnosis and therapy is also discussed, as well as the difficulty of making a definite diagnosis of PML among patients under cARV and high CD4 T cell count.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 48-year-old heterosexual woman was diagnosed with HIV1 infection in October 1998, when she was found to have oral candidiasis. She started on zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz in November 2004. Since then, she had undetectable viraemia and progressive immunological recovery (stage B1-CDC).\n\n【6】In January 2009, she presented a two-month history of insidious progressive gait instability with tandem gait and gait ataxia with no motor, sensitivity or cognitive impairment. Her viral load was undetectable (< 40 copies/ml) and her CD4 T cell count was of 533/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Her physical exam was almost normal, only showing a slightly wide base gait. A cerebral CT scan was done being described as normal. Neurological symptoms progressed and, two months later, she had slurred speech, bilateral limb (more evident on the left side) and gait ataxia. No vertigo, diplopia, dysphagia, motor or sensitive symptoms were reported, besides a two weight loss and some nausea with occasional vomit. The clinical picture was compatible with a bilateral cerebellar syndrome. A cerebral MRI was done revealing a hyperintense sign in T2w and hypointensity in T1w, with discrete mass effect involving the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medium cerebellar pedunculus, white matter, right protuberance with extension to homolateral mesencephalic and periaqueductal regions, and left medium cerebellar pedunculus, found to be characteristic of PML . Lumbar puncture was done and CSF revealed normal glucose (0.62 g/L) and protein (0.22 g/L) levels, with 13 leucocytes (9 mononuclear). CSF was negative for JCV. The immunoglobulin G index was more than 1 (1.3) and one oligoclonal band was present.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Cerebral MRI showing T2w and T1w sequences (description within the text). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Her neurological state got worse. A severe gait ataxia with vomit, dizziness and frequent falls, and a speech disorder with dysarthria were documented. She had no visual complains. Due to her state, at the beginning of July 2009, she was admitted in hospital for further investigation. By that time she had 717 CD4/mm <sup>3 </sup> , undetectable serum HIV viral load and a CSF HIV RNA of 7119 copies/mL. The neurological exam revealed a left hemiparesis with face (grade 4-/4+ to superior/inferior limb respectively), with normal muscular strength on the right side. Left Babinski, exacerbated reflexes on the left side, and a diminished sensitivity on the left side (including face) were recorded. She was not able to walk without help. She had no fever and her vital signs were normal. Concerning the number of pills per day and due to nausea and vomit, AZT was suspended giving place to abacavir, maintaining lamivudine and efavirenz.\n\n【9】She had no evidence of infectious disease elsewhere and no signs of systemic infection were found. Thyroid, renal and hepatic profile was normal and there were no vitamin deficiencies. A lympho- or myeloproliferative disorder and an inflammatory or granulomatosis disease were also ruled out.\n\n【10】A cerebral MRI was repeated, revealing the same lesions, with the same characteristics, at the same locations. Lumbar puncture was repeated and CSF findings were similar: JCV was negative, as was the bacterial and virological study (PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CMV, enterovirus, herpes 6 virus, VZV and herpes simplex 1 and 2). As in the previous lumbar puncture, EBV was positive in the CSF.\n\n【11】In spite of a negative JCV determination and a high CD4 T cell count, PML was considered as the most probable diagnosis. Considering the ongoing cARV and the neurological worsening manifestations, cidofovir treatment was started in a bimonthly regular basis together with mirtazapine in a daily dose of 30 mg and physiotherapy. Considering lesion locations, brain biopsy was not an option.\n\n【12】Three months later the patient’s clinical state was better, walking with orthopaedic aid, feeling less dizzy, with a perfectly comprehensible speech, and a better humor. All JCV CSF determinations (4 in the total) continued negative.\n\n【13】Other demyelinating diseases were considered, namely acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (but CSF immunoglobulin studies were not diagnostic) and HIV-leukoencephalitis (but signs of dementia or behavioural disturbances were not noticed). Cidofovir treatment was sustained and a surveillance program with physiotherapy was proposed together with cARV.\n\n【14】In May 2010 she presented herself at the outpatient clinic on a wheelchair, not being able to walk, and dysarthric. Lesion progression was suspected. At this time she had 478 CD4 T cell/mm <sup>3 </sup> and a serum HIV load of 186 copies/mL. Antiretroviral therapy was changed once again to zidovudine, lamivudine, lopinavir and ritonavir, based on better lopinavir penetration in the blood-brain barrier. A cerebral MRI was ordered. While waiting, she was admitted in the hospital due to prostration and emetic activity. She was aphasic, not following orders. She had discrete facial left central paresis, left hemiparesis with crural involvement, and plegic at the level of the superior left limb, with generalized hyperreflexia. As suspected, cerebral MRI revealed lesions progression, with hyperintense sign in T2W and hypointense in T1w, with involvement of the white matter of the frontal, subcortical and profound lobes, without mass effect.\n\n【15】CSF analysis was similar with normal glucose (0.61 g/L) and protein (0.37 g/L) levels, with 11 leucocytes/uL and 8 mononuclear/uL. JCV PCR analysis of the CSF was finally positive and PML definitive diagnosis was done. The patient died in June 2010 due to neurological disorder attributed to PML progression.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】This case report shows how a definite PML diagnosis is rare and difficult to achieve in a patient with a high CD4 T cell count and under cARV. It is known that in HIV patients, PML often arises in severe immunocompromised states, when CD4 T cell count is lower than 200/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Nevertheless, cases have been described with CD4 T cell count higher than that value 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Yet, case reports of definite PML with more than 500/mm <sup>3 </sup> CD4 T cell count are quite rare. It is well known that JCV cannot infect T lymphocytes or bind to T cell membranes. It seems that JCV uses B lymphocytes as a ‘Trojan horse’ to reach the brain exceeding the blood-brain barrier, and it happens when the reactivation process starts, when an immunosuppression state is achieved, because it can induce the loss of specific immune cells that may allow the beginning of active replication and infection , as well as changes in JCV regulatory region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Nowadays, it is not known which ‘level’ of immunodepression is needed in an HIV patient for JCV to turn from a latent to a replicative state, or if there are some other means for JCV to reach the brain and infect oligodendrocytes rather than the ‘B lymphocyte way’.\n\n【19】The cARV was probably one of the causes for the consecutive negative results of JCV determination, as it is well known that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) lowers the sensitivity of JCV PCR in CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】JCV isolation was possible only at the fifth determination, when CD4 T cell count was slightly lower than500/mm <sup>3 </sup> and neurological deficits were severe. It is known that the profitability of JCV determination in CSF is higher with lower serum CD4 T cell count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and that sample collected in the early course of the disease with a negative result does not exclude the possibility of the presence of JCV in the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Sometimes in the course of the disease, PML diagnosis was questioned, mainly due to the relatively high CD4 T cell count and consecutive negative results for JCV, in spite of the initial findings in MRI. MRI is the best imaging tool to diagnose PML, with typical appearance in 90% of the patients, usually with patchy and commonly non-enhancing white matter lesions, usually bilateral and asymmetric, and with no mass effect. Yet, some demyelinating diseases may present almost with the same characteristics, but some of them with mass effect通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. HIV-leukoencephalitis is the main differential diagnosis, but it seems that lesions are less diffuse, more symmetric, not visible on T1w and less intense on T2w sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. There is also evidence of HIV active replication in brain in this last situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Our patient had, in fact, a higher HIV count in CSF than in serum, indicating an active replication in that reservoir, pending the balance to this last diagnosis. Yet, there were no signs of dementia or cognitive disturbance. It was the neurological evolution and the final isolation of JCV in CSF that changed to the definite diagnosis more than six months later.\n\n【22】One year and a half was the time that elapsed between the initial presentation of the symptoms and death. Neurological symptoms progressed in the beginning, then stabilized (and even got a little bit better in the summer 2009) and got worse once again. The patient was under antiretroviral therapy since the beginning, the only well demonstrated therapy to PML in HIV patients, in order to rise CD4 T cell count, to ameliorate the immunological status of the patient and diminish JCV replication and subsequently neurological manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 16 \\]</u>. Cidofovir is a deoxycytidine monophosphate analogue that inhibits viral DNA synthesis by interfering with viral DNA polymerase. There have been some positive reports concerning the use of cidofovir in HIV patients with PML in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, a recent paper concludes that cidofovir does not influence mortality or morbidity related to PML in HIV infected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Mirtazapine has been described in some reports as of value in the treatment of PML in HIV patients, inducing the down-regulation of 5HT2a receptors, which are used by JCV to enter glial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】It is not possible to say if the transitory recovery was due to cidofovir, mirtazapine or even physiotherapy, started at the same time. The only therapy that was maintained was HAART. AZT and abacavir have similar penetration on the CNS. Cidofovir was not repeated when definite PML diagnosis was done, due to the extension of the lesions and the presumed irreversibility of the neurological symptoms.\n\n【24】There is also some evidence that vital prognosis (lesion progression and death) and the speed of the onset correlate directly with JCV CSF count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 20 \\]</u>. Our patient had no JCV detected in the first determinations. It was when neurological symptoms aggravated that it turned positive. She died one month after evidence of JCV replication in CSF. Could the absence of JCV detection be a factor of ‘good prognosis’ related to a prolonged survival?\n\n【25】In conclusion, clinical symptoms and signs together with typical MRI findings among patients with high CD4 T cell count and under cARV should be considered and treated as PML. The progression of the disease may correlate with a higher replication of the JCV. Several lumbar punctures with JCV PCR in CSF should be done, but a negative result should not delay the start of antiretroviral treatment in those patients with CD4 T cell count above 500/mm <sup>3 </sup> .\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest to report.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Histological investigation showed EBV-positive DLBCL, and we administered ATG, cyclosporine and prednisolone, although not for transplantation. Primary pulmonary lymphoma of the lungs is a rare disorder; the incidence of primary pulmonary lymphoma is 0.3% of all primary lung neoplasms and less than 0.5% of all lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common type of primary pulmonary lymphoma, accounting for approximately 70%, is marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, but it is reported that most human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients have high-grade, EBV-positive DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with EBV-positive immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the lung may tend to have DLBCL. Moreover, iatrogenic lymphoproliferative disorder, except in the post-transplantation setting, is extremely rare. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature about immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative lung disorder in relation to EBV outside of a post-transplantation setting.\n\n【13】It is known that ATG use in a preparative regimen of bone marrow transplantation confers a high risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, especially EBV-related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This case was not a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, but ATG may have contributed to the development of the lymphoproliferative disorder because EBV proliferation was observed in this case.

The bleeding risk is significantly increased once the platelet nadir is < 100 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L as compared to a nadir of > 100 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (52% vs. 21%) and bleeding complications led to fatality in 23% of thrombocytopenic patients in the ICU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Common locations of bleeding include gastrointestinal, airways, cutaneous, puncture, and incision sights.

However, approximately one-half of thrombocytopenic ICU patients have sepsis as the primary cause and another one-third have infection as the primary cause. Additional causes to consider, in decreasing order of frequency, are liver disease, hypersplenism, disseminated intravascular coagulation or other hematologic disorder, massive transfusion, and medications. Chemotherapeutics, antibiotics, anti-platelet drugs, digoxin, haloperidol, and others have all been associated with thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We present the case of a patient who had the antibiotic vancomycin initiated due to concerns for sepsis and subsequently developed severe thrombocytopenia. Recognition of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia led to immediate recovery of platelet count and to the successful outcome of the patient. From this experience, we demonstrate that awareness of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent withdrawal can lead to rapid recovery of platelet count during the infectious work-up of an ICU patient; thus, vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia should be recognized early in the course of an infectious work-up in an ICU patient who subsequently develops severe thrombocytopenia.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 64-year-old female with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on nocturnal home oxygen therapy, hypertension, obesity, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic lower extremity edema presented to an outside emergency department with complaints of dyspnea on exertion of several days duration. Additionally, she reported upper respiratory tract symptoms of sore throat and cough. Her initial work-up revealed resting hypoxia with oxygen saturations between 85% and 89% with mild improvement after nebulizer therapy. She had no chest pain, a normal electrocardiogram, negative troponins, and a normal chest radiograph. She was treated with 750 mg intravenous levofloxacin and transferred to Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN.\n\n【6】On arrival to Mayo Clinic, she was able to communicate in full sentences with notable anxiety. Her initial exam revealed limited air movement with faint expiratory wheezes throughout. Admission labs demonstrated a white blood cell count of 5.5 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 76% neutrophils, platelet count of 284 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, arterial blood gas of pH 7.36, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 46, pO <sub>2 </sub> 166, and negative influenza swab. Given the initial presentation, she was treated for a COPD exacerbation with oral prednisone 60 mg, intravenous levofloxacin 750 mg, and scheduled bronchodilator nebulizer treatments.\n\n【7】On hospital day 3, she was ready for discharge. However, immediately prior to discharge, she acutely decompensated with increased work of breathing and tachypnea requiring increasing oxygen support. A chest radiograph demonstrated a questionable consolidation in the left lower lobe. She was given intravenous furosemide and transferred to the ICU for further management of her hypoxic respiratory failure. Upon arrival to the ICU, she was severely tachypneic with respiratory rates in the high 30s and anxious. She was placed on non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) for support. Initial laboratory work-up in the ICU at 15:13 demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, white blood cell count of 12.6 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, platelet count of 379 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and an arterial blood gas of pH 7.22, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 77, pO <sub>2 </sub> 223 after initiation non-invasive ventilation. Her antibiotics were broadened to include vancomycin and cefepime, stress dose steroids were administered, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to assess for possible pulmonary embolism.\n\n【8】After her return from the CT, she deteriorated further necessitating endotracheal intubation. An arterial line and central line were placed without incident. Her CT was reported as showing left lower lobe parenchymal changes consistent with an infectious bronchiolitis and a subsegmental pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobe. The two subsequent complete blood counts at 20:44 and 21:51 were reported as a laboratory error. The third complete blood count at 00:26 demonstrated a platelet count of 7 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The result was rechecked and revealed a platelet count of 9 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. She received two units of apheresis platelets with an increase to 46 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L.\n\n【9】The severe thrombocytopenia prompted a coagulopathy work-up. Her hemoglobin remained stable with no laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Her coagulation studies (international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time) were normal throughout. A thromboelastogram was obtained and showed a slightly prolonged clot kinetic (K) value, decreased alpha angle, and a decrease in maximum amplitude consistent with her thrombocytopenia. A heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody panel was collected in the setting of recent low molecular weight heparin administration during the hospital course. The value was reported as negative 24 h later. The remainder of her laboratory assessment was unremarkable, including an electrolyte panel and liver function tests. In addition, her infectious work-up remained negative.\n\n【10】Her platelets declined once again to a nadir of 4 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L on ICU day 2 requiring transfusion of two more units of apheresis platelets. To confirm that the thrombocytopenia was not due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a serotonin assay was obtained and reported as negative. One dose of vancomycin was administered at ICU admission and two doses the following day. Antibiotics were discontinued on ICU day 3. Her platelets began to improve, and reached 269 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L on her dismissal 3 days after discharge from the ICU, 8 days after the discontinuation of the vancomycin.\n\n【11】She completed a treatment course for COPD exacerbation consisting of levofloxacin and prednisone and was started on a heparin infusion once her platelet levels stabilized for treatment of her pulmonary embolism. The heparin infusion was transitioned to warfarin upon dismissal. She was discharged without further sequelae.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Thrombocytopenia in the ICU can be the cause of, or result of a multitude of problems.

The primary therapy is to stop the offending drug and transfuse platelets as dictated by the clinical situation. Other therapies that have been suggested include steroids, immune globulin, and intravenous anti-D antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Antibiotics are often implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia and are commonly given to ICU patients. Since its introduction, vancomycin has revolutionized the treatment of serious bacterial infections and in particular, infections from Gram-positive cocci. As the number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections continues to rise, vancomycin has become the cornerstone of antimicrobial therapy in these patients. Unfortunately, there are well-documented vancomycin-related serious adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, and an anaphylactoid reaction commonly referred to as Redman’s syndrome. In addition, recent data implicate vancomycin in potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is known to cause an acute, severe thrombocytopenia with an average nadir of 13.6 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L a median of 7 days after the initiation of vancomycin (range 3 - 27 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is often masked by the numerous confounding issues in these patients such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a multitude of other medications. The thrombocytopenia is often refractory to platelet transfusions and resolves within days of stopping the vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Data published by Drygalski et al showed definitively the presence of vancomycin-induced anti-platelet IgM and/or IgG antibodies in 34 patients who had been exposed to drug. Of the 29 patients followed in the study, 10 patients had severe bleeding episodes presumed to be due severe thrombocytopenia. Of the three out of the 10 patients who died, their platelet counts were below 10 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. In the 26 patients who survived, the platelet counts returned to baseline once the offending agent was removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The development and resolution of thrombocytopenia in the present case followed a pattern very similar to that experienced by the patients in the study by Drygalski et al. Interestingly, a review of her medical records indicated our reported incident was not her first episode of severe thrombocytopenia. In 2009, the patient presented to our institution with a lower extremity infection associated with signs and symptoms concerning for sepsis. A broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimen that included vancomycin was initiated. Within 7 h, the patient’s platelet count decreased from 300 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L at admission to 4 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L . At the time, it was unclear whether her profound thrombocytopenia was drug-related or the result of consumption from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy due to severe sepsis.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Platelet count trend (March 2009). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】A peripheral blood smear indicated myelocytes and nucleated red blood cells indicating a stressed bone marrow, a common finding in severe sepsis. In addition, a serotonin release assay was negative for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient did require six units of packed red blood cells and six units of platelets after she developed significant gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating emergent endoscopy. A review of the patient’s medical records indicated that there was concern for possible drug-induced thrombocytopenia, but no specific drug was identified as the possible culprit. At that time, the patient had been exposed to several antimicrobials including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. These antibiotics were discontinued and patient was started on tigecycline and ciprofloxacin. Eventually (days later and after several platelet transfusions) the patient’s platelet count stabilized. As her heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation panels were negative, her thrombocytopenia was attributed to consumption due to severe sepsis.\n\n【19】The patient remained well until our encounter with her in 2013 when she again presented with symptoms concerning for possible sepsis. As in her previous episode in 2009, she developed severe thrombocytopenia that was refractory to platelet infusions. A comparison of the course of her thrombocytopenia during the two documented episodes shows a very similar pattern on both occasions that is also comparable to the pattern seen by Drygalski et al. Once again, serotonin release assay was negative for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. After her second dose of vancomycin, we became highly suspicious of the drug after her thrombocytopenia worsened. The vancomycin was discontinued following the third dose after a clear pattern of worsening thrombocytopenia within 4 h of each dose was established. Her platelet count subsequently stabilized and returned to baseline by discharge . Of note, our patient actually required heparin for a pulmonary embolism well after her thrombocytopenia had resolved. She tolerated the treatment well without recurrence of her thrombocytopenia, further confirming that her thrombocytopenia was not due heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Platelet count trend (January 2013). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Thrombocytopenia is relatively common in the ICU and may be caused by a wide variety of triggers or etiologies. After exclusion of common causes, drug-induced thrombocytopenia should be recognized as a possible cause. Vancomycin is commonly administered in this setting and may lead to the development of thrombocytopenia. Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by antibodies that may remain for years after last exposure. Appreciation of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia may ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.\n\n【23】Funding\n\n【24】No grants received for this work.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A portion of this work in the form of an abstract has been submitted to the Society of Critical Care Medicine 2014.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These injuries are more commonly associated with penetrating trauma. Our case highlights a blunt trauma injury. The majority of the literature on blunt CA injuries is only been published recently, and only 8 articles have published injuries related to blunt CAs.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 72-year-old male driver, in a head-on motor-vehicle collision at greater than 60 mph, presented to our Level I trauma center. He was restrained, and air bags deployed. The patient’s airway, breathing and circulation were intact. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15. The patient was hemodynamically stable, and complained of severe abdominal pain. Secondary survey revealed abdominal tenderness and superficial lacerations. A computer tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no acute injuries, except for a right hemothorax, and a central supramesocolic retroperitoneal hematoma . Sagittal reconstructions showed subtle findings of a hematoma at the origin of the celiac artery interrupted as a disruption of the celiac axis. A chest tube was placed on the right. After consultation with Interventional Radiology and Vascular Surgery, it was determined that exploration was the patient’s best option. At laparotomy, using a left medical visceral rotation approach, the celiac artery was found to be completely avulsed. The proximal and distal ends were ligated. The hospitalization was complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation which resolved with medical therapy. The patient was discharged on post-operative day 11. At one-month follow-up, he had no abdominal complaints.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Axial cut CT scan of disruption of celiac artery with associated retroperitoneal hematoma.

The overall mortality of abdominal vascular injuries is estimated to be 54% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.This is related to the life-threatening hemorrhage associated with these injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. With regards to CA injuries specifically, the overall mortality is estimated at 38.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】A literature search was performed on Medline 通用删除7(英):<u>(1948 - 2012)</u>, using the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms of Celiac Artery, Vascular System Injuries cross-referenced against Wounds and Injuries, Blunt Trauma, Penetrating Trauma, and Abdominal Trauma, as well as, free text search of celiac artery injuries, abdominal vascular injuries. Only articles related to isolated celiac artery injuries were included. This search was supplemented with review of each article’s bibliography.\n\n【9】The two largest series of CA injuries report 13 patients each. One reviewed specifically CA injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and the other described a collection of abdominal vascular injuries including celiac injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Four reviews on CA injuries have been published, the latest in 2007; which focused on the hepatic complications following a CA dissection \\[ 4 \\- 7 \\].\n\n【10】There are 60 documented cases of isolated CA injuries in 17 articles. Of these 60 cases, 8 are related to blunt trauma. These 8 injuries include dissection flaps, occlusions, intimal tears and avulsions . To our knowledge, this is the only the second case of a blunt CA avulsion. It is the first case of an isolated blunt CA avulsion in a hemodynamically stable patient. Ten of the 17 articles are either associated with penetrating trauma or the mechanism of injury is unlisted. These are reviewed in prior works 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Literature Review of Blunt Traumatic Celiac Artery Injuries |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】A retrospective review, focused on CA injuries and their management, reported 13 CA injuries. Of the 13 patients one sustained a blunt trauma injury; however, the specific management of each individual’s injuries was not stated, only the total management interventions as a whole. The management of these injuries varied, eleven were ligated, one repaired primarily, and one patient expired during the operation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The other 7 reports of CA injuries related to blunt trauma are case reports \\[ 6 \\- 12 \\]. Multiple different management strategies have been reported in the literature including; observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>, anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, ligation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 12 \\]</u> stenting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. There have reported consequences to occlusion or ligation of the celiac, including hepatic and splenic necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, hepatic failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and necrosis of the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The CA is the first anterior branch of the aorta in the abdomen, giving off the splenic artery, common hepatic, and left gastric. It is just below the diaphragm at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra. It has been suggested, due to the rich collateral blood flow from the Superior Mesentaric Artery (SMA) through the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries as well as the non-named branches from the esophagus, diaphragm, intercostals, and abdominal wall that the CA can be ligated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. One must balance the need to control life-threatening hemorrhage versus the risk of hepatic failure or gallbladder necrosis. Nevertheless, ligation of the CA has been documented as a viable option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Our patient tolerated ligation of the CA well without necrosis of his spleen, liver, or gallbladder.\n\n【15】The suggested pathophysiology of CA injuries includes of the compression of the CA against the median arcuate ligament (MAL) of the diaphragm as the intra-abdominal pressure rapidly increases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. This compression could lead to a dissecting intimal flap, or as the fulcrum for a point of tearing in cases of avulsion \\[ 4 \\- 7 \\].\n\n【16】The establishment proximal and distal control and adequate exposure are the fundamental tenants of vascular surgery. There are four major approaches to establish control of abdominal vessels: left thoracotomy, endovascular balloon occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, left medial visceral rotation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, and direct midline compression at the aortic hiatus, or through the mesentery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Hematomas of the central abdomen upper abdomen can mean injury to the suprarenal aorta, CA, proximal SMA, proximal renal arteries, or the inferior vena cava. It is generally recommended to explore these due to the risk of exsanguination. Angiography can be helpful in planning an approach; however, distal control is very difficult if not impossible in cases of avulsion.\n\n【18】There are four techniques for management of a CA injury. These include: primary repair, surgical bypass, endovascular stenting or embolization, or ligation. Primary repair has been advocated in the literature as the preferred approach; however ligation is an acceptable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 14 \\]</u>. Surgical bypass with an interposition graft of vein or prosthetic material is undertaken if the other major vessels of the abdomen have been injured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】The current case represents the second reported CA avulsion related to blunt trauma. It is the first case in the literature of an isolated blunt CA avulsion in a hemodynamically stable patient. The decision to operatively explore this patient was based on the fact that this was central supramesocolic hematoma and there was some question if the proximal left renal artery was involved. Consultation with vascular surgery and interventional radiology was obtained. We performed a left medial rotation of the viscera. Ligation was the selected treatment on the basis of adequate collateral circulation. The patient had no complications related to ligation of the CA including liver injury or necrosis of his gallbladder.\n\n【21】Disclaimer\n\n【22】All authors have no conflict of interest in this report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Whilst the vast majority of patients with cholelithiasis are asymptomatic, associated pathology includes biliary colic, cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several of these complications require treatment via surgical and endoscopic interventions.\n\n【2】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has developed into a widely used procedure to investigate and manage biliary and pancreatic pathologies.\n\n【3】ERCP complications have a reported incidence of 2.5-8% and include pancreatitis, bleeding from sphincterotomy, cholangitis and perforation \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Subcapsular hepatic hematoma is an exceeding rare complication. A recently published literature review for subcapsular hepatic hematomas secondary to ERCP demonstrated fewer than 55 published cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Of relevance to this unusual case, the requirement for surgical intervention is even scarcer with previous reviews demonstrating surgical management in less than one-third of cases \\[ 7 \\- 9 \\].\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】An otherwise healthy 43-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fevers and vomiting. Her blood tests revealed raised inflammatory markers and a raised bilirubin of 87 µmol/L (reference range < 20 µmol/L). She was admitted under the gastroenterologists and treated for ascending cholangitis with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis without signs of cholecystitis.\n\n【6】On day 1 of her admission, she underwent an ERCP. Her common bile duct (CBD) was cannulated with a guidewire and her CBD was swept via balloon with multiple stones extracted. A sphincterotomy was performed and a CBD stent was placed in an acceptable position and bile flowed freely through the stent. The ERCP recovery was uneventful and after convalescence with antibiotics, the patient was referred to the general surgeons. One week after ERCP, she proceeded to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was uneventful and upon discharge she was booked to have a repeat ERCP and removal of CBD stents under the gastroenterology team. Unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic, her appointment was postponed by several months.\n\n【7】After 5 months, the patient was admitted for elective ERCP with stent removal. During the procedure, her CBD stent was removed, a guidewire was again passed in to the biliary tree and a balloon sweep was undertaken, which removed further CBD stones. Post-procedure in the recovery department, the patient complained of right shoulder tip pain and worsening RUQ pain. This settled with analgesia and she was discharged home from the endoscopy suite. She re-presented the following day with severe RUQ pain and was found to be tachycardic. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast showed a large subcapsular hepatic hematoma affecting most of the right liver lobe with some mass effect on the inferior vena cava .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

CT: computed tomography. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】The general surgery team on call were consulted and advised continued close observation, repeat hemoglobin testing and non-operative management. Progress CT scans showed a stable subcapsular hematoma without peritoneal extension. The patient’s pain improved and after remaining stable she was discharged on day 7 of the admission. Five days later, she re-presented to emergency department with a return of RUQ pain. Additionally, she also complained of shortness of breath, new fevers, malaise and lethargy. On assessment, she showed signs of sepsis and had a new oxygen requirement. Repeat CT imaging showed the continued presence of the large subcapsular hepatic hematoma and a new right-sided small pleural effusion.\n\n【11】She was admitted under the gastroenterology team and required admission to the intensive care department for on-going hemodynamic support. The patient was treated for an infected subcapsular hematoma and underwent interventional radiology (IR) guided drainage of the collection. Unfortunately, the drain did not facilitate resolution of the collection and the patient did not improve from a sepsis point of view.\n\n【12】The upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery team was consulted and after discussion with the treating gastroenterology team, the patient underwent laparoscopic washout of the infected collection. It was reported that the right lobe of the liver was densely adherent to the right hemidiaphragm with a necrotic capsule present. This was partially de-roofed and drainage of purulent liquid, necrotic debris and old blood was suctioned. Despite the laparoscopic washout, the patient required a further take back to theater 7 days later due to on-going fevers, raised inflammatory markers and a repeat CT which showed an on-going septated subcapsular collection. The surgical approach for the second operation included a partial necrosectomy of the collection and liver capsule and the cavity was thoroughly irrigated. No bile leak was seen and intra-operatively it was decided to leave a large caliber silicone double lumen sump drain in situ in the cavity, and to have continued irrigation of the sump drain post-operatively. In addition to the sump drain, two 28f Blake <sup>® </sup> drains were placed and kept in situ for several days.\n\n【13】Continued irrigation and drainage of the sump tube with normal saline was performed for 7 days. In addition to this, the patient had 40 days of IV antibiotics after Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli growth from the collection. This management was successful and the patient did not require any further surgical interventions. Continued monitoring of the drain output did not show any evidence of a bile leak during her recovery. Progress CT imaging several weeks after surgical intervention demonstrated significant reduction of the collection .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3.

This occurred due to a supratherapeutic antibiotic level causing a direct acute tubular necrosis. After the patient’s AKI resolved, she was discharged with her sump drain in situ and seen regularly by community nurses. She was reviewed regularly in outpatient clinic after discharge and the drain was systematically partially removed and shortened in size until eventually being completely removed without issue. She has been reviewed since drain removal and does not demonstrate any long-term complications from the admission.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Subcapsular hepatic hematomas are a rare phenomena and potentially life-threatening complication of ERCP. Fewer than 55 cases worldwide have been published in regards to this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Whilst hemorrhage is a known side effect from ERCP, it is usually related to sphincterotomy. Bleeding from other areas such as spleen, liver and bowel are exceptionally rare. Whilst not proven, authors have reflected that the likely pathological mechanism for subcapsular hemorrhage is the ERCP guidewire causing a laceration to one or more intrahepatic vessels. Interestingly, in contrast to this hypothesis, there are cases of subcapsular hematomas where no guidewires have been used. The pathophysiology proposed in these cases is thought to be related to extractor balloon traction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】A commonality in presentation of affected patients is the complaint of abdominal pain post-procedure. Pain may not be localized to the RUQ and all abdominal pain complaints should be taken seriously and investigated appropriately. In most cases, patients developed pain within 24 h as with this case. As such any patient with post-ERCP abdominal pain should be investigated appropriately for subcapsular hematoma. However, there are reported cases with a delay in the development of pain of several days and thus any patient re-presenting to hospital after ERCP should be investigated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In cases without pain, cardiovascular instability, fevers and drops in hemoglobin are documented as the primary symptoms or signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Radiological modalities for diagnosis include abdominal ultrasound, CT and magnetic resonance imaging. However due to its relative ease of access, CT should potentially be proposed as the first-line imaging investigation. As well as imaging, serum tests such as hemoglobin, hematocrit and inflammatory markers are useful adjuncts for diagnosis but importantly do not exclude the diagnosis.\n\n【21】Management is largely supportive with most cases utilizing a non-operative approach. In combination with this, many cases reduce the risk of infected hematoma with IV antibiotics prophylactically. However, this case highlights that non-operative management is not always successful and percutaneous drainage or operative management has to be considered in unstable or septic patients already on IV antibiotics. The original treating team had opted for IR drainage but when this did not result in source control, the UGI surgeons were consulted.\n\n【22】Invasive treatment options should be considered for patients with cardiovascular instability, failure to improve, worsening sepsis, or evidence of on-going hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In this case, on-going sepsis and pain necessitated operative management. Interestingly, laparoscopic washout with necrosectomy of the subcapsular hematoma is not widely reported. Due to the extensive necrotic tissue and purulent material in the cavity found intraoperatively, decision was made to leave large abdominal drains in situ and commence continuous irrigation for several days.\n\n【23】Post-operatively, the patient made a swift clinical improvement. Undertaking necrosectomy and post-operative irrigation removed and controlled the significant septic foci. This, along with the prolonged course of IV antibiotics, allowed convalescence from the iatrogenic complication. In conclusion, this case highlights the necessary pragmatism required when managing a rare pathology and the flexibility needed to gain a successful outcome.\n\n【24】Learning points\n\n【25】Whilst extremely rare, subcapsular hepatic hematomas post-ERCP must be considered in patients with any post-procedural abdominal pain, cardiovascular instability, hemoglobin drop or fevers. Most resolve with non-operative management but IR and surgical intervention should be explored if patients become unstable or have worsening sepsis despite antibiotic therapy. Finally, we offer necrosectomy and continued irrigation as a potential safe treatment option for patients failing conventional treatments.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was gained prior to completing the case report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RP contributed to the conception, writing and editing of the case report.

In autopsies where a malignant neoplasm was identified, cardiac metastases were found in 9.7%-10.7% of cases \\[ 4 \\- 7 \\].

He was an active smoker and complained of weight loss of 25 lbs over the last three months. Physical examination and blood tests at the Emergency Department were unremarkable. However, his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and the chest X-ray revealed a right lower lung field shadow. A transthoracic echocardiogram was arranged and a large tumor was pictured in the left atrium (39.7 × 36.4 mm diameter), attached to its posterior wall . Transesophageal echocardiograph confirmed a dilated left atrium with an immobile mass in the cavity, without any signs of left atrial outflow obstruction . The patient was further evaluated with thoracic CT scanning that confirmed the presence of a right lung mass.

Presenting complaints also include cough, anterior thoracic pain, pleuritic chest pain, or peripheral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Arrhythmias in patients with cardiac metastases is usually the result of concomitant factors such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, or anemia; however, arrhythmia can be secondary to tumors involving autonomic fibers or encroaching on the coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Overall, arrhythmia is the most prevalent manifestation of myocardial involvement by metastatic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 18 \\]</u>. The occurrence of arrhythmia without an obvious trigger in a patient with known malignancy suggests the possibility of metastatic myocardial involvement. The type of arrhythmia depends on the size of the tumor and its location relative to the conduction system of the heart. In our patient, palpitation revealed persistent atrial fibrillation, while transthoracic, transesophageal echocardiograph, CT scanning and bronchoscopic study confirmed the diagnosis of a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【9】Lung carcinoma is postulated to metastasize to the heart most often by direct invasion, followed by lymphatic and hematogenous spread. The right side of the heart is more frequently involved by metastatic lesions than the left side. In this case, the most likely culprit is hematogenous spread as cancer cells had direct access through the right lower pulmonary vein to the left atrium.\n\n【10】Differential diagnosis of intracavitary mass lesions includes benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors like myxoma, and various other space occupying lesions in the form of thrombus, vegetations and foreign bodies. Infectious and non-bacterial thrombotic or marantic endocarditis can also present with similar findings. It is important for admitting physicians to bear in mind that intramural metastases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction and pericardial metastases in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion.\n\n【11】Imaging studies valuable to establish the diagnosis include (2D, 3D) transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, CT scan, MR imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and angiography. Still, metastatic cardiac lesions, most of which are clinically silent, are often only found post-mortem. Other possible complications include peripheral embolism and sudden outflow tract obstruction. Sadly, the prognosis is poor if the patient is unresponsive to chemotherapy.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】Real time 2D and 3D transthoraric echocardiography is a low cost, readily accessible, reproducible, non ionizing radiation and non-invasive technique that provides an indispensable tool for the diagnosis of cardiac tumors. In addition, 2D and 3D transesophageal echocardiography can frequently provide essential supplementary information, obviating the need for further expensive and time consuming imaging tests.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no financial relationship between the authors and the subject matter.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Elemental mercury is a shiny, silver-white liquid (quicksilver) obtained predominantly from the refining of mercuric sulfide in cinnabar ore 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Poisoning by metallic mercury is rare and usually accidental, including injury from a broken thermometer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The ill effects produced as a result of self administration of the metallic form of mercury have appeared in scattered case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Here, we present a case of accidental subcutaneous administration of mercury in the hand and discuss its management.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 32-year-old woman presented with administration of metallic mercury was hospitalized in our clinic on May 2011. A mercury thermometer was broken in her hand, and wounded it accidentally. The metallic mercury inside the thermometer scattered throughout the soft tissue of the left hand. She complained of pain and redness with edema around the wound on the palm.\n\n【4】Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings, such as complete blood cell count, urine analysis, serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium and phosphorus, and liver function tests were normal. Analysis of the arterial blood gas levels were within normal limits on room air. Chest radiograph, and ultrasound of the abdomen were normal. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left hand showed multipl scattered metal-density opacities localized in the soft tissues around the metacarpals and carpometacarpal joint . Following her hospitalization, on the 17th May she was operated for removing the mercury and broken parts of the thermometer. Mercury could not be removed totally.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative lateral and anteroposterior radiographs of the left hand showing multipl scattered metal-density opacities localized in the soft tissues around the metacarpus. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】By atomic absorption method, blood mercury level was 14.1 µg/L (N: 0 - 10 µg/L), and 24-h urine mercury level was 12.0 µg/d (N: 0 - 20 µg/d) at admission on the 17th of May 2011. Over a 12-month of follow-up, the patient did not show any general or central nervous system symptoms of mercury intoxication. During this period, blood and 24-h urine mercury levels were monitored . On the 21st of September, then on the 27th of October the patient was operated in view of the elevated blood mercury levels and the potential severity of mercury intoxication if not properly treated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the operation, it was impossible to excise all tissues where mercury had scattered because of reserving and protecting important anatomical structures like tendons and neurovascular tissues inorder to protect the hand function. Mainly residual mercury was left in the soft tissue around the carpometacarpal joint. X-ray scope used during the operation to evaluate the excision. Postoperative radiographs of the left hand showed residual metallic mercury was left in the soft tissues around the metacarpals and carpometacarpal joint  and . The histopathological examination of the removed tissue showed mercury as black pigmented globules and a foreign-body reaction with polymorphs, lymphocytes, histiocytes and fibrosis of chronic inflammation around the globules  and .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1.

The patient presented with complaints of itching skin rash and painful abdomen after the third operation. Treatment with nonspecific agents such as low-sedating antihistamines and antacids had no effect on her symptoms. The symptoms regressed in time which was related to the gradual decrease of mercury concentrations in blood. None of the systemic symptoms and signs of mercury absorption were detected, and chelation therapy with dimercaprol was not required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. She has been followed for 12 months now.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Mercury is still used in the manufacture of many technical and medical instruments, including sphygmomanometers, manometers, thermometers, and barometers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Mercury in any form is toxic. Mercury poisoning can result from vapor inhalation, ingestion, injection, or absorption through the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The difference lies in how it is absorbed, the clinical signs and symptoms, and the response to treatment modalities. Neurologic, gastrointestinal, and renal systems are the most commonly affected organ systems in mercury exposure \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 \\- 10 \\]. Elemental mercury (Hg) is found in liquid form including mercury in thermometers and vaporizes at room temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Elemental mercury is not well absorbed by the GI tract, when ingested (eg. thermometers) is only mildly toxic \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\- 7 \\], and absorption through the skin is limited unless tissue inflammation is present or the mercury is retained over a prolonged period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. After absorption, elementary mercury is gradually oxidized into soluble mercuric salts that bind sulfhydryl groups, resulting in enzyme inhibition and pathologic cell membrane alteration. This can lead to systemic toxicity particularly in the central nervous system and the kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Mercury is mainly excreted from the body by the kidneys, but the rate of excretion is usually very slow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, like in our patient, and traces of mercury can be seen on radiographs, and in urine even two years after the index event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Measurements of mercury in blood and urine are useful in quantifying the degree of exposure. Clinically significant poisoning with mercury is unlikely if blood and urine concentrations are below 100 µg/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Although in two different measurements the patient had urine mercury levels above the mentioned range, finding a measurable amount of mercury in blood and urine does not mean that the level of mercury causes an adverse health effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Individual prognosis is dependent on the severity of exposure, the form of the mercury compound, the route of administration, and the duration of exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u> In cases of mercury poisoning, close monitoring of the clinical status of the patient is required with follow-up for at least two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Complete recovery is possible when the exposure to inorganic (i.e. elemental, mercuric salt) and organic compounds is mild. Treatment with chelators should be considered in patients with acute symptoms arising from the central nervous system due to confirmed mercury poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. There is no proof that chelation therapy induces significant removal of subcutaneous mercury, and even in patients demonstrating increased elimination, clinical benefit may not be apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. As recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, surgical excision of the mercury granulomas lowered serum and urine mercury levels in this case. There is still some metallic mercury left in the soft tissues of the hand, and the patient will be followed for the ongoing absorption which may unexpectedly cause systemic lesions.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Ankara Duzen Laboratory for measuring mercury concentrations in the blood and urine in their laboratory.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors’ Contributions</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DE and ARS acquired the data and wrote the manuscript, MT and CA did the operation and handled the specimen to the Pathology Laboratory, ET, EK, YCK, SHT and MP performed the clinical follow-up of the patient, SB performed the pathological evaluation.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Owing to unusual presentation and rarity, leptospirosis in pregnancy is often misdiagnosed and under-reported. It mimics HELLP syndrome, viral hepatitis, obstetric cholestasis and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. It has severe implications of early miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal leptospirosis, and requires high index of suspicion, necessitates increased awareness, early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】We report a case of leptospirosis in a 37-year-old at 33 weeks of pregnancy. She initially presented with jaundice, diarrhea and recent travel history to Vietnam. Initial workup pointed towards a diagnosis of atypical hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome in view of a hemolysis picture with proteinuria but subsequent leptospirosis lgM was positive. She was treated with P.O. doxycycline and had a preterm delivery at 33 weeks. We reviewed the literature and discussed the possible differentials that could overlap in presentation with leptospirosis. The authors believe this could be of educational interest to obstetricians as it is a rare infectious disease.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 37-year-old multip with the history of one full-term normal vaginal delivery presented to the labour ward with non bilious, non bloody diarrhea for 3 days at 33+2 weeks. This was associated with nausea, abdominal pain and tea-coloured urine. She has no past medical or surgical history, no past family history of liver disease and did not use any drugs or traditional supplements. She had a travel history to Ho Chi Minh City 3 months prior to admission but no social history of smoking or drinking. Her current pregnancy was uncomplicated except for gestational diabetes mellitus on diet control.\n\n【5】On examination, there was no confusion or lethargy. Patient looked non-toxic. She remained afebrile, blood pressure was normal throughout admission. There was sclera icterus and she was jaundiced, otherwise no stigmata of chronic liver disease. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or right hypochondriac tenderness. Hepatic flap was negative. Speculum examination showed that the cervical os was closed.\n\n【6】Initial blood results showed that hemoglobin was stable at 10 g/dL, platelets downtrending from 254 to 195 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, total white blood cells increasing from 12.3 to 27.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with deranged APTT/PT. Liver function tests (LFT) shows aspartate transaminase (AST) 155 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 153 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 238 U/L with raised total bilirubin 166 µmol/L and direct bilirubin 123 µmol/L as well as acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 117.\n\n【7】Serological test for infection was performed which confirmed that hepatitis A, B, C, E, CMV, EBV and HIV were all negative. Blood and urine cultures were also negative. Autoimmune tests ANA and anti liver antibody were negative. Ultrasound of the hepatobiliary system was normal, showing no hepatic lesion or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct was not dilated. Doppler ultrasound (US) of liver was done and there was no evidence of hepatic venous thrombosis and the portal vein was patent.\n\n【8】The working diagnosis was of atypical HELLP syndrome (absence of hypertension) in view of low platelets and haptoglobin, raised uric acid, LDH and liver transaminases with proteinuria.\n\n【9】She was transferred to labour ward 2 days later for unprovoked decelerations seen on cardiotocography. A few hours later, she had spontaneous rupture of membranes which showed thick meconium stained liquor. She delivered via normal vaginal delivery at 33+4 weeks, Apgar 9.9, birth weight 1,736 g. Baby’s arterial cord blood showed pH 7.275, lactate 3.04, BE -8.8, venous cord blood showed pH 7.316, lactate 2.93, BE -10.6. Placenta for histology showed focal increased perivillous fibrinoid associated with acute intervillositis, meconium staining of membranes, no leptospirosis detected.\n\n【10】She was given 1 pint of fresh frozen plasma in view of deranged coagulopathy and discharged against advice on post delivery day. She was readmitted on post delivery day 8 as leptospirosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) +ve and she was still having intermittent diarrhea.\n\n【11】She was referred to the infectious disease team and started on oral doxycycline and advised to withhold breastfeeding for 2 weeks. Baby was initially covered with IV ampicillin and gentamicin for presumptive Listeria . In view of maternal diarrhea, she stopped consuming breast milk on day 8 of life. Her liver function tests and renal panel was normal. She showed no signs of congenital leptospirosis and was discharged well on day 15 of life at 1,800 g.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Rare cases of leptospirosis in pregnancy are reported in literature. Human infections can occur by direct contact with urine or tissue of an infected animal, especially rodents or indirectly through contaminated water, soil, or vegetation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Leptospirosis ranges in severity from a mild illness suggesting a viral infection to a multisystemic syndrome. The clinical presentation is non-specific like fever, headache, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, lymphadenopathy, rash and hepatosplenomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Icteric leptospirosis, or Weil’s syndrome, characterized by liver, kidney, and vascular dysfunction, occurs in 5-10% of cases and has a fatality rate up to 20-40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Laboratory studies used to screen for the diagnosis of leptospirosis include IgM ELISA or IgM/immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA or real-time DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Laboratory studies used to confirm the diagnosis of leptospirosis include a single titer ≥ 1:200 or 4-fold rise in microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) titre drawn between the first and fourth week of illness or culture of leptospires from body fluids or tissue \\[ 3 \\- 4 \\].\n\n【15】Treatment with antibiotics like penicillin G, streptomycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin have been effective in treating these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. WHO reported that leptospirosis during pregnancy may lead to abortion, fetal death, stillbirth or congenital leptospirosis in women depending of the period of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In terms of fetal implications, Yechiel et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reviewed 15 previously reported cases of leptospirosis in pregnancy, which showed abortion in eight women, healthy babies in two, and four babies with signs of active leptospirosis. Puliyath et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> reported that leptospirosis is transmitted through breast milk and can result in neonatal leptospirosis. Therefore, mothers with suspected postpartum leptospirosis should immediately stop breastfeeding and the infant should be tested for Leptospira infection.\n\n【17】Hepatobiliary diseases during pregnancy can be divided into pregnancy related liver disease such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP, obstetric cholestasis or liver diseases unrelated to pregnancy like gallstones, hepatitis or other infections. In the third trimester, abdominal pain associated with jaundice, hemolysis, raised transaminases and coagulations abnormalities, likely differentials include HELLP syndrome and AFLP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Both disorders show similar clinical and laboratory presentation and accurate diagnosis will be challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Hypoglycemia will be present in AFLP and ideally, a liver biopsy should be performed to rule out AFLP. In view of patient’s travel and hygiene history, it is highly suggestive of an infection and leptospirosis must be ruled out.\n\n【18】In conclusion, leptospirosis is uncommon and difficult to diagnose due to its rare and non specific clinical presentation. It is therefore important to have a high index of suspicion, render early diagnosis and treatment and to avoid severe implications of early miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is an uncommon infection that mimics other conditions like HELLP or acute fatty liver in pregnancy, high index of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis of this condition. Obstetrician/gynecologist needs to be aware of fetal complications of leptospirosis including early miscarriages, stillbirths, preterm labour and neonatal leptospirosis. Multidisciplinary care consisting of nephrologists, hematologists, gastroenterologists, obstetricians and the infectious disease team are needed in the management of leptospirosis in particular patients with severe leptospirosis or Weil’s syndrome.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest in this study and no grant involved.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Myoglobin, a low-molecular-mass protein found in striated muscles, is released within a few hours after injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is made by plasma increase of the specific muscle enzyme (creatine phosphakinase, CPK-MM), as well as myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Urinary and serum levels of myoglobin are unrelated to each other or to the development of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】In this case report we present a fatal case of rhabdomyolysis in a newly transplanted patient. We performed a literature search, in an attempt to identify the possible causes of rhabdomyolysis and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms. Three major causes were identified as possible triggers: terlipressine, propofol and cirrhotic myopathy. As for the other suspected factors: electrolyte dissembalance, prolonged immobilization, some inherited mitochondrial defect in lipid metabolism, a newly and not fully recovered liver, we think they were minor factors that may have contributed to the negative outcome but were not solely responsible for it.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 51 years old patient with HCV liver cirrhosis and an MELD score of 30 underwent liver transplantation. Three months previously, during a gastrointestinal bleeding episode she was treated with terlipressine. Complaints of chest pain, hypertension, bradycardia and fingertips paresthesias were reported both after an i.v. bolus and the continuous administration. The treatment was stopped.\n\n【5】The patient received a good liver. During the dissection stage, due to massive bleeding and consequent hemodynamic instability, the patient required large quantities of blood and inotropic support. Reperfusion of the liver underwent smoothly. The patient was transferred to the ICU. Propofol 1 - 2 mg/kg/h and remifentanyl 1 - 2 µg/kg/h were started for sedation. Mechanical ventilation, and inotropic support were continued. Duplex ultrasound of the liver showed normal portal and hepatic artery blood flows. During the following hours liver enzymes, metabolic acidosis and coagulation profile improved suggesting a functioning liver.\n\n【6】During the following days, the patient’s condition improved. On postoperative day (POD) 3, she was fully awake, hemodynamically stable with adequate urinary output, minimal ventilatory support and good liver function. New onset gastrointestinal bleeding required transfusion of 4 units of blood. Gastroscopy showed multiple oozing points in the gastric mucosa. Two doses of terlipressine acetate, 1 mg each, were administered at 4 h interval. Several hours later, severe skin ischemia was noted on arms, legs, thighs and abdomen followed by onset of purple bullous lesions together with massive edema . Urinalysis revealed myoglobinuria while serum CPK increased to 31,000 U/L . A diagnosis of severe rhabdomyolysis together with skin necrosis was made. Soon thereafter, the patient became unstable requiring escalating doses of inotropic support. Severe metabolic acidosis with hyperkalemia and anuric renal failure required dialysis. Acute lung injury and deterioration in liver function were noted. Despite aggressive treatment the patient’s condition continued to deteriorate and she succumbed on POD 9 due to multiple organ failure and superimposed sepsis.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Extended area of severe skin ischemia and massive edema may be noticed on the arms, legs, thighs and abdomen together with purple bullous lesions. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. These lesions are considered secondary to intense peripheral vasoconstriction induced by terlipressine administration. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】After reviewing this case three potential causes of rhabdomyolysis were identified and they are discussed below.\n\n【11】Vasopressine induced rhabdomyolysis\n\n【12】Terlipressin (Glypressin <sup>® </sup> \\- Ferring Pharmaceuticals - triglycyl-lysine vasopressin) is a vasopressin analog 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> used as a first-line drug for esophageal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> because of its beneficial effect on renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (reduces hepatic venous pressure gradient, variceal pressure and azygos blood flow) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Cleavage of the N-triglycyl residue in the terlipressin molecule by endothelial peptidases results in a “slow release” of the vasoactive lysine vasopressin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The half-life of terlipressin is 6 h whereas that of vasopressin is only 6 min. The therapeutic effect is due to its binding to the V1 and V2 receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells of the portal vessels followed by intense vasoconstriction, thus hindering bleeding from these vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Because of V2 receptors activation on endothelial cells, causing von Willebrand factor release, it enhances platelet aggregation and therefore the risk of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Terlipressin proved to be safe, with a low incidence of side-effects (usually mild: headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bradycardia, increase in blood pressure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. More serious complications, primarily cardiac ischemia, are uncommon, but have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Ischemic effects are described in the literature, affecting intestinal mucosa, skin, distal limbs, and genitalia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Atypical sites of necrosis are also cited: the scalp, tongue, foreskin, scrotum and breasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently associated with ischemia and worsens outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Nevertheless, when the drug was administered for the first time in our patient, the side-effects proved to be difficult to tolerate and the treatment was aborted. After the second administration, skin ischemia was noted followed by appearance of purple bullous lesions and massive edema in the same area (similar to the sites described in the literature) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Soon after, myoglobinuria and high CPK were detected together with severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and anuric renal failure.\n\n【16】There is no known association between the severity of skin ischemia and the dose or the length of terlipressin administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Sepsis related hypoperfusion, concomitant administration of catecholamines or steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> and arterial catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> may act as additional risk factors. Although our patient was not obese, edema was present in the lower part of the body, stretching the skin of the abdomen and lower limbs and increasing the surface area for the microvascular blood supply. The use of terlipressin in the presence of low tissue oxygen levels may have led to ischemic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Moreover, relative hypovolemia associated with early recovery after liver transplantation together with concomitant administration of steroids (as part of immunosuppression) may have enhanced terlipressin effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Propofol infusion syndrome (PIS)\n\n【18】PIS is a devastating clinical entity associated with propofol administration. Propofol (Diprivan <sup>® </sup> \\- Astra Zeneca) a central-acting diisopropyl phenol compound, gained acceptance due to its ultrashort onset and duration of action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Although initially recognized in children, PIS is now accepted to occur in adults also. It has been described as an “all or none” syndrome with sudden onset and likely death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】A large spectrum of findings have been associated with PIS: myocardial failure, brady-arrhythmias, ST-segment changes, lipemia, fatty liver, rhabdomyolysis, lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. This may be the result of cumulative toxicity, with reports coming after high-dose infusions as well as after prolonged administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Risk factors for the PIS include: large cumulative doses, young age, acute neurological injury, low carbohydrate intake, high fat intake or inadequate clearance, exogenous catecholamine or corticosteroid infusion, critical illness and inborn errors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Current guidelines for maximal propofol dosage suggested < 4 mg/kg//h for a duration of up to 48 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Recently, fatal cases of PIS at low infusion rates (1.9 - 5.1 mg/kg/h) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Higher propofol doses during shorter periods of time can also trigger the syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. In our case propofol sedation was started after surgery and continued for the first three postoperative days but the doses did not exceed 2 mg/kg/h, being even below the minimal problematic dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The mechanism underlying PIS has yet to be clarified. Some evidence points to an abnormality of fatty acid metabolism suggested by elevated carnitine levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Pathology studies on patients that died of PIS found diffuse myonecrosis in both cardiac and skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Muscle cells may be susceptible to propofol because of their high ATP requirements and reliance on the fatty acids oxidation to meet their energy needs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. PIS is similar to the inherited mitochondrial myopathies, often clinically silent until a metabolic stress is encountered, when the body comes to rely on fat rather than carbohydrate for its energy requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Although low glycogen stores may have existed in this severely wasted patient, a normal carbohydrate intake of 3.5 g/kg/day was assured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Nothing is known about inborn errors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the recipient or in the transplanted liver. The blockade of the fatty acid metabolism by propofol together with the fat load delivered by the propofol emulsion in the presence of a newly transplanted and not yet fully recovered liver may have overwhelmed cellular functions and induced cytotoxic effects. However, if rhabdomyolysis may be explained by the PIS, extensive skin necrosis, a specific feature in this case is not a component of the syndrome.\n\n【23】Idiopathic rhabdomyolysis\n\n【24】Although myopathy associated with liver cirrhosis has not been established as a disease entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>, idiopathic cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported. The mortality rate in this group is high, 31% vs. 10-12% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Another feature is the recurrence of these episodes as well as the lack of any obvious causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Many cirrhotic patients have muscular symptoms (cramps, weakness and tenderness which may or may not be associated with rhabdomyolysis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>, but little is known about the mechanism of idiopathic recurrent rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. It may be related to altered metabolism due to hepatic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Even though not a disease “per se”, acute myopathy can develop in liver cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. A subclinical myopathy cannot be excluded in our patient (muscle biopsies were not performed), but no specific muscular symptoms or laboratory signs suggestive for rhabdomyolysis were recorded at any time before transplantation.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】In this report we presented a case of lethal rhabdomyolysis after liver transplantation. After analyzing the clinical picture and based on the temporal sequence, we believe that the culprit was terlipressin injection. The key point of this case is skin necrosis. It is not associated with rhabdomyolysis in any of the above mentioned situations except vasopressin or analogs administration. Moreover, the chain of events that led to terlipressine administration and the fatal outcome is also significant for this case.\n\n【28】It is possible that some other risk factors may have contributed to rhabdomyolysis and led to the final outcome: hypovolemia with moderate electrolyte disorder, a subclinical cirrhotic myopathy, infection, immunosuppressive treatment and propofol even in small doses. Medical miscommunication, the failure to convey relevant medical information between key players in the medical team held an important part in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. In hospital systems, medical notes are supposed to be transferred internally from department to department 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. The information relevant for the initial reaction to terlipressine administration (chest pain, hypertension, bradycardia, fingertips paresthesias and pulmonary congestion) was not passed as important to the intensive care team but as merely a note in an overloaded hospitalization chart, and thus, overlooked. We believe it should have been categorized as severe drug allergy/reaction and listed accordingly. Thus, it would have been noticed and a major negative event prevented. In this new light, terlipressin administration was impetuous and it came at a high cost.\n\n【29】This case also led to a change in our approach towards cirrhotic patients - cirrhotic myopathy is looked for during initial evaluation, electrolyte abnormalities are corrected more aggressively and team rather than individual decisions are employed whenever new medication should be added or old one changed. Medical records of the transplant patients, covering sometimes years of follow-up, treatments and their response, are periodically reviewed and updated.\n\n【30】We consider this event to be a lethal complication of terlipressin administration. Although the literature is sparse, the clinical picture fitted previous descriptions of such atypical cases. From this experience one can learn that potent drugs such as terlipressin should only be administered for their absolute indications. Even when adverse reactions are rare, when they do occur they may be catastrophic.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case was a routine transplantation case.

SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma is very rare. Only three case reports of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma have been reported in the literature \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\].\n\n【2】Recently, we had a case of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed by immediate repeat US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 44-year-old woman visited a local medical clinic for a routine exam. On thyroid US, a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid was detected incidentally. She was referred to our center for FNA of the thyroid nodule. She had an upper respiratory tract infection about 3 months prior to presentation and then subsequently developed anterior neck pain 2 months prior to presentation. She was treated at a local medical clinic. Physical examination revealed diffuse enlargement and mild tenderness of the thyroid gland, and there were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. On laboratory investigation, T3 was 132.0 pg/mL, (normal range: 60 - 181 pg/mL), free thyroxine (FT4) was 1.34 ng/dL (normal range: 0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.06 µIU/L (normal range: 0.35 - 5.50 µIU/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 56 mm/h (normal range: 0 - 20 mm/h). Antithyroglobulin was 155.8 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), antimicrosomal antibodies were 52.7 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) was < 1 U/L (normal range: 0 - 10 U/L).\n\n【5】US examination was carried out using a real-time scanner (Philips Healthcare IU 22, Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with a 10 MHz linear array transducer using color Doppler imaging. The thyroid US revealed a 1.2 x 0.8 cm hypoechoic, irregularly-shaped nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid which was suspicious for malignancy and ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid, findings compatible with SAT. Color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas . An US-guided FNA of the nodule was done, and one week later, cytologic diagnosis was found to be benign. We repeated the FNA that day and the result was papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tc-99m scintigraphy showed non-visualization of both thyroid lobes and 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake was 0% , which suggested destructive thyroiditis. We started oral prednisolone 20 mg per day, and the anterior neck pain and tenderness improved within several days. Total thyroidectomy was performed with dissection of the central compartment of the neck and the nodule was confirmed to be papillary carcinoma without lymph node metastasis. Pathologic finding revealed a stony hard papillary carcinoma and the other portion of the thyroid showed some scattered foci of granulomatous thyroiditis . The patient was treated with 30mCi of adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy. Four months after discharge, she remains in stable condition.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, the prognosis of SAT is excellent. More than 90% of the patients with SAT recover completely, with or without treatment. SAT is diagnosed after evaluating clinical manifestations and laboratory findings including elevated ESR, abnormal thyroid function tests, and thyroid scan with radioactive iodine uptake. Our patient had anterior neck pain, elevated ESR, and non-visualization of the gland on <sup>99m </sup> Tc thyroid scan. The first reports on ultrasonographic findings in SAT were published as early as the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Several recent reports have shown that US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring SAT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. Typical gray US findings include the presence of ill-defined hypoechoic thyroid lesions without a discrete round or oval shape. Color Doppler US demonstrates no hypervascularity in the acute stage, and slightly increased vascularity is seen in the recovery stage. This suggests that US features of SAT are more useful in the acute stage. US of our patient revealed ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid and color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas. Though our patient complained of anterior neck pain, the US findings suggested that the patient was not in the acute stage. In terms of the thyroid function tests, T3 and FT4 were normal range, which also suggests that our patient was not in the acute stage.\n\n【11】As thyroid US has become increasingly common, many incidental thyroid nodules are being detected. US features suggestive of thyroid cancer include the presence of microcalcifications, irregular margins, marked hypoechogenicity, nodule height greater than width, and evidence of invasion or regional lymphadenopathy. Many guidelines recommended FNA for such suspicious thyroid nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. FNA of thyroid nodules is widely used as a diagnostic method in identifying malignant lesions. However, false-negative results are reported in 1.3% to 13.6% of cases. Repeat FNA may reduce the false negativity of FNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. However, there has been continuous debate on the management of thyroid nodules with benign cytologic results. Most guidelines suggest that benign lesions may be followed annually by US only. However, Kwak et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> recommend that repeat FNA should be performed for thyroid nodules that have suspicious US features, even if the initial cytologic results are benign. Timing of repeat FNA also has been debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The Bethesda System recommends that thyroid nodules with an initial fine-needle aspiration (FNA) result of non-diagnostic, unsatisfactory, or atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) be re-aspirated, but no sooner than 3 months following the initial aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The US features of our patient’s nodule were suspicious for malignancy. We performed US-guided FNA and the initial cytologic results were benign. Therefore, we performed immediate repeat aspiration which revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the prognosis of thyroid carcinoma is good and the growth rate of tumors is slow, patients worry about malignancy. Therefore, it is helpful to perform early repeat aspiration in patients with US features suspicious for malignancy to obtain a prompt diagnosis.\n\n【13】The coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma is generally regarded as coincidental. Therefore, when SAT is suspected clinically and by laboratory findings, thyroid US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring this disorder and it may help identify a hidden thyroid malignancy as in this case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The majority of 247 cases of SPE were associated with pneumonia, sepsis and infectious endocarditis with only one case associated with infected central venous catheter, thus showing the rarity of the catheter-related SPE. In this study, fungal SPE was twice more common then bacterial SPE and more likely to be associated with hematological or solid malignancy compared to bacterial SPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In another study, tricuspid endocarditis was the most common cause and the drug abusers were the most common patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】CRBSI occurs at the frequency of 0.9 to 2.0 episodes/patient-year among HD population.Ten persent of whom would be hospitalized with sepsis or metastatic infection (such as septic thrombosis, endocarditis and septic arthritis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although CRBSI is very common, catheter-related SPE is unusual, more so in the absence of endocarditis or infected right atrial thrombus \\[ 3 \\- 11 \\].\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of SPE is related to the formation of infected catheter-induced thrombosis at the proximal end of the catheter, often with extension of the thrombus into the right atrium, which is frequently visualized by an echocardiogram. Alternatively, there could be associated tricuspid endocarditis. Dislodgement of the thrombus or vegetation to the pulmonary artery or its branches can lead to an infarction or a metastatic abscess \\[ 3 , 14 \\- 16 \\]. Our patient developed multiple SPE in the absence of overt clinical or radiographic signs of catheter-associated thrombosis, catheter infection or malfunction or endocarditis. Therefore, it is possible that the patient might have developed small thrombosis around the catheter site without extension into right atrium or the patient might have dislodged the entire cardiac thrombus without any residual thrombus.\n\n【15】SPE typically presents with fever, pleuritic pain, cough and hemoptysis. There is often a history of predisposing factor, e.g. drug abuse or extra pulmonary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> or a catheter, as in our patient. The clinical features and chest radiography could be nonspecific, as in our patient, thus delaying the diagnosis. High index of suspicion is important since SPE due to central venous catheters is probably under diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and early identification may improve its prognosis. Equally important is the identification of septic focus since the resolution of the problem will depend on the elimination of the source. When chest radiograph findings are nonspecific or equivocal, the use of chest CT can play an important role in detecting the presence of SPE. Only 32% of lesions visible on chest CTs were detected by chest radiographs in a study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Chest CT might show patchy infiltrate, poorly defined nodule or wedge-shaped densities, which are typically multiple, sub pleural and peripheral, and located at the end of a blood vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 17 \\]</u>, and sometimes associated with cavitations and air bronchogram within the nodule, ground-glass halo around the nodule, pleural effusion or empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. These features, along with the clinical scenario, help to differentiate SPE from other causes of diffuse pulmonary nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Echocardiogram is valuable in detecting the presence of right-atrial thrombus or endocarditis; TEE is superior to TTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Given the rarity of catheter-related SPE, we believe that the following criteria should be fulfilled before the catheter can be definitely implicated as the source of septic emboli: SPE occurs in the presence of CRBSI, and there are no other possible sources of septic emboli such as soft-tissue infection or drug abuse.\n\n【16】Once CRBSI is suspected, prompt empiric therapy with antibiotic covering methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (preferably vancomycin) and gram-negative bacilli (e.g. third generation cephalosporin, carbapenem, or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) should be started 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The infected catheter should always be removed for patients with infection due to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas species, or Candida species and a temporary (nontunneled catheter) should be inserted into another anatomical site. The catheter should also be removed in the presence of severe sepsis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or metastatic infection e.g. endocarditis, or osteomyelitis or in the absence of response to antibiotic therapy within 72 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hence, in patients with SPE, the catheter should be removed. Our patient had infection with MRSA as well as SPE, hence the catheter was removed. Long-term HD catheter can be reinserted once blood cultures are negative as in our patient. The total duration of antibiotic in the presence of complicated or metastatic infection should be at least 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The need of surgical interventions for complications of SPE such as lung abscesses, empyema and bronchopleural fistula, although once common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, is declining with earlier diagnosis and prompt use of antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】1) The diagnosis of SPE might be overlooked because of the absence of respiratory symptoms and signs or the presence of nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Hence, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with HD catheter. 2) A diagnosis of CRBSI can be made by peripheral blood culture in conjunction with catheter tip or catheter blood culture. A chest CT, in addition to echocardiogram, can provide important additional diagnostic clues for SPE. 3). Empiric therapy of CRBSI should include vancomycin and gram-negative coverage with subsequent de-escalation based on cultures.

Venous or lymphatic blockade could result in potentially massive enlargement of the ovary caused by continued arterial inflow to the ovary without venous outflow. Eventually, if undiagnosed and untreated, arterial stasis can lead to hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis of the ovarian stroma. The risk of ovarian torsion rises by 5 fold during pregnancy. Incidence is 5 per 10,000 pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its most common cause in pregnancy is a corpus luteum cyst, which usually regresses spontaneously by the second trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ovarian torsion, therefore, occurs most frequently in the first trimester, occasionally in the second, and rarely in the third 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

The aim of the study is to present a case of maternal adnexal torsion at the 9th gestational weeks, and its laparoscopic management with prophylactic detorsion suture.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 22-year-old, gravida 3, spontaneous abortion 2, pregnant woman at her 9th weeks of gestation, presented to the emergency department with acute onset of excruciating pain in the left and right-abdominal quadrant. She reported no vaginal bleeding or discharge, nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, or constipation. Her general and gynecologic history was noncontributory.\n\n【4】Physical examination showed she was diaphoretic. Her vital signs were unremarkable for a blood pressure of 120/85 mmHg and a pulse of 88 beats/min. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable right lower quadrant mass below the level of the umbilicus, with voluntary guarding but no rebound or peritoneal signs. Pelvic examination revealed a 10-week sized soft uterus, with a closed cervix, and a tender 10-cm right adnexal mass.\n\n【5】Laboratory results were normal. Transvaginal sonography performed at the examination room visualized a normal fetus in utero with a gestational age of 9 weeks. In the right adnexa, a large, 10 cm х 6 cm edematous ovary was seen. The left ovary appeared normal, and some free fluid was seen in the cul-de-sac. With color flow doppler small cystic masses periferally located at the right ovary and some vascular flow were identified at the perifery of the ovary. With a presumptive diagnosis of ovarian torsion, the patient was brought to the operating room, where general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were carried out. Laparoscopy was performed with a standart 10 mm main trochar at the umblical level, and two satellite 5 mm trochars at the inguinal regions. On entry into the abdominal cavity with a main trochar at the umblicus, a congested 10-cm right ovary was found to be twisted around its adnexal pedicle 2.5 rotations . After untwisting the ovarian pedicle, the ovary returned to its normal color and showed no signs of hemorrhage or necrosis. Since the patient was pregnant the luteo-placental hormonal mileu was probably still acting, so the ovary was not incised. Oophoropexy was performed with a no 0 polyglactin 910 suture material with blunt needle to fix the ovary to the ovarian fossa with peritoneal serosal intracorporeal suturing technique. The patient recovered without problems and was discharged on the first postoperative day. The remainder of her pregnancy was unremarkable.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The decision to proceed to surgery during pregnancy is somewhat complex, since the well-being of both mother and fetus must be taken into account. The risk of any surgery to the pregnancy will depend on the gestational age. In the first trimester, when ovarian torsion most often occurs in pregnancy, the risk of fetal loss is the smallest with modern anesthetic techniques. For years, the treatment of choice for ovarian torsion was salpingooophorectomy. Conservative treatment appears to be warranted to preserve fertility, even for adnexa that initially appear nonviable and purple or black in color. A major consideration is whether the surgery can be performed by laparoscopy or by laparotomy. In the nonpregnant patient and during the first trimester of pregnancy, ovarian torsion can usually be approached laparoscopically.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Diagnosis of ovarian torsion can usually be made on the basis of the characteristic clinical presentation in conjunction with ultrasound evidence of a unilaterally enlarged adnexal mass. Treatment options are limited to surgery, either by laparoscopy or laparotomy, the former becomes more difficult in pregnancy but should be the treatment of choice if experienced surgeon and equipment is available. Theoretically cystectomy in early pregnancy may detoriate the corpus luteum function, so ovarian fixation may be more preferable.\n\n【11】Competing Interests\n\n【12】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There was no family history of renal disease.\n\n【4】Physical exam findings were as follows: height 178.0 cm, weight 80.6 kg, body mass index 25.4, blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg, pulse rate 72 beats/min, and body temperature 36.6 °C. The patient was not deaf. The patient’s ocular fundus was normal. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable, without ascites or pretibial edema.\n\n【5】Urinary protein was 1,105 mg/dL and 3.8 g/day. The protein/creatinine ratio in a spot urine specimen was 3.4. The urinary sediment showed 1 - 4 erythrocytes and 1 - 4 leukocytes per high-power field. The patient’s hematocrit was 45.6%, his hemoglobin concentration was 15.5 g/dL, his platelet count was 205,000/µL, and his leukocyte count was 5,590/µL. His serum urea nitrogen level was 15.2 mg/dL, creatinine was 1.61 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 43.8 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> , uric acid was 9.8 mg/dL, cholesterol was 172 mg/dL, total protein was 6.7 g/dL, and albumin was 3.8 g/dL. His C-reactive protein level was 0.05 mg/dL, IgG was 918 mg/dL, IgA was 138 mg/dL, IgM was 74 mg/dL, and ferritin was 129 ng/mL. Serum complement was normal. Circulating immune complexes were negative. The other autoimmune serological findings were within normal ranges and serum hepatitis viral markers were negative. An intravenous pyelogram revealed smaller (right) and small (left) kidneys without hydronephrosis. Size of renal pelvis and calices of bilateral kidneys seemed mildly small . Abdominal computed tomography  and ultrasound showed smaller (right) and small (left) kidneys with uneven surface of kidneys (longitudinal diameters: right kidney 10.1 cm and left kidney 8.8 cm on ultrasonography), but apparent thinning of bilateral renal cortex was not present. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals. Echocardiography revealed a small VSD with left to right shunting.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Abdominal computed tomography showed uneven surface of smaller (right) and small (left) kidneys without apparent thinning of renal cortex. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】On the patient’s second day in the hospital, a right renal biopsy was performed to investigate the cause of proteinuria. Under light microscopy, the number of glomeruli in the biopsy sample was obviously decreased, with only nine glomeruli found in two pieces of adequate length. Of these glomeruli, one was obsolescent, one was becoming obsolescent, and the remaining glomeruli were markedly enlarged with slightly hyperplastic juxtaglomerular apparati, but without mesangial proliferation . Diameters of two glomeruli were 300 μm and 320 μm. The glomerulus in the process of becoming obsolescent had findings compatible with segmental sclerosis; segmental sclerotic lesions, adhesion of glomerular tufts, crescent-like epithelial cell proliferation, and hyaline deposits were seen . Tubules were dilated and enlarged, and focal tubular atrophy with mild interstitial cellular infiltration was noted . There was a peculiar area in the cortex containing numerous small vessels, scattered muscle-like cells, and a presumptive primitive duct enclosed by a smooth muscle collar . The epithelial cells of this duct were cytokeratin positive  and the collar cells were smooth muscle actin-positive . No significant deposits of immunoglobulins or complement components were found with immunofluorescence. Only one glomerulus was found in the electron microscopic specimen and neither electron dense deposits nor specific findings were observed. These imaging and histological findings led us to the diagnosis of OMN.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Using his whole blood, we looked for mutations in paired box gene 2 (PAX2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1β), but no mutations were detected.\n\n【10】The patient was treated with 20 mg/day of valsartan in our outpatient clinics. After administration of valsartan, his proteinuria appreciably reduced. Two years later, his urine protein/creatinine ratio had reduced to 1 - 1.4 and his eGFR had stayed at 52.1 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】Renal biopsy-proven cases of OMN are very rare in adults. We have identified only six reported adult cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-5 \\]</u> confirmed by renal biopsy, including the case presented here . These six cases included five males and one female with a mean age of 28 years (range 19 - 36 years). Low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction are sometimes related to OMN, but five of the six patients were born at full term with normal birth weights. Two patients had hypertension, three had proteinuria of less than 1.0 g/day, and three had proteinuria over 3.0 g/day. The median serum creatinine level at presentation was 1.71 mg/dL, and the median eGFR was 44.3 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . The present case was an adult with OMN, who showed marked proteinuria, moderate renal failure, and bilateral atrophic and uneven kidneys.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Reported Cases of Oligomeganephronia in Adults |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of OMN remains unknown, but OMN has been observed in association with certain genetic disorders, including mutations in the PAX2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and HNF-1β 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> genes. OMN associated with a PAX2 mutation has been reported as one of the symptoms of renal-coloboma syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Mutation of the PAX2 gene associated with OMN without coloboma has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We did not detect mutations of PAX2 or HNF-1β in our patient.\n\n【15】OMN is usually a sporadic isolated malformation, but it has sometimes been reported with other congenital malformations, such as urinary tract anomalies and deformities of the hands, feet, or ears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. One of the reported adult cases had complete hearing loss in the left ear . In addition to clinical and histological findings, concurrent congenital malformations are helpful in arriving at a diagnosis of OMN. In our patient, a small VSD was observed. This is the first reported case of OMN with concurrent VSD. It is thought that OMN results from developmental arrest of the metanephric renal blastoma between the 14th and 20th weeks of fetal life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Although it is possible that common factors influenced the development of renal and cardiac abnormalities in our patient, further evaluation of a greater number of cases is needed.\n\n【16】The characteristic histological findings in OMN include decreased numbers of nephrons with hypertrophic glomeruli, tubules, and juxtaglomerular apparati 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. McGraw et al concluded that increasing proteinuria in patients with OMN heralds the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), presumably due to functional overload of the reduced nephron number 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. These characteristic findings were observed in our patient.\n\n【17】OMN is generally classified as renal hypoplasia. Hypoplastic kidneys are defined as small kidneys weighing less than 50% of the normal mean for the patient’s age, and with no histological abnormality other than secondary FSGS, simple hypoplasia, or hypertrophy of nephrons (oligomeganephronic hyperplasia). In the case of our patient, a presumptive primitive duct enclosed by a smooth muscle collar, which is a distinct feature of renal dysplasia, was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first case of OMN with renal dysplasia, confirmed by needle biopsy. Comparing a figure of apparent infant case in a text book 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, cells enclosing primitive duct of our case appear more matured muscle cells, the possibility that mesenchymal cells in dysplasia can mature with age of patients will be determined by accumulation of such cases. The degree of hypoplasia in our patient was relatively mild, as in the five previously reported adult cases, and glomerular size was not large in comparison with typical juvenile OMN. In consequence, our patient’s renal dysfunction did not become apparent until adulthood. Our case showed relatively small kidneys with small renal pelvis and calices, but apparent thinning of bilateral renal cortex was not present.\n\n【18】The radiological findings of abdominal computed tomography in our patient looked like renal scar or reflux nephropathy. But existence of reflux nephropathy was obscure from his past history. The existence of dysplastic changes suggests that the cause of our patient’s small kidneys was a congenital anomaly rather than acquired kidney disease. As recently pointed out, progressive scarring of the kidneys has been observed in the absence of urinary tract infections and obstruction, and this probably represents primary renal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】CKD is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. In 2002, a simple definition of CKD was proposed and subsequently adopted worldwide. Our case had CKD stage G3bA3. Our patient’s proteinuria had continued for at least 12 years, and he had experienced none of the characteristic symptoms associated with OMN, such as polyuria, polydipsia, or growth retardation. The clinical course of our case matched the definition of CKD. OMN is one of the probable cause of CKD in adults, especially CKD with bilateral small and uneven kidneys. Patients with OMN sometimes have atrophic kidneys, which is a relative contraindication for renal biopsy. The definitive diagnosis of OMN must be based on renal histopathological findings, so OMN in adults may be overlooked. In cases without histological findings, it is difficult to distinguish between congenital and acquired disease.\n\n【20】Our patient’s proteinuria was appreciably reduced by ARB administration. In patients with glomerulomegaly and FSGS, angiotensin inhibitors, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and ARB, decrease proteinuria and slow the rate of progression to end stage renal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. ARB might be effective in reducing proteinuria in FSGS due to OMN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Acknowledgement\n\n【22】The authors are grateful to Dr. N. Morisada and Dr. K.

The medical community is in a desperate need to understand the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (caused by SARS-CoV-2) and explore possible therapeutic strategies in the wake of widespread mortality. At the time of writing this article, globally, 305,395 people have succumbed to this disease with 4,508,435 total infections. As almost a dozen pharmaceutical agents go into randomized controlled clinical trials, multiple studies have surfaced trying to associate a hypercoagulable state to COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We reference these studies and present two novel COVID-19 cases who presented with pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】The summary of cases with pertinent patient characteristics, histories, findings and supporting data are presented in Table 1 . Until now, there have been only sporadic cases of occlusive PE in COVID-19 patients, coming from China, Italy and the USA. Both our patients presented with dyspnea preceded by a mild flu-like illness and were found to have pulmonary emboli with significant clot burden at initial presentation. There were no significant predisposing risk factors, other than a hypercoagulable state due to COVID-19. The history of prostate carcinoma in patient 2 is unlikely to be contributory as he was in remission, suggested by a normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Both patients were treated with heparin products. Patient 1 remains hospitalized with moderate illness (day 4). Patient 2 required 3 days of inpatient stay and was discharged on newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with a recommended duration of 3 months. Hypercoagulable workup including factor V Leiden mutation, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III levels, and anti-phospholipid antibody tests was ordered upon outpatient follow-up, which remains pending.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Pertinent Patient Characteristics, Histories, Laboratory Findings, and Imaging Results |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】Initial studies from Greece and France endorse that COVID-19 patients might be at a higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which has been attributed to a hypercoagulable state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The exact putative mechanism of this observation still remains elusive, but the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) has been implicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Interesting autopsy findings from China suggest hyaline thrombi in some microvessels of the alveolar septum on immunohistochemical staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

In summary, all these studies point towards a similar direction, decoding the labyrinth, i.e. pathophysiology of COVID-19 and how anticoagulation therapy might fit in the algorithm. Future randomized controlled studies might help clear this association. In the meantime, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is being widely used in patients who fit this picture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.

According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 74,690 new cases of bladder cancer and 15,580 bladder cancer-related deaths occurred in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Approximately 75% of patients with bladder cancer present with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC, formerly known as superficial bladder cancer) that is confined to either the mucosa (stage Ta, carcinoma in situ ) or submucosa (stage T1). The current standard treatment for NMIBC is transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), followed by adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The goals of TURBT are to eradicate all visible tumors, prevent tumor recurrence and prevent progression to invasive or metastatic disease. However, when the lesions are located in the lateral bladder wall or around the ureteral orifice, optimal penetration is difficult to control during TURBT, and complications such as bleeding, bladder perforation and hydronephrosis can occur. In addition, these procedures are more likely to stimulate the adjacent obturator nerve (ON), which is in close proximity to the lateral bladder wall. This stimulation causes obturator nerve reflex (ONR), leading to inadvertent bleeding and bladder perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 52-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic because of macroscopic hematuria. Physical examination, urine analysis, complete blood count and blood biochemistry were normal. A mass, 2 cm diameter, was detected on urinary system ultrasonography. Papillary tumoral mass was shown in left side wall of the bladder on cystoscopy. Then bipolar transurethral resection of tumor was planned under spinal anesthesia. Bladder perforation and gross hematuria occurred during transurethral resection of tumor due to severe ONR. We decided to perform open surgery due to persistence of hematuria, the occurrence of hypotension and tachycardia. Bladder perforation about 1 cm at left side wall and left external iliac vein injury were seen in open surgery. The left external iliac vein injury was repaired with 5-0 prolene suture and bladder perforation was repaired with 3-0 vicryl suture. Pathologic evaluation of transurethral resection was reported as low grade urothelial carcinoma. Cystoscopy was normal after 3 months from open surgery.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】ON originates from L2-L4 lumber plexus and passes through obturator foramen to supply adductor muscles of thigh. It passes close to infero-lateral bladder wall, bladder neck and prostatic urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】In transurethral urological surgeries, bladder is distended with irrigation fluid. ON path comes very close to the lateral bladder wall. Electric current can easily stimulate the ON while doing TURBT. Stimulation of ON causes sudden jerk (adductor reflex) due to contraction of adductor muscles. This all happens in fraction of a second and may lead to bladder perforation or deep cut which may cause profuse bleeding. This may also result in incomplete resection of the bladder tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Motor part of the ON is blocked under spinal anesthesia; however, jerk does occur due to non-blockage of sensory part. D-tubocurarine and succinylcholine have been used to block neuromuscular junction but this requires a general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. However, morbidity is relatively high in old age patients requiring tumor surgery under general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Prentiss was the first person who used regional block of ON in 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Various techniques of obturator nerve block (ONB) were described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10-12 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】ONB along with spinal anesthesia can be safely employed to prevent the obturator jerk, which commonly occurs in tumors of posterolateral areas of bladder. We recommend ONB in patient of lateral bladder tumor undergoing TURBT. Vascular injury should be considered in the presence of persistence of hematuria, hypotension and tachycardia due to ONR and open surgery should be performed.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Patients commonly present with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) characterized by protracted fevers, bone marrow failure, splenomegaly and hemophagocytosis. Liver dysfunctions manifested as elevated transaminases and bilirubin are often present and can be life-threatening. Elevated ferritin, sometimes above 10,000 ng/mL, and depressed natural killer (NK) cell function are consistent features of HLH; however, the most specific parameter used to establish the diagnosis and follow disease activity is the serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor/CD25 (sCD25). Hemophagocytosis, although present and frequently pronounced in HLH, is not pathognomonic; infections, autoimmune disorders, lymphomas (especially of T-cell subtypes) and leukemias can be associated with hemophagocytosis phenomena without showing other HLH features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Although HLH is traditionally classified as hereditary or acquired, a genetic defect is currently believed to increase the risk of acquiring HLH after certain triggers. PRF1 gene, first described in the pathogenesis and accounting for 20-40% of hereditary HLH, encodes for perforin, a pore-forming protein with a critical role in the cytotoxic function of NK cells and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells. Other gene mutations linked to familial HLH include UNC13D , STX11 , STXBP2 , Rab27a , SH2D1A , or BIRC4 . Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for these mutations commonly leads to HLH during the first 2 years of life. However, simple heterozygosity may predispose adults to HLH after specific triggers such as viral infections (Epstein-Barr (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and others), malignancies (lymphoproliferative disorders including B- and T-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;16) and rarely germ cell tumors or Ewing sarcoma), immunodeficiencies (HIV/AIDS, X-linked lymphoproliferative disorders, Griscelli and Chediak-Higashi syndromes), autoimmune diseases (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and adult Still’s disease) and solid organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\].\n\n【3】The underlying pathophysiology in HLH is the failure of homeostatic mechanisms to suppress activated macrophages, which abnormally propagate systemic inflammation and tissue damage through mechanisms of cytokine release (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ) and uncontrolled phagocytosis. The unrestrained macrophage activity also leads to a state of moderate immunodeficiency with consequences of increased rates of infections and malignancies \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\].\n\n【4】According to the 2004 HLH guidelines, the diagnosis of HLH requires either the identification of one of the HLH mutations or fulfillment of five out of the following eight diagnostic criteria (clinical, laboratory and histopathologic): fevers, splenomegaly, cytopenias of at least two lineages, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytic activity, low-absent NK-cell activity, hyperferritinemia (> 500 µg/L) and elevated sCD25 (> 2,400 U/mL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】HLH usually evolves into a rapidly fatal disease if left untreated. Based on two landmark studies performed mainly in the pediatric HLH population (HLH-1994/HLH-2004 protocols), the current treatment of HLH is a multidrug regimen comprising dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclosporine. In cases with central nervous system (CNS) disease or progressive neurological symptoms, intrathecal methotrexate is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Allo-SCT may be considered for patients with familial, persistent, or recurrent disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Lymphoma-associated HLH (LA-HLH) is a rare disorder carrying grave prognosis. Both T- and B-cell lymphomas can cause uncontrolled systemic responses and be the trigger for secondary HLH. Factors including the complexity and overlap in their clinical manifestations can lead to a delay in the identification and recognition of both entities. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for LA-HLH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】We conducted a retrospective search of the tumor registry and pathology database at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital to identify adult patients with the combined diagnosis of lymphoma and HLH between January 2008 and July 2018, using Pathology Laboratory Information System (LIS) and natural language search. Data from nine identified LA-HLH patients were reviewed to gain further understanding of the clinical features and treatment outcomes of our adult population of patients with LA-HLH. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of both institutions.\n\n【9】The main clinical characteristics of our retrospective cohort are summarized in Table 1 and molecular analysis results are summarized in Table 2 . While most series demonstrated a male prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, our series has a female predominance (56%) similar to Yu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The median age of our cohort is 53 years (range 19 - 73), with 78% of cases of Hispanic origin corresponding to our geographic location. Lymphoma subtypes consisted of six T-cell/NK-cell neoplasms (67%): two peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), not otherwise specified (NOS); two EBV+ extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphomas; one EBV+, CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , PTCL, NOS; one EBV+, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder-anaplastic large cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase negative (PTLD ALCL ALK-); and three B-cell neoplasms (33%): one EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); two DLBCL, NOS. The clinical manifestations observed across all our nine cases included fevers, constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and cytopenias. In seven out of the nine cases, hemophagocytosis phenomena were established in tissue specimens collected either from the bone marrow or the affected organs. In most of the cases (except cases 1, 3 and 4), HLH and lymphoma were diagnosed simultaneously. In case 1, HLH was diagnosed concurrently with second lymphoma relapse, 36 months after initial lymphoma diagnosis. In case 3, HLH preceded the lymphoma diagnosis by a period of 12 weeks, while in case 4, HLH arose 13 weeks following the diagnosis of PTLD ALCL ALK-, these occurring 5 years following a kidney transplant. In our cohort, five out of the nine cases (56%) tested positive on Epstein-Barr encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) analysis, comparable to the series of Cattaneo et al and Han et al, reporting rates of 41% and 68% EBER-ISH positivity, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.

Molecular Analysis |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】In our series, four cases received the combination of HLH plus lymphoma therapies, four cases had lymphoma-directed therapy and one case was treated with a modified version of the HLH-1994 protocol. Overall, a total of five cases received the HLH regimens (HLH-1994/2004). The selected specific lymphoma therapies for each patient in this case series are illustrated in Table 1 . Three patients had refractory LA-HLH and entered hospice care. Two of them developed sepsis-related complications during the course of treatment leading to multiorgan failure and subsequent death, and a third patient succumbed 13 days after allo-SCT. Of the seven cases that were evaluable for lymphoma response (cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9), four (57%) of them achieved complete remission (CR), and three cases (43%) were refractory to therapy. Three out of the four cases that responded to treatment (CR) were alive with no evidence of recurrence at 10, 16 and 52 months as of last time contact.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】LA-HLH is a rare entity described in the medical literature to have an incidence rate of 0.9%, as illustrated by Machaczka and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Supplementary Material 1  summarizes the published series analyzing the characteristics and outcomes of LA-HLH. Even though our series is built on a demographic of mostly Hispanics, we did not find significant clinical differences in their disease manifestations and treatment outcomes as compared to the reviewed published series. Our experience in LA-HLH indicates that NK-/T-cell lymphomas constitute the most common associated lymphoid malignancy, which correlates with the up-to-date literature. The mean survival of our LA-HLH patient group is 356 days, whereas the survival of the T-cell lymphomas is found to be higher compared to the B-cell lymphoma subgroup; however, this is just an observation given the limitation of a small descriptive study.\n\n【15】In 2015, the Study Group on HLH Subtypes of the Histiocyte Society published consensus recommendations for the management of malignancy-associated HLH (MA-HLH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Due to the lack of prospective trials, there is no explicit agreement on whether patients should receive HLH-directed therapy (dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclosporine), malignancy-focused interventions, or a combination of both. The conventional HLH protocols aimed at suppressing the overactive immune system have shown to improve survival in HLH cases. While treating the underlying malignancy seems natural, a 2017 consensus review from Daver et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> noted higher mortality rates when lymphoma-directed therapies were used alone, leading to a recommendation of a two-step approach: treating first the cytokine storm and T-cell proliferation with etoposide, corticosteroids, anti-thymocyte globulin and immunoglobulins followed by a lymphoma-directed therapy. Hence, merging HLH- and cancer-directed therapies, for instance, adding etoposide to the frequently used lymphoma regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP), or initiating HLH-directed therapy as a first step to gain control of the life-threatening HLH cytokine storm syndrome followed by malignancy-focused treatment are both acceptable strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Another suggestion from the Study Group is to add anti-B-cell therapy such as rituximab in EBV-positive lymphomas and consider allo-SCT consolidation for LA-HLH, which is linked to improved survival outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Additionally, owing to the severe immunosuppressive state and high incidences of infectious complications, supportive measures such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and pneumocystis prophylaxis along with surveillance for secondary viral infections and reactivations (CMV, EBV and fungi) should be strongly advocated in the treatment plan. Finally, treatment should be decided on a case-by-case basis, contemplating each patient’s clinical condition, co-morbidities, underlying malignancy and potential drug toxicities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Relapsed or refractory patients may be rescued with DEP regimen (doxorubicin, etoposide and methylprednisolone) as per a Chinese report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Similarly, several case-reports/case-series have shown alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) and anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) to be effective salvage therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Recently, the FDA approved emapalumab (anti-interferon-γ monoclonal antibody) based on results from a pivotal multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial for patients with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease, or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Furthermore, ongoing trials are evaluating the use of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibitor ruxolitinib in HLH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Herein, we describe our unique experience of an LA-HLH case series in a predominantly Hispanic population in South Florida. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the association between HLH and PTLD ALCL. LA-HLH is an aggressive disease with a complex clinical presentation. The diagnosis is challenging, often delayed, and prognosis is dismal in refractory scenarios despite the currently available rescue therapies. Future prospective studies focusing on early diagnosis, management and novel targeted molecules will hopefully further improve the outcomes of patients with LA-HLH.\n\n| Supplementary Material | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】Suppl 1.

Abdominal and vaginal examination was unremarkable. Vaginal examination was normal and her most recent pap smear was normal. A pelvis ultrasound performed revealed a complex heterogeneous structure in the left adnexal region measuring 7.6 × 6.2 × 5.4 cm with areas of vascularity on Doppler . Serum ovarian tumor markers showed a mildly elevated CA125 level at 41.8 U/mL (0.0 - 35.0 U/mL) while CEA 1.6 µg/L (≤ 5.0 µg/L), beta hCG < 1.2 (IU/L) and AFP levels 2 µg/L (≤ 8µg/L) were not elevated.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The uterus was mildly enlarged with small fibroids and the contra lateral ovary and fallopian tube were otherwise normal.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Previous glomus tumors reported have ranged from 1mm to 4 cm in size.

Immunohistochemical staining using various markers such as pan-Cytokeratins alpha-inhibin, calretinin, synaptophysin, chromogranin, alpha fetoprotein, and c-Kit can be used to aid in the diagnosis.\n\n【13】The pathogenesis of ovarian glomus tumor remains unclear .The ovarian tumor was composed of epithelioid cells with a vague nested architecture which showed positive smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunohistochemical staining that was consistent with a glomus tumor, an extremely rare mesenchymal neoplasm arising in the ovary. On the contrary, the tumor was negative for pan-Cytokeratins AE 1/3 ruling out surface epithelial carcinoma while alpha-inhibin and calretinin were both negative ruling out a sex-cord stromal origin. Synaptophysin and chromogranin were negative for a well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and c-Kit staining were negative for hepatoid carcinoma and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor respectively.\n\n【14】Glomus tumors have been proposed to be classified into malignant, symplastic, glomangiomatosis or uncertain malignant potential which can aid in the diagnosis of rare neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Clinical and pathological features of tumors include size, location, presence of mitotic figures and nuclear atypia.

However this classification was described in glomus tumors of other organs except the female genital tract due to its rarity.\n\n【15】In our case, no atypical mitotic figures or marked nuclear atypia was discerned which would justify a diagnosis of a malignant glomus tumor. However, in view of the large size of the lesion, we feel that the tumor has uncertain malignant potential that would require close surveillance with repeat imaging. Our patient had subsequent baseline postoperative CT scan which did not show any evidence of residual disease or metastasis. She is currently on close gynecological follow-up in our hospital 1 year later disease free.\n\n【16】In conclusion, a large glomus tumor of the ovary with typical immunohistochemical findings which although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian lesions and followed up for its uncertain malignant potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In addition, premature infants are at a greater risk than the full term infants while undergoing similar surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Because of the fact that almost all premature infants have various degrees of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the risk of encountering the symptoms of coughing, laryngospasm and consequent hypoxic episodes is getting higher in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】In this case report, we present the anesthetic management towards an infant with a complete atelectasis of the right lung, and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, for whom laser treatment is planned for rethinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】The female infant weighing 950 grams and born through vaginal delivery at the 27th gestational age was transferred to our hospital following the diagnosis of BPD and consequent bilateral stage 2 retinopathy with plus disease. As a result of the examinations and tests performed, the patient was hospitalized following the diagnosis of prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, BPD, ROP, transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity and intracranial hemorrhage. During the physical examination of the patient, tachypnea and retractions were observed. In the transfontanel ultrasonography performed, it was observed that both ventricles were dilated, thrombosis was present in choroid plexus, and heterogenous image in the left thalamus was seen and cystical encephalomalacia was present. In the echocardiography, secundum atrial septal defect, minimal tricuspid regurgitation, and patent ductus arteriosus were observed. When an urgent ROP surgery was planned for the patient with the above mentioned symptoms, during the preoperative assessment in terms of anesthesia, the chest radiogram showed a complete atelectasis of the right lung .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest radiogram preoperatively. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】The peripheric oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of the infant, who was admitted to the operation room in an incubator with oxygen support, was observed to be 94%. Standard monitorization was performed for the patient and ventilation was manually assisted by a face mask, and the SpO <sub>2 </sub> was found to be 97%. Following this, sevoflurane induction with O <sub>2 </sub> was administered, and a laringeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. One minute later, the patient’s SpO <sub>2 </sub> decreased to 70%. The LMA was immediately removed and the patient was ventilated by a face mask. The SpO <sub>2 </sub> thus reached 97%. Then, the LMA was placed once again and the SpO <sub>2 </sub> again decreased to 70%. The LMA was again removed and the patient was ventilated by a face mask. Then the patient was intubated with an endotracheal tube No. 2.5. However, when desaturation continued, the tube was removed and again, the patient was ventilated by a face mask. The SpO <sub>2 </sub> of the infant rapidly increased to 96%. It was observed that the removed tube was obstructed with secretion. The patient was intubated a second time with an endotracheal tube No. 3.0 and a large amount of secretion was aspirated. While the patient was being ventilated with a mixture of 40% O <sub>2 </sub> \\-air, the SpO <sub>2 </sub> improved gradually and reached 100%. This value was maintained during the 30-minute surgery. Laser treatment was applied to both eyes of the patient and the surgery ended without any complications. At the end of the surgery, the intubated patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. The clinically stable patient was extubated after the confirmation of the SpO <sub>2 </sub> to be 100% at the 2nd postoperative hour and right lung, which had atelectasis in the chest radiogram, to be significantly treated . In the chest radiogram of the patient, who was followed up in the pediatric intensive care unit, taken the following day, it was observed that the right lung was normally ventilated . Thus, the patient was transferred to the maternity ward.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Chest radiogram in the 2nd postoperative hour. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Chest radiogram on the 1st postoperative day. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common cause of chronic lung disease in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rather than being a specific disease, it is the symptom of a complex one characterized by airway obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and lung hyperinflation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This results in uneven distribution of ventilation, reduced compliance, increased work of breathing, and compromised gas exchange. The clinical manifestations of this condition are rapid respiration, wheezing, cough, and frequent episodes of fever, desaturation, and bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Instrumentation of the airway is associated with pulmonary, as well as systemic, hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Further respiratory compromise may prove to be disastrous in these patients, and it is well documented that infants with BPD are at increased risk to develop bronchospasm, atelectasis, and pneumonia in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The early detection of stage 3 ROP is crucial for the exact timing of the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. When treatment is delayed, development of retinal detachment and subsequent very low visual acuity or blindness is more likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, in our case, the infant with atelectasis of a single lung was immediately admitted for surgery without waiting for the recovery of the lung.\n\n【12】There is great variation on the types of anesthesia for the surgery of ROP including general anesthesia, topical anesthesia alone or topical anesthesia plus oral sedation or intravenous sedation or rectal chloralhydrate or paracetamol or intravenous ketamine, subtenon’s local anesthesia, ketamine sedation, remifentanyl infusion and morphine infusion \\[ 10 \\- 15 \\]. However, when we look through the literature, all anesthesia types have their own advantages and disadvantages on the risk of morbidity and the patient’s, surgeon's and the anesthetist’s security, so the anesthesia technique to be used must be chosen according to the patient’s clinical aspect.\n\n【13】Topical anesthesia alone is insufficient for treatment of ROP and may be associated with an increased incidence of potentially life-threatening cardio-respiratory events. Among the variety of anesthesia alternatives for surgery of ROP, general anesthesia is the mostly used modality. General anesthesia in premature infants can be associated with a high risk of morbidity especially when intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotising enterocolitis are also present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 16 \\]</u>. In this case report; because the patient had an atelectesia on the right lung and low the SpO <sub>2 </sub> (94%) although she was in the incubator with the O <sub>2 </sub> supply, we decided to choose general anesthesia technique where we can use positive pressure ventilation.\n\n【14】Patients with ROP and concomitant BPD present the anesthesiologist with a significant challenge regarding airway management. General anesthesia with tracheal intubation will guarantee a patent airway, make positive pressure ventilation possible, and allow the anesthesiologist to remove their hand from the surgical field. However, these patients are sensitive to airway infections and often suffer from bronchial hyperreactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Thus, inserting a foreign object into the bronchial tree will increase the risk both for respiratory infection and bronchospastic episodes. General anesthesia and tracheal intubation also is not uncommonly associated with a setback regarding the need for respiratory support, and certain patients thus will require postoperative ventilator treatment of varying duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】It is possible to administer general anesthesia by a face mask, however, when a face mask is used, the mask or the hand of the anesthesiologist holding the mask may cause a failure in the successful completion of the surgery. Furthermore, pressure from the mask and the hand may cause an increase in intraocular pressure on the globe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The incidence of coughing, straining movements, breath holding, and sore throat were much higher when the endotrachael tube was used when compared to the use of LMA. Since LMA does not enter the trachea, it is less irritating to both the upper and lower airways; therefore, it may be advantageous in former premature infants and other children with chronic lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Also, in pediatric patients, the LMA does not stimulate the sensitive tissue of the larynx and trachea. Therefore, when laryngeal stimulation is absent, for minor surgical procedures, pediatric patients may be maintained at a lighter plane of general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. So, we decided to use the LMA at the beginning of the operation but as the patient’s SpO2 was insistently low, we had to intubate the infant with an endotrachael tube.\n\n【16】In conclusion, even if premature patients with BPD also have atelectasis of one lung, such patients should immediately be operated on for such surgeries are urgent. When administering general anesthesia to these patients, instead of the placement of LMA, we believe direct endotracheal intubation would be more efficient to ensure a patent airway and easily aspirate secretions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

She has no significant past medical history or previous surgery. Her last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago with regular 28 days cycles. The patient was followed up for primary subfertility and recently underwent IVF treatment with embryo transfer 3 weeks ago. Initial serum beta-hCG after embryo transfer was low at 5.4 IU/L.\n\n【4】On physical examination, she reported a body temperature of 37.2 °C, blood pressure reading of 156/80 mm Hg and pulse rate of 87 beats/min. Abdominal examination elicited generalized severe lower abdominal tenderness with voluntary guarding and rebound positive on palpation. Speculum examination revealed no vaginal bleeding. Per vaginal examination was unremarkable. Cervical excitation was negative.\n\n【5】Subsequent urine pregnancy test was positive. Blood investigations indicated a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL and white cell count of 14.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Serum beta-hCG was elevated at 1,528 IU/L. Trans abdominal ultrasound  revealed a large amount of echogenic fluid in pelvis with a complex mass measuring 9.8 × 8.9 × 3.8 cm seen in the midline in the pouch of Douglas. No intrauterine gestational sac was seen. Both ovaries were not well seen due to the presence of hemoperitoneum.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Consequently, the patient underwent an emergency diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy. Intra-operatively, a small 2 × 2 cm ruptured right ovarian ectopic pregnancy was seen with active hemorrhage seen. One and a half liter of hemoperitoneum was present. The uterus and bilateral tubes were normal. A wedge resection of the right ovarian ectopic was performed  and hemoperitoneum evacuated. Ovarian tissue sent for histopathology reported hemorrhage, chorionic villi and trophoblastic attached which confirmed the diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian ectopic. Post-operatively, the patient remained stable and was discharged from hospital 2 days later. Post-operative hCG level was negative after follow-up.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Other differential diagnosis also includes hemorrhagic corpus luteum and endometrioma.\n\n【12】Correct diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is made on patient history, clinical acumen, serum beta-hCG levels and pelvic ultrasound. Preoperative diagnosis is often difficult, challenging and unpredictable. In our case, the ovarian ectopic was initially missed on trans abdominal ultrasound concealed by massive hemoperitoneum and diagnosed intra-operatively by laparoscopy.\n\n【13】Ectopic pregnancy cannot be excluded in patients after IVF treatment despite low serum beta- hCG levels after embryo transfer. These patients may present with an acute abdomen that require close surveillance. Low serum beta-hCG levels may also be misleading as ruptured ectopic pregnancies have been reported in cases with decreasing beta-hCG levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Ovarian pregnancy occurs when the ovum is not separated from the ovary during ovulation and is fertilized by sperm in the peritoneal cavity over the ovary and implanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Definite diagnosis is the fulfillment of all four histological and anatomical criteria that Spiegelberg described in 1878 with the following 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. 1) The fallopian tube on the involved side is intact. 2) The gestational sac is located in the region of the ovary. 3) The ectopic pregnancy is attached to the uterus by the ovarian ligament. 4) Ovarian tissue in the wall of the gestational sac is proven histologically. Our case fulfilled these criteria with negative beta-hCG levels on follow-up.\n\n【15】The management of an ectopic pregnancy includes medical treatment with methotrexate or surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Methotrexate was not suitable in our case as the ultrasound features of a large 9.8 cm midline complex mass with hemoperitoneum were contraindicated. Laparoscopic management of ovarian ectopic includes oophorectomy, enucleation of gestational sac and wedge resection for fertility conservation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This technique allows preservation of reproductive capability which is ideal for patients who want to conceive post-operatively. Laparoscopy remains the ideal treatment for diagnosis and treatment as it is associated with less operative time, lower blood loss, shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery compared to laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In conclusion, ovarian ectopic pregnancy remains a rare occurrence with diagnostic challenges. Diagnosis of ovarian ectopic is made on patient history, clinical acumen, serum beta-hCG levels and pelvic ultrasound. Ectopic pregnancy must be suspected in patients presenting with abdominal pain after IVF treatment despite low serum beta-hCG levels. Laparoscopic management can be successfully used for fertility conservation.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed equally to writing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Consumption of contaminated food, mostly raw products (milk, meat, fish, flour, and fresh cheese) \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\], is the major cause of listeriosis. It has a higher incidence and severity in the elderly, immunocompromised people (with lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection), pregnant women and newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Listeriosis is associated with high a morbidity and mortality. The most common presentations are bacteremia, meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Pericarditis due to Listeria monocytogenes is an extremely rare disease; therefore, knowledge of its pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment is limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present a patient with pericarditis caused by Listeria monocytogenes , persistent and difficult to diagnose and manage. We show the importance of differential diagnosis and the importance of foodborne infections.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】We present a 61-year-old man with 1-month history of mild fever, dyspnea and thoracic pain.\n\n【4】During this disease evolution, he had several visits to urgency department and received two antibiotic courses, aiming at an upper respiratory infection. He was medicated firstly with amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin, with clinical remission. He also presented with an atrial fibrillation (AF) of recent onset. Anticoagulation was started and cardiac rhythm was controlled. After 3 weeks he had recurrence of mild fever and mild cough, and he received doxycycline, without remission of fever. He had no other cardiac events and chest X-ray did not show pulmonary findings.\n\n【5】After 1 month of fever history the patient had a third admission to urgency department, presenting with high fever. Additionally, he presented with respiratory deterioration, with shortness of breath, dry cough and left thoracic pleuritic pain. He never had gastrointestinal symptoms. He had a past medical history of Ann Arbor stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma, in remission for 34 years. He was submitted to chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP) protocol, followed by splenectomy. He also reported a recent trip to Portugal north coast, where he had consumed a large quantity of fresh fish.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient presented with subfebrile temperature and mild hypotension, but was eupneic (peripheral oxygen saturation of 97%). He had irregular cardiac sounds, bilateral pulmonary rales and mild hepatomegaly. He presented with mild bilateral pitting edema up to the knees. There were no meningeal signs. Laboratory findings were relevant for white blood cell count (12.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L; 76% neutrophils), C-reactive protein (16.38 mg/dL), hemoglobin (11.2 g/dL, normocytic), light elevation of cardiac troponin I (2.95 ng/mL), with normal myoglobin and creatine kinase. He had normal iron kinetics. Electrocardiogram showed AF. Chest X-ray revealed a bilateral pleural effusion, cardiomegaly and left diaphragmatic elevation (splenectomy sequelae). Transthoracic echocardiography showed small pericardial effusion, with no signs of ischemia.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Patient chest X-ray on admission, showing a bilateral pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】He was admitted for investigation of fever of unknown origin, and cardiac failure of new onset New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade III. All cultures of blood, urine and respiratory secretions were negative. Mantoux test presented unspecific reaction and the determination of gamma interferon was negative. Viral infections were excluded. He underwent a thoracentesis revealing a pleural transudate, normal adenosine deaminase, reactive mesothelial cells, no tumor cells, and negative microbiology. Abdominal ultrasound did not show significant alterations.\n\n【9】During the clinical investigation, the patient presented with persistent fever, dyspnea, light to mild chest pain, mild hypotension, and increasing inflammatory parameters. He maintained a stable light elevation of troponin I. He received antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, followed by meropenem and vancomycin, analgesics, low dose of diuretics and anticoagulation. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a small volume (< 1 cm) of circumferential pericardial effusion, maintaining a good left ventricular systolic function. There were no signs of ischemia or vegetations, and no signs of hematological disease on blood investigations. He underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan revealing a diffuse pericardium thickening, few mediastinal reactive lymph nodes, moderate right pleural effusion , and a mild hepatomegaly.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

We observed elevation of serum levels of serotype 1/2a immunoglobulin G (IgG) and serotype 4b IgG (both quantifications were 800, by indirect immunofluorescence). Biopsy of pericardium showed features of acute inflammatory pericarditis, revealed by perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and pericardium infiltration by neutrophils, probably of bacterial etiology . It was not possible to analyze microbiologically the sample. Given the high probability of an acute pericarditis due to Listeria monocytogenes , the patient received amoxicillin for 4 weeks.\n\n【13】He presented with fever resolution and progressive clinical recovery, after 12 days of treatment. He was discharged and completed antibiotic at ambulatory. During 1-year follow-up, he remained clinically recovered, presenting with normalization blood tests and resolution of cardiac AF (to sinus rhythm). Pericardium was also normalized on CT scan imaging.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】The incidence of listeriosis is still uncertain worldwide. This is mostly because of under diagnosis, the lack of notification and variable food security policies. In our country, it is not a notifiable infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cardiovascular involvement is very rare and potentially fatal. By analyzing the previously reported cases, we find that Listeria monocytogenes pericarditis has a mortality rate of about 60% (fatal in 6/10 cases) \\[ 3 , 4 , 6 \\- 11 \\]. This is higher than the reported mortality of purulent pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In these reported cases, patients were 54 years old or older. They mostly presented with fever, dyspnea, chest pain and peripheral edema. The presence of weak immune system (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cirrhosis, neoplasia, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) and iron overload states (hemochromatosis, hemodialysis) were noticed. Our patient was in the same age group and splenectomized. All the other causes of immunosuppression and iron overload reported on previous case reports were excluded.\n\n【16】Usually, the diagnosis was made by pericarditis and Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia confirmation. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes in a pericardium culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is often difficult to achieve. Its isolation in cultures is unlikely after the prior antibiotic regimens. On the other hand, we had high serologies for serotypes 1/2a and 4b, strongly suggestive of infection. Additionally, listeria subpopulations with cardiotropic activity have been shown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The patient completely recovered under amoxicillin, supporting this diagnosis. Fatal outcomes in previous reports were seen more commonly in severe infections or even septic shock. In these cases, mostly adopted therapy was a penicillin alone (amoxicillin or ampicillin), or in association with gentamicin, during 4 - 6 weeks. There is one successful report of erythromycin treatment for 4 weeks \\[ 3 , 4 , 6 \\- 11 \\].\n\n【18】This case report aims to increase awareness of foodborne infections among health professionals and promote early diagnosis. It is important that there is a careful management of antibiotics, especially when there are not microbiological findings (or an infectious focus suspected) to guide the treatment. Further studies are needed to know more about Listeria monocytogenes subpopulations and improve food security.\n\n【19】Disclaimers\n\n【20】This is an original work, and it was not submitted in any previous abstracts, presentations, reports, or publications.\n\n【21】Disclosures\n\n【22】There are no financial interests or affiliations with institutions, organizations, or companies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These patients were originally described to have critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). If untreated, it progresses to anterior myocardial infarction in the majority of the cases. We will present a variant case of Wellens’ syndrome.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】An 87-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for an elective skin grafting procedure by plastic surgery. She had recently fallen and subsequently developed a hematoma in the right lower extremity. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on rivaroxaban), ischemic stroke without any residual deficits and malignant melanoma status post resection and axillary lymph node dissection. The patient had a remote smoking history. The patient denied any history of chest pain. Her admission blood pressure was 192/110 mm Hg. Examination on admission revealed normal S1 and S2 heart sound without any murmurs. The patient had a scar of a sternotomy, but she could not recall what type of surgery she had in the past. Hospital records did not have any information either. Admission electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation at heart rate of 84 beats per minute . The patient was admitted to telemetry floor, and her blood pressure was controlled with medications.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Admission EKG showing atrial fibrillation. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Overnight dynamic changes in the telemetry were noted. Repeat EKG was performed  which showed patient in sinus rhythm with a rate of 75 beats per minute with left axis deviation and T-wave inversions in lead V2 to V6, I and aVL. Less than 1-mm ST-segment depression was seen in V6 and lead I. Troponins were drawn and were negative two times. The patients’ EKG was concerning for Wellens’ syndrome, but the patient did not have a history of chest pain. Due to her risk factors and recent dynamic changes, it was decided that cardiac catheterization should be offered.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. EKG performed after dynamic changes noted on telemetry showing sinus rhythm with rate of 75 beats per minute with left axis deviation, T-wave inversions in lead V2 to V6, I and aVL and less than 1-mm ST-segment depression in V6 and lead I. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】The patient consented to the procedure, and catheterization revealed that she had no significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery. The patient had 60-70% stenosis in mid LAD . Fractional flow reserve (FFR) without adenosine was calculated in the lesion, which was 0.83, and the cutoff used at our institution is 0.9. Hence the decision was made to stent the lesion. Two drug-eluting stents (DESs) were deployed in the lesions , and the patient was started on aspirin and ticagrelor. The patient was given an outpatient follow-up with a cardiologist.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Angiogram showing mid LAD lesion with 60-70% stenosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 4. Angiogram after placement of drug-eluting stents showing no residual stenosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Wellens’ syndrome was first described by De Zwann et al in a study group of 145 patients with unstable angina, and 26 patients had the EKG pattern of Wellens’ syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Twelve patients out of this group did not undergo coronary revascularization and subsequently developed anterior myocardial infarction within a few weeks’ time. Later on, a larger sample was used (1,260 patients, 180 patients with Wellens EKG findings) and all of the patients who showed these EKG changes were found to have stenosis in the proximal LAD ranging from 50% to 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The causes of T-wave inversion can be extensive and include coronary ischemia and pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, later stage of pericarditis, myocardial straining following ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, pre-excitation syndrome, and digitalis effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Rhinehardt et al described the following diagnostic criteria for Wellens’ syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>: 1) deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3 (may extend to V1-6); 2) isoelectric or minimally elevated ST-segment (< 1 mm); 3) no precordial Q waves; 4) preserved precordial R wave progression; 5) a recent history of angina; 6) ECG pattern present in the pain-free state; 7) normal or slightly elevated serum cardiac markers.\n\n【12】Usually, two different patterns of T wave abnormality are seen in Wellen’s syndrome type A and type B. Type A has biphasic T waves with initial positivity and terminal negativity (it was seen in about 25% of the cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Type B has T waves which are deep and symmetrically inverted (it was seen in about 75% of the cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This syndrome was described to represent critical stenosis of the proximal LAD.\n\n【13】Throughout the years, many cases have been reported with typical and atypical features of Wellens’ syndrome. Kardesoglu et al reported a case where the patient had T-wave inversions in the lead II, III and aVF and the EKG changed from type B to type A pattern on serial EKGs. This patient also had the unusual finding that the critical stenosis was in mid LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Taylor et al reported a case of 65-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder presenting with EKG of type A Wellens but cardiac catheterization showing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Others have tried to diagnose Wellens in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Grautoff presented a case of LBBB and chest pain. Sgarbossa’s criteria were not met, and the patient was admitted for monitoring. Serial EKG showed type A Wellens. The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization showing mid LAD stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Kyaw et al reported an elderly female with throat pain as the presentation of an acute coronary syndrome and EKG findings of Wellens and revealing proximal LAD lesion on catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Some cases of pseudo-Wellens have been described with the use of cocaine and marijuana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Another case study described a case of Wellens with T-wave changes during the pain episode as well as the pain-free periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The case we presented above highlights that there can be variants in Wellens’ syndrome. The patients’ presentation was atypical, and the lesion was in mid LAD instead of the classical proximal LAD lesion. She was admitted to the hospital for an elective procedure of skin grafting by plastic surgery. She did not have any chest pain or angina equivalent. Troponins drawn before catheterization were normal twice. EKG done on admission showed atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation at heart rate of 84 beats per minute. Second EKG done about 14 h later showed patient in sinus rhythm with rate of 75 beats per minute with left axis deviation, T-wave inversions in lead V2 to V6, I and aVL and less than 1-mm ST-segment depression in V6 and lead I. Third EKG was performed about 5 h later which did not show any T-wave inversions. Due to the concern for type B Wellens’ syndrome, the patient was taken for cardiac catheterization which showed two areas of significant stenosis around 60-70% in mid portion of the LAD. Left main coronary artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery had no significant stenosis. FFR calculation being abnormal was a factor in the decision of stenting the lesion.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Wellens’ syndrome is a pattern of T-wave changes in the precordial leads that occurs in a subset of patients with unstable angina signifying stenosis of proximal LAD. It can have an atypical presentation, and our case highlights a patient with EKG characteristics of Wellens’ but stenosis of mid LAD instead of proximal. More studies need to be done to fully understand the different locations of lesions and their associated EKG findings.

Her birth weight was 3,500 g and length was 48 cm. Head circumference was not recorded. There was no similar individual in the family. She had two healthy siblings. At the age of 3 years, her weight was 12 kg (25th - 50th centile), her height was 84 cm (25th - 50th centile), and her head circumference was 49 cm (above 97th centile).

There was mesomelic shortening of upper and lower extremities. There was macrocephaly and a J-shaped sella turcica on radiograph of the cranium. The radiographic examination of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated thoracolumbar hump and mild platyspondyly. The radiographic examination of upper and lower extremities showed shortening of humerus, radius, ulna femur, tibia and fibula. Radiograph of the pelvis showed squared iliac wings .

We present a case of a 73-year-old patient who was diagnosed with this rare syndrome, after a fall of a height of approximately 2 m and cervical spine injury. We also perform a brief review of the literature to shed light onto this rare clinical entity.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 73-year-old man sustained a cervical spine injury after a fall of approximately 2 m height. The patient was transported to the local hospital, where the clinical examination showed that he suffered from moderate neck pain with slight disturbance of cervical spine mobility. Neurologically, he was diagnosed with incomplete tetraplegia and was found to have 3/5 strength in his upper extremities, 2/5 strength in his lower extremities, normal sensation and reflexes, normal bladder and bowel function. Plain X-rays of the cervical spine could not clarify the cause of the patient’s neurological status . The patient had been operated 12 years before due to larynx cancer and had a tracheal tube since then. He did not suffer from any other significant comorbidities and had not sustained other injuries from his fall. His Glasgow coma scale was 15/15.\n\n|  Figure 1. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine revealed only arthritic changes, consistent with the patient’s age. |\n| --- |\n\n【5】He was transferred to a tertiary spine center for further investigation. A CT scan of the cervical spine was performed, which was negative for fracture or dislocation, but, on the other hand, revealed a periodontoid calcification, indicative of CDS . The patient denied any previous symptoms of neck pain, stiffness or neurological compromise. His MRI did not show any damage to the spinal cord or soft tissues. He had no fever but his WBC count and CRP were slightly elevated. Since he was admitted to hospital, course of corticosteroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) was started and he began to improve neurologically. After a few days he was dismissed with the instruction to use a cervical orthosis for 6 weeks and take common analgesics occasionally. At his follow-up, he was completely clear of signs and symptoms, so the cervical orthosis was discarded. Since then, 4 years after his accident, he has not complained for recurrent pain or functional impairment of his cervical spine.\n\n|  Figure 2.

The syndrome is more common in the elderly, particularly women after the age of 60 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Its clinical presentation includes acute neck pain with concomitant neck stiffness and possibly fever, while the inflammatory markers are often elevated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. It may be found in up to 5% of adults over the age of 70 who present to hospital due to neck pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The syndrome may not often give clinical manifestations, or may cause chronic neck pain or even spinal cord compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>. Also, it has been reported that calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition in and around atlantoaxial joint may cause fractures of the odontoid process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The differential diagnosis of the syndrome includes mainly meningitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, diskitis, tumor, abscess and giant cell arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Interestingly, the majority of patients with CDS have suffered from symptoms of pseudogout in other joints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 12 \\]</u>, a fact that supports that most commonly the syndrome is caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The etiology of this deposition is unknown, but it seems to be associated with increased levels of pyrophosphate in joints due to increased breakdown of adenosine triphosphate, while also genetic factors (gene ANKH) seem to be involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, other authors presented case series in which there is no correlation of CDS and crystal deposition in other joints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In CDS, periodontoid calcification, which is the principal finding in diagnostic imaging, is believed to be caused by deposition of crystals in the fibers of transverse ligament of the atlas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

This disease affects pancreas, salivary glands, artery, thyroid, lung, and many other organs. It remains controversial whether IgG4-related disease is associated with the risk of malignancy or not. In some studies, malignancy increased in IgG4-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> or only in autoimmune pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. On the contrary, a Japanese study could not find any difference in the incidence of total malignancies between 113 patients with IgG4-related disease and a general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Serum level of IgG4 elevates in most cases. Although the diagnosis is based on biopsy, it is sometimes difficult to obtain pathological specimen. The diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related disease are defined by the following three findings: clinical manifestations, elevated serum IgG4 level, and pathological characteristics. Clinical manifestations of IgG4-related disease are similar to cancer-related manifestations in some cases. In a UK study of 53 patients with IgG4-related disease, 22 patients (41.5%) were categorized as definite, highly probable or probable thoracic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The following four patterns of radiological manifestation have been described for IgG4-related lung disease: solid nodular, bronchovascular, alveolar interstitial, and round shaped ground-glass opacity type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These patterns mimic various lung diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial pneumonia and sarcoidosis.\n\n【3】Herein, we report a case of co-existence of pulmonary adenosquamous cell carcinoma and IgG4-related disease manifested by systemic lymphadenopathy, which confused our clinical staging and treatment strategy.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 75-year-old man with diabetes mellitus showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level at his regular visit. Computed tomography (CT) scan found a tumor in the left lower lobe, interstitial pneumonia , and systemic lymphadenopathy including peri-gastric and peri-pancreatic lymph nodes. Bronchoscopic biopsy pathologically diagnosed the lung tumor as a squamous cell carcinoma in the middle of July 2016.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showing (a) the primary tumor in the left lower lobe (shown by black arrow) and bilateral sub-pleural reticular shadows in the bilateral lower lobes, (b) the first acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia, remarkable shrinkage of (c, d) mediastinal and (e, f) peri-gastric lymphadenopathy (c, e) before steroid therapy (shown by white arrows, in the middle of September) and (d, f) during steroid tapering (in the late October). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic sonography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not detect abdominal malignancy. Enhanced brain CT did not find brain metastasis. Fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed abnormal uptake in the lung tumor in the left lower lobe (maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 4.7), and systemic lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa (SUVmax, 6.8), subaortic arch (SUVmax, 4.0), gastric cardia (SUVmax, 3.5), peri-pancreas (SUVmax, 4.3), superior mesenteric arterial root (SUVmax, 5.1) . Considering these findings, we diagnosed the lymphadenopathy as metastasis of lung cancer, and then planned chemotherapy for clinical stage IV cancer. However, acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia canceled the pre-planned chemotherapy in the middle of September . We immediately started intravenous pulse-steroid therapy at the dose of 1 g/day of methylprednisolone during the first consecutive 3 days, and thereafter gradually tapered steroid dose from 40 mg/day of prednisolone. During the steroid tapering, left pneumothorax suddenly occurred. Aspiration from two chest drainage tubes failed to control air leakage. Thus, we planned surgical approach for uncontrollable pneumothorax. Another CT scan before surgery revealed remarkable shrinkage of systemic lymph nodes . We doubted the decision of lymph nodes metastases at the initial staging, and then corrected C-staging from C-stage inferior vena cava (IVC) to C-stage inferior abdomen (IA) (cT <sub>1b </sub> N <sub>0 </sub> M <sub>0 </sub> ). We also found elevated IgG4 level (385 mg/dL), KL-6 (661 U/mL) and SP-D (407 ng/mL) in the serum obtained before the steroid pulse therapy, and then decreased IgG4 level (193 mg/dL) and SP-D (67.6 ng/mL), but stable KL-6 (675 U/mL) in the serum obtained during the steroid tapering and just before the subsequent operation. There was no radiological indication of IgG4-related disease in other organs. Curative-intent left lower lobe lobectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed for the lung cancer at the end of October. The pneumothorax was successfully cured and did not recur thereafter. The resected left lower lobe contained mainly squamous cell carcinoma with keratinization , partial component of adenocarcinoma , and interstitial pneumonia (favor for non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)) with marked lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration into interstitium of interlobular septal walls . Both resected lung and mediastinal lymph nodes contained epithelioid granulomas with necrosis, suggesting complication of pulmonary tuberculosis . Thereafter, mycobacterium tuberculosis was found to be negative in smear, but positive in culture of post-operative sputum specimen. Combination of four anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) started 18 days after the surgery. The resected mediastinal lymph nodes contained not only malignant cells  but also IgG4-positive plasma cells . We could not detect typical pathological findings of IgG4-related disease, such as obliterative phlebitis or storiform-fibrosis. Pathological staging was determined as pT <sub>2a </sub> N <sub>2 </sub> M <sub>0 </sub> . We detected 384 IgG4-positive cells per high power field, and IgG4/IgG-positive cell ratio was 54% . These findings confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. Infiltration of IgG4-positive cells was also seen in lung tissue of diffuse ground-glass opacity, suggesting IgG4-related interstitial pneumonia. Another acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia occurred 8 days after surgery. Despite of steroid therapy, the patient died 24 days after surgery in late November.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

IgG4: immunoglobulin G4. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】This was a rare case of co-existence of locally advanced pulmonary adenosquamous cell carcinoma and IgG4-related disease manifested by systemic lymphadenopathy. To our knowledge, there were only nine case reports of lung cancer concomitant with IgG4-related disease \\[ 8 \\- 16 \\] .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. A Review of English or Japanese Case Reports of Coexistence of Lung Cancer and IgG4-Related Disease |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】A unifying diagnostic criterion has not been established, because various organs are involved in this disease. The current diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based either on comprehensive or organ-specific diagnostic criteria. According to the comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease published in 2011 by the Japanese IgG4 team, organized by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, our case met the three diagnostic factors: chest imaging, serology and histology. Based on the eight weighted inclusion criteria domains, the third step of classification process, of the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism Classification Criteria for IgG4-related Disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, our case presented dense lymphocytic infiltrate (+4 points), the IgG4/IgG ratio 41-70% and the number of IgG4-positive cells/high power field > 10 cells (+14 points), and 2 - 5 × upper limit of normal serum IgG4 concentration (+6 points). Thus, our case exceeded the threshold of 20 points. In light of the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related respiratory disease proposed by Matsui et al in 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, our case met the chest imaging of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the elevated serum IgG4 concentration, marked lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration into interstitium of interlobular septal wall, and the IgG4/IgG-positive cell ratio > 40% and > 10 IgG4-positive cells/high power field. Thus, our case was a possible diagnosis of IgG4-related respiratory disease. The latter two diagnostic criteria were published after our patient was already dead or at the same time of our surgery, respectively. Despite of satisfaction of these various inclusion criteria, our case did not meet the exclusion criteria due to pulmonary comorbidities of lung cancer and tuberculosis. A significant correlation between malignancy and IgG4-related disease has indicated IgG4-related disease as a paraneoplastic syndrome, rather than an independent disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Furthermore, we could not completely exclude other similar diseases, because we did not examine various serological markers suggestive of another systemic autoimmune disease, vasculitis or sarcoidosis such as antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Thus, in the current and latest diagnostic criteria, our diagnosis was not enough for the strict definition of IgG4-related disease.\n\n【15】We thought it impossible to distinguish IgG4-related lymphadenopathy from lymph node metastases only by routine images of clinical staging. Either endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle biopsy (EBUS-TBNB) or mediastinoscopical biopsy should be considered aggressively for confusing lymphadenopathy. In our case, neither pre-staging enhanced CT scan nor FDG-PET could detect the underlying IgG4-related disease. As a result, the remarkable shrinkage of lymph nodes after unexpected steroid therapy reminded us of IgG4-related disease. Surgical resection finally determined the IgG4-related systemic lymphadenopathy, and then down-staged pre-surgical clinical staging from IV to IIIA. In fact, most previous cases required surgical biopsy for the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease . We oncologists have to keep in mind a malignancy mimicker, IgG4-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The second important finding was post-surgical acute exacerbation of IgG4-related lung disease, NSIP pattern. In a UK study, interstitial lung disease of NSIP pattern was observed in 22.7% of IgG4-related thoracic disease. In this study, among four dead patients with thoracic involvement, NSIP was considered to have contributed to the patient’s death in two cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. On the other hand, according to two Japanese nationwide surveys of 744 and 1,763 lung surgeries for lung cancer with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, the prevalence of acute exacerbation following surgery was 8.3% (in 62 cases) and 9.3% (in 164 patients ), and the mortality rate was 3.5% (in 26 cases) and 2.6% (in 46 cases), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Among seven independent risk factors of acute exacerbation identified in the previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, our case met at least four risk factors: surgical procedure of lobectomy, male gender, history of exacerbation and preoperative steroid use. We could not access percent vital capacity preoperatively. Thus, in terms of interstitial lung diseases, post-surgical acute exacerbation might be very likely in our case. There was no report of post-operative acute exacerbation and mortality in IgG4-related lung disease. Our case, in which acute exacerbation occurred soon after lung surgery, calls physicians’ attention to a risk of post-operative acute exacerbation.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion, our case alerts oncologists to IgG4-related disease as a possible underlying comorbidity which confuses pretreatment clinical staging and treatment strategy.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable because the manuscript has been sufficiently de-identified to protect the patient.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>S.

Portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis is the most common mechanism. Other causes are portal hypertension due to non-cirrhotic etiologies, peritoneal diseases, lymphatic obstruction, hypoalbuminemia and intra-abdominal organ leak (such as pancreatic acites).\n\n【2】Ascites is a common manifestation of hepatic venous outflow obstruction, i.e. Budd-Chiari syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, ascites due to external compression of the hepatic veins is a rare situation. It has been reported in adults in cases of abdominal trauma, solid tumors, cyst or abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】A hiatal hernia causing ascites by compressing the hepatic veins has been rarely reported in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, it was never reported in adults. We present a case report of an adult patient in whom a huge hiatal hernia contributed to formation of refractory ascites that improved significantly after surgical repair.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male was referred to the emergency room due to recurrent vomiting that started on the same day. Lately an increasing abdominal swelling was observed. The patient had moderate mental retardation and was a resident of a nursing home. His medical history included chronic constipation and a hiatal hernia. His regular medications were clothiapine, valproic acid and promethazine.\n\n【6】Few days previous to his admission, he was examined in the emergency room due to abdominal swelling and was diagnosed as suffering from an inguinal hernia. At that time his chest and abdominal X-rays showed bilateral pleural effusion, with small bilateral atelectasis and a large hiatal hernia without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation. An abdominal X-ray following oral contrast material administration revealed normal passage. The inguinal hernia was reduced and the patient was discharged.\n\n【7】On the day of his admission, the abdominal swelling increased and he started to vomit. On his arrival to the emergency room, his blood pressure was 145/70 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats/min, body temperature was 37.2 °C and the respiratory rate was 20/min. On physical examination, he was dyspneic, the jugular veins were mildly distended and the heart sounds were normal without murmurs or a friction rub. The lung examination was normal. The abdomen was swollen without guarding sings. An averted umbilicus was observed and shifting dullness was found. There was no leg edema and the peripheral arterial pulses were normal.\n\n【8】ECG showed low voltage sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, the axis was undetermined and otherwise there were no QRS or ST-T abnormalities. Blood electrolytes were normal, creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were 59 and 23 IU/L respectively. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were 89, 128 and 813 IU/L respectively. Pancreatic enzymes were normal, and albumin and globulin levels were 3.4 and 4.4 g/dL respectively. The hemoglobin level was 14.5 g/dL, and the total white blood cell (WBC) and platelets count were 10,800 and 428,000/μL respectively.\n\n【9】His chest and abdominal X-rays were as described above. The patient was hospitalized for further investigation. Due to dyspnea and large abdominal swelling, a large volume abdominal paracentesis, draining 7 L of ascetic fluid was conducted. The total cell count of the ascetic fluid was 460 cells/μL with 33% neutrophils. The albumin level of the peritoneal fluid was 1.8 g/dL, hence the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.6 g/dL. Fluid cultures were negative, and the cytological examination was normal.\n\n【10】Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative, and compliments levels were normal. The alphafetoprotein level was 14.1 ng/mL, and protein electroforesis showed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.\n\n【11】Echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular systolic function, without any valvular abnormalities. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. An extra cardiac lesion compressing the atria was identified.\n\n【12】A chest and abdominal contrast enhanced CT showed a huge hiatal hernia, compressing the thoracic inferior vena cava . The hepatic veins were patent, the liver and spleen were normal in texture and size, and the abdominal cavity contained a large amount of free fluid. A gastroscopy revealed a large hiatal hernia, with mild hypertensive gastropathy. Esophageal varices were not observed.\n\n|  Figure 1. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) - coronal view without IV contrast media showing huge hiatal hernia compressing the inferior vena cava in proximity to the confluence of hepatic veins. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】The wedge and free hepatic venous pressures were 17 and 13 mm Hg respectively, thus the hepatic venous pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg. A needle liver biopsy revealed a nodular pattern with venous congestion without significant fibrosis .\n\n|  Figure 2. Low power view - nodular configuration of the liver tissue without fibrosis. |\n| --- |\n\n|  Figure 3.

Dilated sinusoidal spaces are present. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】A right-sided heart catheterization was conducted. The mean right atrial was 17 mm Hg and a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium was found. The other measurements were within normal limits and no signs of pericardial constriction were observed.\n\n【19】Following abdominal paracentesis, a temporary improvement in the respiratory distress was observed. However, accumulation of ascites was rapid despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy and repeated procedures of large volume paracentesis were indicated.\n\n【20】At that point we concluded that obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, due to compression of the supra hepatic inferior vena cava by the huge hiatal hernia, contributed to the formation of the intractable ascites. Thus, a laparoscopic hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【21】During the first 2 months after surgery, despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy, the patient needed three more procedures of large volume paracentesis. On the third postoperative month, ascites accumulation was dramatically decreased without any need for further therapeutic paracentesis.\n\n【22】We followed the patient up to 3 years later. There were no signs of ascites on physical examination. Nevertheless, ascetic fluid was still detectable by abdominal ultrasound.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】The presented patient had ascites with a high serum - ascites albumin gradient, indicating that portal hypertension was the underlying etiology. A large ascites without the presence of esophageal varices implied that the mechanism was post sinusoidal obstruction.\n\n【25】The major cause of intrahepatic post sinusoidal obstruction is the hepatic “sinusoidal obstructive syndrome”. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia may rarely present as ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The histological findings were compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Nevertheless, this condition cannot explain the congestion of the jugular vein. Moreover, the rapid accumulation of ascetic fluid, recent to his admission, suggested another etiology. The cardiac echocardiogram and catheterization did not support a myocardial, valvular or pericardial pathology. Normally, there is no measurable pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. The finding of an external pressure on the right atrium combined with a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium led to the conclusion that the findings are due to external compression by the huge hiatal hernia. Therefore, hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【26】The hiatal hernia, most probably, was not the cause for the ascites formation but it was the cause of worsening ascites. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the hiatal hernia was known for many years, and that the ascites formation reduced dramatically following hernioplasty.\n\n【27】After the operation, the improvement had not evolved immediately but rather after few weeks. This sequence of events is not surprising. First, the patient had probably an underlying intra-hepatic post sinusoidal liver pathology that was not cured by the hernioplasty. Second, as after treating Budd-Chiari syndrome the improvement can be delayed due to structural changes of the liver tissue secondary to the extrahepatic venous obstruction. Nevertheless, in contrast to the preoperative refractory massive ascites, the patient remained with mild ascites detectable only by ultrasonography.\n\n【28】Portal hypertension caused by external compression of the inferior vena cava was reported in cases of trauma, malignancy or cysts. Hiatal hernia is a common medical condition. So is ascites. The combination of the two is known as well. Nevertheless, ascites worsened by a hiatal hernia was never reported in humans according to our best knowledge. Although rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of massive ascites and hiatal hernia.\n\n【29】Disclosure\n\n【30】All the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest and there is no funding support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The PCP initially suspected perichondritis and the patient was prescribed a course of Levaquin; however, due to a lack of improvement, the patient was referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon. The ENT surgeon felt that it was not an infectious cause and discontinued Levaquin; a 7-day course of steroids was given. With no improvement, the patient was seen by the university ENT surgeon on January 21, 2008 and an initial working diagnosis of auricular pseudocyst was made. The lesion was excised in early February of 2018 and pathology showed a high-grade sarcoma with positive margins. She then underwent a PET, MRI and CT scan. The PET scan showed enhancement around the left external auditory canal and jugular chain lymphadenopathy bilaterally. The MRI also showed enhanced superficial soft tissue intensity around the left external auditory canal consistent with a history of auricular sarcoma and the CT scan was also negative .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Lymphoscintigraphy revealed two to three nodes showing activity in the left neck which were to be removed along with excision of the sarcomatous lesion . Bone marrow flow cytometry FW18-177 was performed to assess the presence of metastatic cells in bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of metastatic disease, granulomata or lymphoid aggregates.

RMS has an overall survival rate of 70%, depending on the site, and has a survival rate as high as 90% in the orbital and neck regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. The head and neck location is the most common site for RMS and accounts for 35-50% of tumors. Rapid diagnosis and recognition of this rare disorder will facilitate long-term survival. However, ssRMS is commonly seen with the mean age at diagnosis of about 27 years and for alveolar RMS type is about 16 years and embryonal RMS is peaking at 7 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】There are primarily three cell types of RMS, embryonal, alveolar and pleomorphic. Alveolar is more aggressive, growing rapidly and more likely to metastasize. Embryonal RMS is the most common tumor type, comprising up to 80% of RMS malignancies, and is seen in children with an average age of 6 years. The embryonal type is subdivided into three histological subtypes. The botryoidal type is usually seen in mucosal sites and has a characteristic grape-like gross appearance. The spindle type consists of cells that have spindle morphology and is most commonly located in the orbital and para-testicular areas. Lastly the rare pleomorphic subtype is most commonly seen in extremity skeletal muscle in patient over the age of 45 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 11 \\]</u>. Microscopically, they are 1) round cells with eccentric eosinophilic cytoplasm, 2) spindle cell myoblasts with tapered fibrillary eosinophilic cytoplasm, and 3) anaplastic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】RMS is occasionally seen in patients with other genetic diseases such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Costello syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Symptoms and signs depend on tumor location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are primarily two histological types of RMS with genetic mutations that play a role in pathogenesis of this malignancy, the alveolar subtype and the embryonal subtype. The alveolar type a translocation between long arm of chromosome 2 and chromosome 13 referred to as t(2;13) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 12 \\]</u>. The location and size of the primary tumor and associated metastases determine the presenting symptoms and signs of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This cancer does not secrete any hormones or hormone-like peptides and is therefore not associated with any paraneoplastic syndromes.\n\n【13】The tumor is staged based on TNM classification using TNM and Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) using tumor (T), nodes (N) and metastases (M) to classify the RMS by stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In stage I, the tumor is localized without metastasis and usually involves the orbit, head, neck and genitourinary tract. Stage II tumor is less than 5 cm with no metastasis to lymph nodes or other distant sites. In stage III, the tumor is usually larger than 5 cm or smaller than 5 cm with spread to surrounding lymph nodes but no distant locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Lastly, stage IV involves metastases to other areas such as the bone marrow, liver, lung or bones. The lung is the most frequent site of metastasis followed by bone, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Visceral organ metastases are rare in newly diagnosed patients. The percentage of patients with histologically proven lymphatic metastases was highest for the prostate (41%), paratesticular sites (26%) and genitourinary sites overall (24%), whereas the percentage of patients with nodal metastases from extremity lesions was 12%. The primary tumor mean diameter was significantly larger in the group with nodal metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable staging technique and yield positive results. It was positive most commonly associated with alveolar RMS, followed by Ewing sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, epitheloid sarcoma and positive in one patient with embryonal RMS out of 29 patients’ studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The treatment usually consists of surgical excision with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine, dactinomycin (actinomycin-D) and cyclophosphamide. Other agents that have been used include ifosfamide, etoposide and doxorubicin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. It is usually given once a week for the first few months, with the total length of treatment lasting from 6 months to a year. Radiation therapy is administered with chemotherapy if there is incomplete resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Adherence to immunization schedule (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and oral polio vaccine) has been shown to have some protective effect preventing development of RMS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of RMS in offspring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】This case discussion is extremely important due to the rarity of spindle cell carcinoma. On a search of PubMed, there are no articles written discussing the occurrence and prognosis of the sclerosing spindle cell variant. While RMS is more common in males, this case discussion is of a 7-year-old female patient. In addition, spindle cell most commonly occurs in the orbital and para-testicular areas as opposed to the pre-auricular location seen in this patient. The spindle cell embryonal subtype is not known to metastasize to lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 17 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>. According to this case, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have resulted in a positive prognosis. A wider discussion needs to be focused on this variant of RMS to help determine the prognosis and treatment approach.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Any time a growing mass in the head and neck location is encountered, an aggressive approach must be taken and RMS must be on our differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with RMS give the best prognostic outlook. The tumor is sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy, after the early excision of the mass along with removal of involved nodes. Our case is unique with a diagnosis of spindle cell RMS discovered in the preauricular location in a female patient. Our objectives in reporting this unusual case is to increase awareness among practitioners and participate in formation of the database. Further research needs to be done to understand the pathology and spread of this subtype of RMS.\n\n【18】Financial Support\n\n【19】No grants or financial support received.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The patient reported experiencing burning, continuous pain in the epigastric region with a visual analog scale (VAS) rating of 4 - 5. The pain was not related to food, did not improve with rest or changes in position, and was accompanied by nausea and a decrease in appetite. There were no complaints of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. The patient had experienced intermittent joint pain in her hands and feet for 6 months prior to admission, which was relieved with painkillers and rest, but worsened with movement or strenuous activity. Urination was normal, occurring three to four times per day with a volume of approximately 100 - 120 mL, and there was no pain during urination. Defecation was initially normal, occurring once a day with solid, yellow stool. However, after 5 - 7 days of treatment, the patient complained of eight episodes of liquid defecation, with no reports of black or bloody stool. The patient also reported the appearance of reddish spots on her forearms that gradually spread to her palms without any associated pain or itching. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, allergies, joint disease, heart disease, kidney or liver disease, or miscarriage. There was no family history of similar complaints. The patient did not smoke, consume alcohol, or use herbal medicine or over-the-counter drugs. She was currently unemployed and spent most of her time at home caring for her children without engaging in heavy physical activity. The patient had noticed hair loss resulting in baldness on her head, especially in the past month.\n\n【5】The patient presented with various symptoms, including abdominal pain, joint pain, skin rash, and hair loss. The case highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation and investigation of all symptoms in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and proper management plan.\n\n【6】Physical examination\n\n【7】The patient was observed to have a general impression of moderate illness with normal nutritional status (weight 50 kg, height 155 cm, body mass index (BMI) 20.81 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). The patient was alert and oriented with a blood pressure of 99/59 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 117 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, an axillary temperature of 36.5 °C, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Examination of the head revealed a normocephalic head shape with pale conjunctiva and canker sores on the oropharyngeal mucosa, but no icteric sclera, facial rash, or papillary atrophy of the tongue. Examination of the neck revealed no increase in jugular venous pressure (JVP) in the axilla or inguinal region. Lung examination showed symmetrical hemithorax movements and left and right tactile fremitus, with sonorous percussion on both hemithoraxes and vesicular breath sounds in both lungs without wheezing or rhonchi. The cardiac examination revealed no signs of an enlarged heart, with normal heart sounds.\n\n【8】On abdominal examination, the patient had a flat abdominal wall, with normal peristaltic sounds on auscultation. The epigastric region was soft and tender on palpation, and the liver and spleen were not palpably enlarged. The percussion examination showed tympanic results, with no signs of ascites. Examination of the extremities showed warm scrotum with no pitting edema in the upper or lower extremities. There was tenderness and swelling in the joints of the hands and feet. Erythematous and scattered macules were found on the right and left palms and forearm, without any associated tenderness. On digital rectal examination, the anal sphincter tone was positive, and the mucosa was smooth, with no blood, mucus, melena, masses, or nodules found. The rectal ampulla did not collapse, and yellow stools were observed.\n\n【9】The physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the joints of the hands and feet, erythematous and scattered macules on the palms and forearm, and soft and tender epigastric region on palpation. The patient showed no signs of ascites, an enlarged heart, or pitting edema in the upper or lower extremities. The examination results highlight the importance of a comprehensive physical examination to identify potential symptoms and provide a more accurate diagnosis.\n\n【10】Laboratory findings\n\n【11】On November 27, 2020, laboratory examinations were conducted during her admission to the hospital. The results indicated that the patient’s hemoglobin was 7.0 mg/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 87.1 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) was 27.1 pg, and white blood cell was 3.120/µL. The patient’s lymphocytes were 23%, and thrombocytes was 179,000/µL. The blood sugar level was 80 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) was 56, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 15. The albumin level was 2.7 mg/dL, while the total bilirubin was 0.45, and the direct bilirubin was 0.15. Additionally, the patient’s blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 77.4, serum creatinine was 2.04, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 31.9 mL/min. The patient’s sodium level was 135 mmol/L and potassium was 4.11 mmol/L, while chloride was 105 mmol/L. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Furthermore, the patient’s uric acid level was 13 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1,936 U/L.\n\n【12】Peripheral blood morphology results showed that the patient had anemia suspected to be due to chronic disease accompanied by an inflammatory/infectious process. Urinalysis examination showed a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.020, protein levels at (+2), blood at (+3), and leukocyte esterase at (+2). Nitrite was not detected, while glucose, bilirubin, and ketones were found to be absent. The urine sediment obtained erythrocytes of 173, leukocytes of 323, bacteria of 863.8, and pathological cylinders of 4.96 (granular cylinder +3).\n\n【13】Radiographic findings\n\n【14】Radiographic findings on November 27, 2020, revealed a normal chest X-ray with normal heart size. Abdominal ultrasound conducted on November 12, 2020, showed evidence of gastritis and suspected bilateral renal parenchymal inflammation due to inflammation. However, no abnormalities were detected in the liver, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, or uterus.\n\n【15】Based on the results of the above examinations, the patient was diagnosed with SLE with manifestations of arthritis, mucocutaneous, hematology, vasculitis, and nephritis; normochromic normocytic anemia due to bleeding with differential diagnosis of chronic disease; urinary tract infection; acute renal failure with a differential diagnosis of chronic renal failure; hyperuricemia; hypoalbuminemia and ulcer-type dyspepsia. Further tests were conducted, and the patient was diagnosed with SLE with strenuous activity with a Mex-SLEDAI score of 15 (nephritis: 6; arthritis: 2; vasculitis: 4; mucocutaneous: 2; hematology: 1), based on strong positive antinuclear antibody (ANA, immunofluorescence (IF)) laboratory results, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) > 200 U/mL, C3 51 mg/dL, and C4 13 mg/dL. Hemolytic anemia was also traced with reticulocyte results of 0.79%, total bilirubin of 0.45 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.15 mg/dL, LDH of 1,936 U/L, negative direct and indirect comb tests.\n\n【16】The patient received treatment consisting of ampicillin sulbactam injection therapy of 1.5 g/8 h, omeprazole injection of 30 mg/24 h, ondansetron injection of 8 mg/8 h, sucralfate of 3 × 10 mL, paracetamol tablets of 3 × 500 mg, allopurinol tablet of 1 × 100 mg, injection of methylprednisolone at a dose of 62.5 mg/24 h, and 3 × 10 nystatin drops.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】The discussion centers on the possible causes of the patient’s abdominal pain, which may indicate mesenteric vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Vasculitis, an inflammatory process in the blood vessels that damages the structure of the blood vessel walls, is a common cause of acute abdominal pain in SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. While lupus mesenteric vasculitis (LMV) is prevalent in Asia and America, globally, it can range from 0.2% to 9.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The clinical manifestations of LMV include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. However, in the patient’s case, there is a complaint of continuous burning pain in the epigastrium that does not improve with rest, change of position, or eating. Other symptoms include nausea, decreased appetite, and diarrhea lasting for 3 days, but there is no mucus or blood in the stool.\n\n【19】Upon physical examination of the patient, epigastric tenderness was observed, which may indicate the presence of dyspepsia, a condition that can either be functional (psychogenic) or organic (gastritis, hemorrhagic gastritis, duodenitis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or malignant process). In order to eliminate this possibility, the patient was referred to the psychosomatic department with a suspicion of psychogenic dyspepsia and psychogenic acute watery diarrhea. Furthermore, the patient’s abdominal pain was also suspected to be caused by peptic ulcer-type organic dyspepsia. However, endoscopy, which is considered the definitive test for the confirmation of peptic ulcer, was not performed. Despite this, the diagnosis can still be confirmed through observation with a therapeutic approach during treatment. The working diagnosis was mixed type dyspepsia.\n\n【20】Confirmation of the diagnosis of mesenteric vasculitis often requires the use of imaging tests, with abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan being the preferred modality of investigation. Such scans can reveal characteristic findings, including thickening of the intestinal wall, target sign, obstruction of the mesenteric wall, and increased attenuation of mesenteric fat, among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Despite its utility, the patient in this case did not undergo an abdominal CT scan due to concerns regarding the diagnosis leading to vasculitis based on epidemiological findings, which pointed towards a similar presentation. Persistent abdominal pain, which was unresponsive to proton pump inhibitors and in the context of established SLE, was suggestive of vasculitis of the intestinal blood vessels.\n\n【21】This case significantly underscores the diagnostic challenges in patients with SLE presenting with common symptoms, such as abdominal pain. This can be attributed to the diverse range of potential causes, extending from benign conditions like dyspepsia to severe complications such as mesenteric vasculitis. This calls for a comprehensive and systematic approach to differential diagnosis, reiterating the need for diagnostic vigilance, particularly in patients with complex autoimmune diseases such as SLE. In this instance, the patient’s diagnosis was made despite the absence of standard diagnostic procedures such as an abdominal CT scan or endoscopy, which would usually be paramount in confirming the diagnosis of gastrointestinal issues. This case brings to light the importance of flexibility in managing patients where such procedures are not feasible. Thus, the role of symptom observation, therapeutic management, and laboratory tests in confirming the diagnosis was brought to the fore, highlighting that a judicious blend of these elements can compensate for the lack of direct imaging diagnostics, providing valuable insight for clinicians managing similar cases.\n\n【22】A noteworthy aspect of this case was the patient’s positive response to pulse-dose methylprednisolone treatment. This indirect evidence proved to be a valuable pointer towards the diagnosis of mesenteric vasculitis. Further confirmation of vasculitis was obtained through arteriography, which revealed abnormal findings consistent with vasculitis.\n\n【23】The case provides an example of how therapeutic responses can help guide the diagnosis in challenging situations, further emphasizing the role of observation and adaptability in the clinical approach.\n\n【24】The patient’s laboratory criteria showed an elevated D-dimer level of 784 ng/mL, suggesting the possibility of abdominal thrombosis, which is a clinical manifestation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. APS is an acquired autoimmune thrombophilic disease that can vary from asymptomatic to severe and life-threatening (catastrophic APS (CAPS)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of APS requires meeting at least one clinical and one laboratory criterion. However, based on the Sapporo criteria, the syndrome of antiphospholipid antibodies could not be demonstrated in the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The etiology of the patient’s abdominal pain was evaluated through observation and therapeutic management. In the context of SLE, abdominal pain warrants consideration of LMV as a primary diagnosis given its emergent nature and potential for serious complications. The diagnosis of LMV was established through a combination of clinical examination, laboratory tests, and abdominal CT scans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. While an abdominal CT scan was not performed in this case due to the patient’s response to pulse-dose methylprednisolone treatment and the impracticality and expense of CT scans, the diagnosis of LMV was still confirmed. Endoscopy was not utilized to confirm a diagnosis of dyspepsia due to the feasibility and efficiency of using a therapeutic approach during treatment to observe patient response and manage symptoms.\n\n【26】Learning points\n\n【27】The learning points from this case report emphasize the importance of considering and promptly investigating the potential causes of abdominal pain in patients with SLE, given the potential for rare but severe complications such as mesenteric vasculitis. Clinicians should be aware of the diverse clinical manifestations of SLE and its challenging diagnosis, particularly in patients receiving steroid therapy or immunosuppression, which may mask the true clinical features. In this case, the patient’s abdominal pain was thoroughly evaluated through observation, therapeutic management, and laboratory tests, and the diagnosis of LMV was confirmed despite the absence of an abdominal CT scan. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing abdominal pain in patients with SLE, taking into account the wide range of potential etiologies and the significance of timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】This case report underscores the intricacies and challenges of diagnosing SLE with rare manifestations, such as mesenteric vasculitis. The patient’s persistent abdominal pain, despite being a common symptom, pointed towards a more severe underlying condition, requiring meticulous diagnostic evaluation. The case further amplifies the importance of a comprehensive and dynamic approach to diagnosis, especially when standard diagnostic procedures, like abdominal CT scans or endoscopy, are not feasible. This approach entails a combination of clinical examination, thorough investigation of symptoms, and strategic therapeutic management. Despite the absence of these standard procedures, a successful diagnosis was made, reinforcing the importance of clinical acumen and adaptability in managing complex autoimmune diseases like SLE. Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the diversity of SLE presentations and the potential for severe, uncommon complications, which necessitates a high degree of suspicion and a flexible, patient-centered approach to diagnosis and management.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ayu Paramaiswari conceived and designed the case report and collected data.

The malignancy features a distinctive histologic pattern which includes a malignant component with squamous differentiation, as well as a characteristic lymphoid-rich stroma from which the malignancy takes its name 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since its original description from the nasopharyngeal region, a series of cancers with similar histologic features and a lymphoid-rich stroma have been described in a multitude of other organs, including lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, uterine cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. These carcinomas have been included under the broad umbrella of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELCs). In addition to sharing many similar histologic features with lymphoepithelioma, many of the LELCs also share an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Case reports and series examining the LELCs have suggested the malignancies have a better prognosis than non-LELC malignancies in the same organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-8 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Primary LELC of the liver is an exceedingly rare entity, and to this point very few cases have been described in the literature. In the cases that have been reported, histologic features resembling both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Here, we report three cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】An 89-year-old previously asymptomatic female presented to her primary care physician with right upper quadrant pain in July 2011. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.6 cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver. The patient has a past medical history of hepatitis C viral infection diagnosed 16 years prior to presentation, breast cancer diagnosed 20 years prior to presentation, and a history of “colon polyps” 9 years prior to presentation. An abdominal MRI confirmed the presence of a heterogeneous enhancing mass in segment VIII of the liver, measuring 5.2 cm in greatest dimension and showing regions of central necrosis. The background liver showed features suggestive of early cirrhosis, with atrophy of the right, left and caudate lobes. The hepatic vasculature was patent, and no additional abnormalities were seen. Liver enzymes performed at the time of presentation to our institution revealed normal values for ALT (19 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), AST (36 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (84 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), and total bilirubin (0.5 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL). Hepatitis C viral RNA quantification by PCR was positive at 297,000 IU/mL. The patient’s serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was markedly elevated at 1,054.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 11 ng/mL). Based on the findings, the decision was made to proceed with surgical resection. Prior to the procedure, the patient underwent embolization of the right portal vein, which was followed by a right hepatectomy during which a 410 g segment of the patient’s right liver lobe was excised.\n\n【6】Upon gross examination of the resection specimen, a single mass was identified, measuring 5.1 cm in greatest dimension . The mass was well-circumscribed, soft, and white, with a bulging cut surface. Necrosis comprised approximately 20% of the mass (not photographed). Wire coils and rubbery beads, relics of the preoperative embolization, were identified in the vasculature (not photographed). A hemorrhagic area was noted near the tumor, likely secondary to embolization of the right portal vein. No additional masses were identified. The background liver showed no evidence of cirrhosis on macroscopic examination .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Gross photograph of right hepatectomy specimen from an 89-year-old female patient with a solitary liver mass. A 5.1 cm well-circumscribed, soft, white mass was present within the resection specimen. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】On histologic sections, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells . There was no evidence of large vein invasion but microscopic lymphovascular invasion was identified. No conventional HCC component was identified. The background liver showed a chronic hepatitis of mild activity with portal and periportal fibrosis (Batts and Ludwig: grade 2/4, stage 1-2/4) without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. There was no evidence of iron deposition on Perl’s Prussian blue iron stain or alpha 1 antitrypsin inclusion on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain with diastase digestion. Immunohistochemical studies through use of a battery of antibodies including hepatocyte (HepPar-1, OCH1E5, 1:800, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); CD3 (2GV6, prediluted, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ); CD20 (L26, 1:25, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); CD4 (1FC, 1:10, Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK); CD8 (1A5, 1:10, Biogenex, Fremont, CA); TIA-1 (TIA-1, prediluted, Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA); CD138 (BC/B-B4, 1:200, Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA), and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER CISH, ISH I-VIEW Blue Plus kit, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ), as well as kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains (kappa light chain messenger RNA and lambda light chain messenger RNA, performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ). The malignant cells showed focal positivity for HepPar-1, supporting their hepatocellular origin. The lymphoid population showed a subpopulation of CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, as well as a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population. The T-cell population consisted of both CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes and CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells which also showed staining for T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). The cytotoxic T cells predominantly consisted of the intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes located within the malignancy itself . A CD138 stain highlighted the plasma cell component of the lymphoid infiltrate; however, the plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Chromogenic in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA was negative in both the lymphoid cells and the malignant cells. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of “HCC with a dense lymphoid stroma (hepatocellular lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma), stage II (according to AJCC cancer staging manual, the 7th edition)” was considered. The patient is alive without recurrence at 38 months after surgery.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

A liver biopsy 10 years ago showed chronic hepatitis with moderate lobular activity and mild periportal fibrosis. One year prior to presentation the patient had undergone an esophagectomy for intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Liver function tests performed at the time revealed normal values for ALT (18 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), AST (21 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (81 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), and total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL). Serology test performed at the time showed negative hepatitis B viral DNA, negative Hep B surface antigen, negative HBV E antigen, negative HBV E antibody, positive HBV surface antibody and positive HBV core antibody. The patient’s serum AFP level was elevated at 305.5 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 11 ng/mL). No additional serum tumor markers were performed. This liver lesion was biopsied and showed HCC with a rich lymphoid stroma. Based on these findings, the patient underwent a left lobectomy.\n\n【13】Upon gross examination of the resection specimen (measuring 11.7 × 11.1 × 3.0 cm and weighing 170 g), a single mass was identified, measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension. The mass was well-circumscribed, soft, and white. A hemorrhagic area (0.8 × 0.7 cm) was noted near the tumor. No additional masses were identified. The background liver showed no evidence of cirrhosis on macroscopic examination.\n\n【14】On histologic section, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. No conventional HCC component was identified. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells. The background liver showed a chronic hepatitis of mild activity with minimal portal fibrosis without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. There was no evidence of iron deposition on Perl’s Prussian blue iron stain or alpha 1 antitrypsin inclusion on PAS stain with diastase digestion.\n\n【15】Immunohistochemical studies (performed on the liver mass biopsy specimen) revealed that the malignant cells showed focal positivity for HepPar-1 supporting their hepatocellular origin. The tumor demonstrated membranous and canalicular staining pattern for polyclonal CEA, but was negative for MOC31 and CK7, in line with its hepatocellular origin. The lymphoid population showed a subpopulation of CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, as well as a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population. The T-cell population consisted of both CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes and CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells which also showed staining for TIA-1. The cytotoxic T cells predominantly consisted of the intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes located within the malignancy itself. The plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Chromogenic in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA was negative both in the lymphoid cells and the malignant cells. Based on these findings in the biopsy and resection specimens, a diagnosis of “HCC with a dense lymphoid stroma (lymphoepithelioma-like HCC), stage I (according to AJCC cancer staging manual, the 7th edition)” was considered. The patient received no further HCC-specific treatment and is alive without recurrence 26 months after surgery.\n\n【16】Case 3\n\n【17】A 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C infection of approximately 20 years and was noted to have an elevated AFP level at 45.1 ng/mL. An abdominal MRI study revealed two T2 intense liver lesions (5.6 cm and 1.6 cm) in the right lobe of the liver. There were no accompanying symptoms such as jaundice, ascites, or GI bleeding. There was no documented history of alcohol abuse. The patient has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of 5-year duration and cholelithiasis status post cholecystectomy 2 years ago. Liver tests performed at the time revealed a normal value for ALT (45 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), a slight increase in AST (62 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase (159 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), normal value for total bilirubin (0.6 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL), a decrease in total protein (5.3 ng/dL, normal range: 6.0 - 8.4 g/dL) and albumin (3.1 g/dL, normal range: 3.5 - 5.0 ng/dL). The patient had normal serum alpha 1 antitrypsin level at 187 mg/dL (normal range: 100 - 220 mg/dL). Hepatitis C viral RNA quantification by PCR was positive, at 426,000 IU/mL. Needle biopsy of the larger liver mass was performed.\n\n【18】On histologic sections of the liver mass biopsy, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells. There was no non-neoplastic liver parenchyma present for the evaluation of background liver disease. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the malignant cells were positive for HepPar-1, supporting their hepatocellular origin. The tumor cells also demonstrated membranous and canalicular staining pattern for polyclonal CEA. The plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Based on the overall findings, the liver mass was diagnosed as HCC with a rich lymphoid stroma.\n\n【19】Because of the patient’s severe COPD and the HCC being beyond Milan criteria, the decision was made to proceed with locoregional therapy with chemoembolization. The patient died of disease at 31 months after the diagnosis of HCC despite the treatment.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】The clinicopathologic features of rare HCCs with marked lymphocytic infiltration have been documented in case reports and series in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>, the largest of which comprised 11 cases examined by Wada et al in 1998 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In 2000, Emile et al published a small case series that examined five cases of what the author termed “HCCs with lymphoid stroma”, or hepatocellular CLS, likely corresponding to the cases of HCC with marked lymphocytic infiltration previously described by the Japanese publications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The following year, Szekely argued that the entities described by Emile were indistinguishable from the LELCs described in multiple other organ systems, and advocated terming the liver malignancies as LELCs in order to emphasize their similarities to those previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In the intervening years, additional case reports have been published detailing findings consistent with those initially described by Emile et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs remain a rare entity. Our current report adds three additional cases to the existing literature. It should be noted that cases of cholangiocarcinoma with components of LELC have also been documented arising in the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 15-18 \\]</u>; these lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinomas were not included in this review. The detailed literature review of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC is summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 , 13 , 18-23 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Literature Review of Lymphoepithelioma-Like Hepatocellular Carcinoma |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【23】The three patients described in our series had documented hepatitis C (two cases) and hepatitis B viral infection (one case), a finding which is consistent with the cases previously described in literature. None of our cases had evidence of cirrhosis. Of the 27 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC described in literature, 21 patients (78%) demonstrated seropositivity for either hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or in one case, hepatitis B and C viral infection . In addition, four other cases of LELC arose in patients with a documented history of underlying liver disease, including hereditary hemochromatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, previous HCC status post right lobectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, alcohol use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u> and Clonorchis infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Only two cases of LELC have been documented as arising in the absence of hepatitis viral infection or underlying liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 21 \\]</u>. However, despite the presence of underlying liver injury in 25 of the 27 documented cases of LELC (93% of cases), 48% of reported cases (13/27), including all three cases described in this paper, lacked either gross, histologic, or clinical evidence of cirrhosis . Whether underlying liver disease, viral or otherwise, can be considered an etiologic factor for LELCs of the liver has yet to be determined. The absence of cirrhosis in 13 of the 27 (48%) described cases, however, demonstrates that LELCs have the potential to develop in non-cirrhotic livers, with or without a documented underlying liver disease.\n\n【24】EBV infection has long been acknowledged as playing a role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and EBER CISH performed on these malignancies show a characteristic strong positivity in nearly all of the malignant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The association of EBV with LELCs of various organ systems, however, is less distinct. In a literature review performed by Iezonni and colleagues in 1994, LELCs of the salivary gland, thymus, lung and stomach demonstrated positivity for EBV. In contrast, LELCs of the uterine cervix, bladder, skin and breast were negative for EBV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Subsequent case reports which described LELCs in additional organ systems have demonstrated EBV positivity in LELCs of the esophagus, colon and rectum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Of the 27 cases of liver LELC reviewed in Table 1 , 15 cases were evaluated for the presence of EBV. Thirteen of the 15 cases (87%) were negative for EBV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 18-23 \\]</u>. Only two cases demonstrated EBV positivity within lymphoepithelioma-like HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Of the two EBV-positive cases, one showed focal differentiation of cholangiocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>; EBV positivity has previously been demonstrated in lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 15-17 \\]</u>. The ultimate role of EBV in the pathogenicity of these and other LELCs remains unclear, and the fact that the majority of lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs reported in the literature arose in its absence indicate it is not the major etiologic factor in their development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】On review of LELCs of various organ systems, it has become generally accepted that LELCs carry a better prognosis than comparable malignancies in the same organ systems. In the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, uterine cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, studies have reported favorable prognoses when compared to non-LELC malignancies, and this finding has been described in HCCs as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 24 \\]</u>. As the number of reported lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs remains small, the evaluation of prognostic implications is limited. Of the 27 cases of LELC including 24 published cases and three cases described in this report, 25 had follow-up data available for review. With follow-up periods ranging in length from 4.5 months to 8 years, including one case with an unknown length of follow-up, 21 of the 25 patients (84%) were alive without recurrence of disease, while one (4%) was alive with recurrence . Of the four cases where the patient died of their disease, one developed multiple recurrences following liver transplant and died shortly thereafter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>; one developed metastatic disease to parapancreatic and para-aortic lymph nodes, progressed to hemoperitoneum, and died 21 months following right lobectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>; one had a previously documented history of HCC and had undergone right hepatectomy 2 years prior to liver transplant, died at 7.7 years after liver transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>; and one had progressive disease and died 31 months following chemoembolization treatment alone. Among the four patients who died of disease, one had EBV-positive LELC which had metastasized to a portal lymph node and this patient developed recurrence and died shortly after liver transplant. It remains to be determined whether the immunosuppressant status post-transplantation accelerates the recurrence of the disease. In addition, of the four patients who died of disease, one had tumor beyond Milan criteria at the time of diagnosis (case 27, our current report) and received chemoembolization treatment only. It has been suggested that the accumulation of inflammatory cells at the site of LELCs may contribute to their observed favorable prognoses, representing a localized immune response to the malignant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 10 , 25 \\]</u>. In studies that have characterized the lymphoid component of LELCs in various organ systems, a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population has been described, which has been observed to be associated with co-expression of cytotoxic markers including CD8 and TIA-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 19-20 , 23 \\]</u>; these findings were also observed in the cases described in our report.\n\n【26】In summary, we have reported three cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC arising in patients with chronic, non-cirrhotic, viral hepatitis. Given the small number of these malignancies that have been described, many aspects of these tumors, including etiologic agents, remain unknown. Based on previously described cases of hepatocellular LELCs, the malignancies appear to carry a favorable prognosis when compared to classical HCCs, and therefore warrant recognition as a unique entity distinct from conventional HCC. However, further conclusions on the pathogenesis and prognosis of these malignancies would require additional studies in larger cohorts.\n\n【27】Financial Support\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【30】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In our child factor VII assays showed a level of less than 3 IU/dL in utero resulting in intracranial hemorrhage. However factor VII levels increased spontaneously without treatment and although she continued to have an abnormal clotting profile with a raised PTT, there have been no symptoms of bruising or bleeding in the postnatal period.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A baby girl was born at 39 weeks to non-consanguineous parents by emergency section for fetal distress in a good condition with a birth weight of 2.3 kg. The baby was noted to have a paucity of movement of the left side of the body and was diagnosed to have left sided hemiplegia subsequently. Antenatally, an ultrasound scan done at 22 weeks showed right ventriculomegaly with caudothalamic groove atrophy, which was thought to represent earlier hemorrhage. Antibody titers for toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes infections were negative. The fetal blood sampling showed a normal platelet count. Maternal platelet counts were normal and there was no history of maternal intake of aspirin, antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants or any other drug ingestion. Functional factor VII assay performed antenatally, demonstrated a factor VII level of less than 3 IU/dL (normal range > 50 IU/dL). Cytogenetic analysis of the amniotic fluid revealed a terminal deletion of chromosome 13 with a breakpoint at 13q33.3 (46XX del 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u> (q33.3) ish del 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u> (q33.3) (wcp13+, D13S327-)). The genotype was confirmed in the postnatal period. A probe for the subtelomeric region of chromosome 13 (D13S327) demonstrated a small distal long arm deletion in the anomalous chromosome. A cytogenetic analysis performed on both the parents did not reveal any abnormalities.\n\n【5】Functional factor assays performed in the postnatal period showed an increase in the factor VII level to 8 IU/dL from an antenatal assay level of less than 3 IU/dL. At 3 months of age her factor VII levels spontaneously rose to 35 IU/dL. There was no history of bruising epistaxis or bleeding during childhood. The factor X assay was subsequently within the normal range.\n\n【6】The dysmorphic features comprised of prominent forehead, triangular face, almond shaped eyes with upslanting palpable fissures, mild ptosis, high nasal root, hypoplastic alae nasi with prominent columella, thin upper lip, downturned corners of the mouth, and a small pointed chin . She also developed swelling of both lower limbs, which progressively increased with time. A series of abdominal ultrasounds showed no evidence for obstruction of the inferior vena cava. A clinical diagnosis of lymphedema praecox was made.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Nissen’s fundoplication was performed at 8 years of age. The surgical procedure was not associated with abnormal bleeding. She was subsequently noted to gain excessive weight. At 10 years of age, the patient’s body mass index (BMI) was 29.5 (+3.07 standard deviation score) with microcephaly (below 0.4th centile).\n\n【9】Endocrine investigations to identify the cause of obesity including a 24-h glucose and cortisol profile, urinary steroid profile, adrenal androgens, thyroid function tests, and baseline pituitary function tests were within normal limits. An oral glucose tolerance test showed evidence of insulin insensitivity  with the peak plasma insulin level of 170 mU/L at 30 min and peak plasma glucose of 124 mg/dL. She was commenced on metformin at a dose of 500 mg twice daily and follow-up of 12 months did not reveal any significant benefit.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1.

While distal deletions are closely associated with severe phenotypes, proximal deletions tend to cause fewer major anomalies, with the exception of retinoblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In our patient, the deletion occurred before the coding region for factor VII, with the break point occurring at 13q33.3 . This possibly led to antenatally detected very low levels of factor VII leading to intracranial hemorrhage. This is the first case report of 13q deletion associated with factor VII deficiency leading to antenatal stroke. Interestingly the factor VII levels improved spontaneously in the postnatal period. The reason for this fluctuation in the factor VII levels remains unclear. In addition to factor VII deficiency, the deletion of COL4A1 (OMIM 120130) and COL4A2 (OMIM 120090) genes, which have been mapped to chromosome 13q33.3-34  could have contributed to the hemorrhagic stroke in the antenatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 2. Genes Mapping to Chromosome 13q33.3-34 (Ensembl/Biomart) |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】The human insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) (OMIM 600797) is localized on chromosome 13q34 . This gene encodes the IRS2, a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that mediates effects of insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and other cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Homozygous deletion of IRS2 in mice is known to generate insulin resistance which is particularly pronounced in liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Mice lacking IRS2 develop diabetes due to peripheral insulin resistance, failed hypothalamic regulation of appetite and β-cell insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Our patient had a heterozygous deletion of IRS2 gene  which we postulate to be the cause of insulin resistance. Our patient has mobility issues that reduce the calorie expenditure in addition to the behavioral difficulties that make calorie restriction very difficult. These factors in association with the genetic predisposition for insulin resistance due to IRS2 deletion possibly act together in contributing to the obesity.\n\n【16】Primary lymphedema (lymphedema praecox), a disorder causing persistent swelling in an extremity, is rare in childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The influences of estrogen and inflammation are thought to be important etiologic factors in primary lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This is the first case report of lymphedema praecox in association with 13q deletion. She did not have any other cause like trauma, illness, pelvic mass or surgery that could have contributed to the lymphedema. No genetic etiology for lymphedema praecox has been identified so far; hence the exact genetic link between 13q deletion and lymphedema is not clear.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】While 13q deletion syndromes are well recognized, this is the first reported case report of antenatal, hemorrhagic stroke secondary to factor VII deficiency. In the index case, the deletion has occurred just before the coding region for factor VII leading to intracranial hemorrhage antenatally. A combination of genetic (deletion of IRS2) and environmental factors (diet and exercise) possibly contributes to the obesity and insulin resistance. This is the also first case report of lymphedema praecox in association with 13q deletion.\n\n【19】Competing Interests\n\n【20】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Since the pain gradually increased, the patient visited our out-patient clinic 1 year after the onset.\n\n【5】Physical examination revealed an elastic hard, ill-defined mass in the right inguinal region. The mass was 2 × 1 cm in size and its mobility was poor. The skin color overlying the mass was normal . Radiographs of the pelvis were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken during her menstruation revealed a mass, measuring 2 × 1 cm, in the subcutaneous tissue in front of the right superior pubic ramus. This mass showed iso-signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and on T2-weighted images, the mass showed iso-signal intensity with partial high-signal intensity area , suggesting desmoid, or other soft tissue tumors.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

A diagnosis of endometriosis was made. Microscopically, a band-like structure was a dense fibrous tissue around the gland.

Most patients with endometriosis are asymptomatic, but some of them have infertility, menstrual irregularities, menorrhagia, low abdominal pain or low back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The occurrence of symptoms and growth of the endometriosis depend on estrogen. Therefore, periodic increase of symptom intensity associated with menstruation can occur. The current patient complained that the intensity of the symptom periodically increased during menstruation, although we did not notice before the histological diagnosis. Although endometriosis is usually found in intrapelvic structures such as ovaries, pelvic peritoneum or Douglas pouch, extrapelvic endometriosis is relatively uncommon. Extrapelvic endometriosis can occur in the ileum, jejunum, pleura, lung, palm, forearm, and peripheral nerve. Endometriosis that occurred in the pleura is famous as the catamenial pneumothorax. Operative scar after cesarean section has the potential to be an endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-5 \\]</u>. In the current case, the patient did not have any Cesarean section nor operation around the inguinal region. In extrapelvic endometriosis, those occurring in the inguinal subcutaneous tissue are extremely rare. Candiani et al reported that the incidence of endometriosis in the inguinal region was 0.6% in all extrapelvic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is difficult, in inguinal region, to diagnose a soft tissue mass as the extrapelvic endometriosis.\n\n【14】Clausen and Nielsen reported the largest series of endometriosis in the inguinal region, including 30 cases. In 27 of the 30 cases, the lesion occurred on the right side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In other literature, the right side was predominant, and two-thirds of the cases occurred around the round ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Similarly, the lesion in the current case was on the right side, and ligamentous structure was observed in the surgical specimen. Hagiwara et al reported two cases of inguinal subcutaneous endometriosis attaching to the round ligament of the uterus. They mentioned there had been continuity between the lesion and right round ligament of the uterus, but no association with inguinal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In previous reports, endometriosis usually appears as a high signal intensity lesion on T1-weighted images, owing to depositing of methemoglobin. On T2-weighted images, high signal intensity is common; however, diffuse hemosiderin deposition reflecting cyclic hemorrhage can result in low signal intensity appearance. Shading or variable loss of signal intensity on T2-weighted images is a frequent feature of endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11-13 \\]</u>. In the current case, the mass showed iso-signal intensity both on T1- and T2-weighted images. In addition, the mass showed partial high signal intensity area on T2-weighted images. Since the appearance of an endometriosis on MRI is variable, diagnosis of endometriosis by MRI is considered to be difficult. The importance of biopsy for correct diagnosis should be stressed.

On rectal examination, it was identified an ulcerated rectal mass, on the anterior wall of the rectum. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed an ulcerated, hard and friable tumor located on the anterior surface of the distal rectum . The biopsy revealed a high-grade GIST. The patient was subjected to a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a tumorous formation in the rectum, with no densification of the fat of the ischiorectal space or pelvic lymphadenopathy . The pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results showed a 5.1 × 3.1 cm mass in the rectovaginal space with origin in the anterior wall of the rectum, 2.9 cm from the anal verge with presumably non-epithelial origin and no apparent local invasion .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The proliferative index (assessed with Ki67) was around 60-70%.\n\n【11】On multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was proposed to adjunctive therapy with imatinib.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】GIST represents 80% of mesenchymal tumors. They are relatively rare, constituting 1-3% of all malignant gastrointestinal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The organs most often affected are the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%). The other locations are duodenum (5%), colon and rectum (5%) and esophagus and appendix (< 1%). Rarely, they can be found in extra-luminous locations such as mesentery, omentum and retroperitoneum (< 5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Rectal GISTs are more predominant in males and are more frequent between the fifth and seventh decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】This type of tumor originates in interstitial cells of Cajal, located in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal wall, which act as gastrointestinal motility regulators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Approximately 10-30% are clinically malignant; however, all of them have some potential degree of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】GISTs are associated with two mutations: the mutation of the c-kit proto-oncogene (responsible for the expression of the CD117 protein, a receptor for the tyrosine kinase growth factor) and the mutation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) gene. These mutations are present in 80-85% of patients (75-80% c-kit and 10-15% PDGFRA ). The GISTs that do not have these mutations are classified as “wild type”, this one with better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Most patients are asymptomatic. In rectum, although rare, obstruction or hemorrhage may be present.\n\n【17】The diagnosis follows the principles of diagnosis of any rectal mass, using imaging exams (endoscopy, CT scan and pelvic MRI scan) and biopsy.\n\n【18】Usually, the GIST is endoscopically characterized as a bulging of the wall, with normal mucosa or eventual mucosal ulceration, with solid consistency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The diagnosis includes CT scan with intravenous contrast, in order to identify distant metastatic disease. Locally they present as a well-circumscribed region of contrast, with heterogeneous enhancement, particularly if it is a large GIST with necro-hemorrhagic areas or degenerative components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Pelvic MRI scan allows locoregional staging. The lesions are usually described as well-defined solid masses, and some of them may have central necrosis, presenting with a diffuse hyposignal at T1 and hypersignal at T2. Post-contrast gain is homogeneous in the solid region, forming a ring around central necrosis.\n\n【21】Signs of malignancy include ulceration, irregular margins and increased dimensions on follow-up exams 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Biopsy is particularly important in the characterization of the tumor, namely in the differential diagnosis with rectal adenocarcinoma (in the case of ulcerated GIST), whose management are different. The final diagnosis is established according to the specific histological and immunohistochemical characteristics (CD117, CD34, actin, desmin, S-100 and Ki67). Sometimes, the biopsy is not conclusive since it is a neoplasm originated in the deeper layers of the rectum, which, if not biopsied, there is no representative sample.\n\n【23】The standard treatment of non-metastatic GIST involves complete resection of the tumor, with free margins, without rupture of the capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In the case of rectal GIST, the purpose of surgery, in addition to local tumor resection, is when possible, the sphincters preservation. The spread does not usually involve regional ganglion metastases, so regional lymphadenectomy is unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】There are several surgical techniques described, from conventional transanal resection (Parks), trans-sacral approach (Kraske), transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS), laparoscopic and laparotomic surgery (anterior resection of the rectum, abdominal-perineal amputation) \\[ 13 \\- 17 \\]. The method of choice is decided according to the characteristics of the tumor (size, extent, location) and according to the surgeon’s preferences.\n\n【25】The resection of tumors of the anterior wall of the rectum is technically more difficult. The transvaginal approach is a possible method for local tumor excision when located in the rectovaginal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. It is an alternative to a low or ultralow anterior resection surgery, which has a higher risk of complications. Transvaginal resection is a valid approach due to the large volume of the vagina, which is enough to support the resection.\n\n【26】In our case, enucleation without fragmentation of the piece was not possible. However, the entire lesion was macroscopically resected, and that constitutes one of the most important factors for the prognosis.\n\n【27】In large tumors and in those that have a high risk of metastases, preoperative treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib is recommended to decrease tumor volume, improve intact resection with negative margins, sphincter preservation and increase disease-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 13 \\]</u>. Several studies have shown that neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib improved R0 resection rates and decreased the risk of postoperative morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. However, in the case of our patient, the tumor was symptomatic, requiring a primary surgical approach.\n\n【28】The worst prognostic factors for GIST are tumor size, mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses/50 high-power fields (a total area of 5 mm <sup>2 </sup> ), non-gastric location, male gender and pseudo-capsule rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Adjuvant therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor is strongly recommended in high-risk patients to reduce the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】The biology of our patient’s tumor, with a high risk of biological behavior (18 mitosis/5 mm <sup>2 </sup> and a proliferative index around 60-70% (Ki-67)), demanded adjuvant therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Recurrence can develop 10 - 15 years after primary treatment, so clinical follow-up must be done over the long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n\n【33】Rectal GISTs are uncommon and the treatment involves local excision of the lesion, without regional lymphadenectomy. Transvaginal resection is an acceptable procedure in tumors located in the rectovaginal region, with protrusion in the posterior wall of the vagina. This method allows not only the excision of the tumor, but also prevents iatrogenic damage to the anal sphincters and their clinical consequences.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We appreciate the contributions of all surgeons.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent was provided for the publication of images and necessary data.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Marta Ferreira: corresponding and first author, conceptualization and study design, data acquisition, analysis and interpretation, article drafting and critical revision of the work for important intellectual content.

It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery. Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32%. The diagnosis of this rare disease is difficult to make. Pregnancy-related pathologies such as pre-eclampsia, myocarditis, or underlying genetic disease show overlapping symptoms with PPCM. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder that presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Edema is frequently present in patients with pre-eclampsia. Hypertension, proteinuria and edema are also symptoms of PPCM. Patients with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by PPCM should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists to improve morbidity and mortality.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Our patient is a 35-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, bearing a singleton pregnancy. Her first pregnancy was normal with a term delivery. She presented with first trimester hypertension and was given methyldopa but defaulted on her medication.\n\n【4】She was seen in outpatient clinic at 33 weeks of gestation and was noted to have a raised blood pressure but no proteinuria. Ultrasound done showed mild intrauterine growth restriction. She was admitted for observation and started on methyldopa. At 34 weeks of gestation, she presented with sudden onset epigastric pain and her blood pressure was 220/110 mm Hg. Liver function test showed transaminitis. Oral nifedipine, intravenous hydralazine and intravenous magnesium sulphate was started and she underwent an emergency cesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation.\n\n【5】On postoperative day 1, the patient developed jaundice. Blood tests showed raised bilirubin, transaminitis and low platelets. The patient also had gross hematuria. A diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was made and the patient was transfused with platelets and fresh frozen plasma. Her hemoglobin level was noted to be 7.1 g/dL. Therefore, one pint of packed cells was transfused. Her creatinine level was noted to be 341 µmol/L. She was seen by the renal physician and was diagnosed to have acute kidney injury secondary to HELLP syndrome.\n\n【6】On postoperative day 3, she developed worsening dyspnea. Chest radiography showed left lower lobe pneumonia and pulmonary congestion. In view of rising trend of total white blood cells, a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia was made. She was started on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【7】On postoperative day 5, she had persistent and worsening dyspnea and was noted to be clinically overloaded. Chest X-ray showed that the lungs were congested and there is bilateral perihilar airspace opacification in a bat wing’s configuration, which was worrisome for pulmonary edema. She was given frusemide and a cardiologist referral was made. A two-dimensional echocardiography was done which showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 58% with moderate mitral regurgitation, unlikely to be PPCM.\n\n【8】Ultrasound abdomen and kidneys showed normal liver and kidney functions. Her creatinine levels and liver function tests progressively returned to normal. Fluid overload resolved with strict fluid restriction. Her pneumonia resolved after 10 days of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged on POD15 well and afebrile.\n\n【9】The patient returned 3 days later to the emergency department complaining of left thigh blisters with fever. She also complained of mild dyspnea and a productive cough. Her vitals showed tachycardia with a pulse rate of 124 beats per minute but blood pressure was normal. On examination, there was a 2 cm vesicular lesion on the anterior aspect of her left thigh. Chest X-ray showed increased opacity and haziness over bilateral lower lung lobes compared to previous X-rays. Patient was advised for admission to treat for pneumonia but she declined and went home.\n\n【10】She returned to the emergency department a day later with increased shortness of breath and persistent left thigh blister that was increasing in size. She was tachypneic and unable to speak in full sentences. Her blood pressure was 169/126 mm Hg and heart rate was 158 beats per minute. The temperature was 37.5 °C. Her oxygen saturation was 35% on a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood gas showed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with type 1 respiratory failure. Patient had a seizure while her blood was taken which was aborted with intravenous midazolam. She was subsequently intubated and kept on mechanical ventilation. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral basal crepitation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion and a diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema was made. She was then admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with central line monitoring.\n\n【11】The patient was reviewed by the cardiologists and a formal two-dimensional echocardiography was done. It showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, mild global left ventricular hypokinesia, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderately dilated left atrium, mildly dilated right atrium and normal ventricles. A diagnosis of PPCM was made. Patient was treated with intravenous frusemide and started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Residual HELLP syndrome was unlikely as the patient was 3 weeks postpartum and biochemical investigations do not support ongoing or worsening HELLP syndrome. The patient had an episode of pulseless electrical activity 1 day after admission to intensive care unit. She was resuscitated for 3 min and intravenous adrenaline was given with return of spontaneous circulation within 2 min. The patient’s care was taken over by the cardiologists and she was transferred to the cardiology intensive care unit.\n\n【12】She was extubated 3 days after admission and intravenous frusemide was converted to oral. Anti-hypertensives were started for blood pressure control and diuresis was achieved with negative balance of up to 500 mL/day. Her renal function gradually improved with creatinine levels on a downward trend till normal before discharge. Infection markers were also on a downward trend and intravenous antibiotics were stopped. The patient was discharged home well 10 days after the second admission.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】Our patient first presented with HELLP syndrome secondary to severe pre-eclampsia. She was unfortunate to have suffered from nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged hospital stay. Acute kidney injury was thought to be a complication of HELLP syndrome but the renal physicians did not rule out the possibility of chronic kidney disease that was not diagnosed before pregnancy. PPCM is likely, as the patient had no past history of cardiac disease before pregnancy. The patient gave a history of increased fluid intake when she was at home as she thought it would improve her kidney function. Her actions probably resulted in acute pulmonary edema as her heart was unable to cope with the increased fluid due to cardiomyopathy.\n\n【15】PPCM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown origin. It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. PPCM is rare in some places but more common in others. It seems to be more prevalent in developing countries. For example, the incidence in Nigeria (1%) or Haiti (0.33%) surpasses that in more developed countries, such as South Africa (0.1%) or the United States (1:3,000 - 4,000 deliveries) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The reason for these discrepancies remain unknown but may be due to environmental and genetics factor, quality of perinatal care and also socio-cultural practices.\n\n【16】Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and the diagnosis of this rare disease is not always straightforward.\n\n【17】PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion and defined based on four criteria: 1) development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum; 2) the absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure; 3) absence of recognizable heart disease before the last month of pregnancy; and 4) LV systolic dysfunction shown by echocardiographic data such as depressed shortening fraction (e.g. ejection fraction less than 45%, M-mode fractional shortening less than 30%, or both, and an LV end-diastolic dimension of more than 2.7 cm/m <sup>2 </sup> ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】It may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of normal late pregnancy. Giddiness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or pedal edema can happen in both normal late pregnancy and early congestive heart failure. Therefore, we need to be extremely cautious when dealing with patients with dyspnea in late pregnancy or postpartum. Careful history taking and physical examination need to be undertaken to exclude conditions that can cause or exacerbate heart failure. Volume status of the patient needs to be assessed through postural blood pressure, weight, blood investigations and physical examination. A complete works of blood investigations should be done to exclude causes of heart failure. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram and chest radiograph should be done to assess for cardiac abnormalities and hypertrophy of the heart. Chest radiographs can also be used to look for pulmonary edema. Two-dimensional echocardiogram is useful to assess LV size, wall thickness, and valvular function.\n\n【19】Several etiologies have been postulated but none is definite. They include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, stress activated cytokines, abnormal responses to hemodynamic stress of pregnancy, increased myocyte apoptosis, malnutrition, genetics factors, abnormal prolactin production, abnormal hormonal function, increased adrenergic tone secondary to emotional or physical stress, and myocardial ischemia.\n\n【20】Risk factors include advanced maternal age, multiparity, obesity, African origin, multiple pregnancy, malnutrition, gestational hypertension, diabetes, prolonged tocolysis, low socioeconomic status, poor perinatal care, breast feeding, substance and tobacco abuse, and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The standard principles of acute treatment for PPCM are the same as for heart failure. This includes fluid and salt restriction, treatment of hypertension, diuretics, vasodilators and digoxin. The aim of the treatment is to relieve the symptoms, delay progression of left ventricular dysfunction, and improving survival. Special cautions need to be given when deciding which medications when given to the mother will be harmful to the neonate when breastfeeding. Currently, cardiologists use three types of drugs (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and B-blockers) for the treatment of chronic heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diuretics help to improve pulmonary and peripheral edema within hours or days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. ACEIs improve survival in all severities of myocardial disease, but are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding, due to its severe teratogenicity. ARBs help to improve survival in patients with heart failure but they have similar teratogenic risks as ACEIs. Three different B-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol) have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Atrial arrhythmias should be treated with digoxin. However, class III and class IV anti-arrhythmias should be avoided because of their teratogenic risks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Early delivery is recommended if the condition of a patient with PPCM is unstable despite medical treatment. Prostaglandins and oxytocin can be used as methods of inducing labor with minimal risks. Adequate analgesia, such as epidural, is recommended to reduce the load of the heart as pain will stimulate a sympathetic response. Strict fluid restriction should be maintained in order to avoid fluid overload. It will be beneficial to insert an indwelling urine catheter or even a central line to monitor the volume status of the patient. A vaginal delivery is recommended over cesarean section in view of the potential surgical risks of cesarean section. However, a cesarean delivery should be performed if there are obstetrics indications. Thromboprophylaxis should be given peripartum.\n\n【25】Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem condition, involving hypertension and proteinuria, which happens in pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation. Edema is frequently present. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves endothelial damage and capillary leak. Some of the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia include headache or visual disturbances, impaired coagulation, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, ascites, and renal failure. Pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria are caused by endothelial dysfunction with subsequent capillary leak. As pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria occur in heart failure too, it makes the diagnosis of PPCM difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of pre-eclampsia and it involves hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It occurs in < 1% of pregnancies during the third trimester or in the first few days postpartum. The pathophysiology involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia secondary to general activation of coagulation cascade. It presents with epigastric pain, visual disturbances, headache and parasthesiae. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is the most frequent major complication. Acute renal failure occurs in almost half of such cases.\n\n【27】Our patient’s encounter demonstrates the complexity of managing a patient with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome and acute renal failure, and PPCM. The symptoms are often similar which makes the diagnosis extremely difficult. A multidisciplinary team of specialists will be required for optimal care and management of such patients.\n\n【28】Grant\n\n【29】None.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is one of such gastrointestinal hormones. GLP-1 is produced mainly by L-cells in the ileum. GLP-1 is released into the blood from intestinal L-cells in response to meal ingestion, and GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. GLP-1 slows gastric emptying, which may aid weight loss, and inhibits glucagon release from the pancreaticα-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n【2】Therefore, therapeutic strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus are focused on the use of GLP-1 analogues. Exenatide was introduced to the market in the United States in 2005 and in Europe in 2007. Liraglutide has been introduced to the market in Europe in 2009 and in the United States and Japan in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Liraglutide is an acylated analogue of human GLP-1 and has 97% sequence homology to human GLP-1, while exenatide shares 53% homology with human native GLP-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since GLP-1 is promptly inactivated by the enzyme, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the half-life of GLP-1 is less than two minutes. A high degree of plasma protein binding capacity of liraglutide induces decreased susceptibility to metabolism by DPP-4 and the half-life of liraglutide is approximately 13 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】This article describes a 70-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus achieving a good glycemic control by switching from pre-mixed insulin 50/50 (50% NPH and 50% regular insulin) to liraglutide. Here, we will show the changes in blood glucose levels, plasma glucose and serum C-peptide levels before and after meal ingestion, results of glucagon loading test, and dairy urinary C-peptide levels, by switching from pre-mixed insulin to liraglutide.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 70-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed as type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago, and had been treated by pre-mixed insulin for ten years. For the last 6 months, she used pre-mixed insulin 50/50 (12 unites before breakfast and 6 unites before dinner). She had also been diagnosed as having hypertension and previous cerebral infarction, and took nifedipine (60 mg/day), telmisartan (40 mg/day), furosemide (40 mg/day), clopidogrel sulfate (75 mg/day), and sarpogrelate hydrochloride (300 mg/day). She did not take any oral anti-diabetic drugs. Her body weight had been increasing, and her body height, body weight, and body mass index were 158 cm, 79 kg, and 31.6 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . A good glycemic control could not be obtained, and hemoglobin A1c level was 8.0% before the admission.\n\n【6】At first, we used pre-mixed insulin 50/50 (13 unites before breakfast and 7 unites before dinner), however, her blood glucose levels were not ameliorated. And then, we switched from twice-daily pre-mixed insulin 50/50 to three-times-daily rapid-acting insulin glulisine. Three-times-daily low dose of rapid-acting insulin glulisine also did not ameliorate her blood glucose levels . At 11 days after the admission, we did not use insulin to washout effects of insulin. We started to use liraglutide from day 12 (12 days after the admission). Liraglutide promptly decreased blood glucose levels, and blood glucose levels with more than 150 mg/dl were not observed except for one time spot (before lunch on day 23) while daily 0.6 mg of liraglutide was used .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Liraglutide significantly reduced plasma glucose levels before and after each meal ingestion. Interestingly, liraglutide decreased % serum C-peptide levels compared with those without liraglutide, indicating that liraglutide reduced plasma glucose levels by ameliorating insulin sentitivity.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Plasma glucose levels (a), % changes of plasma glucose levels from before breakfast (b), serum C-peptide levels (c), % changes of serum C-peptide levels from before breakfast (d).

BB, AB, BL, AL, BD, and AD mean before breakfast, two hours after breakfast, before lunch, two hours after lunch, before dinner, two hours after dinner, respectively. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】We performed a glucagon loading test before and after switching from insulin to liraglutide . At 6 days after the start of daily 0.6 mg liraglutide use, increases in plasma glucose and serum C-peptide levels by a glucagon loading were significantly suppressed by liraglutide. This suggests that liraglutide reduced glucagon-mediated increase in plasma glucose and also ameliorated insulin sensitivity. In spite of that liraglutide ameliorated blood glucose levels, liraglutide significantly reduced daily urinary C-peptide level , supporting liraglutide-mediated amelioration in insulin sensitivity.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3.

Results from the LEAD-1, 2, 3, and 5 studies indicate that liraglutide has superior (non-inferior in the LEAD-2) glycemic control compared with thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea, and long-acting human insulin analog, and that liraglutide is likely to be more favorable for body weight reduction and the occurrence of hypoglycemia \\[ 4 \\- 7 \\].\n\n【15】To our knowledge, our report is the first to observe effects of the switching from twice-daily pre-mixed insulin to liraglutide. Our patient used daily 18 unites pre-mixed insulin as monotherapy, however, a good glycemic control could not be obtained. Daily 0.6 mg liraglutide as monotherapy significantly ameliorated glycemic control. Although liraglutide has been considered to potentiate the glucose-dependent insulinotropic and glucagonostatic effects of GLP-1, liraglutide decreased relative postprandial C-peptide levels and daily urinary C-peptide levels in spite of reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels in our patient. This result indicates that liraglutide decreases plasma glucose levels mainly not by the glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect but by amelioration in insulin sensitivity.\n\n【16】Glucagon increases plasma glucose levels by increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Since glucagon has a strong insulinotropic effect, glucagon is usually used to test the potential of pancreatic β-cells to secrete insulin. In our patient, serum C-peptide level after a glucagon loading was decreased by liraglutide, in spite of reduced plasma glucose. This result suggests that liraglutide reduces glucagon-mediated increase in plasma glucose levels not by enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cell but by suppressing glucagon-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon has also been reported to stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes and increase plasma free fatty acids levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Increased serum free fatty acids induce insulin resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Suppressed lipolysis in adipocytes due to reduced serum glucagon levels by liraglutide may also be associated with amelioration in insulin sensitivity. At 2 weeks after the start of liraglutide use, she gained weight by 1.0 kg, however, fasting and postprandial blood glucose and serum C-peptide levels were significantly reduced, indicating that liraglutide has other mechanisms to ameliorate insulin resistance than by reducing body weight. Insulin resistance may be ameliorated by an enhanced GLP-1-mediated glucagonostatic effect and the resultant suppression of lipolysis in adipocytes, and a liraglutide-mediated suppression of glucagon-mediated hepatic glucose output.\n\n【17】In conclusion, glycemic control in obese diabetic patients was significantly ameliorated by switching from twice-daily pre-mixed insulin (18 unites/day) to a low dose of liraglutide (0.6 mg/day). Our study suggestes various mechanisms for GLP-1 analog-mediated improvement in glycemic control . However, the underlying mechanism for liraglutide-mediated improvements in insulin resistance still remains obscure. Further studies, preferably with larger numbers of patients, should be performed in the future.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 5.

Previous reports have shown that facial or neck trauma is the most frequent cause of fracture of the SP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】No reports have indicated that rolling over is a cause of fracture of the SP. We herein describe a patient who developed a fracture of the SP associated with sudden neck pain by rolling over during sleep. Thus, fracture of the SP should be considered when elderly patients develop sudden neck pain after a casual motion such as rolling over.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 67-year-old woman developed a sudden onset of severe left-sided neck pain the night before presentation. She presented 6 h after the onset of the symptom. Her medical history included diabetes and osteoporosis. There was no family history of bone disease. Her regular medications were drugs for diabetes and osteoporosis. The patient’s chief complaint was pain on the left side of her neck. She experienced worsening pain and no limitation during her jaw movement. She reported no surgical history or tonsillectomy. The patient did not complain of symptoms mimicking glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Upon examination, she had severe neck pain but normal vital signs. Neck examination revealed tenderness in near front of the mastoid process. Other examinations were normal. Blood test and X-ray findings were also normal. Because of concern regarding an underlying fracture, a computed tomography scan of the neck was performed, which revealed a fracture of the SP .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

A neck brace was placed to limit her neck movement, and an analgesic was prescribed (acetaminophen, 500 mg every 8 h for 8 weeks). After 2 months when conservative treatment started, her neck pain gradually resolved.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Investigations of the epidemiology of fracture of the SP have indicated that such fractures are rare traumatic events that frequently occur in association with other head and neck fractures, especially mandibular fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

However, no reports have described fracture of the SP due to a minor trauma such as that induced by rolling over.\n\n【9】With respect to the cause of the fracture of the SP in the patient, traumatic injury is likely. When she rolled over, her neck sprained unnaturally. She also had a history of osteoporosis; thus, bone fragility might have contributed to the fracture. She had no other predisposing risk factors for fracture of the SP, although the influence of osteoporosis was not completely ruled out. Therefore, the cause of the fracture of the SP in her could be considered to be related to rolling over.\n\n【10】Regarding the therapeutic approach to the fracture of the SP in the patient, conservative management was chosen and provided good recovery.

Surgical removal of an SP bone chip could be necessary in some patients, but conservative treatment might be sufficient in those with only mild discomfort. The patient was treated conservatively with a neck brace to limit her neck movement, and we prescribed an analgesic.

Here, we report a 49-year-old female with MESTK with no cystic components and no history of hormone use.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 49-year-old female with a flank pain on left side for 1 year was referred to our urology clinic. She had hypertension and had an operation in the ophthalmology before. There was a history of colon cancer in her mother and renal tumor in her aunt which she did not know the exact diagnosis. On physical examination there was pain and tenderness on left lumbar region. All other findings were normal, and there was no organomegaly. On laboratory tests there was slight leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, WBC count was: 12.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mL (N: 4.0 - 10.0), Neu% 87.7 (N: 42 - 75.2). RBC and Hb were within normal limits. There was only a slight microcytic anemia, Hct: 36.0 (N: 37-47%), MCV: 75.1 (N: 80 - 100). Platelet count was normal. Urea was within normal limits, but creatinine was slightly higher than normal (1.07 mg/dL, N: 0.5 - 0.9). Electrolytes were also normal. On ultrasonographic examination size and localization of right kidney was normal. No stone or mass was detected. On left kidney, a lobulated solid mass of 26 × 44 mm which was located on the middle zone, extending from renal parenchyma to renal sinus was detected. On MRI size and localization of both kidneys were normal. On coronal plane, on the contrasted, fat-saturated T1 images, 26 × 44 mm lobule contoured mass was seen . Mass was thought to be either a transitional cell carcinoma or an oncocytoma radiologically. She underwent a surgery. During surgery there was no gross pathology in ureters and urinary bladder. Simple nephrectomy was done.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Spindle cell component was arranged in short fascicules and bundles, but there were also areas that were looking like ovarian stroma. Epithelial component was composed of small number of normal appearing tubules with round lumina which scattered throughout the spindle cell component. The spindle cell component was dominant, and only few tubules were seen . No mitoses or abnormal mitoses were seen in both components. A panel of immunohistochemistry was done: SMA was diffuse positive in the spindle cell component , and EMA and CK were positive in epithelial component. HMB-45, desmin and S-100 were negative in both components. Progesterone receptor was only focally positive in the spindle cell component . Both components were also negative for estrogen receptor. Together with these results and morphological pattern of tumor, patient was diagnosed as MESTK.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3.

It was first described in 1973 by Block et al as congenital mesoblastic nephroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The term MESTK was introduced by Michal et al in 1998 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. These tumors were diagnosed as leiomyomatous renal hamartomas, congenital mesoblastic nephroma in an adult, cystic hamartoma of renal pelvis, solitary multilocular cyst with Mullerian like stroma and adult metanephric stromal tumor in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Ages of the patients range from 19 to 78 with a female predominance. It is generally seen in premenopausal woman and the average age is 46 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Female to male ratio is striking, which is (10:1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Of the 100 reported cases of MEST, only eight cases are male 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】History of long term estrogen replacement therapy in females and hormonal therapy in male patients shows that a hormonal mechanism plays role in etiology of these tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Most of the patients present with flank pain, palpable mass, hematuria and urinary tract infection as like other renal tumors, but 25% of the cases are identified incidentally and are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Radiologically MESTK can be seen as well described mass in pelvis, can be located in cortex and protrude from cortex and may show multiple septa with solid and cystic components. In contrast, enhanced tomography, solid component generally shows delayed contrast enhancing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. MEST can mimic renal angiomyolipomas, adult cystic nephroma, cystic renal cell carcinoma, complex cyst. For that reason most MEST are classified as Bosniak 3/4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Macroscopically MESTK is a well-defined mass, composed of cystic and solid areas. Dimensions are variable, ranging from 2 to 24 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In some cases, cystic component is dominant and solid area may be seen as a mural nodule, it can be seen as multilocular cystic mass and mimic multilocular renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or it can be solid and mimic angiomyolipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Microscopically MESTK is a benign biphasic tumor composed of both mesenchymal and epithelial components. The mesenchymal component is characterized by spindle cells arranged in bundles, sheets and fascicules and may show fibroblastic, smooth-muscle or myofibroblastic differentiation in variable degrees. Mesenchymal component may also resemble ovarian stroma. Epithelial component is variable, generally consists of glands scattered throughout the stroma, but sometimes glands can be seen as compact clusters, in a back-to-back pattern, they can show cystic dilatation or may form complex tubulopapillary structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Mitoses, hemorrhage and necroses are rarely seen in MESTK but malignant cases have also been reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In our case, diagnosis of MESTK was challenging due to absence of cystic component in the tumor. Generally MESTK are composed of solid and cystic areas grossly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In our case tumor was composed of only solid areas with no cystic component. It was thought to be transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) radiologically. Microscopically there were few tubules scattered between the spindle cell components. Some of tubules showed cystic dilatation. Immunohistochemistry findings were also not typical as with other MESTK. Most of the reported MESTK in the literature showed ER, PR and CD10 positivity in the mesenchymal component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In our case ER was negative and PR was positive only focally. But there is also a fact that estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity are not by themselves diagnostic of MESTK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Another point of conflict in our case is that, there was no history of oral contraceptive use. Hormonal factors are thought to play role in the pathogenesis of MESTK, and long term use of hormonal preparations is shown to be associated with MESTK in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Exact pathogenesis is not clear. Also an angiomyolipoma with dominant myomatous component was taken into consideration in differential diagnosis but absence of S-100 and HMB-45 in our case showed tumor was not an angiomyolipoma.\n\n【20】In conclusion MESTK is a rare benign tumor that should be differentiated from other renal tumors. Radiologically it can mimic a variety of tumors for that reason it should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of a solid tumor in a premenopausal woman. These tumors may consist of only solid areas rather than cystic-solid areas. It must be differentiated from angiomyolipomas and other stromal tumors. ER and PR positivity is not by itself diagnostic of MESTK; it should be kept in mind that these tumors can show only focal or weak positivity as in our case. These tumors generally have good prognosis but recurrence and malignant transformation of these tumors have also been reported. For that reason follow-up of these patients is recommended. A small number of cases were reported in literature as MESTK up to date. For that reason variations in morphology and immunohistochemistry are not known exactly. As number of cases increase, our knowledge about this tumor will also increase and different morphological patterns as our case will be better understood.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Neurological examination showed mild paraparesis, lower limb hyporreflexia, absent superficial abdominal reflexes, hypoesthesia and hypopalesthesia bellow D12 level and inability to walk without bilateral assistance.\n\n【7】Blood analytical evaluation revealed mild normocytic normochromic anemia. CSF examination showed a slight increase in protein count without neoplastic cells. There were no significant changes in computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and spine.\n\n【8】The patient was admitted to the neurology ward with the diagnosis of transverse myelopathy of undetermined etiology. Treatment was immediately initiated with high doses of steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g for 5 days); nevertheless, his neurological condition kept deteriorating and he became paraplegic in less than a week. He also developed lower limb neuropathic pain and urinary and fecal incontinence 3 days later.\n\n【9】Thoracic spinal cord MRI demonstrated an oval intramedullary lesion causing medullary mild expansion in the level of D12 associated with extensive hypersignal from the medullary cone to approximately D3 . The features of this intramedullary expansive lesion were suggestive of metastatic lesion.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Sagittal view of magnetic resonance imaging with enhancement showing an intramedullary spinal cord lesion at D12 level (arrow). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】The search for a primary tumor was initiated. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan demonstrated the presence of a lesion with neoplastic characteristics in the rectosigmoid transition zone with various lymph nodes conglomerates and several subpleural nodules, suggesting metastatic lesions. Whole-body positron emission tomography with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-18 FDG) was also performed and confirmed the findings of the CT scan and also the presence of a focal hypermetabolic lesion at D12.\n\n【12】Rectosigmoidoscopy confirmed the presence of rectosigmoid transition zone adenocarcinoma with extraparietal invasion and several lymph nodes conglomerates staged preoperatively as T4aN2 (TNM staging system) in pelvic MRI .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Sagittal view of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealing primary tumor at rectosigmoid transition zone. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】The case was discussed by a multidisciplinary team (Neurosurgery, Oncology, General Surgery, Radiology and Radiotherapy) concluding that there was no indication for neurosurgical intervention, given the advanced stage of the primary tumor with spread metastasis and the fact that the patient was paraplegic. The patient completed five spinal cord radiotherapy (20 Gy/F5/1S) treatments associated with oral corticotherapy to relieve severe pain in the lower limbs. Later, the patient underwent laparotomy but the primary tumor was considered unresectable and only a derivative colostomy was performed. In a further multidisciplinary team meeting, adjuvant palliative chemotherapy was proposed but never carried out because of the patient’s poor general condition.\n\n【15】The patient attended a convalescence home for 3 months and his clinical condition continued worsening with multiple infectious complications until he died 4 months after ISCM diagnosis.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】ISCM represents only 1-3% of spinal cord tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and CRC is one of the less frequent tumors associated with it. According to Sung et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, the median age at presentation of ISCM is 56 years (range: 4 - 82 years) and it usually manifests by muscle weakness, back pain and radicular pain. Sensory loss and bowel and bladder dysfunction are typically seen at a later stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>, although there are cases (1%) of asymptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】ISCM as etiology of medullary lesion can be difficult to diagnose, especially in situations with no known primary tumor, as our case report. However, thanks to advances and wider use of imaging techniques, especially MRI, increase in the diagnosis of ISCM is happening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. As MRI is highly sensitive and many patients have a poor performance status to undergo a neurosurgical intervention, we can go without histological analysis and assume ISCM diagnosis only by imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Our patient had no indication for neurosurgical intervention, even for biopsy, and the ISCM diagnosis was made by MRI confirmed by PET-18-FDG, which can be used to evaluate this clinical situation when MRI is unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The presence of ISCM usually appears associated with widespread metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>, including brain involvement in 61% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, with 80% mortality rates in first 3 - 4 months after the onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient had already lung and pelvic but not brain metastasis at ISCM diagnosis.\n\n【20】As far as the treatment is concerned, there is no consensus because of the rarity of this entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 12 \\]</u> and the lack of controlled studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The main objective is to try to preserve motor function in patients with rapid neurologic deterioration, considering conservative approach for patients with little or no cord function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 12 \\]</u>. There are three main therapeutic tools: radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Radiotherapy with or without corticotherapy represents the gold standard to reduce edema in radiosensitive tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The conservative treatment is often chosen because of advanced stage of disease and poor clinical condition of patients. On the other hand, we can consider surgery in certain patients, accordingly to their age, physical condition, location and severity of the primary tumor, other metastasis and surgical risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and may offer some improvement in neurologic condition and quality of life in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 10 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Despite an early diagnosis, our patient had already advanced disease, with disseminated metastasis and irreversible neurological deficits and so a very poor prognosis. He was in no condition to undergo neurosurgical intervention. Thus, only palliative approach to control his pain was performed.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】ISCM from CRC is a rare condition, but thanks to therapies’ improvement, cancer patients are living longer. This, associated with more advanced imaging methods, explains the fact that ISCM is being increasingly diagnosed. It is of uttermost importance to consider this diagnosis even in patients whose primary tumor is not usually associated with ISCM, such as in CRC, or even in undiagnosed primary tumors, as demonstrated by our case report. The management of these patients needs a multidisciplinary approach, requiring early spinal cord MRI and whole-body imaging for tumoral staging, in order to achieve timely diagnosis and treatment. The aim is to avoid irreversible neurologic deficits, preserving patients’ quality of life.\n\n【24】Grant Support\n\n【25】None.\n\n【26】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【27】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There are several secondary causes for amyloidosis like chronic inflammatory process or malignancies. There is no definitive cure for amyloidosis yet. It can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations depending on organ system involvement.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】We present here a 47-year-old Asian woman with history of hypothyroidism who came to emergency room with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for a month with worsening of symptoms for the last 3 - 4 days prior to presentation. Symptoms were associated with nausea, bloating sensation, abdomen distension, early satiety and weight loss. On examination, she had mild abdomen distension, right upper quadrant tenderness, hepatomegaly and bipedal pitting edema. Her pertinent laboratory findings were serum albumin of 1.6, total bilirubin of 3.5, direct of 2.1, AST/ALT of 151/81 and alkaline phosphatase of 1,339. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/Cr was 20/1.6 and urinalysis (UA) was positive for proteinuria of 300 mg/dL. Ultrasound (US) of gallbladder revealed hepatomegaly, thickened gallbladder wall with 4 mm gall bladder polyps vs. non-shadowing stones concerning for acute cholecystitis. Cholestatic pattern of liver enzymes prompted us to get magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which confirmed the findings of US gallbladder along with ascites without any intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Her viral serologies were suggestive of past hepatitis B infection. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, alpha-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and iron profile were within normal limits. Patient felt better with supportive treatment by day 3 of admission. Since most of the workup was unrevealing, decision was made for liver biopsy. Biopsy was positive for amyloidosis.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Clinical presentation of amyloidosis depends on the type of protein, tissue distribution and the amount of amyloid deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Some clinical and laboratory features that suggest amyloidosis include waxy skin and easy bruising, enlarged tongue, symptoms and signs of heart failure, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hepatomegaly, proteinuria, peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy and impaired coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Proteinuria leading to nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency is the earliest and most frequent clinical manifestation that should raise suspicion of AA amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are very few cases reported in the literature of amyloidosis initially presenting with features of acute cholecystitis and cholestatic pattern of liver function tests along with ascites. Our patient presented clinically as acute cholecystitis. The clinical dilemma was more when US commented on the findings as non-shadowing stones vs. polyps.

However, gastric heterotopia in the rectum is a rare entity. Although histopathologic finding is straightforward for correct diagnosis, gastric heterotopia is identified as polyp, diverticula or ulcer endoscopically. Awareness of this entity can direct us to correct diagnosis. Here, we present a 65-year-old female with gastric heterotopia in the rectum.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 65 year-old female presented with bowel habit changes. The patient did not have rectal bleeding nor pain. Perianal fistula and ulceration were not identified, either. On colonoscopy, three polyps were found (4 to 8 mm in range) in the cecum, transverse colon and rectum, respectively. These polyps were removed with cold snare. The histopathological evaluation revealed that the polyp in the cecum was tubular adenoma and that the polyps in the transverse colon and rectum were hyperplastic polyps. An area of congested mucosa measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter was noted in the rectum. This patch of mucosa was demarcated by both color and texture when compared to the remainder of the rectal mucosa. Biopsies were taken for histopathological evaluation.\n\n【4】A sharp demarcation is seen between the rectal mucosa (left) and gastric mucosa (right) on microscopic examination . The mucosa of the rectum shows crypt epithelia which have basally-located nuclei and purple cytoplasm. On the other hand, the mucosa on the right side shows foveolar type surface epithelium with underlying glands composed of parietal and chief cells . Warthin-starry stain (not shown) for Helicobacter pylori did not identify microorganism in the mucosal surface.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Unlike gastric heterotopia which consists of full mucosal thicknesses of specialized foveolar epithelium and gastric glands composed of chief and/or parietal cells, gastric metaplasia is of partial thickness with only foveolar epithelium and intermingles with the native tissue.\n\n【9】Since the first report by Ewell and Jackson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> in 1939 in the English literature, 47 cases of gastric heterotopia in the rectum have been reported so far to the best of our knowledge \\[ 7 \\- 10 \\].

X-ray: 8 months after surgery. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Fibrous dysplasia (FD) has been described as a medullar fibro-osseous lesion that can involve a single site (monostotic) or multiple locations (polyostotic). FD can be considered a dysplastic anomaly of bone-forming mesenchymal tissue with an inability of bone-forming tissue to produce mature lamellar bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Recent investigations suggest a genetic background of the disease that leads to an impaired cell differentiation into mature osteocytes, which would be capable of producing lamellar bone. The associated mutations affect signal-transducing G proteins and have been implicated in the development of multiple endocrinopathies in McCune-Albright syndrome and soft tissue related myxomas in patients with Mazabraud syndrome. Fibrous dysplasia is part of both mentioned diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】FD accounts for 7-10% of benign bone tumors and tumor-like lesion, respectively. FD is most commonly a disease of young children and adolescents that usually regresses after cessation of bone growth. The monostotic form is 6 times more frequent than the polyostotic form and tends to manifest later in the life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The lesion can cause deformity, pain and sometimes fracture.\n\n【21】Most frequently the proximal femur, the skull and the ribs are affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Involvement of the upper extremity, especially the phalanx, is extremely rare with only a few cases having been reported in the literature. On plain film radiography phalangeal FD presents as a lobulated or expanded and sometimes distorted phalanx with ground glass appearance with intact cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Alternatively, FD can present as a lytic cyst-like lesion with incomplete periostal reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Lesions have a variable X-ray attenuation depending on their degree of mineralization and bony spicules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. FD of the skull is usually expansive with a ground glass appearance (56%), may have an homogeneously dense (23%) or cyst-like pattern (21%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, lesions are associated with endosteal scalloping, with or without bone expansion and thinning of the cortex. Generally there is no soft tissue extension or periostal reaction unless a fracture or malignant transformation occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Malignant transformation into chondroblastic osteosarcoma has been reported in less than 1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The MRI appearance of this lesion, as documented in previous cases, shows an isointense signal area and a high signal area on the T2 weighted sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, a homogeneous low signal on T1-weighted images and a homogeneous isointense signal on STIR images.\n\n【23】Furthermore, we found a considerable enhancement in the T1 weighted fat saturated sequence (T1WI fs) after injection of contrast agent. Whereas cortical disruption was suspected on plain film radiography, this finding could neither be confirmed by MRI nor during surgery.\n\n【24】Surgery is indicated for confirmatory biopsy, correction of deformity, prevention of pathologic fracture, and/or removal of symptomatic lesions. The use of cortical grafts is preferred over cancellous grafts or bone-graft substitutes because of the superior physical qualities of remodelled cortical bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Benign differential diagnoses of lytic lesions of the phalanx include enchondroma, solitary bone cyst (SBC), aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), giant cell reparative granuloma and brown-tumor-hyperparathyroidism (HPTH). Important malignant differential diagnosis comprises osteosarcoma and metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Infectious diseases like tubercular dactylitis (spina ventosa) may also show a comparable disease pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Enchondroma is an intramedullary lesion with well-defined borders that usually has low-intermediate signal on T1WI and intermediate on Proton density-weighted image (PDWI). On T2WI and fat saturated T2WI it has a predominantly high signal. Enchondroma shows enhancement of contrast agent, however, in varying patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Solitary bone cysts often have a peripheral rim of low signal on T1WI a T2WI adjacent to normal medullary bone and usually contain fluid. Thin peripheral contrast enhancement can be seen at the margins of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Aneurysmal bone cyst, often excentrically located, has a low signal rim on T1WI and T2WI adjacent to normal medullary bone or to extraosseous soft tissue. There are various combinations of low, intermediate, and/or high signal on T1WI, PDWI and T2WI. Fluid-fluid levels and internal separations can, however, be considered as highly indicative of ABC. Moreover, variable contrast enhancement can be seen that commonly involves the margins and the internal septae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The giant cell reparative granuloma can have heterogeneous low, intermediate, and/or high signal a T1WI, PDWI and T2WI. Furthermore peripheral rim-like and central Gd-contrast enhancement can be seen.\n\n【30】The brown-tumor-hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) often has a low-intermediate signal on T1WI and an intermediate or slightly high signal on T2WI. It typically shows contrast enhancement. Zones of low signal on T2WI may occur due to hemosiderin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Osteosarcoma is an intramedullary malignant lesion which shows low-intermediate signal on T1WI and mixed low, intermediate or high signal on T2WI. Usually it contains matrix mineralization and ossification with low signal on T2WI. Furthermore, it usually shows contrast enhancement. Zones of cortical destruction are typically seen, when tumor extends into the extraosseous soft tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Metastatic lesions appear as single or multiple osteolytic lesions. Lesions are well-circumscribed, although poorly defined margins can occur with highly aggressive tumors. They are often associated with cortical destruction and extraosseous extension. Metastases usually show contrast enhancement. Periostal reaction is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The tubercular dactylitis is an unusual form of skeletal tuberculosis of the short bones. The main radiographic feature is a cystic expansion. The lesion reveals alterated marrow signal, which is hypointensive in T1WI and hyperintensive in T2WI. Furthermore, the cortex often appears irregular and sometimes is surrounded by a soft tissue abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】Although it is very rare, MFD should be included in differential diagnosis of lytic lesions of the phalanges. Its typical X-ray features comprise ground glass attenuation, cortical thinning and distortion.

The acute presentation, however, helped limit the differential, with interstitial pneumonitis being high on the list. Possible etiologies were ruled out by negative extremities ultrasound and bronchoalveolar lavage negative for microorganisms. In this case, lack of rash and eosinophilia lessened the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction, though rapid improvement after cessation of the causative agent was supportive of this diagnosis.\n\n【9】Interstitial pneumonitis is defined as an inflammation change of the lung interstitium, including the alveolar septa, due to a broad range of etiologies. The etiology of interstitial pneumonitis can either be idiopathic or from known causes, such as drug-induced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In immunocompromised populations, interstitial pneumonitis is more commonly caused by fungal, atypical bacterial, and viral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In healthy populations, the cause of interstitial pneumonitis is more commonly an extrinsic particulate; fungal or plant antigens in farmer’s lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, aerosolized metallic or organic chemicals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, or even possibly radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The presentation of drug-induced pneumonitis commonly includes dyspnea, fever, cough, and rash. Investigation will often reveal inflammatory changes on CXR or CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and eosinophilia on lab analysis. If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is suspected as the cause of pneumonitis, the medication can be restarted after cessation to confirm the reappearance of symptoms; this however may cause the patient to require intubation and supportive treatment. As with other hypersensitivity reactions, the first step in treatment of drug-induced pneumonitis, after life supporting measures, is cessation of the drug or inhalation agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients with severe disease may require treatment with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, however, this has been shown to have no effect on long-term outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】While hypersensitivity reactions are a known adverse effect of the use of cephalosporins, there are few reported cases of pneumonitis associated with ceftriaxone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This case is suggestive that clinicians should continue to be aware of the possibility of drug-induced pneumonitis, even in the absence of rash or eosinophilia. At this time, more investigation is required to establish the exact mechanism behind ceftriaxone-induced pneumonitis, and to determine if there is population with an elevated risk of this complication. We believe that the addition of hypersensitivity pneumonitis to the differentials of patients with similar presentations, and early recognition of this complication can reduce or even prevent significant morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In some patients, however, these typical clinical manifestations may not be present, and the condition may present more subtly, leading to delays in diagnosis and timely institution of appropriate treatment, the clinical consequences of which can be devastating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】SAH can sometimes present with symptoms seen with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as upper back, shoulder, or neck pains, and although atypical, these symptoms can often be confused for ACS because of the commonly associated electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and elevation in cardiac troponins \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Herein we present a patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with upper back and neck pain, diagnosed initially as non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but was eventually found to have occipital SAH after extensive inpatient workup.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient is a 68-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and migraine headaches who presented to the ED with neck, left shoulder, and upper back pain for 1 day. The pain started while the patient was resting at home. The pain improved partially with paracetamol tablets. Later in the day, the patient stated she tried to pick up an item from the ground when her severe neck/back pain returned and has since persisted. Her neck pain was not associated with chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, or limb weakness. She has not reported any recent falls or trauma. The patient initially presented to an urgent care center where ECG demonstrated ST segment depression, and the patient was advised to go to the ED for further evaluation. The patient noticed an improvement in neck pain upon arrival at the ED. However, the pain was somehow worse with movement; she did not report headaches, focal weakness, paresthesia, or bowel or urinary symptoms.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Given the patient’s clinical presentation and ECG findings, ACS was suspected. ECG in the ED showed ST depression in leads V3-V6 , and high-sensitivity troponin level was significantly elevated to > 4,800 (0 - 20 pg/mL). The patient was started on antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with heparin. Repeat ECG on the next day showed improvement of the ST deviation noticed on the first day . Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular wall thickness and normal ejection fraction of 60-65% without any regional wall motion abnormalities or other significant structural abnormalities. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient underwent urgent coronary catheterization on the second day of hospitalization; however, coronary angiography  did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease. Given the level of troponin rise, persistent upper back pain, and negative coronary angiography, a workup for aortic dissection was done with computed tomography (CT) angiography , which was again negative. Additionally, CT pulmonary angiography  was negative for pulmonary embolism. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient reported headaches and photophobia. The headaches were initially attributed to migraines which the patient stated typically worsen with stress. However, her headaches worsened, and she reported worsening neck pain and nausea. Her physical examination remained unremarkable throughout this period without any focal neurological deficits or alteration in her mental status. A head CT  was obtained at this point, revealing left occipital SAH with mild cerebral edema and minimal midline shift.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, no neurosurgical intervention was recommended. The patient’s neurological status was observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 72 h. She remained neurologically intact, but her hospitalization was complicated by moderate hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in the context of her intracranial hemorrhage. The patient’s hyponatremia resolved with fluid restriction.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】After a week of hospitalization, the patient was discharged home in good condition without neurological deficits. A repeat head CT scan  showed a resolving SAH before discharge. At the follow-up in the neurosurgery clinic 3 weeks later, the patient had no neurological deficits, and the follow-up CT scan  showed a healing SAH with a suspicion of an underlying vascular malformation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain  confirmed a diagnosis of cavernous malformation.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】Twenty percent of strokes in adults are due to intracranial hemorrhage, with SAH and intracerebral hemorrhage, each accounting for 10%. Most patients with spontaneous SAH have an underlying intracranial saccular aneurysm. However, about 20% of SAH cases are not due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. These are caused by arteriovenous malformations/fistulae, intracranial arterial dissection, amyloid angiopathies, vasculitides, bleeding disorders, and illicit drug use. Among these non-aneurysmal etiologies are cavernous malformations (CMs). CMs are very rare, with an incidence of 0.15 to 0.56 per 100,000 in various populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The incidence is equal in males and females, with a mean age of 30 to 40. However, females are more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage and neurological deficits \\[ 8 \\- 10 \\].\n\n【17】The typical clinical presentation of SAH is severe headache, which is sufficiently characteristic that an immediate non-contrast head CT scan should be performed as part of the evaluation of such patients, even those who are alert and neurologically intact at the time of initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition to headache, other common symptoms of SAH include transient loss of consciousness, neck pain or stiffness, and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In one case series, these were present in 9%, 75%, and 61% of patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Meningismus, often accompanied by lower back pain, may develop several hours after the bleed due to aseptic meningitis caused by the breakdown of blood cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Head CT scan without contrast is the initial diagnostic test of choice for SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A lumbar puncture should be performed if the head CT is negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Cardiovascular effects of intracranial hemorrhage are well known and may have some prognostic significance, but they can also present diagnostic challenges in a minority of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Cardiovascular effects of intracranial hemorrhage were first described in 1903 by Cushing, who noted elevations in blood pressure and cardiac rhythm abnormalities in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In 1947, Byer et al described ECG changes in a patient with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. ECG changes are expected in almost all patients with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and up to 10% are noted to have a potentially lethal arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which may account for some of the mortality in patients with SAH. In addition to ECG changes, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevations have also been described in case series of patients with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In these reports, cTnI elevations correlated with the severity of the neurological injury and cardiovascular complications, including pulmonary edema, LV dysfunction, and hypotension requiring vasopressors. In addition, some metanalyses correlated elevated cardiac troponins with the severity of the stroke, poor neurological outcome, longer ICU stays, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. One meta-analysis showed that peak cTnI levels were independent predictors of death or severe disability at discharge. However, this association was insignificant at follow-up in 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These findings suggest that cTnI should be measured in all patients with SAH, especially those with ECG or clinical signs of potential cardiovascular dysfunction, and support the concept that cardiovascular dysfunction in these patients may contribute directly to poor outcomes. Although ECG changes are seen in almost all patients with SAH, and cardiac troponin elevations correlate with the severity of SAH as mentioned above, our patient has a significant elevation of troponins out of proportion to the mild SAH.\n\n【19】Although the above-mentioned cardiovascular effects carry important prognostic significance, they may also present diagnostic challenges in some patients with SAH. Several case reports suggested that some SAH patients can be misdiagnosed with ACS upon initial presentation \\[ 20 \\- 23 \\]. Such patients are more likely to present with clinical features that were not specific enough to suggest SAH as a potential diagnosis and have features suggestive of cardiac origin for their symptoms, including ECG changes, high cardiac troponins, and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. Our patient was initially misdiagnosed with NSTEMI in the context of her atypical presentation with neck, shoulder, and upper back pain with ECG changes and significantly elevated cardiac troponins, and the absence of headache at the initial presentation. It was not until the patient developed headaches associated with nausea and vomiting on the third hospital day that a head CT scan was performed, which confirmed SAH. Fortunately, her recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home without neurological deficits.\n\n【20】Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of SAH are common and can result in delays in starting appropriate treatment and worse clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common cause of misdiagnosis is the misconception that patients with SAH should always appear sick, have altered mental status, or have focal neurological deficits when in fact, about 40% of patients lack these clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. This misconception is a common reason not to perform CT scans on such patients. A systematic review conducted in 2017 identified three studies published from 1996 to 2007 in ED populations with a pooled misdiagnosis rate of 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. In that systematic review, initial misdiagnosis was independently associated with small SAH volume, normal mental status at presentation, and right-sided aneurysm location in patients with aneurysmal SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Failure to order a head CT scan at the initial clinical encounter was the most common error, accounting for 73% of the misdiagnoses. Patients with intact mental status at initial presentation (45%) had the highest misdiagnosis rate, which was associated with a fourfold increase in mortality risk at 12 months and increased morbidity among survivors.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】SAH is a common emergency with high mortality and morbidity. Misdiagnosis and delayed SAH diagnosis are common and associated with poor clinical outcomes. The typical clinical features of SAH include severe headaches, often described as thunderclap-like, altered mental status, and often focal neurological deficits. However, some cases can present subtly or present atypically with symptoms suggestive of other alternative diagnoses such as ACS. These atypical presentations often lead to delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and can have profound clinical consequences, especially if anticoagulation and antiplatelets were used for an incorrectly diagnosed ACS.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】The most common cause of misdiagnosis of SAH is the misconception that patients with SAH should always appear sick, have altered mental status, or have focal neurological deficits. Cardiac effects of SAH, including ECG changes, elevated cardiac troponins, and regional wall motion abnormalities, are common. These cardiac effects have prognostic significance and can be a source of diagnostic confusion in patients with SAH who do not present with the typical severe thunderclap-type headaches. Initiation of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation in such circumstances can have serious consequences. Clinicians should be aware of the misconceptions surrounding the clinical presentation of SAH and know about the cardiac effects of intracranial hemorrhage to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis in patients who do not have the typical clinical manifestations of SAH.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the Department of Radiology for providing the images.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest in this case report from all authors.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided consent for publication.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MAN and AK Contributed to conceptualizing and writing the first manuscript.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, but several factors have been associated including autoimmune and infectious processes. IGM usually affects women of childbearing age, and most have a recent history of breastfeeding. IGM additionally has been speculated to be associated with autoimmune disorders, oral contraceptive pills, hyperprolactinemia, fat necrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and corynebacterium infection \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\].

The breast was engorged with an area of induration in the 10 - 11 o’clock position, which was accompanied by tenderness and overlying erythema. She denied history of nipple discharge, oral contraceptive or estrogen use, breast trauma or family history of breast cancer. She reported breastfeeding all four of her children, with the last time being 14 years ago. Her past medical history was significant for conversion to a positive tuberculin skin test, which was never treated. Serial chest radiographs were benign and showed no indication of current or prior pulmonary TB infection. There was no history of cough, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, night sweats or unexplained weight loss.\n\n【7】A preliminary diagnosis of cellulitic mastitis was made, and the patient was treated conservatively with antibiotics. The pain and erythema resolved, but the induration persisted. The patient returned 1 month later with a new area of induration accompanied by overlying erythema, warmth and tenderness. At this time the patient was sent for further evaluation with imaging.\n\n【8】Mammography revealed findings suspicious of a tumor in the subareolar region with generalized skin thickening and nipple retraction. These findings are a significant change from the previous mammogram performed 7 months prior, which was normal. Ultrasound indicated two solid complex masses with irregular margins. The clinical history and imaging studies were highly suggestive of malignancy and indicated biopsy. The diagnostic hypotheses at this time included inflammatory breast cancer, infectious process or granulomatous mastitis.\n\n【9】A core needle biopsy was preformed. No organisms were seen on Gram stain but indicated 2+ white blood cells. Culture grew moderate diphtheroids. The mass was surgically incised and drained. Cytology revealed inflammation with predominantly neutrophils, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and foreign body giant cells in a background of acellular debris, fibrin and red blood cells. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Surgical pathology indicated acute and chronic non-specific inflammation with granulation tissue and panniculitis. Surgery led to improvement in the pain and swelling, but the induration did not fully resolve.\n\n【10】Over the course of the next year, the patient presented with two more recurrences of left breast masses that were treated conservatively with antibiotics, which amounted to no significant improvement in her condition. The new masses were subsequently evaluated by mammography and ultrasound, and were again found to be suspicious for malignancy. Repeat ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies revealed benign pathology, and no further intervention was taken.\n\n【11】Two and a half years after initial presentation, the patient returned complaining of engorgement and erythema of the contralateral breast. The patient was treated conservatively with antibiotics without resolution of the induration. A new area of induration manifested and ultrasound revealed cystic rim enhancing foci. The patient was sent for MRI-guided core needle biopsy. MRI showed diffuse enhancement of the breast parenchyma with solid and cystic changes . Post-biopsy mammography revealed periareolar skin thickening with absence of positive findings in the area of palpable concern . Core biopsy revealed non-specific granulomatous inflammation. The patient underwent incisional biopsy, and surgical pathology revealed noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous mastitis with chronic and acute inflammation, fibrosis, inflamed granulation tissue, fat necrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction . Microbiology and cultures were negative. The patient presented with recurrent abscesses twice over the next 2 months, which were treated with incision and drainage and oral antibiotics. Pathology and microbiology were consistent with previous findings.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient did not develop any more breast abscesses and remained asymptomatic.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】IGM is a rare and benign inflammatory disease of the breast of unknown etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The disease is accepted to be idiopathic after excluding all other causes of granulomatous disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. IGM is a diagnostic dilemma. The clinical findings of IGM are non-specific and can initially mimic other conditions, specifically inflammatory breast cancer, infection and other causes of granulomatous disease. When the presentation suggests infectious mastitis, trials of different antibiotics are frequently used. When there is no response to antibiotics, other etiologies should be suspected. It therefore requires a high degree of suspicion early in the course of disease to make a proper diagnosis of IGM. Definitive diagnosis requires incisional biopsy and histological examination.\n\n【20】In patients who are PPD positive, tuberculous mastitis must be carefully excluded. Breast TB should be suspected when there is poor response to non-TB antibiotics. Chest radiographs are useful in ruling out pulmonary TB; however, there are documented cases of tuberculous mastitis occurring in the absence of lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Histological diagnosis is therefore necessary to distinguish IGM from tuberculous mastitis by demonstrating granulomatous inflammation without caseous necrosis.\n\n【21】Treatment of IGM is challenging as there is no consensus in the literature. Initial treatment approaches vary widely and may include surgical or nonsurgical methods. IGM is generally a self-limiting condition and in uncomplicated cases can be safely observed without treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 13 \\]</u>. Current practice indicates that in cases that require treatment, the initial approach should be non-operative and begin with a course of corticosteroids. In more persistent cases, immunosuppressives like methotrexate or azathioprine may be used. The addition of immunosuppressive agents allows for reduction in steroid dose. Surgical management should be considered as a last resort, especially in resilient or recurrent cases which have failed medical management or in cases that are complicated by abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Surgery in cases of IGM can be challenging, requiring extensive resection to obtain disease-free margins, and even then, recurrence of IGM is high. Extensive scarring and fistula formation can occur, resulting in unsatisfactory cosmetic results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Medical treatment with corticosteroids prior to surgery significantly decreases the inflammation, which allows for more conservative surgery and reduces the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Treating IGM patients with latent TB infection presents a unique set of challenges. As steroids increase the risk of reactivation TB, other treatment modalities should be employed. Little is previously documented about the effectiveness of pain management in patients with granulomatous mastitis. In patients with latent TB or others who cannot tolerate corticosteroid treatment, treatment should be primarily symptomatic with the aim of providing adequate pain relief. Adequate pain management may reduce the frequency of unnecessary antibiotic use and surgical palliation, and result in better long-term cosmetic outcomes.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr. Shahida Ahmed of Department of Veterans Affairs, East Orange, NJ for preparation of pathology slides, and Dr. Basil Hubbi of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ for assistance with radiographic interpretation.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LM reviewed the case notes and prepared the manuscript.

This constellation of clinical findings was first described by Leslie Zieve in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is estimated that this syndrome is seen in approximately 1 in 1,600 hospital admissions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The exact pathogenesis remains elusive, and our current knowledge remains confined to multiple hypotheses. Identification of Zieve syndrome is essential to provide timely treatment and high-value care without subjecting the patient to unnecessary testing in the search for a diagnosis.\n\n【2】The syndrome is slowly gaining recognition in the literature, and as a result, the clinical significance is not well understood. We present a rare case of Zieve syndrome with the unusual finding of a normal reticulocyte count to bring further awareness of this diagnosis, with an emphasis on the pathogenesis, presenting symptoms and labs, prognosis, and clinical management. We explain why an unconventional treatment strategy might prove beneficial in this unique variant. Additionally, we reviewed the literature for cases of Zieve syndrome dating back to 1958 to better characterize the clinical presentation and overall survival rates of this condition.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypothyroidism and alcohol use disorder, presented with a complaint of jaundice for the last 10 days. She also reported a 2-month history of weakness and lethargy. A targeted review of the systems was found to be negative. She reported a history of drinking three to four glasses of hard liquor every night for many years. Her only medication was 50 µg of levothyroxine. In the emergency department, the patient had tachycardia of 103 beats per minute with all other vitals within normal limits. Physical exam was significant for mild tachycardia, scleral icterus, jaundice, and mild abdominal distension with no fluid shift noted. She reported no family history of autoimmune disorders or liver disease, no recent blood transfusions, and no other over the counter medications or herbal supplements.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Initial laboratory values on admission are shown in Table 1 .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Initial Laboratory Values on Admission |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Other workup included a blood alcohol level of 0.306% (reference range < 0.005%), negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, normal ceruloplasmin levels and normal hepatitis panel. Peripheral blood smear showed mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, along with slight anisocytosis, slight macrocytes, moderate target cells. Direct Coomb’s showed a negative elution test and hence it was not considered significant by the lab. The anemia was hemolytic and non-immune in origin. Thus, laboratory findings were consistent with Zieve syndrome. Hemoglobin continued to downtrend during the patient’s hospital stay .\n\n| Click to view | Table 2. Follow-Up Hemoglobin Values |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】Due to downtrending hemoglobin, gastroenterology was consulted. Additionally, a psychiatry consult was placed for assistance with alcohol cessation. The patient was started on appropriate therapy with furosemide and spironolactone, along with lactulose. She was monitored for alcohol withdrawal and counseled extensively on alcohol cessation. She was also recommended for an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for varices. Discriminant function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> was noted to be elevated at 47 so she was started on a 1-month course of prednisolone daily. Her condition improved and she was discharged with advice to follow-up with both gastroenterology and psychiatry as an outpatient.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】At a follow-up visit 1 month later, the patient abstained from alcohol and completed the prescribed steroid course. Repeat labs  at this time showed improvement in all three cell lines and a decrease in the total bilirubin suggesting resolution of hemolysis.\n\n| Click to view | Table 3. Follow-Up Laboratory Values 1 Month Later |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】Chronic alcohol use predisposes individuals to a wide range of adverse medical conditions such as macrocytic anemia, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The goal of our case is to bring awareness to a rarely documented and an underrecognized complication of alcohol abuse known as Zieve syndrome. This disease process was first described by Dr. Leslie Zieve in 1958 and is composed of a specific constellation of clinical and laboratory findings which includes hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of Zieve syndrome remains poorly defined, but multiple theories have been proposed. It is suspected that the hemolysis seen in these patients results primarily from a profound elevation in triglycerides. The altered synthesis of lipoproteins, cholesterol, and fatty acids may induce hemolysis via instability of the erythrocyte membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Recent studies now suggest that both toxic metabolites from ethanol and alcohol-induced vitamin E deficiency may also compound the red blood cell destruction through impaired functioning of crucial metabolic enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The multifactorial mechanism for red blood cell destruction directly results in hemolytic anemia, contributing also to an elevation in unconjugated bilirubin levels. Often the hyperbilirubinemia that is seen is substantial as concurrent alcohol-mediated hepatocellular toxicity induces chronic cholestatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Clinicians should have a high degree of clinical suspicion for Zieve syndrome in individuals with a known history of excessive alcohol use who present with hemolytic normocytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, especially when subsequent workup is negative for gastrointestinal bleeding. The hemolytic nature of anemia can aid as a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate Zieve syndrome from isolated cases of alcohol dependence which often involves macrocytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. While Zieve syndrome typically can be identified by the classic triad, additional clinical findings may aid in the diagnosis. For example, abdominal pain was a universal finding seen in all 20 patients that Leslie Zieve studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Additional nonspecific symptoms that have been reported in the literature include fatigue, fever, nausea, and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Given the hemolytic nature of anemia, labs generally reveal elevated reticulocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased haptoglobin, with elevations in direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Coomb’s test is also negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The clinical importance of recognizing this syndrome comes from the fact that most patients rapidly recover within weeks of alcohol cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Following alcohol abstinence, there is an intracellular shift of lipids from the plasma to adipose tissue in hepatocytes, thus eliminating the hypertriglyceridemia which is a suspected inciting trigger for the development and propagation of this unique syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The excessive alcohol consumption that is seen in this specific patient demographic can have toxic effects on the bone marrow as well. Suppression of hematopoietic stem cells results in impaired production of all three major cell lines, leading to decreased production of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. It is possible that the bone marrow suppression induced by chronic alcohol use in our patient was insufficient to mount a proper response to the hemolytic environment in our patient. The most effective treatment for Zieve syndrome continues to be complete abstinence from alcohol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Unconventional therapies such as plasmapheresis in a patient with massive elevations in triglyceride have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. It is believed that the commonly used scoring system of Maddrey discriminant function, which screens alcoholic patients who benefit from steroids, is ineffective in Zieve syndrome due to the temporary elevations in bilirubin levels that normalize after alcohol cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. In fact, the recommendation is to avoid corticosteroids entirely due to a lack of any proven efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. While this may be true for patients with Zieve syndrome that have functional marrow, our patient was seen to benefit from both alcohol cessation in addition to steroids. We believe this to be due to the effect of steroids to stimulate the release of cells from the bone marrow, which has been proven in prior studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Our success mirrors that of other conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, where corticosteroids can result in appropriate elevation in reticulocyte count with subsequent improvement in hemoglobin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】To date, there is a substantial gap in knowledge regarding the clinical presentation and overall prognosis of patients affected by Zieve syndrome. Following the initial pronouncement of this syndrome by Leslie Zieve in 1958, there have been over 100 documented cases in the literature. The only aggregate analysis of these case reports that we identified was by Liu et al in 2017, with a brief review focusing on the time period, country of origin, and subtype of each publication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. As a result, we aimed to conduct a more thorough review of documented case reports of Zieve syndrome with an emphasis on clinical presentation, lab values, and treatment outcomes while also including any additional cases that were published after 2017. After an extensive PubMed literature review of all case reports dating back to 1958 using the search term “Zieve syndrome”, we identified 31 documented cases \\[ 1 , 3 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 22 \\- 31 \\]. Inclusion criteria included: publications dated after Leslie Zieve’s original manuscript and cases that met all three components of the clinical triad including hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice. Exclusion criteria included: articles that were not open access or written in English text.\n\n【21】We document and summarize our findings below . Overall, patients that met the triad for Zieve syndrome were on average 42.2 years of age with 54.8% being male. While abdominal pain was reported in nearly all of Zieve’s original 20 patients and has historically been considered a classic associated feature of this syndrome, our analysis demonstrates that this complaint is seen in just slightly over half of patients. Over the 31 patients we collected data on, the average initial triglyceride level was significantly elevated at 822.5 mg/dL. A majority of patients were anemic with an average hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL and all patients reported so far had an elevated reticulocyte count. Overall, we demonstrate that Zieve syndrome carries a favorable prognosis, with 93.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 31 \\]</u> of individuals being successfully discharged and only two patients experiencing inpatient mortality.\n\n| Click to view | Table 4. Literature Review Findings |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click to view | Table 5. Summary of Table 4 Findings |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】It is important to recognize the typical findings that characterize Zieve syndrome since this diagnosis is relatively unknown. A high index of clinical suspicion is warranted in patients with alcohol use disorder who present with hemolytic anemia and jaundice. Additionally, a special emphasis should be placed on studying rare variants, such as our patient with a normal reticulocyte count, as they might help uncover undiscovered mechanisms at play. Ultimately, while our data suggest that this condition carries a favorable prognosis with timely identification and treatment interventions, further research regarding the pathophysiology of this syndrome is needed to better target future treatment strategies.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】Our case aims to bring further awareness to the rare combination of clinical features, along with the complex pathophysiology, which underlies Zieve syndrome. Additionally, we present a unique subtype of Zieve syndrome with bone marrow suppression as demonstrated by a paradoxically low reticulocyte count which benefited from the use of corticosteroids. Following an extensive review of the literature, it is evident that Zieve syndrome can be promptly identified by the classical triad of clinical features on presentation including hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice. Additionally, abdominal pain may not be as reliable of a clinical finding as once previously thought. We demonstrate that appropriate intervention, primarily alcohol cessation, can result in promising recovery for these patients. Ultimately, we hope that our contribution to the knowledge of Zieve syndrome may lead to improved patient outcomes and a more robust treatment protocol in the future. We also hope to increase recognition of this rare variant of Zieve syndrome.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was taken from the patient before writing this case.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author was individually involved in and made substantial contributions to conceptions and designs, acquisition of data, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting, and editing the manuscript.

Studies have shown that mutations in the 3p14 region and STK11 gene are closely related to the pathogenesis of PJS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Since it can be complicated by a variety of serious complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, intussusception, and malignant transformation, PJS seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to have a correct understanding of it, actively prevent and treat it, and follow these patients closely. Some studies have reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> that active endoscopic polypectomy has positive significance for preventing polyp-induced obstruction, bleeding, perforation, and malignant transformation, and reduces related complications and patient suffering. At present, the clinical treatment of this disease is mainly to solve the acute abdomen caused by PJS, such as intestinal obstruction, intussusception, hemorrhage, and complications such as malignant transformation.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 26-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of “abdominal pain for 7 h”. The patient had intermittent abdominal pain for more than half a year, and the abdominal pain worsened 7 h ago, accompanied by vomiting, with no blood in the stool, and no history of weight loss. The patient had been diagnosed with PJS in childhood (diagnosed in other hospitals, specific treatment unknown). In the past, open bowel polypectomy was performed for intestinal polyps in another hospital. Later, he complained that he underwent surgery for intestinal prolapse (with the specific name of the disease and the specific surgical method unknown). His mother and sister suffered from PJS and mother died of intestinal malignancy. His vital signs were normal. Mucocutaneous pigmentation was noted on his lips, palms, and soles of the feet . Tension of abdominal muscles, tenderness of the whole abdomen, the tenderness around the umbilicus and the left lower quadrant are more obvious, and bowel sounds are significantly reduced.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Melanin spots  were seen on the patient’s lips (a), palms of fingers (b) and soles of feet (c). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Mucocutaneous pigmentation was noted on his lips, palms, and soles of the feet. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed that the small intestine of about groups 4 and 5 in the left middle and lower abdominal region having concentric circles changes; and the intestinal wall was obviously edematous and widened ; and slightly high-density shadow changes can be seen in the bowel . Based on the past history, clinical manifestations, and CT imaging examination, a diagnosis of PJS with multiple polyps in jejunum with intussusception was made.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Concentric changes and obstruction of the bowel (a), high-density mass in the bowel (b) . |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. The exploration showed: about 300 mL of pale red exudate in the abdominal cavity, about 150 cm away from the ligament of Treitz, and the distal jejunum is inserted into the proximal jejunum , forming a length of about 40-cm jejunum-jejunum intussusception, part of the bowel showed congestion and swelling changes, and the proximal jejunum was obviously dilated. We performed the intussusception reposition, and found multiple lumps in the dilated bowel, the size of the lump is about 1.5 - 2.5 cm . Considering the jejunal mass and intussusception, it was decided to perform partial jejunectomy and side-to-side anastomosis of the small intestine. Several polypoid masses were found in the excised bowel , with a maximum size of about 1.5 × 1.5 cm and soft texture. Postoperative pathological immunohistochemistry showed: jejunum Peutz-Jeghers polyps, which were multiple .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Jejunum-jejunum intussusception and obstruction of the intestinal segment (a), multiple mass-like changes in the intestinal tract (b), several polypoid tumors, the largest size is about 1.5 × 1.5 cm, the texture is soft and pedunculated (c) (shown by arrow). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 4. Pathological immunohistochemical indication. The central smooth muscle showed tree branching pattern changes, and glands can be seen in the surface mucosa. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】The postoperative recovery was well, and the follow-up was good 1 month after discharge.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】PJS is also called “dark spot-polyposis syndrome” because of its clinical manifestations of the lips and finger end skin and mucous membranes accompanied by melanotic plaque changes and accompanied by multiple polyposis changes in the digestive tract. The disease was first reported by Peutz in 1921 and was systematically described by Jeghers et al in 1949, so it was named “Peutz-Jeghers syndrome”. It is more common in children and adolescents and is autosomal dominant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Some studies have reported that about 30% are inherited in families, and 70% may be caused by gene mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that among the many causes of PJS, its genes are mainly related to the mutation of a susceptibility gene called STK11/LKB1 on chromosome 19p13.3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. About 66-94% of genetic deletions occur in chromosome 19 (19p13.3) on the broken arm of LKB1/STK11 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Among them, Chen et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> found in the comparison of familial and sporadic cases of PJS, the LKB1 gene mutation rate was as high as 85.7% in familial PJS, and it was 63.2% in all PJS patients. Some studies have confirmed the LKB1/STK11 mutation in hereditary colorectal tumor-related genes in polyp tissue of PJS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Therefore, looking at the current research reports on PJS, it is indicated that LKB1 gene mutation is the main factor leading to the occurrence of familial PJS. In terms of genetic disease, whether PJS is caused by a single gene mutation, or a combination of multiple gene mutations remains to be further studied.\n\n【17】Among PJS patients, about 95% of them have skin and mucous membrane melanoma changes, most of whom are young and adolescents. Mostly, it is scattered in the skin, mucous membranes, fingers, toes, and other parts. Melanin plaques often appear on the face, nose, lips, and oral mucosa, and can also occur on the eyelids and anus. After some patients grow to puberty, a small number of melanin spots gradually fade away. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that this may have a tendency to become cancerous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Another important feature of PJS is polyps, which can be found anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The jejunum and ileum polyps are the most common, accounting for 60% to 90% of PJS polyps, followed by colorectal polyps, about 50% to 64%. In addition, there are a small number of clinical cases and literatures showing that PJS patients also show polyp characteristics in some organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the gallbladder, nasal cavity, bronchus, bladder mucosa and ureter mucosa, etc. \\[ 13 \\- 16 \\]. In terms of histopathological characteristics, polyps are mainly divided into lipomas, hamartomas, inflammatory polyps, hyperplastic polyps, adenoma polyps, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Among them, most of the polyps in PJS patients are hamartoma polyps, and they may coexist with various polyps. A few studies have reported that a small number of PJS polyps manifested as adenomatous polyps alone in pathological features. From this we can see that PJS polyps are mainly manifested as hamartoma and adenomatous polyps, and other types of polyps are relatively rare. Because the PJS polyps are mainly hamartoma polyps, their malignant transformation rate is relatively low, but there are also adenomatous polyps, which lead to a relatively increased risk of cancerous transformation. In addition, some studies have found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> that hamartoma polyps themselves may gradually transform into cancer under a certain mechanism. In the process of disease evolution, hamartoma gradually develops into adenoma and finally into cancer. Other studies have shown that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, PJS not only has the above-mentioned carcinogenesis mechanism, but also has a carcinogenesis pathway called de novo mechanism, which is mainly used to explain the carcinogenesis and development of other organs other than gastrointestinal-related malignant tumors. Relevant studies have reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 19 \\]</u> that the risk of cancer in patients with PJS is 15 times that of normal people, and the risks of gastrointestinal tumors are 39% for colon cancer, 29% for gastric cancer, 36% for pancreatic cancer, and 0.5% for esophageal cancer; and there is evidence showing that the average age of cancer in most patients is about 40 years old.\n\n【19】Most PJS patients were admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain, intussusception, and obstruction as the first symptoms; and most of them were treated by emergency surgery. For some asymptomatic gastrointestinal polyps, the diagnosis is mainly based on medical history, family history, physical examination (characteristics of melanin spots), combined with gastrointestinal endoscopy, gastrointestinal imaging, and histopathology. In this case report, the patient underwent emergency surgery for abdominal pain and acute abdomen due to intussusception obstruction. Multiple scattered polyp lesions of the small intestine were found during the operation, and finally PJS was confirmed according to the histopathological results. Reviewing the literature on the treatment of PJS, the focus of clinical treatment of PJS is mainly on the early treatment of gastrointestinal polyposis. Some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 20 \\]</u> have found that, for the treatment of PJS gastrointestinal polyps, a comprehensive system of endoscopic techniques, close follow-up, combining surgery and preventive drugs is an effective diagnosis and treatment plan. Among them, endoscopic polyp resection is the main method, and for those with scattered polyps, endoscopic resection can be performed in different times. Some studies have reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> that double-balloon enteroscopy is of great value and significance in the diagnosis and treatment of PJS. It not only allows the inspection of the entire small bowel, but also facilitates treatment such as microscopic resection, thereby avoiding some surgical resection of the bowel. In the face of difficult endoscopic resection of polyps, malignant transformation, and acute abdomen in patients with PJS, surgical treatment still has an irreplaceable role. On the other hand, from the perspective of genetics, as PJS is a dominant hereditary disease, due to its own particularity, both endoscopic and surgical treatments are still limited treatments in the treatment of PJS. In recent years, with the deepening of domestic and foreign research on PJS, Rossi et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u> found that they established a PJS nude mouse model in animal experiments and found that the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the nude mouse model was increased. At the same time, COX-2 is also highly expressed in hamartoma polyps in PJS patients. Another study found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u> that the application of COX-2 inhibitor drugs (celecoxib) can significantly reduce the incidence of tumor in animals, and to a certain extent reduce the incidence of polyps in patients with PJS. Therefore, COX-2 can be used as a potential new target for the treatment of PJS polyps and PJS syndrome, but further research is needed.\n\n【20】Through the case report, we have a certain understanding of the clinical manifestations, pathogenic genes, pathogenesis, and treatment of PJS. However, its specific pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, and further research on its mechanism and genetics is required, in order to provide better solutions for clinical diagnosis and treatment of PJS. At present, the treatment of PJS is still mainly endoscopic treatment, with surgical intervention if necessary. We believe that in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PJS patients in the future, gene therapy may become the dominant in order to achieve the purpose of cure.\n\n【21】Learning points\n\n【22】PJS is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease. Through this case, we have a certain understanding of its clinical manifestations, pathogenic genes and treatments. Considering the subsequent catastrophic complications, endoscopic examination and treatment should be actively recommended for such patients in clinical practice. Active prevention and close follow-up can improve the quality of life of PJS-patients.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr. Gao Zhou and Dr. Shui Ping Tang for their supports and all staff of the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery of Hengyang Central Hospital involved in the care of the patient.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no competing interests.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient authorized the main author, in written form, to publish this case report and all case data.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hai Hua Jiang wrote the paper.

Here we present a case of OPMD, who was initially admitted as aspiration pneumonia and later on was found out to have underlying OPMD.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 75-year-old male presented to the hospital with a complaint of fever, cough of 1 week duration and worsening of 2 years of chronic dysphagia. His cough was productive with yellowish phlegm which was not blood mixed. He was having a persistent fever and started noticing difficulty breathing even on rest for which he presented to the emergency department. His dysphagia started around 2 years ago which progressively got worse with difficulty swallowing mainly solid meals. He had modified his swallowing technique by himself to avoid choking and he had no previous history of aspiration. His past medical history was adult-onset bilateral ptosis that was first noticed when he was around mid-50s. His ptosis had also progressed significantly over the years and he was offered blepharoplasty by an ophthalmologist in past which he had refused. His father and paternal grandfather also had a history of ptosis and dysphagia. His father had deceased from a complication of aspiration pneumonia. On physical examination, he was febrile and tachypneic with bilateral rhonchi on chest auscultation. Bilateral ptosis was present . Cranial nerve examination was intact. The motor exam revealed 3/5 weakness of the bilateral infraspinatus and other shoulder girdle muscles. Distal arm and forearm muscle groups including biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, wrist flexors and extensors and intrinsic hand muscles were 5/5. Muscle strength in the bilateral lower extremities was 5/5 in all muscle groups tested. The sensation was intact throughout. Ataxia was absent. He had an elevated WBC of 19,000 and a chest CT revealed consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes and in the right lower lobe posteriorly . A modified barium swallow showed frank tracheal aspiration . An acetylcholine receptor antibody test was negative. An electromyogram and nerve conduction study revealed a generalized myopathic process with the absence of myotonia. With a history of adult-onset bilateral ptosis and progressive dysphagia with aspiration complication along with the positive family history of ptosis and dysphagia, there was a strong suspicion for OPMD. Genetic testing was performed, which was positive as it detected GCG expansion, with expanded allele size of 13 repeats, in the poly(A) binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) gene, which is associated with OPMD and thus the diagnosis of OPMD was established. He was treated with antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia along with supportive management. Initially, the patient required high flow oxygen but with resolution of pneumonia his respiratory status improved and he was not requiring any oxygen support at the time of discharge. He was offered surgical corrective measures to help him with his ptosis and dysphagia but he declined any surgical interventions. At the time of discharge, the patient was offered a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement to help him maintain proper nutritional status due to underlying severe dysphagia, which he accepted. Genetic counseling for his family members was recommended after his diagnosis.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The prevalence of OPMD is highest in the French-Canadian population of the province of Quebec and among Bukhara Jews living in Israel. In the United States, the majority of affected individuals are of French-Canadian extraction, Ashkenazi Jews, and the Hispanic population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In Europe, the estimated prevalence is 1:100,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. OPMD is a rare form of genetic muscular dystrophy which is inherited mostly as autosomal dominant and rarely as an autosomal recessive disorder. OPMD is characterized by ocular and pharyngeal muscle involvement, and it commonly presents with adulthood onset ptosis, dysphagia and proximal muscle weakness in advanced cases along with a positive family history of ptosis and dysphagia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Our patient had all the classic clinical features of OPMD, with positive family history along with proximal muscle weakness in upper extremity which points towards advance stage of disease but was not diagnosed until late as OPMD is easily overlooked and underdiagnosed. The PABPN1 gene mutation contains GCG trinucleotide repeats, and the expansion of this repeat leads to OPMD, which was detected in our patient. The confirmatory diagnosis is made by detection of an expansion of a GCG trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Muscle biopsy is warranted only in individuals with suspected OPMD who have two normal PABPN1 alleles. Unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions are seen in muscle biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Currently, treatment is supportive as no therapeutic intervention is currently available for patients with OPMD. Surgical interventions like blepharoplasty and cricopharyngeal myotomy can temporarily help manage symptoms related to the ptosis and dysphagia, respectively. Malnutrition and recurrent aspiration pneumonia are the potential complications that reduce the life expectancy of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. PABPN1 gene therapy for OPMD is in the experimental phase. The recently published article showed that the treatment of mouse model of OPMD with PABPN1 gene therapy significantly reduces the muscle fibrosis, level of insoluble aggregates, reverts muscle strength and normalizes the muscle transcriptome. The efficacy of this gene therapy was further confirmed in cells derived from OPMD patients. These findings show a promising pathway towards a gene replacement approach for OPMD treatment in future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the participating authors disclose no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authorship</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors had access to the data and played a role in writing and critical review of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Yes.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Its prevalence increases with age to affect over 19% of people older than 80 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As an age-related disorder, RLS is often seen in long-term care patients. RLS has hallmark features of discomfort or paresthesias in the lower legs that are relieved by movement. RLS is also commonly associated with observable periodic limb movements of sleep, which are involuntary stereotyped jerking movements of the limbs.\n\n【2】Dementia is also extremely common in long-term care settings, with prevalence in residents 65 years and older recently measured at 45% for men, and 52 % for women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In patients with dementia, having RLS as a comorbidity has been associated with nocturnal agitation behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These disruptions can create problems for nursing home residents including sleep deprivation and a decreased quality of life. Our case demonstrates this type of situation, along with the diagnostic difficulties surrounding RLS in patients with dementia.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Our patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia and challenging behavior who lives in a skilled nursing facility. Her past history included difficulties with sleep disruptions. In 2000, she stated that she had experienced symptoms of RLS since her teenage years. She was living independently in her home and took gabapentin and carbidopa/levodopa to treat her RLS symptoms. Later in 2001, her gabapentin was tapered off and her carbidopa/levodopa dosage was increased to counter worsening RLS symptoms. In 2003, pramipexole was added to her treatment, and in 2006, carbidopa/levodopa was discontinued while continuing pramipexole. In September 2008, she was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation, and the hospital team noted problems in her memory and executive function, which her family confirmed had developed over a period of years. After dismissal from the hospital, she returned home but refused home health care. In November 2008, she experienced a fall and was eventually discharged to a long-term care (LTC) facility in light of further decline in memory.\n\n【5】Her RLS symptoms started to worsen while she was in LTC. In 2010, the medical team started treatment with gabapentin. She experienced agitation, which disrupted her sleep and provoked aggression towards staff. She was prescribed quetiapine for the agitation, presumed secondary to her dementia, but these symptoms persisted. The patient was unable to communicate any subjective experience of RLS symptoms, due to her cognitive decline. The primary concerns from the medical and nursing teams involved the potential challenges of RLS, as well as her dementia. The team increased the pramipexole, which helped improve her symptoms of agitation.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Current diagnostic criteria for RLS, published by the National Institute of Health and the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), are based entirely on the subjective accounts of symptoms by patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These diagnostic criteria are not applicable to patients with difficulties in memory, cognition, or communication. Patients with dementia and concurrent RLS have been previously shown to be incapable of reliably answering questions during an RLS diagnostic interview 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The IRLSSG also offered diagnostic criteria for patients with cognitive impairment, essentially consisting of observed patterns of behavior suggesting the subjective experience of RLS detailed in the diagnostic criteria for typical patients. Unfortunately, these criteria have not been formally studied or validated, like those applying to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】These circumstances suggest that numerous patients with dementia and RLS are at-risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating their sleep disruption and cognitive difficulties, and leading to a decreased quality of life. Positive results from more objective diagnostic modalities, involving immobilization combined with electromyography, have been shown to be correlated with RLS in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, but a large scale assessment showing the value of these tests has not yet been completed. Empiric treatment may be necessary for patients with cognitive impairment who are also thought to suffer from RLS, particularly in LTC settings. Nursing home providers should attempt treatment or modifications of treatment for RLS in appropriate residents. Observation by family and nursing staff is essential to evaluate improvement in the residentÃ­s quality of life.\n\n【9】RLS has notably been found to be correlated with iron deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Providers should screen for iron deficiency in all patients with suspected RLS, and residents should receive iron supplementation when their serum ferritin is below 50 Âµg/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our patient experienced RLS continuously throughout her life, including when her serum ferritin was measured at 136 Âµg/L in 2004, suggesting her symptoms had a different etiology.\n\n【10】First-line pharmacologic therapy for RLS includes dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> and ropinirole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, titrated upwards to a suitable dose. These agents commonly result in an augmentation effect, with symptoms appearing earlier in the day and medication effectiveness decreasing over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. This effect creates the challenging need to modify medications in residents who cannot communicate symptoms. The treatment regimen for our patientÃ­s RLS included pramipexole for several years, and as her symptoms have worsened, an appropriate adjunct, gabapentin, was added.\n\n【11】Levodopa/carbidopa can also be used as a baseline treatment for intermittent RLS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 13 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, augmentation and rebound symptoms in the morning commonly develop with this treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Clonazepam can be a useful adjunct therapy in patients with additional causes of poor sleep, with temazepam being recommended for patients with late-night awakenings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These long-acting benzodiazepines may not be ideal in residents with dementia, due to their adverse effects on cognition and risk of falls. Opioids should be reserved for treatment in refractory cases of RLS, with codeine or tramadol to start, and higher-strength opioids used only in the most refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Again, the risk of falls and sedation should be considered with opioids. Some medications commonly used in LTC may worsen RLS, including antidepressants, neuroleptics, dopamine agonists, and sedating antihistamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These should be discontinued if possible.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】With the subjective nature of accepted diagnostic criteria, there is a high-risk of RLS going unnoticed or untreated in LTC patients with dementia. RLS can be a significant contributor to sleep disturbance, agitation, and decreased quality of life in these patients. There is a need for further research to validate objective criteria for RLS diagnosis in patients such as ours, who experience cognitive and communication difficulties due to their dementia. Nevertheless, many treatment options exist for RLS, and they may be pursued empirically in patients with dementia and possible RLS, even in the face of inapplicable diagnostic criteria.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have none to report.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

At that time, her CRP was in the negative range (< 0.3 mg/dL), but her procalcitonin (PCT) was slightly high (0.06 ng/mL) in her blood exam . Because of the mild elevation of PCT, the medication of ampicillin tablet (AMPC), which was prescribed from the previous hospital, was continued for 2 weeks in our hospital, and the PCT was still remained mild positive (0.06 ng/mL) in Figure 1 . We decided to stop the medication by the reason why the PCT was stable and the CRP was almost negative. However, the woman had a high fever again 1 week after stopped the AMPC medication, and then, the patient was entered into our hospital. At that time, both CRP (6.1 mg/dL) and PCT (0.07 ng/mL) were elevated as shown in Figure 1 . Immediately, we began to administrate some antibiotics of cefazolin (CEZ), tosulfoxacin (TFLX) and AMPC based on data of her blood culture for drug sensitiveness against MSSA as same as previously.

He had been in his baseline state of compromised health until about 7 days prior to this admission. He began noticing headaches that were located in the back of his neck, and were unremitting in nature. Then, 1 - 2 days prior to the admission, he started to have gait abnormalities. The patient denied having these symptoms before.\n\n【4】He had been on immunosuppressant agents including oral tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily, oral azathioprine 200 mg daily, and oral prednisone 5 mg daily. In addition, he had been on antibiotic prophylaxis including oral azithromycin 250 mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 800 mg/160 mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n\n【5】His vital signs included a temperature of 97.9 °F (36.6 °C), heart rate of 74/min, respiratory rate of 18/min, blood pressure of 132/82 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The physical examination was unremarkable. He was alert, awake, and conversant with clear speech and mental status. His cranial nerves were well preserved with no nystagmus. Dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia were present, and were more obvious on the right side of the body. He moved all four extremities reasonably with adequate muscle bulk and tone. There was no frank pronator drift or leg lag.\n\n【6】Laboratory findings included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.6/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelet count of 99,000/µL, and hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL. The chemistry panel revealed sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mg/dL, calcium of 9.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL and chloride of 101 mg/dL.\n\n【7】A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain  revealed a 2.0 cm lobulated rim-enhancing right cerebellar mass with central restricted diffusion consistent with abscess.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sagittal view. There is a 2.0 cm lobulated ring-enhancing right cerebellar mass with central restricted diffusion consistent with abscess.

A peripherally inserted central catheter was placed and he was discharged home on intravenous (IV) meropenem and vancomycin for a duration of 6 weeks.\n\n【10】On December 10, 2014, the patient was admitted once more for worsening headaches and photophobia. The headaches started 5 days before his admission, and were located behind his right eye. He was very unstable on his feet, and the left side of his body displayed weakness. He denied any nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, fever, chills or sweats. His vital signs were within normal limits and the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【11】Laboratory findings included a WBC count of 7.5/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelet count of 95,000/µL, and hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL. Electrolytes demonstrated sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mg/dL, chlorine of 103 mg/dL, BUN of 20 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL.\n\n【12】A repeat MRI of the brain  revealed a right 1.6 × 1.8 cm rim-enhancing right cerebellar mass with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema. The patient underwent a stealth directed resection of the right cerebellar brain abscess. Samples from this procedure ultimately grew fungus . The patient was empirically treated with course of IV liposomal amphotericin B for a duration of 6 weeks and voriconazole for a duration of 12 weeks. The patient was treated successfully and his neurologic deficits improved.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. MRI, sagittal view.

C. bantiana is a member of the order Chaetothyriales , which is often referred to as “black yeast-like fungi” due to the ability of some representatives to produce budding cells as well as dark hyphae, depending on the life cycle and environmental conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It is the most common cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by the dematiaceous pigmented fungi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The pigmented nature of this organism has been shown to be due to melanin production, and this feature may assist the organism with evading host defenses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Although the portal of entry for infection is frequently obscure, many fungi are thought to be blood-borne from the lungs or intestines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Primary infection in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses can subsequently spread to the CNS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It can present in the form of cerebritis, meningitis, or abscess (most common clinical manifestation) \\[ 5 , 9 \\- 11 \\].\n\n【20】The risk factors for C. bantiana infection include those which suppress cell-mediated immunity, such as organ transplantation, cancer, and immunosuppressive agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In one study by Chakrabarti et al, researchers revealed that the majority of these cases were found in males who came from Asian countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Interestingly, C. bantiana infection was nearly equally distributed in the immunocompetent and the immunosuppressed hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The most common symptom was headaches, followed by hemiparesis, seizures, and altered sensorium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Histopathological and microbiological examinations are the diagnostic tool of choice since fungal brain abscess cannot be differentiated from bacterial cerebral abscess, primary CNS tumor, and cerebral metastasis by imaging studies, according to Huang et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, a study done by Hauck et al mentioned that magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging apparent diffusion coefficient MRI may add valuable information for the imaging differential diagnosis of fungal abscess versus bacterial abscess versus high-grade glioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. There has also been use of genetic analysis to help in the diagnosis of C. bantiana in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Current treatment recommendations in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients from the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice regarding pheohyphomycosis identify itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole as first-line therapy \\[ 17 \\- 19 \\]. Amphotericin B is not recommended as a first-line therapy in the setting of cerebral abscess due to concern for excess failure rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. However, our study noted voriconazole and amphotericin B were the most commonly used antifungal agents. Voriconazole has been used in a number of case reports due to its broad activity against dematiaceous fungi and its good cerebrospinal fluid penetration. The use of itraconazole has excellent brain tissue penetration and can be used if voriconazole cannot be tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Flucytosine is effective; however, its use is limited due to bone marrow suppression, especially in immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Fluconazole and echinocandins are not effective against C. bantiana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The Staphylococcus sciuri was ultimately believed to be a skin contaminant. This delayed appropriate antifungal therapy and underscores the need for surgical resection of the abscess for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【24】We reviewed the literature  of patients who underwent SOT that were subsequently on immunosuppressant therapy and developed this rare CNS infection. The average age was 39 years and the median age was 38 years. There were six males and four females. Five patients had kidney transplant, two patients had liver transplant, three patients had heart transplant, and two patients had lung transplant. The most common types of immunosuppressive agents used were corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. The most common presentation was headache. Thirty percent of the patients had an abscess located in the parietal region and cerebellum, 20% in the temporoparietal region, and 10% in the frontal region. The most common antifungal agent used was amphotericin B. Six patients expired and three patients were cured.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Review of Literature of Cladophialophora Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Patients \\[ 21 \\- 29 \\] |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Cerebral pheohyphomycosis is a deadly infection with high morbidity and mortality, despite aggressive treatment. Complete excision of brain lesions may provide better results than simple aspiration. An aggressive medical and surgical approach is warranted in treating these infections to optimize outcomes. Although rare, it is important for clinicians to keep this fungal infection in their differential diagnosis.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Spinal anesthesia initially gained popularity as it was shown to be a suitable alternative to general anesthesia in the high-risk, former preterm neonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-7 \\]</u>. In this population, spinal anesthesia was used instead of general anesthesia to limit the incidence of postoperative complications, especially apnea and postoperative respiratory dysfunction, which was noted following general anesthesia with halothane. However, its use decreased as the risk of apnea was shown to be limited with the introduction of the new volatile anesthetic agents, sevoflurane and desflurane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. More recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of spinal anesthesia based on findings from animal models and retrospective cohort studies regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia during the neonatal period or infancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10-14 \\]</u>. Despite the lack of prospective trials to clearly demonstrate such issues, spinal anesthesia has been reintroduced as a means of avoiding general anesthesia during the potentially vulnerable time period of central nervous system development. Additionally, in patients with significant co-morbid conditions, spinal anesthesia may offer a safety advantage over general anesthesia for brief (< 90 min) surgical procedures. The authors report the use of spinal anesthesia during circumcision in a 19-month-old, 12.1 kg infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who had undergone hybrid palliation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The applications of spinal anesthesia in high-risk patients with co-morbid congenital heart disease (CHD) are reviewed, techniques are described, and potential adverse hemodynamic and respiratory effects are discussed with emphasis on the patient with palliated HLHS.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 19-month-old toddler (weight 12.1 kg) with HLHS (aortic atresia and mitral stenosis type) who had completed the stage I hybrid procedure and a comprehensive stage II palliation, presenting for circumcision due to phimosis. Medications at the time of surgery included enalapril 1.5 mg twice daily, digoxin 50 µg twice daily, and aspirin 40.5 mg daily. His aspirin was held for 7 days prior to the scheduled surgery. He had no known drug allergies and no new laboratory tests were performed prior to the procedure. Due to his extensive cardiac history and a history of the need for prolonged postoperative ventilation following his previous cardiac surgical procedures, the surgeon had a frank discussion with the family regarding the potential risks of this elective surgery and offered ongoing observation of the urologic condition. Despite this, the family still desired surgery. At this point, a discussion was held including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist regarding potential spinal anesthesia in an effort to avoid general anesthesia and airway instrumentation. The patient was deemed a suitable candidate, and the option was presented to the parents who consented to proceed with spinal anesthesia. On the morning of surgery, the patient was held nil per os (NPO) for 2 h for clear liquids and for 8 h for solids. The patient’s vital signs were blood pressure 104/61 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 85% on room air, and temperature of 36.3 °C. In the preoperative holding area, LMX <sup>® </sup> cream (4% topical lidocaine, Ferndale Laboratories Inc. Ferndale, MI) was applied to the lumbar area to minimize discomfort with the placement of the spinal needle. The patient was transported to the operating room and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. He was positioned in a curled sitting position. Using aseptic technique, a 1.5 inch, 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted at the L <sub>4-5 </sub> interspace. Free flow of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained and 1.2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (0.5 mg/kg) with epinephrine 1:200,000 and clonidine (1 µg/kg) was injected through the spinal needle. The patient was positioned supine and a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the right foot. Prior to surgical incision, the adequacy of the spinal blockade was confirmed by motor blockade of the lower extremities and absence of response to skin prick. During the procedure, the patient breathed room air with a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose solution in place. The oxygen saturation ranged from 80% to 85%. Due to slight irritability, a single dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg) was administered intravenously prior to the start of procedure. The patient’s heart rate prior to spinal anesthesia was 160 beats/min with a blood pressure of 100 - 110/60 - 80 mm Hg. After spinal anesthesia, the heart rate decreased to a nadir of 80 beats/min and the blood pressure ranged from 80 - 100/40 - 50 mm Hg. The patient tolerated the 30-min procedure without incident and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. After meeting discharge criteria, he was discharged to home on the day of surgery.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】HLHS is a complex CHD characterized by abnormal development of left-sided cardiac structures, leading to inadequate systemic perfusion following post-natal closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Surgical management of HLHS has traditionally been approached with a Norwood procedure during the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. This involves extensive reconstruction of the aortic arch, thereby connecting the right ventricle with the systemic circulation and placement of a shunt to provide pulmonary blood flow. A more recent approach is the hybrid procedure, which combines interventional catheter-based stenting of the PDA to maintain systemic output, balloon atrial septostomy, and surgically placed pulmonary artery bands to limit pulmonary blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The hybrid approach defers aortic arch reconstruction with the need for cardiopulmonary bypass until the stage II procedure, when the patient is 4 - 8 months of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 18 \\]</u>. The proposed advantages of this strategy include improved hemodynamic stability after stage I and reduction in risk of brain and myocardial injury by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic arch reconstruction in the early neonatal period.\n\n【6】Infants with HLHS frequently have associated conditions requiring non-cardiac surgical procedures. Given the associated co-morbid CHD, there is an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality in this patient population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In general, elective surgery should be carefully considered in such a patient, and a well-informed discussion between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and parents should occur prior to proceeding. Despite such discussions, as was the case with our patient, families may still request surgical intervention.\n\n【7】In an effort to avoid the potential deleterious effects of general anesthesia, airway instrumentation, and the potential need for positive pressure ventilation, spinal anesthesia was chosen for our patient. Although first reported in a pediatric patient as early as 1899, spinal anesthesia never gained significant popularity in pediatric anesthesia, being used in the 1980s as a means of avoiding apnea following halothane anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is currently seeing a resurgence as an alternative to general anesthesia, as it may limit the potential deleterious long-term neurocognitive effects of inhalational and intravenous anesthetic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Following the comprehensive stage II procedure on the hybrid pathway for patients with HLHS, the perioperative concerns include maintaining adequate pulmonary blood flow through the Glenn anastomosis. As pulmonary blood flow is passive, this is accomplished by maintaining adequate preload, avoiding increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, and limiting the use of medications with negative inotropic effects. Avoidance of prolonged NPO times, intravenous hydration while NPO, and fluid loading prior to anesthetic induction may be helpful in avoiding intravascular volume depletion. Endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and the use of positive end expiratory pressure may all decrease pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In our patient, we chose to use spinal anesthesia as a means of providing surgical anesthesia while avoiding the need for endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and the use of intravenous and inhalational anesthetic agents with potentially negative inotropic effects.\n\n【9】The obvious concern regarding the use of spinal anesthesia in this scenario is the potential for adverse effects on hemodynamic function. However, spinal anesthesia (even high blockade) has been shown to have limited effects on hemodynamic function in infants and children less than 6 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Even deliberate high spinal anesthesia used for repair of PDA in neonates produced only a mild decline in blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Unlike the adult population, sympathetic blockade with hypotension rarely occurs. This has traditionally been attributed to the incomplete development of the sympathetic nervous system in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. However, analysis of heart rate variability during the administration of spinal anesthesia in infants suggests that the reflex response to high spinal anesthesia is primarily due to diminished parasympathetic tone that offsets the blockade of sympathetic function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. This has been supported by clinical studies of spinal anesthesia in infants demonstrating that only a small percentage of patients required treatment with intravenous fluids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. In our patient, no clinically significant changes in blood pressure or oxygen saturation were noted after the administration of spinal anesthesia. The decrease in heart rate to 80 beats/min was likely from the administration of intravenous dexmedetomidine to provide sedation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Despite these data, the potential for hemodynamic changes should always be considered and appropriate monitoring be employed with ready access to resuscitation medications if needed. The potential safety of this approach is further supported by observational studies reporting no clinically significant reduction in blood pressure or oxygen saturation in high-risk infants with CHD during spinal anesthesia  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28-36 \\]</u>. In these studies in infants and children with CHD, spinal anesthesia provided stable hemodynamic parameters without excessive hypotension requiring the administration of fluid or inotropic agents.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Previous Reports of Spinal Anesthesia in Infants With Congenital Heart Disease |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】With the increasing use of spinal anesthesia in pediatric anesthesia, there have been several detailed reviews highlighting the important aspects of this technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 37 , 38 \\]</u>. In the neonate or infant, the sitting position is generally preferred for spinal anesthesia. The head should be slightly extended to avoid airway obstruction. Superficial analgesia with a topical local anesthetic cream is recommended to prevent pain during needle insertion. While we prefer to avoid the use of sedative agents, other investigators have suggested the administration of midazolam or ketamine to provide sedation during performance of the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. At our institution, we prefer a non-pharmacological approach with a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose oral solution whenever possible. Furthermore, we generally place the intravenous cannula in the foot after spinal anesthesia has been initiated. In our practice, a 1.5”, 22-gauge spinal needle with a stylet is used. After the epidermis and dermis are punctured, the stylet is removed as there may be only a subtle pop as the intrathecal space is entered. Once free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is obtained, the local anesthetic solution is injected. We generally aspirate only at the end of injection to clear the hub of the needle of remaining local anesthetic solution. The two commonly used local anesthetic agents are tetracaine or bupivacaine, with dose ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg/kg. Higher intrathecal local anesthetic requirements in infants result from the larger per-kilogram volume of CSF compared to adults and proportionally greater blood flow leading to faster drug uptake. Although hyperbaric tetracaine solutions were previously used most commonly, many institutions, including ours, currently use isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%. These dosing regimens will provide approximately 90 min of surgical anesthesia depending on the dermatomes involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. The addition of epinephrine or clonidine may be used to prolong the duration of surgical anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>. After performing the spinal, the infant is placed in the supine position with care taken not to raise the legs above the body to avoid unintentional high block. Though this should not be required with isobaric solutions, we nonetheless observe this precaution as an added safety measure.\n\n【12】Absolute contraindications to spinal anesthesia include parental refusal, history of true allergy to the local anesthetic agent, ongoing systemic infection with bacteremia, clinically significant coagulation disturbances, and intracranial hypertension or hemorrhage. Reports in the literature have demonstrated a very low incidence of significant adverse effects with spinal anesthesia in neonates and infants. The relatively high failure rate of spinal anesthesia reported in the literature highlights the importance of developing a robust spinal anesthesia program to optimize successful outcomes for awake spinal anesthesia in these high-risk infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. With these caveats in mind, spinal anesthesia should be considered a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia in high-risk neonates and infants, especially those with co-morbid CHD. We also recommend effective communication between providers as well as the family to enhance the safety of this approach. This should include a well-informed discussion with the family and then physician-to-physician consultation to ensure proper preparation for such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These findings were consistent with diffuse proliferative GN with exudates features and IgG3 kappa deposits.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Dysproteinemia is characterized by excessive synthesis of Ig molecules or subunits, which may form paraprotein tissue deposits and produce an array of pathologic lesions, most commonly amyloidosis and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Several renal diseases are associated with dysproteinemias, among which those manifesting monoclonal glomerular deposits of IgG are relatively uncommon. Glomerular diseases associated with monoclonal gammopathies include multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal Ig deposition disease, type I cryoglobulinemic GN and amyloidosis. Of these, MM is the most commonly associated.\n\n【9】In 2004, Nasr et al reported 10 patients with an unusual form of glomerular injury caused by monoclonal IgG deposition that does not belong to a specific entity, which was termed PGNMID 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. On IF, the glomerular deposits were monoclonal, staining for a single light-chain isotype and a single γ heavy-chain subclass. Light microscopy (LM) exhibited endocapillary proliferative or membranoproliferative GN, and EM revealed granular electron-dense deposits, mimicking ordinary immune-complex GN. Clinical presentations included proteinuria in 100% of patients (mean 24-h urine protein 5.8 g), renal insufficiency in 80% (mean serum creatinine 2.8 mg/dL), and microhematuria in 60%. A monoclonal serum or urine protein was identified in 50% of patients, although none of them had evidence of MM or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【10】In a retrospective study done by Nasr et al in 2009, entitled “Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits”, 37 patients were studied, of which 60% were older than 50 years. This study represented one of the largest series of PGNMID 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】On SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), seven patients had a monoclonal spike (M-spike) in both serum and urine, and four patients had an M-spike detectable in the serum only. The M-spike was detected at presentation in 10 of these 11 patients but not until repeat testing 3 years after presentation in the remaining patient. In all of these 11 patients, the monoclonal proteins in both serum and urine had the same heavy- and light-chain isotypes as the monoclonal Ig deposited in the kidney. IgG heavy-chain subclass analysis of glomerular deposits, performed in nine of the 11 patients, showed IgG1 in five patients, IgG2 in two, and IgG3 in two. Of the remaining 26 patients who had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE, four underwent serum free light-chain assay; of these, three were found to have normal κ:λ ratio, and one (who had glomerular monoclonal IgG3κ deposition) had an elevated κ:λ ratio. In our case, the patient had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE and serum free light-chain assay revealed normal kappa/lambda ratio.\n\n【12】At presentation, all patients had proteinuria. The mean 24-h urine protein was 5.70 g (range 0.36 - 17.00 g). Proteinuria was in the nephrotic range in 68.6% of patients, and 48.6% developed full nephrotic syndrome. Microhematuria was documented in 77.1% of patients. In our case, the patient had a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.36 mg/mg and had microhematuria persistent on repeated testing.\n\n【13】Regarding pathologic findings, the most common histologic pattern seen on LM was predominantly membranoproliferative GN characterized by diffuse and global double-contoured glomerular capillary walls (GCWs) with mesangial cell interposition and mesangial expansion by increased mesangial cell number and matrix. Most of these cases also showed endocapillary hypercellularity, including focal macrophage infiltration. The second most common pattern was predominantly endocapillary proliferative GN, characterized by endocapillary hypercellularity and leukocyte infiltration. IF identified staining of GBM for subclasses of IgG (IgG3-kappa being the most frequent type). In all cases, granular electron-dense deposits were confined to the glomerular compartment. The glomerular immune deposits were primarily subendothelial and mesangial. Subepithelial deposits were less frequent, and were segmental in most cases. In our case, LM showed an acute proliferative and exudative GN and EM showed glomeruli with endocapillary proliferation and neutrophilic proliferation and revealed subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits (EDD) as well as mesangial and subendothelial deposits. IF revealed monoclonal IgG3-kappa deposits.\n\n【14】In our case, the findings of acute proliferative and exudative GN  and the subepithelial hump-shaped  immune-type electron dense deposits on LM and EM, respectively, would be most characteristic of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (APIGN). Interestingly, the lack of hypocomplementemia would be somewhat unusual for APIGN, and the immunofluorescence findings of IgG kappa restricted deposits are also atypical. The presence of deposits of a single Ig class which is IgG and a single light-chain, kappa, and the absence of other Igs, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Monoclonal IgG kappa deposits on IF. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】In fact, the diagnosis of PGNMID is based on the following criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>: findings on kidney biopsy of GN with 1) glomerular immune deposits staining positive for heavy-chain IgG, with negativity for Inga and IgM heavy-chains, thus confined to a single Ig class; 2) positive staining for a single IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4); 3) positive staining for a single light-chain isotype indicating monoclonality; 4) predominantly granular EDD in mesangial, subendothelial and/or subepithelial locations by EM, resembling immune complex GN; and 5) no clinical or laboratory evidence of cryoglobulines.\n\n【20】The etiology of PGNMID is not fully established. The majority of patients do not appear to have or develop hematologic malignancies during the published follow-up period. A small percentage of PGNMID cases were associated with neoplasm or viral infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-6 \\]</u>. In fact, there are 21 more patients with PGNMID that have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7-9 \\]</u>. One patient reported by Evans et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> with PGNMID with monoclonal IgG-κ deposits was found to have a follicular B-cell lymphoma infiltrating the kidney and expressing surface IgG-κ. That patient had a positive Bence Jones protein in the urine as well as a monoclonal IgM protein on serum IFE. None of the remaining 20 patients had any hematologic malignancy. In our case, the patient had no detectable M protein by SPEP/UPEP/IFE.\n\n【21】In regards to the clinical outcome of patients with PGNMID, prognosis is variable. For instance, most of the 16 patients with available follow-up data were treated with prednisone with or without other immunosuppressive agents. Five out of the 16 patients subsequently progressed to ESRD (31.3%). In the study by Nasr et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, on an average of 30 months of follow-up for 32 patients, 38% had complete or partial recovery, 38% had persistent renal dysfunction, and 22% progressed to ESRD. Correlates of ESRD were higher creatinine, percentage of glomerulosclerosis, and degree of interstitial fibrosis but not immunomodulatory treatment or presence of a monoclonal spike. In our case, the patient had a complete remission with prednisone therapy.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In summary, we describe a unique case of PGNMID occurring in a young patient following a viral illness with spontaneous remission. The findings of an acute proliferative and exudative GN and the subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits in the absence of hypocomplementemia, along with the presence of IgG kappa deposits, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case. The pathophysiology of this disease is not well understood. Is PGNMID another form of post-infectious glomerulopathy in which an infection activates or induces a transient/acute monoclonal Ig formation?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In 1937, based on electrical stimulation of the brain surface during surgery, Penfield and Boldrey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported that there was a broadly somatotopic representation of the different body parts in an arrangement in the primary motor cortex. The corresponding area to the shoulder is very small. Therefore, there have been only five reported cases of ISP due to a cortical infarction, and its vascular supply remains controversial \\[ 1 \\- 5 \\]. Here, we describe an additional case of ISP due to a cortical infarction, which proves that the corresponding area to the shoulder receives its blood from the cortical branch of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA).\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 75-year-old Japanese man with essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus suddenly presented with difficulty in lifting the right arm, despite no shoulder pain in April 2013. Therefore, the patient was admitted to our neurologic ward. Consciousness was alert. Blood pressure was 144/84 mmHg. The heart rate was 62/min. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial nerve impairment was not detected. The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 30 kg in the right and 26 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, right-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was detected. Manual muscle testing on the right upper limb demonstrated that pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi were at grade 4, despite trapezius, diceps brachii, triceps brachialis, brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris at grade 5. Bend, extension and wiggle were normal in both sides of the fingers. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathologic reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense) and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. Dysmetria, decomposition of movement and intension tremor were not observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were all normal. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the right side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. Based on these results, there were moderate weakness restricted to the right shoulder with normal joint flexibility, despite normal muscle strength in the elbow, wrist and fingers. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having right-sided ISP. Complete blood cell count was within normal ranges. Blood chemistry demonstrated elevated HbA1c level at 6.4%. Chest roentgenogram, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings were normal. Carotid ultrasonogram demonstrated a 3.9 mm diameter of hypoechoic plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery. Shoulder roentgenogram demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an infarct lesion in the territory of the cortical branch of the ACA on the left side . Cranial MR angiography demonstrated normal finding. By administration of intravenous ozagrel sodium 160 mg/day and the rehabilitation, marked blood pressure fluctuations were not observed and right-sided ISP was gradually resolved within 7 days. Thereafter, clopidogrel sulfate at 50 mg/day was initiated for prevention of cerebral infarction.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Cranial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.

In addition, Celebisoy et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> noted that the hand area in the cerebral motor cortex was located in the middle to lower portion of the anterior wall of the central sulcus. However, in the cerebral motor cortex, detailed vascular supply remains uncertain. Kim 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> speculated that the medial portion of the precentral knob representing topographically ulnar-sided fingers may correspond to the borderzone area between the ACA and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), whereas the lateral portion representing radial-sided fingers is supplied by distal MCA branches.\n\n【7】In 2003, Komatsu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> described a first case of ISP. Cranial MR imaging on the diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted demonstrated a small infarct lesion in the precentral gyrus on the ipsilateral side to shoulder palsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Echocardiogram did not demonstrate a source of embolus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

However, detailed etiology of infarction was not mentioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 2007, Uncini et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported a case of unilateral shoulder palsy due to a localized cortical infarction. An analysis of functional MR imaging confirmed the location of the corresponding area to the shoulder in the precentral gyrus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, muscle strength weakness of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii was also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Pathogenesis of infarction was not described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In 2011, Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> noted a third case of ISP. Diffusion-weighted cranial MR imaging demonstrated a cortical infarct lesion in the two serial axial images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, carotid ultrasonography and cranial MR angiography demonstrated normal findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Marked blood pressure fluctuations were not observed. Consequently, atherothrombosis was suspected as pathogenesis of cortical infarction. However, whether the infarcted artery was originated from the ACA or MCA could not be specified, because the lesion was very small 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In 2012, Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported a fourth case of ISP due to an infarction of the cortical branch of the MCA, which might be caused by atherothrombosis. In 2013, Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> described a case of shoulder palsy as well as sensory aphasia due to MCA embolism. Therefore, Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u> stated that the cortical branch of the MCA might supply blood for the corresponding area to the shoulder in the precentral gyrus. On the other hand, Kawasaki et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> noted a fifth case of ISP due to cerebral cortical infarction. Although cardiogenic embolism or Trousseau syndrome was suspected as its pathogenesis, infarcted artery could not be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】In our present patient with ISP, cranial MR imaging demonstrated an infarct lesion of the cortical branch of the ACA. Based on the carotid ultrasonogram finding, the infarction might be caused by artery to artery embolism. In conclusion, this is a sixth reported case of ISP due to a cortical infarction. We emphasize that the cortical branch of not only the MCA but also ACA might supply its blood for the corresponding area to the shoulder in the primary motor cortex.\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors state that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Tumor size approximated 3.5 cm . His past surgical history included coronary artery disease and a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) through median sternotomy 2 years ago.

The mass was attached to the interatrial septum. Complete excision of the mass was performed, including part of the interatrial septum . A patch was used to secure the opening of the interatrial septum. Continuous prolene 3/0 suture was used to close the left atrium and the bypass was terminated, after the transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the lack of air in the cardiac cavities. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged from the hospital after 5 days.

With this approach, we avoided possible complications of redo median sternotomy especially cardiac trauma, postoperative bleeding and distorted sternal closure or even sternal dehiscence.\n\n【11】We conclude that the use of right thoracotomy is a safe and effective way of treating patients who have been previously subjected to cardiac surgery and can be used as a standard procedure in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They tend to be large and multiple and pathologically belong to the pseudodiverticula, resulting from a mucosal and submucosal herniation through the muscular layer of the bowels’ wall in places of minor resistance to the intraluminal pressure such as the anatomic points where blood vessels penetrate the intestinal wall. They are generally asymptomatic but complications often occur as age advances with changes in the anatomy and physiology of the affected area. A wide spectrum of symptoms appear from mild epigastric or peri-umbilical discomfort, anaemia, bacterial overgrowth with flatulence, malabsorption syndrome, fatigue and weight loss, to more serious complications such as diverticulitis, acute inflammation, intestinal obstruction and perforation with localized abscess causing abdominal pain with or without signs of peritonitis.\n\n【2】The management of jejunal diverticulosis with perforated diverticulitis usually requires surgical referral. When the patient are stable, trial of nonsurgical management with intravenous antibiotics and other supportive measures alongside percutaneous CT-guided aspiration of localised intraperitoneal collections maybe suitable and avoid the need for laparotomy. The disease should always be taken in consideration in the presence of non specific GI symptoms, especially in the elderly population. We herein report the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian man presenting with one-day history of generalised abdominal pain, on a background of a chronic abdominal discomfort, pain and dyspepsia. Our patient underwent a laparotomy which revealed multiple small jejunal diverticula and two larger adjacent diverticula arising on the mesenteric border of the proximal jejunum. Both diverticula were inflamed and perforated. We also review the literature for this rare disease.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 63-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the emergency department with one-day history of generalised abdominal pain on a background of a chronic abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, pain, flatulence and borborygmi. No significant past medical history was noticed. OGD endoscopy and colonoscopy performed in the last two years were clear. The patient was admitted with right-side abdominal pain, localised at the lower right quadrant, rebound tenderness, pyrexia, significantly raised white cell count, inflammatory markers hypoalbuminemia and a raise to serum amylase. Chest and abdominal X-rays displayed only a few small intestinal air-fluid levels but not pneumoperitoneum. The patient was taken to the operating theatre on the first 24 hours considering appendicitis. A right paramedian incision exploratory laparotomy was performed which identified several small jejunal diverticula and two larger adjacent diverticula arising on the mesenteric border of the proximal jejunum . Both diverticula were inflammed and perforated containing a collection of pus . A careful proximal and distal to the diverticula bowel mobilisation was performed, followed by a resection of the affected segment, using a gastrointestinal anastomosis stapling device. The rest of the diverticula were preserved. A side to side jejuno-jejunal stapled anastomosis was created, followed by a copious peritoneal lavage. A Jackson-Pratt drain was left near the anastomosis. Pathology report described large diverticula and multiple foci of diverticulitis with perforations. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on the sixth day.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Intraoperative findings.

The aetiology is unclear. Studies have focused on abnormalities of the smooth muscles or of the myenteric plexus in order to explain intestinal dyskinesia. Manometric studies in such patients have also shown functional abnormalities. The results support the hypothesis that irregular intestinal contractions generate increased segmental intraluminal pressure, favouring the diverticula formation through the weakest point of the bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

Anemia due to chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding, iron or B12 deficiency has often been reported and commonly attributed to malabsorption syndrome with diarrhoea and steatorrhea. Malabsorption could be justified by the nonsynchronous peristaltic movement of the bowel, the dilation of the diverticula, the stasis of the intestinal content and the bacterial overgrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Considering that jejunal diverticulosis is asymptomatic for a long time in most of the cases, diagnosis is usually made when the disease becomes symptomatic or complicated. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed. It is a challenging disorder from a diagnostic perspective, with no truly reliable diagnostic tests. The literature has shown that computer tomography scan has variable reliability, while barium swallows are the gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Computer tomography may identify localized intestinal wall thickening due to inflammation or edema, abscesses, free abdominal fluids and pneumoperitoneum. Multislice CT seems to be promising in diagnosing jejunal diverticulosis and appears more specific than enteroclysis concerning small bowel diseases and may identify the enterolith inside the diverticulum or protruding into the intestinal lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Endoscopic procedures, such as single- or double-balloon enteroscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy, are useful in diagnosing small bowel disorders, however these procedures are expensive, present low availability and cannot be used in the emergency setting, such as intestinal obstruction or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Complications of jejunal diverticulosis warranting surgical intervention occur in 10-30% of patients and the most common acute complications include diverticulitis, bleeding, enterolith formation, intestinal obstruction and perforation \\[ 16 \\- 18 \\], however, some patients respond to the temporary interruption of the enteral nutrition, to a gastrointestinal relief with a nasogastric tube and to the administration of empirical, wide-spectrum antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Another series of perforated diverticulitis treated conservatively with antibiotic administration and CT-guided drainage of abdominal abscesses have also been presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Instigating factors for perforation were shown to be related to a necrotizing inflammatory reaction in 82% of cases, followed by blunt trauma (12%) and foreign body impaction (6%). Cocaine sniffing has also been reported as a risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. The incidence of jejunal diverticulitis with or without perforation ranges from 2-6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The current treatment of choice for perforated jejunal diverticula causing peritonitis is exploratory laparotomy and resection of affected intestinal segment with primary anastomosis. The extent of the bowel resection depends upon the length of the bowel that is affected by the diverticula and the patient’s peri-operative condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. If diverticula are extensive, resection may have to be limited to include only the segment containing the perforated diverticulum and to leave a segment of small bowel that still contains non-perforated diverticula in order to avoid short bowel syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Recently, the total laparoscopic approach has been used as a valid surgical strategy, even in cases of complicated diverticulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Laparoscopy becomes a valid diagnostic approach as it is rapidly convertible in laparotomy and it can function as a guide in order to avoid unnecessary laparotomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Our case in this paper presented symptomatology mimicking acute appendicitis and a decision was taken to perform prompt exploratory laparotomy due to the extent of the clinical and haematological findings and the individual Surgeon’s experience.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】It is seen that complicated jejunal diverticula are quite rare and that one of the most common complication is perforation. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected jejunal segment. However, conservative management has been reported in selected patients to alleviate symptoms and inflammation before proceeding to an elective resection and primary anastomosis. If affected diverticula are not resected complications will reoccur. It is important to be familiar with this entity and take it in consideration in cases of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, because any treatment delay may contribute to an unsuccessful clinical outcome for patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In the FLAURA trial, osimertinib improved progression-free survival in previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared with erlotinib and gefitinib. Therefore, osimertinib has become a standard drug as the first-line treatment for these patients. Owing to highly selective inhibition of mutated EGFR and lower activity against wild-type EGFR , less than 5% of patients develop significant pulmonary toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Digestive and dermatological symptoms are representative as adverse effects of osimertinib. On the other hand, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is recognized as an infrequent, but serious adverse effect associated with osimertinib.\n\n【2】Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar erythrocytes originating from the alveolar capillaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Various diseases cause DAH. As the causes of DAH, the following two etiologies are well known: 1) pulmonary capillaritis, i.e. anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated granulomatous vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis and Goodpasture syndrome; and 2) various drugs, such as propyluracil, anticoagulants and amiodarone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The precise prevalence of each cause remains unknown. EGFR-TKI is a rare drug that causes DAH. As pulmonary adverse effects of osimertinib, acute pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and fleeting asymptomatic infiltrates on imaging have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We herein report a case of DAH, which occurred during osimertinib for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and resolved after withdrawal of osimertinib and steroid treatment.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man visited another hospital because of a persistent cough for 2 months. The right pleural effusion was found on a chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a mass of 4 cm in diameter in the right upper lobe and bilateral multiple lung nodules . He was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (cT2aN0M1a, c-stageIVA) with EGFR exon 19 deletion by transbronchial biopsy. Endoscopic bronchial occlusion with endobronchial Watanabe spigot (EWS), silicone-made bronchial fillers, was performed twice for management of intractable iatrogenic pneumothorax after bronchoscopy. Then he started osimertinib (80 mg/day). He also had prostatic hypertrophy and had been treated with tamsulosin. He had no allergy, socially drank and was an ex-smoker with a history of 15 pack-years of cigarette smoking. At the start of osimertinib, his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) was 0. He was prescribed with dextromethorphan and tamsulosin at that time, but took neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulation agent. Two months after the initiation of osimertinib, both primary tumor in the right upper lobe and metastatic lesions in the bilateral lungs reduced, and no ground-grass opacity was detected .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest computed tomography on the diagnosis (a), 2 months after the start of osimertinib (b) and on admission (c). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】Four months after osimertinib initiation, he required an emergency admission to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. His consciousness at the arrival to our emergency room (ER) was clear, and his vital signs revealed a temperature of 35.8 °C, a blood pressure of 150/98 mm Hg, a pulse of 113 beats/min, a percutaneous oxygen saturation of 78% under bag valve mask ventilation, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min. His breath sounds were decreased, and coarse crackles were audible bilaterally. His limbs were cold with livedo reticularis and cyanosis. There was no jugular venous distention. In the peripheral venous blood sampling, the leukocyte count was 11,500/µL, C-reactive protein level was 9.49 mg/dL, platelet count was 30.7 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL. No abnormality of coagulation was revealed, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio was 1.27 and activated partial thromboplastin time was 33.9 s. The arterial blood gas analysis (under bag valve mask of oxygen flow of 15 L/min) showed lactic acidosis, pH was 7.165 and lactate was 11.8 mmol/L. The urine test was normal, except for hematuria due to prostatic hypertrophy. Sputum, urine and blood bacterial cultures were all negative. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with normal range of QTc time (472 ms). Chest radiographs at ER visit showed unilateral diffuse ground-grass opacities dominantly in the left lung field . Chest CT revealed diffuse ground-grass opacities and consolidation in the left upper and lower lobe, dominantly upper lobe . At that time, we suspected drug-induced interstitial pneumonia or infectious disease. Neither bleeding nor inflammation was not visually observed in his bronchial tracts by bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the left B5 (fluid recovery rate 65%) became serially and increasingly hemorrhagic . The total cell count in the BALF was 3.3 × 10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL, and differential cell count showed 54.5% of lymphocytes, 43.5% of neutrophils, 1.5% of macrophage, 0.5% of eosinophils and 5.13 of cluster of differentiation (CD)4/CD8 ratio. In the BALF, bacterial cultures were negative and no malignant cell was detected. Thereafter, proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA, myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies were all negative.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The BALFs on the hospital day 1 (a) and 9 (b). BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Diagnosis\n\n【12】The patient was diagnosed with osimertinib-induced DAH.\n\n【13】Treatment\n\n【14】We discontinued osimertinib, and then started steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone at 1,000 mg/day for 3 consecutive days, followed by steroid maintenance therapy with prednisolone (1.25 mg/kg/day). The consolidation regressed after the steroid pulse therapy. The second BALF from the left B5 (fluid recovery rate 41%) on the hospital day 9 was not bloody . The total cell count in the second BALF was 1.3 × 10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL, and differential cell count showed 14.5% of lymphocytes, 2.5% of neutrophils, 83.0% of macrophage, 0% of eosinophils, and 1.73 of CD4/CD8 ratio. His pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> (PF) ratio improved significantly from 77.6 on the hospital day 1 to 182 on the hospital day 11. Thus, he was extubated on the hospital day 11 . Prednisolone and O <sub>2 </sub> inhalation were gradually tapered.\n\n【15】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【16】He was discharged home on the hospital day 91. Considering the risk of recurrence of DAH and decreased ECOG-PS from 0 to 3, he was followed without further aggressive chemotherapy. Three months after the discharge, he died of lung cancer progression.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】This was a rare case of osimertinib-induced DAH. To our knowledge, there were only two osimertinib-induced and four other EGFR-TKI-induced DAH cases  \\[ 1 , 4 \\- 8 \\]. We could not find a report of DAH induced by other EGFR-TKIs; afatinib and dacomitinib, and anti-EGFR antibodies; cetuximab and panitumumab.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Summary of Previous Cases of Alveolar Hemorrhage Induced by EGFR-TKI |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【20】Although the mechanisms of drug-induced DAH remains unidentified, a direct toxicity to type II pneumocytes, tracheal epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells by cytotoxic drugs and activation of immune system cells may play a key role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In some previous literatures of TKI-induced DAH, this cytotoxic mechanism was assumed as the cause of DAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. In addition to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, EGFR-TKI also suppresses angiogenesis and promotes apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Compared with the previous cases of EGFR-TKI-induced DAH, our case was interesting in distribution of DAH shadow, i.e. unilaterally localized consolidations. A 65-year-old US woman required intubated mechanical ventilation and then improved by steroid pulse therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Her CT images were similar to our case in that the diffuse consolidation did not bilaterally spread, but was localized in the left upper lobe. However, the reason why DAH happened dominantly in the unilateral lung remains uncertain.\n\n【22】In our case, not only bronchoscopy but also BAL was necessary for the detection of DAH. If we had not performed BAL at the ER visit, we might have assumed infectious pneumonia and treated him only with antibiotics. We should not hesitate to perform bronchoscopy with BAL when we encounter intractable or atypical pneumonia during EGFR-TKI treatment.\n\n【23】Our case was also interesting in the report of differential cell counts in the BALF. Differential cell counts in the BALF may be a potential and useful marker of sensitivity to steroid and prognosis in DAH. There were only two reports of differential cell counts in the BALF of EGFR-TKI-induced DAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. A 56-year-old Japanese man with 90% of lymphocytes and 10% of neutrophils in the BALF improved after high dose of methylprednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Another 75-year-old Japanese woman with 20% of lymphocytes and 8% of neutrophils in the BALF recovered without steroid pulse therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), differential cell counts in the BALF were not correlated with steroid sensitivity and prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Fibrosis was reported to be of unfavorable prognostic relevance in acute exacerbation of ILDs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. On the other hand, when we find diffuse consolidations with increased lymphocytes (≥ 20%) in the BALF, we should consider other differential diagnoses except IPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Cytologically increased lymphocytes in the BALF and histologically small fibrotic changes may be favorable prognostic indicators of DAH. However, bronchoscopic specimen with biopsy is difficult at a risk of hemorrhagic worsening in DAH. Thus, BALF may be clinically available and useful as a prognostic marker of DAH.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】Osimertinib causes not only interstitial pneumonia but also alveolar hemorrhage. The consolidations may spread not bilaterally, but be localized unilaterally. We have to keep this rare adverse event in mind, and consider immediate withdrawal of osimertinib and treatment with steroid. Increased lymphocytes in the BALF may be a potential indicator of sensitivity to steroid and favorable prognosis in DAH.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr. Hideyasu Okada and Dr. Kensuke Kanaoka (the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Osaka Police Hospital) for their supports to the care and management of this patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was not applicable because the manuscript has been sufficiently de-identified to protect the patient.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>S.

However, complications of the procedure minor or major are referred and present in a rate varying from 0.4% to 22.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Buried bumper syndrome (BBS), the migration of the internal fixation device (bumper) out of the stomach, to the gastric wall and even to the abdominal wall, is a major and usually late complication of PEG leading in most of cases to severe intra-abdominal or abdominal wall infection. Its incidence ranges between 0.3% and 2.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, but, according to others, it can occur in 0.9% to over 8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> of adult patients with PEG. Although this complication is considered as late one, early cases have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, probably by vigorous traction of the cannula or tightness of the external bolster 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We report a case of a female patient who underwent a PEG placement 6 months previously, and presented with an extensive abdominal soft tissue inflammation, due to the translocation of the bumper subcutaneously.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】An 87-year-old female patient was admitted in the emergency department in severe septic condition, presenting a soft tissue necrotic inflammation of the anterior abdominal wall. The patient suffered from final stage of Alzheimer’s disease and a PEG was placed 6 months before the admission.\n\n【6】The terminal stage of dementia made the patient unable to communicate, and her relatives did not report any change of behavior or other symptoms on her behalf. On clinical examination, crepitus was found in the major part of anterior abdominal wall which was reddish . Complete laboratory values showed 9,000,000/μL white blood cells with 84% neutrophils, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, hematocrite 25.2%, urea 80 mg/dL, creatinine 1.58 mg/dL, K <sup>+ </sup> 4 mmol/L, Na <sup>+ </sup> 126 mmol/L and Ca <sup>2+ </sup> 7.90 mmol/dL.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. During admission, the whole anterior abdominal wall was seen reddish and inflamed. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Further imaging examination through CT scan of the abdomen showed dislodgement of the internal bumper of the gastrostomy tube to the subcutaneous area, as well as an extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the anterior abdominal wall, followed by necrosis .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Abdominal CT revealing the bumper migration, subcutaneously, and presence of subcutaneous emphysema. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】After thorough information, relatives’ consent was obtained and the surgical intervention was decided. Intra-operatively, the abdominal wall was opened and explored extensively; PEG was retracted as the internal bumper rested subcutaneously and the necrotic regions were removed . Tissues from the wound, as well as the PEG tip, were selected for cultures and sensitivity test and the patient was immediately administered wide-range antibiotics. Although she was, hemodynamically, full supported, the patient died the next day, due to septic shock. The culture revealed the presence of E. coli , sensitive at amoxicillin, clavulanic and imipenem.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Extensive exploration of the abdominal wall, PEG extraction, debridement and collection of tissues for culture. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】PEG was realized for the first time by Gauderer et al in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, for long-term enteral feeding without the need of an open surgery. Since then, PEG has been widely used for feeding patients with poor oral intake, such as in cases of neurologic or mechanical dysphagia and in the critically ill. It provides a more natural nutrition than parenteral feeding and is thought to be a safe procedure, even for the elder patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The overall complication rate after PEG placement ranges between 2% and 23.8% of cases, according to Biswas et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These complications can be minor, as wound infection, or major, as necrotizing fasciitis or peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. They can also be classified in mechanical (tube obstruction, malposition, secondary displacement or removal, leakage, skin erosion, intestinal obstruction or perforation, bleeding), infectious (infection of the insertion site, aspiration, peritonitis) and metabolic complications (electrolyte and glucose disturbances) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】BBS was first reported as a complication in 1988 by Levant et al and it is considered as a late and major complication, presenting with leakage, peristomal pain and infection and difficulty of feeding through the tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It consists of migration of the internal bumper in the gastric wall (incomplete type) or anywhere outside the gastric lumen (complete type). It, usually, occurs after a 4-month period from PEG placement, as in our case, but cases of acute BBS presentation have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Many risk factors have been proposed, but, actually, obesity and increased tension of the tube are certain reasons that lead to this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】BBS may present with bleeding, perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, peritonitis, abscess and phlegmon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, but also, rarely, as necrotizing fasciitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, rectus abdominis necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, or with co-existence of encephalopathy and high anion gap metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>; these complications could be potentially lethal. Microbes isolated from the tube or the wound are rarely described in the literature, but they can include Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】When BBS does occur, the removal of the tube is necessary for the prevention of secondary complications. Although endoscopic or surgical retrieval, open or laparoscopic, can be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, new methods have also been described, such as NOTES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, efforts to re-introduction of the bumper in the stomach, through endoscopy, have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Furthermore, necrotic fasciitis, which consists of a usually lethal condition, has been reported to be treated with early and aggressive surgical debridement, antibiotic administration and supportive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In patients suffering from dementia or brain injury, who are not able to communicate and report their symptoms to their family members or caregivers, the initial clinical condition could be misleading 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> and, therefore, they may not be examined and treated in time. Our patient could not reveal any signs of pain or discomfort in the inflammatory area, so her condition misinterpreted to local skin irritation, before the presence of high fever, which increased the family’s concerns. However, as in our case, a suspected and earlier diagnosis could have prevented any further intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of feeding via the PEG, as well as earlier treatment of necrotic fasciitis.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】BBS is a rare complication of the PEG placement. Safe positioning of the external bolster is important for the prevention of this complication. However, in cases of internal bumper migration, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the prevention of further complications; if not treated on time, the results could be severe and even lethal. Cooperation between doctors, nurses, family, or care-givers can lead to prevention and a better confrontation of the condition.\n\n【21】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding this paper.\n\n【23】Funding\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】Grant Support\n\n【26】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The prevalence of food allergy, and of CMA in particular, is believed to be increasing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Although in the past it was believed that the majority of cow’s milk (CM) allergic children tolerated it until school age, recent studies point to a much more delayed resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Avoidance diet in CMA is particularly difficult since milk is a ubiquitous food; also, the fear of an inadvertently ingestion of hidden CM with occurrence of a severe reaction has a great impact on children and families quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Therefore, specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) to CM has been regarded as a promising strategy to improve care of these patients.\n\n【2】In several research clinical trials, a few sublingual and oral protocols have been found to be generally well-tolerated and safe in highly controlled clinical settings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Prospective data, however, concerning tolerance and safety after ending SOTI are still lacking. The longest follow-up published, by Meglio et al, included 4 years and 8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Publishing these case reports reinforces the safety and efficacy of SOTI therapeutic strategy.\n\n【3】We describe herein an 8 years follow-up after successful SOTI to CM.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A Caucasian young male, now aged 20 year-old, was referred to Immunoallergy Department in 2001, at the age of 10 years, due to CMA diagnosed in the 1st month of life. He was breastfed until the 14th day of life and then initiated a CM infant formula. Two days later, about 30 minutes after each meal, he started reproducible episodes of generalized urticaria, ocular angioedema and vomiting. He was admitted to hospital and started a soy formula with good tolerance, which has kept throughout these years. During childhood he had several episodes of accidental ingestion of hidden CM, the last at the age of 8 year-old. He also reported moderate asthma, controlled with formoterol and budesonide, rhinitis controlled with mometasone, and a prior history of atopic eczema until 4 years old. Family history was also positive for atopy.\n\n【6】The allergy workup performed included skin prick tests (SPT) (Laboratorios Leti <sup>® </sup> , Madrid, Spain), which were positive to house dust mites and grass pollens, as well as for whole CM, casein, α-lactoalbumin and β-lactoglobulin and so were specific IgE (ImmunoCAP <sup>® </sup> , Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Evolution Throughout the Years of Total (IU/L) and Specific IgE (kUA/L), and Skin Prick Tests (mean wheal) |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】An open oral food challenge (OFC) was performed, and severe anaphylaxis occurred with the cumulative dose of 76 mL. At the age of 12 years, OFC was positive with 38 mL.\n\n【9】Because of this persistent CMA confirmed by stably positive OFCs, in 2003, with 13 year-old, a SOTI to CM was proposed, after detailed explanation about risks and advantages to him and his parents. The SOTI lasted 2 weeks, starting with increasing doses, reaching 30 mL on the first day, and with daily progressively increases in hospital setting, until a single dose of 200 mL of CM could be tolerated. The protocol was completed with mild side effects (1 episode of facial urticaria, controlled with cetirizine 10 mg and 1 episode of abdominal pain, self-limited) and no severe systemic reactions.\n\n【10】He was advised to keep a daily ingestion of at least 200 mL of CM, always after a meal, and without vigorous exercise in the 2 subsequent hours. Regular appointments with medical staff were programmed and until now, 8 years after SOTI, no reactions had occurred. Also, he is currently free of asthma and rhinitis symptoms, and therefore without therapeutics. Throughout the years, specific IgEs and SPT results for whole milk and CM proteins decreased, until reaching total negativity .\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】Our patient was submitted to a SOTI protocol different from that reported by Meglio et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, but also an excellent tolerance was observed at the end of 8 years, as long as he kept CM ingestion. Similarly to what was reported by Meglio et al at 4 years follow-up, an improvement occurred in what concerns to asthma and rhinitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. sIgEs and SPT decreased until reaching negativity. We prove that this protocol is equally effective and safe, with the advantage of being less time consuming and consequently more convenient, therefore representing an alternative. Spreading the safety and efficacy of SOTI strategy provides current knowledge on this issue and improves confidence of allergists to start using more often this therapeutic, which clearly improves quality of life of these patients and their families, and additionally seems to be beneficial to other concomitant allergic diseases.

Patients described in the literature have been treated with supportive care alone as there are no established treatment regimens. We report a case of late-onset multiple organ dysfunction and type B lactic acidosis following 25-I ingestion treated with a novel approach of vitamins for mitochondrial support, plasmapheresis, and pharmacologic reduction of free radicals.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 16-year-old male was found obtunded outside of a drug house. In the emergency department he was febrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with a Glasgow coma score of 7. He developed seizures requiring benzodiazepines and intubation.\n\n【4】He was given benzodiazepines and dexmedetomidine for agitation and suspected serotonin syndrome. An epinephrine drip was briefly required for hypotension. Lactate level initially peaked at 2.6 mEq/L 16 h post-ingestion. He also became hemodynamically stable and creatinine decreased from 1.45 to 1.04 mg/dL.\n\n【5】The patient then developed a new lactic acidosis about 30 h after admission, which rose to 8.5 mEq/L . Initial mixed venous saturation (S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ) was normal (46-72%) but later unexpectedly rose to 93%; this coincided with peak lactate. At this time he had an arterial total O <sub>2 </sub> concentration (TO <sub>2 </sub> c) of 19 mL O <sub>2 </sub> /dL blood (vol%), and an elevated venous TO <sub>2 </sub> c of 17.8 vol%; the arterial-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO <sub>2 </sub> ) was therefore 1.2 vol%, much lower than expected , indicating impaired oxygen utilization. The patient developed multiple organ dysfunction, including hypotension, oliguria and increases in creatinine and hepatic transaminases. This change was presumed to be caused by a defect in aerobic metabolism, despite adequate substrate delivery. To manage this metabolic uncoupling, thiamine 100 mg daily, levocarnitine 100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 h, and coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ-10) 120 mg every 8 h were given for 14 days. Additional treatments included N-acetylcysteine (NAC), per acetaminophen toxicity protocol, and one session of plasmapheresis with 2 L 5% albumin and 2 L fresh frozen plasma as replacement.\n\n|  Figure 1. Timeline of major patient events over first 60 h of admission. |\n| --- |\n\n|  Figure 2. Arterial-venous oxygen difference over first 48 h of admission. |\n| --- |\n\n【8】Subsequently, lactate levels and S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> returned to physiologic levels, 60-76% by 60 h after ingestion. Other markers of organ injury and dysfunction also improved.\n\n【9】The patient’s serum levels of 25-I were 25.1 pg/mL before plasmapheresis and 30.6 pg/mL after. The concentration of 25-I in the pheresis fluid was 20.1 pg/mL. 25-I was also detected in the urine at admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. He made a full recovery and admitted to taking 25-I.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Our patient’s presentation of hypertension, tachycardia and altered mental status was consistent with previous reports of 25-I ingestions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>. However, the late development lactic acidosis and multi-organ dysfunction has not been reported. This second phase of illness was successfully managed with a novel combination treatment strategy to target metabolic uncoupling and promote drug clearance with plasmapheresis.\n\n【12】Lactic acidosis is most often caused by inadequate substrate delivery, type A lactic acidosis, with cardinal features of poor perfusion and low S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> . Our patient had a high S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> and no signs of hypoperfusion, suggesting adequate substrate delivery with decreased oxygen uptake by tissues; the low AVDO <sub>2 </sub> is congruent with this. The patient had signs of end-organ dysfunction, rising creatinine and transaminases, oliguria and hypotension. This is most consistent with type B lactic acidosis, caused by a defect in the aerobic metabolism pathway leading to anaerobic metabolism, decreased ATP production and lactic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The heart, liver and kidney are all metabolically active organs that are at risk of injury in the setting of decreased ATP production.\n\n【13】Treatment of type B lactic acidosis focuses on restoring normal mitochondrial function and addressing the mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. We used a cocktail of vitamins and co-factors based on established treatments of mitochondrial disorders associated with lactic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Thiamine, vitamin B1, is a co-factor in multiple steps in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, including the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl Co-A can then enter the citric acid cycle. Levocarnitine aids in the transport of long chain fatty acids in the mitochondria where they are broken down into acetyl-CoA. Co-Q10 is part of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in the mitochondria. These vitamins support aerobic metabolism in the mitochondria.\n\n【14】Free-radical mediated injury may occur as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. To mitigate this, we treated with the free-radical scavenger NAC, using dosing standards for acetaminophen-associated liver injury. Plasmapheresis was used to clear any drug that was potentially protein bound. It is not known how 25-I is bound or metabolized.\n\n【15】In the literature on 25-I intoxication, there are no similar reports of late-onset type B lactic acidosis. The exact cause of this patient’s metabolic failure and most appropriate management regimen were unclear, so multiple approaches were employed. The patient may have had an active metabolite of 25-I. Despite a relatively high level of 25-I in the urine at the time of presentation (2.28 ng/mL), the low level of 25-I at the time of lactic acidosis support this theory.\n\n【16】As detection of 25-I is not on standard drug screens, it should be part of the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with a clinical picture similar to our patient. Testing using mass spectroscopy is used on a research level at a few select centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】We present a case of 25-I ingestion causing type B lactic acidosis successfully managed with vitamins to support mitochondrial function, plasmapheresis for toxin removal, and NAC to scavenge free radicals all in an attempt to reverse the mitochondrial uncoupling process.\n\n【18】Acknowledgement\n\n【19】We thank Shannon Haymond, PhD and Alphonse Poklis, MD for their help with testing for 25-I.\n\n【20】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【21】The authors report no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Sixteen percent of patients with acute CIDP (A-CIDP) experience rapid deterioration within 8 weeks followed by a chronic course, while 6-16% of treated patients with GBS have one or more deteriorations after initial improvement that is typically described as treatment-related fluctuations (TRFs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Here we report a case of a 49-year-old male patient with A-CIDP presenting with apparent GBS.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 49-year-old male was admitted to the hospital on November 1, 2012 for syndrome of weakness in the facial muscles and progressive loss of sensation that began in his upper limbs and progressed distally. One day prior to admission, the patient suffered weakness in his legs, and walked slowly with an unsteady gait. He also presented with slurred speech and dysphagia. According to the patient, he had intermittent diarrhea for a month before the onset of the syndrome.\n\n【4】Physical examination findings and electromyogram (EMG) characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The patient developed mild dyspnea on his second day of admission. On day 3, a lumbar puncture was performed and the results showed increased protein content .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Findings for Physical Examination and Cerebrospinal Fluid |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】The patient was initially diagnosed with GBS, stage II hypertension (moderate to severe), and viral hepatitis. Owing to financial constraints, the patient could not afford gamma globulin replacement therapy or plasma exchange. He opted for steroid treatment instead. He took methylprednisolone (60 mg orally once daily) for 5 days followed by tapering of the dose by 5 mg every 2 days. The patient was given an intramuscular injection of vitamin B1, B12 and mouse nerve growth factor. His symptoms improved progressively, and the lower limb muscle strength recovered to the point where he could carry heavy loads with a normal gait. The patient’s speech returned to normal, and his dysphagia and dyspnea subsided. The sensation in all his limbs was normal. He had intermittent sensation loss on his back. He was discharged after 8 days, while still taking a daily dose of 50 mg methylprednisolone, 100 mg vitamin B1, and 500 μg methylcobalamin. The dose of methylprednisolone was gradually reduced until cessation by 5 mg every 2 days.\n\n【7】Fourteen weeks after the first episode, the patient drank 10 mL of alcohol. He experienced slurred speech, weakness in his lower limbs, and inability to walk. He was readmitted to the hospital on February 1, 2013.\n\n【8】Physical examination findings and EMG characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . On day 5, the patient underwent lumbar puncture. The results showed increased protein content . Examination for anti-ganglioside antibody spectrum 2 (GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b) was negative (Euroimmun). Based on his clinical features and disease progression, the patient was differentially diagnosed with A-CIDP. He restarted taking 60 mg methylprednisolone daily for 5 days followed by weaning of the dose of methylprednisolone by 5 mg per week. He received an intramuscular injection of vitamin B1, B12 and mouse nerve growth factor. Three weeks after this admission, the patient’s symptoms had improved. His speech was nearly normal. Bilateral peripheral facial palsy had partially recovered without leaking of his breath when he blew his cheeks. He could walk slowly. The patient was discharged from the hospital while still taking methylprednisolone which was gradually tapered until cessation by 5 mg per week.\n\n【9】Eight weeks after the second episode, the patient manifested recurrent symptoms for the third time. He suffered limb weakness and slurred speech. He was able to stand but could not walk, and he had shortness of breath. Two weeks after the recurrent symptoms, he was readmitted to the hospital. Findings for physical examination and lumbar puncture are summarized in Table 1 . The patient was given pulse methylprednisolone treatment. Two weeks after the pulse treatment, the clinical manifestations had improved. His speech returned to normal. He had atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle in both hands. His upper-limb muscle strength was graded 5-, and lower-limb muscle strength was graded 4+. The symptom of hypalgesia had not improved. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after the treatment and he was followed up as an outpatient. One year after his discharge, the patient’s status was updated by a follow-up phone call. According to his description, he was able to perform daily chores and routines, his strength was slightly weaker than normal, and no other abnormality was reported.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Ruts et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> suggested A-CIDP should be suspected when a patient with GBS deteriorates after 9 weeks from the onset or when deterioration occurs three or more times. In this case, the patient’s condition deteriorated over 14 weeks after the first onset and the deterioration occurred three times; hence, he was diagnosed with A-CIDP according to the key diagnostic features described by Ruts et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In addition, Dionne et al performed a retrospective review on 30 patients with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and 15 patients with A-CIDP and revealed that infectious prodrome was rarely correlated with A-CIDP; patients with A-CIDP were more likely to have prominent sensory signs rather than motor signs. In their studies, 53.3% A-CIDP patients presented with signs of sensory ataxia, impaired vibration perception, and stocking-glove hypalgesia, which was consistent with the symptoms experienced by our patient. Nevertheless, Dionne et al also reported that patients with A-CIDP were less likely to have autonomic dysfunction, facial weakness, or need for mechanical ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Ruts et al performed a prospective longitudinal study on patients with GBS-TRF and with A-CIDP in order to distinguish these two diseases in the early phase of disease. Their results revealed, at all time points, A-CIDP group was less severely affected than GBS-TRF group in level of weakness and severity. A-CIDP patients did not need artificial ventilation, had significantly less cranial nerve dysfunction, and tended to have more CIDP-like electrophysiologic abnormalities. In Rut’s study, only one out of eight A-CIDP patients appeared cranial nerve dysfunction (VII). However, in this case, our patient had facial weakness in the first and second episodes, and mild respiratory muscle weakness in the first and third episodes; hence, our patient was an A-CIDP case different from those cases reported in the previous literatures.\n\n【12】Early recognition of A-CIDP in patients with apparent GBS is clinically difficult, but important because it can lead clinicians to initiate steroid therapy. While A-CIDP requires maintenance therapy after the initial response to steroid treatment, adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy is commonly used to lower the steroid dose, thereby reducing side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Medjaden Bioscience Limited for providing assistance in the preparation of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported by all authors of the study.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Various hematological abnormalities are reported in COVID-19 patients, some of which have prognostic significance. Guan et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> reported lymphopenia in 83.2% of their study patients, thrombocytopenia in 36.2% and leukopenia in 33.7%, and the level of these abnormalities was directly correlated with severity of COVID-19. Platelet changes were commonly reported leading to several complications in the disease course such as thrombocytopenia, systemic hypercoagulability and thromboembolic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Here we report two challenging cases where COVID-19 presented with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis together, complicating the course and management of this disease.\n\n| Cases Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 73-year-old male with a past medical history of metastatic poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma status post two cycles of carboplatin + pembrolizumab, poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis, chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), recent upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) for which he was receiving anticoagulation therapy with apixaban, was admitted with acute change in mental status. His last dose of chemotherapy was more than a month before his initial presentation.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 was positive. Computed tomography (CT) scan of head without contrast showed chronic age-related microvascular changes without any acute intracranial pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast showed left cerebral acute infarcts with microhemorrhages, punctuate right occipital infarct, left parietal signal abnormalities and punctate foci of enhancement. Initial lab testing revealed: white blood cell count of 5.03 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L of which lymphocytes were 13%, D-dimer > 20 µg/mL, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.6 s, international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, platelet count of 60,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . His baseline platelet count was around 75,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . The etiology of his thrombocytopenia was presumed to be exacerbation of his chronic ITP in setting of COVID-19 infection. His platelet counts progressively trended down to below 40,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> .\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】Apixaban was held and he was given 3 days of intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 h followed by 2 days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 g/kg. Platelet count slightly improved but remained below 60,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . His D-dimer was persistent at > 20 µg/mL; however, given his refractory thrombocytopenia, his anticoagulation was decided to be held. He was discharged home with oral prednisone 15 mg daily. He was re-admitted the very next day with blurred vision, and MRI of the brain showed interval evolution of previously seen infarct in the left cerebral hemisphere, large acute infarct in right temporal lobe with microhemorrhages.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】Given his multiple comorbidities with poor prognosis, he was placed on home hospice care and expired within few days.\n\n【12】Case 2\n\n【13】Investigations\n\n【14】A 72-year-old female with aortic stenosis status post bioprosthetic valve and cryptogenic liver cirrhosis with chronic thrombocytopenia (bone marrow biopsy in past excluded leukemia, aplastic anemia or lymphoproliferative disorder) had an initial hospital admission for COVID-19-related pneumonia and was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir. During this admission, she was noted to have a platelet count of 11,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> without any signs and symptom of bleeding and D-dimer of 2.8 µg/mL. Her baseline platelet count was 40,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . She received a dose of IVIG 0.5 g/kg with slight improvement in platelet count and was discharged home. She had a second hospital admission for fall within couple of days, during which her WBC count was 10.49 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocytes were 5.2%, PTT was 25.5 s, INR was 1.4, platelet count was 24,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> without any signs of bleeding. She was treated with 90 mg of prednisone daily and was discharged with a plan to taper prednisone by10 mg every 3 days. Two days later, she had third hospital admission for worsening shortness of breath.\n\n【15】Diagnosis\n\n【16】CT ruled out PE and showed persistent bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia. Her platelet count during this admission was less than 25,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Duplex of lower extremity showed bilateral occlusive DVT in femoral and popliteal veins extending up to right common femoral vein.\n\n【17】Treatment\n\n【18】Interventional radiology-guided inferior vena cava filter was placed. There was no improvement in platelet count with high-dose steroid or IVIG. Her bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular bone marrow with adequate mature granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis without increased blasts, myelodysplastic syndrome, or marrow involvement by lymphoma. She was treated with two doses of romiplostim 100 µg, 4 days apart, after which platelet count increased to > 40,000/µL and she was placed on anticoagulation therapy with subcutaneous enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg two times daily.\n\n【19】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【20】Four days later, she was readmitted with retroperitoneal bleed, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension with a platelet count of 334,000/µL. She was placed on comfort care measures and expired.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【22】Thrombocytopenia or thrombosis are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients, and the combination of these complications is particularly challenging.\n\n【23】Thrombocytopenia\n\n【24】Thrombocytopenia is reported to be mild to moderate in most COVID-19 cases without causing significant bleeding complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Thrombocytopenia and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were reported to have a prognostic role in COVID-19 \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\].

The in-hospital mortality was also directly correlated with severity of thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The causes of thrombocytopenia are unclear, but several mechanisms were proposed as described in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Proposed Mechanisms of COVID-19-Associated Thrombocytopenia |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【27】Management of thrombocytopenia is usually supportive and depends on the cause of thrombocytopenia. Critical causes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia must be excluded first 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. Steroids such as prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg tapered after 2 weeks is standard first-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. IVIG is second-line therapy in ITP patients who fail to respond appropriately to steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Platelet transfusion should be avoided in patients without significant hemorrhage due to the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists should also be avoided given the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Due to the risk of developing severe COVID-19, it is better to avoid immunosuppressant drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Coagulopathy\n\n【29】Thrombosis is one of the dreaded complications and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with more thrombotic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Klok et al reported 27% venous thromboembolism and 3.7% arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 ICU patients despite at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. PE was reported to be most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Various coagulation abnormalities are hallmark of COVID-19 coagulopathy. Elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated PTT, mild thrombocytopenia were commonly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. High D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were associated with higher mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Elevated D-dimer levels can also be used to predict risk of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In very severe cases, a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) like state was reported with extremely elevated D-dimer; however, fibrinogen level is often normal or elevated in COVID-19 unlike in classic DIC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Platelets, endothelium and inflammatory cells were involved in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, of which platelets were reported to have a significant role. Following are the proposed mechanisms of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy as described in Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 2.

Thromboprophylaxis with heparin was associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 with elevated D-dimer and increased risk for thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Physical therapy and hydration in addition to thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization are important measures to prevent thrombosis. Low-molecular-weight heparin is first-line standard thromboprophylaxis; however appropriate dose recommendation is not certain to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 , 9 , 15 \\]</u>. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in all COVID-19 hospitalized patients unless contraindicated in situations such as active bleeding, platelet count < 25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L or significantly low fibrinogen level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Mechanical preventive measures can be used when anticoagulation is contraindicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Several trials are ongoing but currently there is no evidence supporting prophylactic use of antiplatelet agents to prevent COVID-19 thrombotic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. Drugs such as argatroban seem to be promising agents theoretically in treating severe COVID-19 cases; however randomized trails are required to support evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Therapeutic anticoagulation with either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended to treat COVID-19 thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 15 \\]</u>. Oral anticoagulants should be avoided due to possible interactions with antiviral agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Antiplatelet agents are used in acute treatment of arterial thrombotic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Treatment options for severe COVID-19 cases are limited to date. More randomized controlled trials are required to better understand the pathophysiology of this disease and develop better treatment options.\n\n【36】Learning points\n\n【37】Various hematological abnormalities associated with various complications are reported in COVID-19.

Percutaneous interventions on degenerated SVGs are associated with up to 30% of short- and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Such procedures have evolved to reduce embolization and restenosis. Primary percutaneous interventions on aneurismal degenerated SVGs are difficult because of variable diameters along the SVGs. We report a case of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in which angiography showed an acute thrombosis of a voluminous degenerated SVG. Thrombectomy was realized and angioplasty was performed using a balloon-expandable peripheral stent.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 71-year-old male was referred to our catheterization center for inferior ST elevation MI (STEMI). The patient underwent triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 16 years previously, with sequential SVG to the posterior interventricular and to the second marginal branch of the left circumflex artery (LCA), and left internal mammal artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD). His risk factors were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. The patient was regularly followed up and was taking diligently his medication (aspirin, rosuvastatin and metformin).\n\n【4】Intermittent chest pain started 2 days prior to admission. He was initially planned for a non-invasive ischemic test, as there were no electric modifications or cardiac hypersensitive troponin elevations at the emergency room. A more intense and sustained chest pain occurred few hours before his second admission. He was referred to the emergency room and his baseline EKG showed an inferior STEMI. He received intravenous heparin, aspirin and a loading dose of ticagrelor at the admission. He was emergently transferred to the hemodynamics department to perform coronary and bypass angiography. Native coronary angiogram showed a severe stenosis of the distal left main, an occlusion of the proximal LAD, the proximal LCA and the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The LIMA to the LAD graft was patent. Finally, SVG angiogram showed a massive thrombotic occlusion of the second part of the sequential graft, which was aneurismal just after the posterior interventricular artery .\n\n【5】A continuous infusion of IIbIIIa inhibitors was started after identifying the culprit lesion. An 8-Fr MP-A1 guiding catheter (Cordis Corp. Miami Lakes, USA) was used to engage the SVG. A BMW universal wire (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, USA) easily crossed the occlusion and partially successful thromboaspiration was performed. After pre-dilation with a 2.0 mm diameter balloon, TIMI 2 flow was restored and the angiogram revealed an 8 mm diameter (quantitative coronary angiography measurement) aneurysmal degenerated graft . We decided to use a balloon-expandable peripheral stent to treat this lesion. A 260 cm Glide hydrosteer wire (St Jude Medical, St Paul, USA) was carefully taken down in the RCA in order to have enough length and backup to bring the stent . An 8.0 × 24 mm Genesis bare metal stent (Cordis Corp, Miami Lakes, USA) was easily taken down and deployed in the SVG . TIMI 3 outflow was restored without any no-reflow phenomenon. Patient was discharged to his origin hospital 3 days later. He had an uneventful evolution at the 3 months follow-up.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Procedural complications and no-reflow rates remain high even if distal embolization protection devices have decreased significantly these risks from 20% to less than 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Mostly because of the large vessel size in degenerated SVG, choice of stent and distal embolization protection strategy is a primary concern. No distal embolization protection device has been used in this case considering the large size of the culprit vessel.\n\n【12】The optimal management of SVG aneurysm remains controversial, especially during acute MI. Traditionally, medical treatment, repeat CABG and covered stents have been advised in large aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】To our knowledge, we described the first case of degenerated SVG treated with a balloon-expandable peripheral stent during STEMI.

It is characterized by excessive and prolonged bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction with increased platelet size and deformability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patients with BSS have a defect in or complete lack of the key glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, normally found on the surface of platelets. The GPIb-IX-V is important in initiating platelet aggregation and thrombosis after vascular injury by facilitating the adhesion of platelets to von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which is exposed on the vascular subendothelium after blood vessel injury. The binding of GPIb-IX-V to vWF results in a decrease in velocity of platelets as they move past damaged vessel walls and is critical in the process of initiating thrombosis to repair damaged vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In addition to mediating adhesion of platelets to the blood vessel wall at sites of vascular injury by binding vWF, the complex facilitates platelet activation at low concentrations of thrombin, which may have roles in the platelet formation and turnover given that BSS is associated with decreased number and abnormal size. The lack of or defect in the functioning of GPIb-IX-V results in a compromised ability to initiate platelet adhesion and aggregation resulting in a bleeding diathesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is confirmed by platelet function testing with lack of platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin. We present a 17-year-old adolescent with BSS who presented for posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. Previous reports of perioperative care of patients with BSS are reviewed and options for anesthetic care including correction of the coagulation defect are presented.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH, USA) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 17-year-old, 70.9 kg girl who presented for posterior spinal fusion to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her past medical history was positive for BSS, diagnosed at 3 years of age on platelet function testing for presentation of easy bruising and excessive bleeding. She also had been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, diagnosed at age of 9 years with genetic testing and idiopathic scoliosis. Due to the BSS, she has macrothrombocytopenia with a baseline platelet count in the 50,000 - 70,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Her past surgical history was positive for one orthodontic procedure that did not involve anesthesia and resulted in no complications. Although prior platelet transfusions had resulted in an inadequate increase in her platelet count, work-up for platelet specific antibiotics was negative. Her medications at the time of surgery included tranexamic acid (1,300 mg PO TID) to control menstrual bleeding, celecoxib (100 mg PO BID) for menses-associated pain, an oral probiotic and a benzoyl peroxide 10% topical wash. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished and well-developed young woman in the 85th percentile for weight and 89th percentile for height. She denied any recent health concerns and her vital signs were unremarkable. Her airway examination revealed a Mallampati class I airway with a thyromental distance greater than three fingerbreadths. Her cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. She was eager to proceed as prior posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery, scheduled 3 months earlier, and was cancelled due to inadequate response to two platelet transfusions, resulting in a platelet count of 74,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , which did not meet the desired threshold of 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Given the inadequate response to previous platelet transfusions, after hematology consultation, a plan was devised to further address these issues perioperatively and her surgical procedure was rescheduled. The platelet count the day prior to surgery was 72,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and she received one unit of pheresed platelets, which increased her platelet count to 78,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Other coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ration (INR) were within normal limits. Due to previous issues with a limited response to platelet transfusions, it was decided to monitor in vivo coagulation function using the rotational thromboelastogram (ROTEM®). The values were within normal limits except for a prolongation of the clot formation time (CFT). The patient was kept nil per os for 6 h before being transported to the operating room following premedication with intravenous midazolam (2 mg). Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were placed followed by anesthetic induction with propofol (200 mg), lidocaine (100 mg) and sufentanil (20 ìg). Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by the administration of rocuronium (65 mg). Following anesthetic induction, two large bore peripheral intravenous cannulas and an arterial cannula were placed. To facilitate neurophysiological monitoring per our usual protocol, maintenance anesthesia included desflurane titrated to maintain the bispetral index at 50 - 60 and a sufentanil infusion adjusted from 0.1 - 0.3 ìg/kg/h to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 55 - 65 mm Hg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Maintenance anesthesia was supplemented by continuous infusions of lidocaine and esmolol. Prior to the start of the surgical procedure, a second unit of pheresed platelets was infused along with a single dose of recombinant factor VIIa (1 mg). The dosing of rFVIIa was repeated every 2 - 3 h intraoperatively. Tranexamic acid was administered intraoperatively (loading dose of 50 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg/kg/h during the procedure). The ROTEM® was followed during the perioperative course and remained at baseline except for a persistent mild elevation of the CFT. Intraoperatively, surgical hemostasis was adequate as judged by the surgical team. No allogeneic packed red blood cells were administered. Intraoperative cell savage was used with the return of 350 mL of salvaged and washed blood. The surgical procedure was accomplished in 4 h 25 min with an estimated blood loss of 900 mL. At the completion of the procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated and she was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and then to the pediatric ICU for 24 h. Her postoperative hemoglobin remained stable at 9 - 10 gm/dL. On postoperative day 1, she received one unit of pheresed platelets for a platelet count of 56,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Postoperatively, å-amino caproic acid (Amicar) was administered intravenously and then by mouth for a total of 10 days. No other allogeneic blood products were administered during the postoperative course and although her platelet count decreased to a nadir of 39,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , there was no clinically concerning bleeding and her ROTEM® values remained stable. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and she was discharged to the inpatient ward on postoperative day 1 and home on postoperative day 5.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】BSS is a rare inherited disorder affecting platelet function with decreased aggregation, decreased numbers and decreased function. As such, excessive bleeding may occur spontaneously, following trauma or during surgical procedures. Although the glycoprotein defect results in the ineffective interaction of vWf with the vascular endothelium, the disorder cannot be corrected by the administration of vWf and other strategies are needed. Our case was unique in two respects including our patient’s refractory state to the administration of allogeneic platelets with minimal increase in the platelet count. Despite this, work-up did not reveal platelet antibodies or other issues that might be amenable to corticosteroid therapy or plasmapheresis.\n\n【6】While the mainstay remains the administration of allogeneic platelets, adjunctive strategies have included the administration of antifibrinolytic agents (ε-amino caproic acid or tranexamic acid), recombinant factor VIIa and 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). To date, there are a limited number of reports in the literature regarding the perioperative care of pediatric patients with BSS  \\[ 2 , 6 \\- 15 \\]. While the mainstay of therapy includes platelet transfusions, adjunctive therapies have included desmopressin, anti-fibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid) or recombinant factor VIIa. Given our patient’s inadequate response to platelet transfusions, we chose to use adjunctive agents to augment platelet and coagulation function including tranexamic acid and recombinant VIIa.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Reports of Perioperative Care of Patients With Bernard-Soulier Syndrome |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Tranexamic acid is a synthetic, lysine-derived antifibrinolytic agent used to slow the breakdown of thrombin and fibrin, thereby limiting blood loss in various surgical procedures and in trauma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. By reversibly blocking the five lysine binding sites on plasminogen, tranexamic acid prevents the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and the degradation of fibrin. Tranexamic acid has been shown to effectively limit blood loss during orthopedic procedures on the spine even in patients with normal preoperative coagulation function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. In addition to its effects on the fibrinolytic process, tranexamic acid also improves platelet function through poorly understood and controversial mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Clinical studies have demonstrated that tranexamic acid attenuates platelet aggregation defects created by antiplatelet treatment or by uremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. These effects may explain its anecdotal success in patients with BSS and other platelet defects.\n\n【9】In addition, we chose to use recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), a synthetic hemostatic agent originally used to treat bleeding in hemophilia A patients who had developed inhibitors to factor VIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Given its integral effect of coagulation function, rFVIIa has also been used to treat bleeding of various other etiologies in many clinical scenarios. Following disruption of the endothelial barrier of blood vessels, tissue factor (TF) is exposed and binds factor VIIa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. The complex of TF and VIIa initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade with the activation of factor X to Xa, which in association with cofactor Va, leads to the formation of thrombin from prothrombin. The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin occurs on the surface of activated platelets, resulting in the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is crosslinked and further recruits platelets to propagate the thrombus. Though not well understood, rFVIIa, by directly activating factor X, is thought to help compensate for low or dysfunctional platelets by increasing the generation of thrombin and the subsequent activation of platelets are activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. In addition to these proposed cellular mechanisms, rFVIIa has been shown to anecdotally be a valuable adjunct in preventing or the treatment of bleeding in patients with qualitative and quantitative platelet disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Given that the routine laboratory parameters of coagulation function (PT and PTT) do not demonstrate the clinical interaction of the various components of the coagulation cascade or adequately demonstrate platelet function, we used the ROTEM® to evaluate and follow in vivo coagulation function in our patient. Despite the presence of persistent thrombocytopenia following platelet transfusions, coagulation function was clinically adequate to allow for completion of the surgical procedure. The ROTEM® is a modification of the thromboelastogram that identifies clot formation and strength by using an electromechanical transduction system that measures the amount of rotational force transmitted by the developing clot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The system involves the suspension of ball from a rod in a rotational device. The rotation of the ball is impeded as the clot develops, thereby characterizing the patient’s hemostatic ability. Clot development in vivo is dependent on the interaction of platelets with coagulation factors which can be evaluated by the pattern seen on the ROTEM®. The propagation of clot and the pattern can also be followed to evaluate for clot lysis (fibrinolysis), hence evaluating the efficacy of agents. We utilized the coagulation profile provided by ROTEM® to assess our patient’s qualitative response to platelet transfusions, response to adjunctive agents (tranexamic acid and rFVIIa), the risk for perioperative bleeding and transfusion needs in the perioperative period.\n\n【11】In summary, we present the perioperative care of an adolescent with BSS for PSF. Although platelet transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy to prevent or treat bleeding, adjunction agents including anti-fibrinolytic agents or rFVIIa have been shown to be useful. Our anecdotal experience adds to the literature suggesting the demonstration of utility of bedside point-of-care coagulation function monitoring using the ROTEM®. With such care, even invasive surgical procedures can be accomplished with minimal sequelae related to the primary bleeding disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint that may lead to severe deformity and dysfunction. Bilateral knee neuropathic arthropathy is an exceedingly rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Given the rarity of Charcot arthropathy of the knee in general treatment is still controversial, with the trend nowadays toward total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Pathomechanism of the disease is still unknown. However, it is believed that the diminution or absence of nociception, results in poor joint protection and undetected microtrauma may lead to development of bone destruction and attenuation of ligaments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, according to neurovascular theory, neurally stimulated vascular reflexes may provoke bone resorption. In the first half of the 20th century syphilis was the main cause of Charcot arthropathy. As syphilis declined due to antibiotic evolution, diabetes mellitus became the primary etiology \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\].\n\n【3】Diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy should include detailed history taking, and a complete physical examination, including neurologic tests. It is based on clinical findings such as warm and swollen painless joint and later radiographic evaluation, which may reveal joint dislocation, fractures, or deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of Charcot arthropathy affecting both knees after a fifth lumbar vertebral (O5) fracture 35 years ago, which led to cauda equine syndrome and treated with bilateral total knee arthroplasty.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】A 65-year-old woman presented to the orthopaedic office on a wheelchair. The patient had suffered an O5 fracture 35 years ago which was treated conservatively, and produced a cauda equine syndrome. The symptoms of urinary incontinence, diminished sensation in both legs distally to the middle of both thighs and deep tendon reflexes were remaining. Furthermore, she presented with muscular weakness (2+/5) of both feet, and she used feet orthoses. The quadriceps strength was uneventful. The patient had no notable medical history concerning diabetes mellitus, syphilis, lacunar infarcts, rheumatologic disease and osteoarthritis, and she denied tobacco and alcohol use. She had suffered a right middle tibia fracture 5 years ago, which was treated with intramedullary nailing and fused uneventfully. After a period of 2 months she regained her prior walking ability and was able to walk using a walker. The last 2 years she gradually lost her walking ability due to gross instability of both knees.\n\n【7】The main complaints were progressively swollen knees with mild pain and increasingly instability with valgus deformity and crepitus for the last 2 years. Since then the patient was unable to weight bear due to gross instability, and she used a wheelchair. During her admission to the orthopaedic office both knees had similar clinical deterioration and radiological abnormalities. Gross abnormal mobility was present on clinical examination in both sagittal and coronal planes. Anterior and posterior drawer test were positive. Varus and valgus instability test were also positive.\n\n【8】The diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy was established using knee X-rays, which showed marked destructive changes, sclerosis, dislocation, and subchondral fractures of the knee joints .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative face X-ray, before nail removal showing excessive valgus deformity. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Right knee face X-ray after nail removal. Destructive changes are apparent. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Due to the progressive inability to ambulate the patient decided to be treated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). She underwent removal of the intramedullary nail first. Two months later she was operated on her right knee using cemented rotating hinged knee prosthesis, in order to accommodate bone loss and ligamentous insufficiency. On postoperative day 2, the patient could partially weight bear. Wound healing was uneventful, and on postoperative day 20 knee range of motion (ROM) was 115°/0°/0° (flexion/extension/hyperextension). Knee stability was restored, and she was allowed to weight bear. Three months later the patient underwent TKA at her left knee using identical technique. Postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on day 20, ROM was 120°/0°/0°. Six weeks later she was able to walk with the aid of a walker and was satisfied with the result.\n\n【12】We assessed the clinical outcome using the Knee Society Score (KSS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, which was calculated preoperatively and at the final evaluation 12 years postoperatively. There was an improvement from 25 to 90 points in knee score and from 0 to 30 points in function score, although she was continued to use walker due to her muscular weakness of both feet. Radiological evaluation also took place at the final follow-up, using radiographs. The position of components was evaluated for proper placement and loosening, with no apparent sings of malposition and progressive loose lines .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Twelve years postoperative X-ray, showing good component alignment, without loosening. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】Neuropathic arthropathy was described by Jean Martin Charcot in 1868 as the progressive destruction of bone and soft tissue in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Almost 100 years later, Eichenholtz stated that the knee was the most common site of neuroarthropathy, and all these patients had tabes dorsalis. Since then and due to antibiotic evolution, the incidence of neurosyphilis has been declining, with diabetes mellitus constituting the most common reason for neuroarthropathy of joints in the lower extremity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Diabetic neuropathy most commonly involves the tarsal, tarsometatarsal and ankle joints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Other causes are leprosy, meningomyelocele, syringomyelia and spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Our case is the only one in the literature that followed vertebral fracture and cauda equine syndrome.\n\n【16】The pathophysiology of Charcot arthropathy is not fully understood. The current accepted theory states that in susceptible individuals with peripheral neuropathy, an unregulated inflammatory process is triggered which leads to an increase expression of the polypeptide receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL). RANKL triggers the synthesis of nuclear transcription factor, nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), and this in terms stimulates the maturation of osteoclasts from osteoclast precursor cells. Furthermore NF-κβ stimulates the production of the glycopeptide osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblasts. All these events lead to continuing local osteolysis. The damaged nervous endings may also decrease the secretion of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This peptide works as an antagonist of the RANKL synthesis and at the same time is responsible for the normal integrity of the joint capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The diagnosis is based on patient’s history, clinical examination, and imaging methods. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, syphilis, leprosy, alcoholism, syringomyelia, lacunar infarcts etc. which can lead to loss of deep sensation and proprioception, should be identified.\n\n【18】Typical symptoms in clinical examination of active neuropathic arthropathy are edema, erythema, warmth, and more than 2 °C difference in local temperature in comparison to the contralateral extremity. Pain occurs in about 50% of neuropathy cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the degree of pain does not correlate with the degree of joint destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Differential diagnosis in acute stage of disease should be done especially between septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and microcrystalline arthritis. Our case presented with mild pain due to loss of sensitivity, despite the gross instability of both knees.\n\n【19】Radiograph is the preferred examination method concerning the imaging methods. The Eichenholtz classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> is still in use and it consists of three stages. Stage of development, which is an early stage of the disease, shows evidence of debris formation, fragmentation, disruption and dislocation of the articular margins. Stage of coalescence is characterized by absorption of much or all of the fine debris, sclerosis, and fusion of most large fragments. Finally, stage of reconstruction presents decrease sclerosis, rounding of major fragments, and some kind of reformation of joint architecture. Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been broadly used to detect this condition early, as changes on X-ray are typically delayed and have low sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Bone marrow edema as a finding in a patient with risk factors may depict neuropathic arthropathy in early stages.\n\n【20】The treatment of neuropathic arthropathy is conservative at the early stages of the disease prior to radiographic abnormalities. It is based on immobilization and complete absence of weight bearing for the affected extremity in the active stage. To support healing bisphosphonates, intranasal calcitonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> and teriparatide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> have been used, but their efficacy is yet to be fully demonstrated. When the knee joint is affected, and radiological abnormalities are apparent, conservative treatment is insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Arthrodesis has been the mainstay of operative treatment in the late stages of neuroarthropathy, despite a high incidence of failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Knee arthroplasty has been considered to be an absolute contraindication because of the high incidence of serious complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. However in recent years some authors have shown satisfactory results after knee arthroplasty in patients with neuropathic arthropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. High incidence of serious complications, such as periprosthetic infection, aseptic loosening, and periprosthetic fracture, in these patients are related to significant bone loss, poor bone quality and ligamentous laxity. Recommendations for successful total knee arthroplasty include bone grafting or custom-augmented prosthesis to repair bony defects, correct ligamentous balancing, total synovectomy, and a complete armamentarium of the new implants. Furthermore, a better outcome is obtained if implantation occurs after the initial developmental phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Late stage neuropathic arthropathy of the knee causes significant functional deficits, and its treatment is very challenging. There is still a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment when operative management is indicated. Although knee arthroplasty recently provides promising results, it is associated with high complication rates, is technically demanding, and needs a complete armamentarium of the new implants.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been received.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Athanasios Karageorgos: substantial contribution of the conception and design of the work; Andreas X.

In contrast, it is remarkably uncommon in elder adults, representing merely 2-5% of all malignant soft tissue tumors, mostly of the pleomorphic type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Alveolar RMS may involve the head and neck region (40%), the genitourinary system (20%), the extremities (20%), the trunk (10%) and other sites (10%) \\[ 7 \\- 10 \\].\n\n【3】Here we report an uncommon case of alveolar RMS in the paranasal cavity of a 61-year-old woman, with emphasis on the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors in this location and the potential immunohistological diagnostic pitfalls.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 61-year-old female presented for onset of otalgia and a lump in the right neck.\n\n【6】A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right ethmoidal sinus lesion extending to the homolateral maxillary sinus and medial turbinate, with radiological features suspicious for a neoplasia .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. CT scan reveals a right ethmoidal sinus lesion (A), 30 mm in diameter, extending to the homolateral maxillary sinus and medial turbinate, and infiltrating the right orbital cavity (B). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】A biopsy was performed and histological evaluation revealed an infiltrative neoplastic proliferation composed of sheets and solid nests of atypical small round cells , displaying hypercromatic nuclei, scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity . Examination of the individual cell morphology was often limited by variable crush artifacts and necrosis. On the basis of the sole morphology, an initial diagnosis of malignant undifferentiated neoplasia was made, being a small cell carcinoma the favored diagnostic hypothesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody panel  that could confirm the hypothesis of small cell undifferentiated carcinoma (EMA, cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, CK20), including neuroendocrine markers (CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin) and GFAP, s-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A, CD45, EBV-LMP1 and myeloperoxidase (for excluding neuroectodermal tumors, melanoma and lymphohemathopoietic neoplasms).\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Histological examination of the biopsy shows a submucosal infiltrative lesion composed of sheets of small cells (A, hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification × 200) displaying round hyperchromatic nuclei with nucleoli, scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity (B, hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification × 400). At immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells show a diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for CD56 (C, original magnification × 630) and desmin (D, original magnification × 400) and diffuse nuclear positivity for myogenin (E, original magnification × 400). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Details on Antibodies Used for the Immunohistochemical Study |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】The tumor cells showed a positive immunostain only for CD56 . A sarcomatous nature of the lesion was suspected and appropriate additional immunohistochemical studies were performed. The neoplastic cells displayed a positive immunoreaction for vimentin, desmin , MyoD1 and myogenin , suggesting a rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.\n\n【12】A cytogenetic analysis revealed the t(2;13) translocation, a chromosomal rearrangement typical of alveolar RMS.\n\n【13】On the basis of immunohistological and cytogenetic findings a final diagnosis of alveolar RMS was made.\n\n【14】In January 2010, the patient underwent the first cycle of polichemotherapy treatment (VAC scheme: vincristine 2 mg/day 1, adriamicine 108 mg/day 1, cyclophosfamide 3,024/days 1-2).\n\n【15】One month later the patient received the second cycle (75% of VAC scheme: vincristine 1.5 mg/day 1, adriamicine 80 mg/day 1, cyclophosfamide 2,268/days 1-2). The third cycle was at 66% of VAC scheme for progressive mielotoxicity side effect.\n\n【16】CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in April revealed a good local response with 80% of tumor regression. From May to July the patient was treated with external beam radiation therapy (69.3 Gy/33 fraction). One month later MRI revealed the presence of local residual disease.\n\n【17】The case was discussed by the Head and Neck Tumor Management Team that scheduled the patient for surgery. Before the operation, the patient presented with a new onset of pain at the right arm and scapula. PET-CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed the presence of multiple bone metastases. The patient was referred to palliative chemotherapy and unfortunately died for disease complications one year after the initial consultation.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】Alveolar RMS is composed in its classical form of distinctive nests of primitive-appearing round cells, which grows in a discohesive fashion, surrounded by hyalinized and highly vascular fibrous septa producing a pattern reminiscent of the alveoli of the lung. Obvious rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, in the form of strap cells and cytoplasmic cross striations, is rarely identified.\n\n【20】Solid forms of alveolar RMS lack the prominent nested pattern and cellular discohesion seen in the classical histotype and may closely mimic a variety of other small round cell tumors, such as small cell carcinoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】In immunohistochemistry, alveolar RMS typically expresses vimentin and muscle-specific antigens, such as desmin, muscle actins (including smooth muscle isoforms), myogenin and MyoD1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Aberrant expression of epithelial and neuroendocrine markers, a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall, has been recently described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Alveolar RMS is a very aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis and requires a histotype-specific aggressive therapy. Therefore an accurate diagnosis and its distinction from other small round cell tumors are of crucial clinical importance.\n\n【23】While some cases of alveolar RMS have been described in young adults, the occurrence of this neoplasm in adults over the age of 45 years is extremely uncommon, being pleomorphic RMS, characterized by different microscopic features and biological behavior, the most common histotype in this category of patients \\[ 8 \\- 10 , 16 \\]. For this reason, the inclusion of alveolar RMS in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors of the head and neck region is often neglected. Other malignancies such as small cell undifferentiated or neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and melanoma are more likely to be considered in this location in elder patients.\n\n【24】In our case, the initial diagnostic work-up for an undifferentiated tumor arising in the head and neck region in a 56-year-old female patient did not include myogenic markers. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD56 immunostain and only as a consequence of no immunoreaction for the other epithelial, lymphoma, or malignant melanoma markers, the differential diagnosis was expanded to include RMS and additional immunostains for a myogenic differentiation were pursued.\n\n【25】The differential diagnosis of CD56 positive small round cell tumors includes natural killer (NK)-cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, primary neuroectodermal tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, synovial sarcoma and malignant melanoma.\n\n【26】CD56 expression has an established role in the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma/NK cell type and other hematological malignancies. The sinonasal region is notably a common location for NK/T-cell lymphomas, in particular in some areas of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】CD56 immunostain is of limited value in the differential diagnosis of sarcomas because it is widely expressed in these neoplasms. However, it may be useful in combination with the assessment of CD99 expression in the differential diagnosis with Ewing’s sarcoma. Only 10-25% of Ewing’s sarcomas are CD56 positive in contrast to 100% embryonal and alveolar RMSs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】CD56 is also commonly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and the co-expression of synaptophysin and/or chromogranin is highly suggestive of neuronal or neuroendocrine differentiation.\n\n【29】Indeed, some cases of synaptophysin positive immunoreaction in alveolar RMS have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Conversely, rhabdomyoblastic differentiation may occur in olfactory neuroblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】The differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated round cell neoplasms represents a common problem. In most cases morphologic evaluation is not sufficient and further investigations are required. The study of the immunohistochemical profile of the tumor is mandatory and the evaluation of the right combination of immuno-markers may have very important prognostic and therapeutic implications. In doubtful cases, cytogenetics and molecular biology studies can be useful in establishing the right diagnosis or to confirm the diagnostic hypothesis. The most common chromosomal rearrangements in alveolar RMS are t(2;13)(q35;q14), which is seen in 55% of cases, and t(1;13)通用删除11(英):<u>(p3;q14)</u>, which is encountered in about 22% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Our case suggests that in cases of undifferentiated round cell neoplasms of the head and neck region in elder patients, alveolar RMS should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis, along with lymphoma, small cell carcinoma and estesioneuroblastoma that are commonly encountered in such clinical spectrum. Therefore, the immunohistochemical differential diagnosis should always include a myogenic marker, such as desmin, myogenin or MyoD1. The performance of one more immunostain can avoid a diagnostic pitfall and provide a more rapid and correct diagnosis. Moreover, the demonstration of specific chromosomal rearrangements may be a very helpful diagnostic tool in doubtful cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

She felt a presence of fetal movements; however, the FHR showed a fixed pattern of 150 bpm without normal baseline variabilities, accelerations or decelerations, and it did not change during uterine contractions by routinely cardiotocograms. The result of vibroacoustic stimulation test (VAST) was negative; there was no change in FHR and movements under the vibroacoustic stimulation . Sonographic examination revealed normal fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume. We measured peak systolic and end-diastolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA). The resistance index (RI) of UA was normal (0.48); however, the MCA showed a high diastolic blood flow velocity and the RI was at an extremely low level of 0.47, indicating a brain-sparing effect. By ultrasonography, the presence of fetal breathing movements could not be recognized with certainty; however, the fetus was seemed to repeatedly sink in the amniotic cavity and to repeatedly rebound in the reaction of reaching the bottom of the amniotic cavity. The mother felt the fetal movements repeated regularly until delivery.\n\n|  Figure 1. Fixed fetal heart rate pattern of 150 bpm with fetal movements.

After endotracheal intubation and resuscitation, the infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. No spontaneous breathing or body movements, somatic or primitive reflexes, or pupillary light reflex were observed. At admission, a neonatal ultrasound examination showed that the RI was very low at 0.09 in the MCA  and luxury perfusion continued. Her lactate dehydrogenase 943 IU/L and creatine kinase 199 U/L were not elevated. Electroencephalography was performed at 1 day of age and gave almost flat readings. A cerebral ultrasound examination at 8 days of age showed the presence of ventricular distention and cerebral atrophy.

Her medical history was significant for LCH with multiple complications, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, cirrhosis, secondary hypothyroidism and diabetes insipidus caused by LCH infiltration of the gallbladder and pituitary gland. She had undergone chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and then with cladribine with her most recent cycle 2 years prior. She denied any symptoms such as epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematuria, hematochezia, or melena.\n\n【4】On examination, there were diffuse, non-blanchable petechiae over her lower extremities, back and chest. Examination of the abdomen revealed splenomegaly. Labs showed pancytopenia with a platelet count of 1. In July of 2012, her platelet count was 67. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a spleen 19 cm in length. She was given 3 U of platelets; however, her platelet count remained at 1. She was then given filgrastim and romiplostim in an attempt to stimulate bone marrow production of leukocytes and platelets. Her leukocyte count responded; however, her platelet count remained at 1. A bone marrow biopsy was done which showed atypical lymphoreticular aggregates consistent with LCH, but with a normal number of megakaryocytes with normal morphology.\n\n【5】Her thrombocytopenia and lack of response to platelet transfusions was attributed to platelet sequestration in the spleen. Surgical oncology was consulted and they recommended laproscopic splenectomy. Because of her high MELD score and high risk of mortality (greater than 30% 90-day post-operative mortality), gastroenterology was consulted for clearance and an MRCP was done which showed no portal vein thrombus or hematoma. The patient was then scheduled for laproscopic splenectomy.\n\n【6】However the day before surgery, she began to have spontaneous bleeding. She developed both hematochezia and hematuria. On physical exam, she was pale and diaphoretic and her hemoglobin dropped from 7.5 to 6.5. She was given PRBCs. Surgical oncology was called for urgent, open splenectomy. Open splenectomy was successful and she immediately began to respond to platelet transfusions. At first her platelets were 213, but normalized to a baseline of 30 - 80. She was given platelets as needed when her platelets would drop below 20. The patient was started on high dose steroids and given romiplostim and her platelet count stabilized at 30 - 40 without the need for platelet transfusions. She was then discharged with a slow, tapering dose of steroids.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】This is a rare presentation of severe thrombocytopenia and spontaneous bleed in a patient with multi-system LCH. LCH is a rare disorder characterized by dysplasia and infiltration of immune cells similar in phenotype and morphology to the Langerhan’s cells of the mucosa and skin single-system involvement is the most common manifestation; however, multi-system involvement does occur and usually signifies a poor prognosis and high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. LCH most commonly affects bone, skin and the lymphatic system. It can also infiltrate into the CNS, lung, liver and spleen. Infiltration into bone marrow, spleen and liver usually denote a worse prognosis. The etiology is unclear and there is continuing research to differentiate whether LCH is a malignant or reactive process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-7 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is made with a biopsy of bone or skin lesions showing characteristic histiocytes with staining positive for CD1a and CD207.\n\n【9】Treatment depends on whether there is single-system or multi-system organ involvement and whether at risk organs (bone marrow, liver, or spleen) are involved. Treatment varies widely based on the organs involved, but usually involves treatment with prednisone, vinblastine, etoposide, 6-mercaptopurine or a combination of the above. Patients with single-system disease have high rates of spontaneous remissions and good outcomes.

Patients with multi-system disease that respond poorly to initial chemotherapy and those with “at risk” organ involvement generally have very poor outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8-12 \\]</u>. Because of the rarity of the disease and its varied presentation few randomized trials have been done to study optimal treatment regimens.

The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 31 kg in the right and 29 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, left-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was positive. Manual muscle testing on the left upper extremity demonstrated that pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, biceps brachii, triceps brachialis, and brachioradialis were at grade 4, while extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris at grade 5-. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. However, manual muscle testing on the right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities demonstrated no abnormalities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation, and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense), and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis, and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. Dysmetria, decomposition of movement, and intension tremor were not observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were slow on the left side. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the left side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. As a result, there was moderate weakness in the left upper extremity with proximal dominancy. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest roentgenogram findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized MMI on the right side . Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Seven days of intravenous argatroban therapy were performed. Thereafter, oral clopidogrel at 75 mg/day was initiated.

She underwent several surgical repairs, and she further developed osteomyelitis. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she continued to receive IV vancomycin and cefepime. After 3 weeks into vancomycin and 2 weeks on cefepime, patient started to have fever (101 °F) and generalized erythematous papular rash. Cefepime was stopped in lieu of this rash. Her rash resolved; however, fever persisted. Four weeks into vancomycin, patient was reportedly hypoxic in the 80’s, and tachycardic hence was brought back at our institution. Upon arrival, vital signs were BP 97/49, HR 108, RR 22, temp 37.7, O <sub>2 </sub> sat 97% on 2 L NC. Physical examination revealed mild confusion, bibasal crackles, no mumurs, normal abdomen and no rash seen. She was given fluid boluses, and blood pressure was responsive. Vancomycin was shifted to daptomycin, and imipinem-cilastatin started. Laboratory studies initially revealed WBC 21.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, eosinophils 2.2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, platelet 264 and lymphocytes 36%. Urinalysis showed protein 100 mg/dL, WBC 1-5 and RBC 1-3, and no atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral smear. Her blood chemistry result is remarkable for Cr 1.51 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, AST 710 unit/L, ALT 659 unit/L, alk phos 459 unit/L and lactic acid 2.8 mg/dL. Serologic test results were remarkable for CMV quantitative PCR 14,274 unit/mL and positive HHV-6 PCR, negative HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, influenza, corona virus, RSV, adenovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, aspergillus galactomannan and blastomyces antigen. Blood cultures were persistently negative. Chest CT showed pulmonary edema and patchy ground glass opacities in upper and lower lobes with mediastinal, bilateral hilar and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies with the largest lymph node being 1.4 cm. Liver US showed mild hepatosplenomegaly. ANA panel negative, TEE negative. Bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed eosinophilia and reactive changes. Flow cytometry showed reactive lymphocytosis. Extensive workup has basically failed to reveal a definite diagnosis. Patient continued to be febrile and tachycardic with broad spectrum antibiotics even with addition of voriconazole. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia worsened. Progressive elevation of liver function tests, worsening kidney function and onset of another rash prompted discontinuation of all antibiotics. Leukocytosis, eosinophilia, ground glass opacities on chest CT, transaminitis and acute kidney injury started to abate down slowly, and patient was no longer febrile and tachycardic. One week after this improvement, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis but without eosinophilia recurred. Liver function tests were noted to be trending down, but total bilirubin and creatinine remained elevated. A notable desquamative type of pruritic rash was also noted . Consequent to this, patient had worsening liver synthetic function manifesting with jaundice, elevated INR, prolonged PTT, elevated bilirubin and low fibrinogen. Supportive therapy was maintained. At the time steroids and liver biopsy were being contemplated, patient had gradually improved on her synthetic liver function and acute kidney injury. She was at this time discharged to an acute long-term care facility in stable condition.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Currently there are no accurate diagnostic criteria for DRESS, but it is a syndrome diagnosed by exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. RegiSCAR scoring system has been used to grade DRESS cases as “possible”, “probable” or “definite” DRESS. A delayed onset of symptoms 2 - 6 weeks after the initiation of the causative drug is a feature of DRESS more so with probable/definite cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The average time of recovery is 6 - 9 weeks with clinical course characterized by several flare-ups of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It has been reported that these flares might be induced by introduction of new drugs versus simply part of the natural course of DRESS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In addition, relapses have been reported associated with reactivation of HHV-6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and CMV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. It is postulated that HHV-6 may interfere with some of the enzymes responsible for drug detoxification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our case was a “definite” DRESS achieving a RegiSCAR score of 8, and in addition other causes had been ruled out, CMV and HHV-6 reactivation were detected and the time of onset plus resolution of symptoms match the usually reported presentation of DRESS. Vancomycin was the likely causative agent considering timing of onset of symptoms after initiation of drug. This case also describes flare-ups during the clinical course. It is unknown if prompt initiation of steroids in our patient might have caused a more rapid recovery for DRESS syndrome as one study have shown a notable symptomatic and laboratory improvement after 3 days of completing 48 h of steroid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although DRESS has been less commonly reported due to vancomycin compared to more common drugs such as anticonvulsants and allopurinol, DRESS cases related to vancomycin are rising in numbers likely from increased use for MRSA and continuous IV infusions leading to higher trough levels and hence toxicity of vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis and treatment, most importantly identifying and stopping the drug, remain to be the most important step in the management of DRESS syndrome.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】We report a case of DRESS syndrome associated with a high risk medication, vancomycin with clinical course complicated with flare of symptoms even after stopping drug. Drug exposure also overlaps with several other drugs like cefepime, daptomycin, imipenem-cilastatin, moxifloxacin and voriconzole; however, the timeline that has been described for DRESS most especially fits vancomycin exposure in this patient. This case also demonstrated reactivation of herpesvirus that has been reportedly associated with DRESS syndrome. It is possible that the addition of other drugs together with herpesvirus reactivation and absence of steroid therapy all contributed to this patient’s prolonged and complicated clinical course and associated relapse. Vancomycin, as a commonly used drug especially with increasing MRSA, warrants increased awareness of its association with DRESS, since it can prompt early recognition of symptoms and withdrawal of offending drug.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest to report.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Treatment with a taxane- or platinum-based regimen is recommended for patients with poor prognosis for cancers of unknown primary. This case was a cancer of unknown primary, but carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, s-pancreas antigen-1 (SPan-1), and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen (DU-PAN-2) were abnormally high. Endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed of the soft tissue shadow near the tail of the pancreas. And a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was made. Pancreatic cancer was presumed and FOLFIRINOX was performed and it was effective. Pancreatic cancer was confirmed by postmortem pathological autopsy.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】The patient was a 52-year-old man. He had no significant medical history. His family history included colorectal cancer and prostate cancer in his father. A blood test in June 2020 revealed an abnormally high level of hepatobiliary enzymes, and he was referred to our hospital.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】A blood test at our hospital also showed an increase in hepatobiliary enzymes, and CA19-9, SPan-1, and DU-PAN-2 were abnormally high. Thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) showed soft shadows near the liver hilum, near the celiac artery, near the tail of the pancreas, omentum, ileocecal region, and appendix . No hypovascular enhancement and pancreatic duct dilatation, which are typical imaging features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, were observed. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed abnormal uptake in soft tissue shadows .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. CT scan and PET-CT scan.

The soft tissue was not in contact with the pancreas. And a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (cytokeratin 7 (CK7)+/CK20+/CA19-9+, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-) was made. Pancreatic head tumor was not clear when EUS was performed.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. EUS-FNA of the soft tissue shadow near the tail of the pancreas. EUS showing the soft tissue shadow near the tail of the pancreas (arrow head) is punctured by the needle (arrow).

On August 18, 2020, obstructive jaundice due to an increase in the liver hilum tumor was observed. No obstruction of the lower common bile duct was observed. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) tube was placed. This led to an improvement in jaundice and hepatobiliary enzyme levels. A thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced CT performed on September 3, 2020, for the purpose of determining the effects showed SD and a reduction in ascitic fluid. A decrease in tumor markers was observed. We decided to continue treatment with FOLFIRINOX and continued it until the fifth cycle. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital on November 20, 2020, with grade 3 anemia. Abdominal CT showed exacerbation of peritoneal dissemination and increased ascites. We continued treatment with blood transfusions and ascites punctures, but the patient died on December 9, 2020.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】On the same day, we performed a pathological autopsy. The pathological result was a diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer 通用删除1(英):<u>(CK7+/CK20+/CA19-9+, Fig. 3 )</u>. Pancreatic head cancer could not be found on EUS.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Neoplastic cells, hematoxylin-eosin stain, immunohistochemical stains × 100.

Pathological anatomy is important to confirm the validity of treatment. We discuss each of these separately below.\n\n【17】FOLFIRINOX is effective against cancers of unknown primary presumed to be pancreatic cancer\n\n【18】Cancers of unknown primary make up 3-5% of malignant tumors, and no improvement in overall survival has been observed over the last 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. If the patient is judged to have a poor prognosis based on the location of the lesion and clinical/pathological characteristics, chemotherapy is the main treatment. Among the cancers of unknown primary in the poor prognosis group, several studies have reported on adenocarcinoma treated with a taxane- or platinum-based regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Lee et al performed an analysis that combined a systematic review and meta-analysis. Adjusted prognostic factors showed no significant difference in survival benefit between platinum-based and non-platinum-based regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A systematic review by Amela et al concluded that there is no specific regimen that can be recommended for these cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Currently, chemotherapy for patients with disseminated metastasis is limited to patients with good performance status (PS). The regimens in their study were often taxane- or platinum-based, but no specific regimen was recommended.\n\n【19】In the present case, EUS-FNA was used to collect tissue from the tail of the pancreas, and immunostaining revealed CK7+/CK20+/CA19-9+, and a blood test showed abnormal CA19-9, SPan-1, and DU-PAN-2. Since the values were high, we decided to start treatment for a suspected pancreatic cancer of unknown primary cancer. FOLFIRINOX was selected as the regimen. A total of five cycles of treatment were performed. Although CT indicated SD, we judged that the disease condition was temporarily suppressed. Anne et al reported a case of cancer of unknown primary suspected to be pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This is the second report of FOLFIRINOX for cancer of unknown primary origin with presumptive pancreatic cancer. Currently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) for cancers of unknown primary is being performed, and it has been pointed out that it may improve the prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the future, further optimization of treatment is desired by accumulating cases.\n\n【20】Pathological anatomy is important to confirm validity of treatment\n\n【21】In some cases, as in this case, the primary lesion cannot be identified even if cancer is diagnosed by pathological examination of the metastatic lesion. Cancers of unknown primary make up 3-5% of all malignancies. The prognosis for cancers of unknown primary is poor and overall survival is 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There is no commonly agreed-upon chemotherapy regiment for such cancers. In order to confirm the validity of treatment to improve future treatment, it is important to examine the primary lesion by pathological autopsy. In this case, the primary lesion could be confirmed in the head of the pancreas by performing pathological autopsy. The primary lesion in this case could not be confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT or PET-CT while the patient was alive. FOLFIRINOX is not a common treatment for cancers of unknown primary. However, in this case, treatment with FOLFIRINOX was considered to be appropriate.\n\n【22】In this case, pancreatic cancer was diagnosed as a cancer of unknown primary, and treatment was performed in the same manner as for pancreatic cancer. Later, pathological autopsy revealed pancreatic cancer. It is not always necessary to choose taxane- or platinum-based chemotherapy, which has been widely reported on, even for cancers of unknown primary. If there is a suspected primary lesion, the physician may choose the treatment most appropriate for cancers of that origin. In the case of cancer of unknown primary, it is important to perform pathological autopsy as much as possible in order to confirm the validity of the treatment performed. This will allow the physician to improve future treatment for cancer patients.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient described in the case report had given informed consent for the case report to be published.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Naonori Inoue: case selection, discussion and drafting manuscript; Genichiro Matsumoto: drafting manuscript and revision; Shiho Sumitomo: drafting manuscript and revision; Atsushi Sirakawa: manuscript revision and final approval; Koichiro Mandai: manuscript revision and final approval; Takuji Kawamura: manuscript revision and final approval; Koji Uno: case selection, planning, manuscript revision and final approval.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CA: carbohydrate antigen; EUS-FNA: endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration; SPan: s-pancreas antigen; DU-PAN-2: pancreatic cancer-associated antigen; CT: computed tomography; PET: positron emission tomography; CK: cytokeratin; MSI: microsatellite instability; ERCP: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; ERBD: endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage; SD: stable disease; PS: performance status; NGS: next-generation sequencing</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are rarely seen in adults and occur as a result of the tongue base mucus retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. These cysts might be asymptomatic or might be associated with airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and failure to thrive during infancy, and even with death due to severe laryngeal obstruction \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. In cases with laryngeal inlet obstruction due to a vallecular cyst, the airway management sometimes might be a challenge \\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]. In this case report, the airway management of an adult patient with difficult airway due to a large vallecular cyst completely obstructing the pharynx was presented.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】This case report was presented after obtaining the patient’s written informed consent. A 28-year-old male patient who was experiencing foreign body sensation in his throat, dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness and snoring that persisted for 2 months, presented with his complaints to the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic. In the indirect laryngoscopic examination, a cystic mass with a smooth surface filling vallecula was detected, and under general anesthesia, the excision of the cystic formation was scheduled. No abnormality was found during the preanesthetic routine systemic physical examination and laboratory investigations. The view of oropharyngeal structures was evaluated as Mallampati class 1. The patient was taken to the operating room without premedication and standard monitoring was applied. As patients with vallecular cyst have the potential for a difficult airway, in addition to tracheostomy and other difficult airway equipment, an otorhinolaryngology specialist was made available during anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 50% O <sub>2 </sub> and air and when necessary with bolus propofol administration. Following tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with end-tidal (ET) 2.5% sevoflurane in 50% O <sub>2 </sub> \\-air and i.v. 1 µg/kg fentanyl. Since mask ventilation could only be provided with two practitioners, the patient’s spontaneous breathing was maintained. Direct laryngoscopic attempts and intubation were performed without muscle relaxant. Despite the use of different laryngoscopic blades 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. = 3, Macintosh and Miller)</u>, no laryngeal structure was seen due to the cystic formation. Therefore, it was decided to aspirate cyst content under laryngoscopy. After aspiration of approximately 20 mL cyst content with a needle, the peripheral side of the epiglottis was seen on the left-upper side of the shrunken cyst . Therefore, laryngoscopy was performed by an insertion of the left side of the mouth, and tracheal intubation was achieved by endotracheal tube which was advanced blindly under the epiglottis. After confirming the tracheal placement of the tube with pulmonary auscultation, SpO <sub>2 </sub> and ET CO <sub>2 </sub> monitoring, surgery was started, and surgical excision of the cyst was performed. The patient’s oxygenation was maintained at normal values with mask ventilation performed with two applicators until endotracheal intubation was achieved. Eight milligrams dexamethasone was administered intravenously as a precaution against potential airway edema. Upon completing the operation, anesthesia application was finalized and tracheal extubation was performed without any problem. Histopathological examination of the excised material confirmed a vallecular cyst. A week later, due to cyst reoccurrence, the patient was operated on again. With the presence of otorhinolaryngology, difficult airway equipment was made available and anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen and air. Probably due to the fact that the size of the cyst was smaller than the previous one, neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium was given in order to facilitate laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation since mask ventilation was easily provided. Upon the request of the surgeon, cyst content was not aspirated. The previous experience was taken into account, direct laryngoscopy was performed through insertion of the left side of the mouth and tracheal intubation was achieved with a single attempt. No problem arose during the course of anesthesia, surgical intervention and the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. After aspiration of cyst content laryngoscopic view. (A) epiglottis. (B) cyst. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】The size of a vallecular cyst has a tendency to increase with mucus secretion. As in our patient, since the large cyst prevented the view of the larynx, the airway management is of particular importance. In the cases where the larynx inlet is completely closed by the cystic formation, generally more than one intervention is performed and tracheal intubation can be performed by using laryngoscopes designed for difficult airway, fiberoptic or rigid bronchoscopy \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]. Unfortunately, we have not a fiberoptic bronchoscopy or a video laryngoscope device. In some cases, mask ventilation is achieved with great difficulty, direct laryngoscopic oral intubation might not be achieved and urgent tracheostomy might be required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. In the cases in which laryngeal view is blocked by the cyst, glottis might be visualized with the aspiration of the cyst content and tracheal intubation might be achieved. Vijayanand et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported that in an adult patient with a large (4 × 3 cm size) vallecular cyst occupying all of the tongue base, epiglottis and larynx are apparent upon the aspiration of the cyst content with a needle under local anesthesia, and endotracheal intubation could be easily performed on the next day under general anesthesia. Probably we were able to see a part of the epiglottis since we could not completely aspirate the cyst content.\n\n【7】Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations showed that the position of the epiglottis can be changed according to the placement of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our case, after draining a large portion of cyst content, we detected that the epiglottis was pushed to left side by the vallecular cyst located in the right side of the tongue base. Therefore, although direct laryngoscopy is performed through insertion of the right side of the mouth, we performed direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation through the insertion of the left side of the mouth. Cheng et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> revealed that the laryngeal inlet was obstructed by the cyst in a 50-day-old infant with a large vallecular cyst, when the blade was on the midline. In a similar manner we performed, they moved the blade to 45° left from the midline, and they placed it laterally and achieved intubation.\n\n【8】As a result, they are able to obtain the view of the glottis or other laryngeal structures by shrinking the vallecular cyst size by needle aspiration of its content. Despite the fact that routine direct laryngoscopy is performed by entering from the right side of the mouth, performing laryngoscopy through insertion of the midline or left side, alternatively, can provide laryngeal view and facilitate tracheal intubation.\n\n【9】Grant Support\n\n【10】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

If this communication fails to heal, then a fistula is formed. The majority of literature on transradial AV fistula is based on case reports, with timing of AV fistula diagnosis ranging from weeks up to 1 year post-angiography. We present a rare case of AV fistula formation as an early complication of transradial angiography.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 76-year-old man with a background history of mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) on warfarin anticoagulation presented with syncopal episodes and chest pains. He had a permanent pacemaker (PPM) inserted for sinus bradycardia with trifascicular block on ECG. He also underwent diagnostic transradial coronary angiography using a 5-French radial sheath with Judkins 3.5 catheters (Terumo Medical Corporation) which revealed significant calcification and stenosis in mid right coronary artery (RCA). A decision was made for elective rotablation and stenting of RCA 1 month post-PPM with pre-procedural warfarin cessation and bridging anticoagulation via clexane. No complication was noted following initial angiography.\n\n【5】The rotablation and stenting to the RCA was again performed via right radial approach using 6-French radial sheath (Terumo Medical Corporation). Pre-procedural Allen’s test was normal. Anticoagulation was administered with heparin 12,000 units. The RCA lesion was wired with a 0.014 inch Runthrough Extra Floppy wire (Terumo Medical Corporation) with balloon exchange to a Rota-Floppy wire (Boston Scientific). The heavily calcified RCA lesion was rotablated with a 1.5 mm burr (Boston Scientific), following which pre-dilation was performed with serial noncompliant balloons (Boston Scientific; Abbott Vascular). A 3.5 × 28 mm bare metal multi-link stent (Abbott Vascular) was deployed and post-dilation was done with a 3.5 mm balloon to 18 atmospheres pressure (Abbott Vascular). The radial artery sheath was removed immediately after the procedure and hemostasis was achieved by application of an adjustable plastic clamp of the radial artery (TR Terumo band). The clamp was gradually released over few hours while the access site was monitored for bleeding and hematoma. Patient was commenced on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), and his warfarin was recommenced with bridging clexane cover.\n\n【6】On day 5 post-procedure, patient complained of pulsatile swelling with minimal tenderness on palpation over the right radial artery. He did not complain of finger claudication or numbness, and the Allen’s test remained normal. An ultrasound Doppler was arranged which confirmed small AV fistula connecting the right radial artery with a superficial vein over the access site . The AV fistula was managed conservatively with TR Terumo band application for 24 h and limb elevation. No alteration to his anti-thrombotic therapy was made. The patient had a follow-up Doppler US after 1 month which showed resolution of the AV fistula .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Repeat Doppler ultrasound of right radial artery (transverse view) showing resolution of AV fistula with no flow between radial artery and cephalic vein (arrow). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】The benefits of using radial artery as angiography access, which is a superficial and readily compressible artery compared to the femoral artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, have been shown in multiple observational and randomized controlled studies. The 2012 randomized controlled RIVAL study showed that access site complications were significantly less in the transradial group (1.4%) compared to the transfemoral group (3.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Similar rates have been reported by a systematic review with vascular complication rates of 0.59% via transradial approach compared to 3.71% via transfemoral approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In addition, transradial access is associated with earlier ambulation, greater patient comfort, and earlier discharges from the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The low incidence of AV fistula formation complicating transradial coronary angiography is illustrated in a recent large case series of 10,324 patients by Tatli et al, where only four cases of AV fistula were documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Patients with iatrogenic radial AV fistula are usually asymptomatic and typically present with a pulsatile mass, thrill, or bruit over the wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The time to diagnosis can be variable from weeks up to a year from the angiography procedure. In our case, our patient first noticed his pulsatile mass 5 days after his procedure, which was relatively early in onset.\n\n【12】Duplex ultrasonography is the routine screening test for patients with suspected AV fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Factors have been identified which increases the risk of iatrogenic femoral AV fistula, although it is unclear whether they apply to transradial angiography as well. These factors were female sex, age more than 60, hypertension, prolonged warfarin therapy, and high heparin dose during interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In line with this, recommendations have been quoted in the literature to potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic AV fistula formation, including use of sheath sizes less than the arterial diameter, limitation on the number of arterial puncture attempts, gentle catheter manipulation and use of ultrasound guided needle placement to provide real time anatomic information on proximity of the radial artery to nearby veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】This report also reviewed existing literature on management strategies for iatrogenic radial AV fistula. The natural history of radial AV fistula is thought to be benign with most cases resolving spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, although serious consequences in the form of high output cardiac failure and distal limb ischemia can potentially occur. As in transfemoral AV fistula, three management strategies have been explored in transradial AV fistula, namely conservative management (including mechanical compression), implantation of covered stents and surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Earlier case reports on radial AV fistula have all utilized the use of surgical ligation, with a range of presentation from 2 months post-angiography up to 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u> . Out of the four AV fistula cases from Tatli et al, only one case required surgical ligation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. No complications from the surgical ligation itself were identified from these cases. The authors of this report have identified one case involving the use a covered stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, unlike transfemoral cases, the practicality of this technique is limited by the small size of the radial artery, and the potential risk of restenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Reported Cases of Transradial Arteriovenous Fistula and Management Strategy |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】Conservative management of radial AV fistula was reported on a patient who had this complication 1 month post-angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The fistula failed to resolve on 1-year follow-up but due to ongoing stable hemodynamic status, the management approach was continued. Seventy-five percent of the radial AV fistula cases reported by Tatli et al resolved with mechanical compression for 72 h and vertical arm rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In view of this, these studies have recommended that a conservative approach be the first-line treatment option for patients with AV fistula formation. Our experience with this early case of AV fistula provides further support to this management approach, with successful resolution following conservative treatment mechanical compression for 24 h.\n\n【17】In conclusion, AV fistula is a rare complication from transradial angiography.

Besides, radiation exposure can cause thyroid malignancy, RAI therapy is recommended as the first choice for toxic adenoma by American Thyroid Association (ATA) without performing fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). As there is no reported cancer case that developed from hot nodule, routine FNAB is not recommended by ATA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In this report, a case with papillary thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic thyroid nodule is presented.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A thirty-four year old female patient was admitted to hospital for toxic adenoma in 2007. At the initial investigation, TSH, FT <sub>4 </sub> , FT <sub>3 </sub> , anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibody and antithyroglobulin autoantibody (Anti Tg) levels were 0.189 µIU/mL (N:0.35-5.5 µIU/mL), 1.48 ng/dL (N: 0.85 - 1.78 ng/dL), 3.26 pg/mL (N: 157 - 4.71 pg/mL), 133 IU/mL (N: 0 - 35 IU/mL) and 337 IU/mL (N: 0 - 40 IU/mL), respectively. Thyroid ultrasonography (USG) showed a calcified solid nodule with cystic degenarations, in a size of 2 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm, at right thyroid lobe and the <sup>99m </sup> Tc thyroid scintigraphy showed a hyperactive/hot nodule at right thyroid lobe . After the diagnosis, 444 MBq (12 mci)通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>131 </sup></u> I treatment was administered orally in June, 2007. After RAI therapy, patient remained in euthyroid status.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. 99m Tc scintigraphy showing a hot nodule at the right thyroid region. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】On January 2010, she was admitted at the hospital with a mass at the left side of her neck. After a physical examination, there was a palpable mobile mass at the left side of thyroid lobe. Thyroid USG showed two classified nodules at right thyroid lobe (9.5 and 10 mm in diameter), a heterogeneous mass with cystic areas and lobulated contours (30 mm × 17 mm × 44 mm) at the left side of the cervical region and lymph node with narrow hilus at bilateral cervical regions, larger one measuring 11 mm×5.5 mm. FNAB was performed and it revealed “papillary thyroid carcinoma” in the thyroid nodule at right lobe and “suspected for malignancy” in the mass at the left side.\n\n【6】On April 2011, the patient underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection. The histopathological examination showed papillary carcinoma in size 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm at right thyroid lobe, 0.4 cm in left thyroid lobe and five metastatic lymph nodes at the left central neck . On L-thyroxine replacement therapy, post-operative serum TSH, thyroglobulin and anti Tg levels were 0.01 µIU/mL, < 0.2 ng/mL (1.6 - 59.9 ng/mL) and 63.2 IU/mL, respectively.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Post ablative 9 th day whole body 131 I scan showing a remnant at the left thyroid bed. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting papillary thyroid cancer arising from toxic adenoma following RAI therapy. The prevalence of thyroid nodule increases with age and it is more common in women. Nearly less than 10% of all thyroid nodules are toxic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Initial evaluation of all thyroid nodules require FNAB, however, as the rate of malignancy in toxic nodule is low and benign hyperfunctioning nodules may be cytologically indistinguishable from non functioning benign follicular neoplasms and follicular cancer, ATA doesn’t recommend it for toxic ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. It is reported that toxic nodules are almost never malignant and cold nodules are 5 - 8% malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The usage of RAI therapy for toxic goitre is increasing worldwide and the disadvantage of radioactive iodine therapy is the possibility of radiation induced malignancy.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>131 </sup></u> I has relatively high photon energy (364 keV), long half life (nearly 8 day) and the presence of beta particle emissions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Latency period between radiation exposure and development of thyroid cancer ranges between a minimum of 3 - 7 years and a maximum of 40 - 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The risk of the development of thyroid malignancy decreases with age and after the age of 20 years the risk is less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In our patient, if we accept that the thyroid cancer developed as a consequence of first RAI therapy, there had been nearly 4 years between first RAI therapy and the diagnosis of cancer. This was consistent with the literature for the development of the thyroid cancer after radioiodine.\n\n【14】In the literature, there are few reports about thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic nodulary or diffused goiter. Staffurth et al. reported a folliculary thyroid cancer following RAI therapy for Graves’ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In their case, FTC derived 17 years after the RAI therapy. Similarly, there are some reports of anaplastic thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic goiter \\[ 6 \\- 9 \\].\n\n【15】In the case, FNAB was not performed before the first RAI therapy. It is not known whether the cancer had been there before the therapy or it was developed after the therapy. Therefore, FNAB must be performed for all nodules before RAI therapy.\n\n【16】In conclusion, differentiated thyroid cancer can be found incidentally in toxic nodule or can be developed as a consequence of RAI therapy for toxic nodule. FNAB must be performed for all the patients with hot or cold thyroid nodules before RAI therapy and all the patients taking RAI theraphy should be closely followed in terms of nodule growth and cancer development.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have no relevant conflict of to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Extramedullary PCD, which belongs to the category of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is present in about 3% of all plasma cell neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

The etiology of ITP is still unknown, and the diagnosis remains exclusionary. In 80% of the cases it may present alone (primary) or with other associated (secondary) clinical conditions, such as viral and bacterial infections or changes in immune status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Identifying trigger factors that cause ITP is extremely difficult, and a variety of viral infections have been associated with ITP, among which the most common ones are the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus. In this context, no data regarding infection of the SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbation of previous ITP treated with splenectomy have been recently published.\n\n【2】Here, we present a clinical case of exacerbation of ITP related to COVID-19, a disease whose causative agent is a virus of Coronaviridae family, and a producer of respiratory and systemic disease, which could progress to a severe form of pneumonia in 10-15% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 46-year-old man diagnosed with ITP since childhood and submitted to splenectomy at age of 9 years, had stabilized platelet levels between around 50,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> without any further treatment. Recently, in March 2020 the patient presented with a history of odynophagia, headache, and fever with dry cough for a couple of days. At this time, no shortness of breath was documented. On physical examination, lungs were clear and respiratory frequency was normal. Petechiae throughout lower limbs were found.\n\n【5】Initial laboratory showed platelets of 9,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and D-dimer of 630 (normal range up to 500 ng/mL), with no other tests abnormalities. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharynx swab was positive while other viral studies (influenza, parainfluenza and dengue virus) were negative. Chest tomography revealed incipient peribronchovascular micronodular opacities in the periphery of the lower lobe of the left lung, suggesting a tenuous inflammatory/infectious process. Despite the previous history of ITP, new tests for HIV, hepatitis C and B were done and came negative. Bone marrow aspirate showed normocellular with no morphological changes. In order to avoid high dose corticosteroids, we started treatment with a single course of intravenous human immunoglobulin 1 g/kg and eltrombopag 50 mg daily. No antimicrobial treatment or any other therapy for COVID-19 was given.\n\n【6】After 3 days of treatment, platelets levels increased to 36,000/m <sup>3 </sup> and the patient was discharged from the hospital in very good health condition, without fever or cough. Fifteen days after discharge, no SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected and platelets count was 320,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> .\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】The relationship between acute and chronic infections and the development of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia represent a widely unexplored paradigm, and response to an infectious agent could result in loss of immune self-regulation. The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenic purpura with infection involves several immunological pathways, as well as non-immune mechanisms that accelerate platelet destruction.\n\n【9】Noteworthy, during infections other potential causes of thrombocytopenia should always be considered, for example, hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia (HCV) may also result from liver cirrhosis, leading to portal hypertension and hypersplenism and/or decreased liver production of thrombopoietin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, the relationship between the infectious agent and the development of thrombocytopenia is clearly demonstrated by improvements in platelet levels following successful treatment of the underlying infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Regarding acute infections, it has long been suspected that an acute event may be a trigger for the onset of primary ITP. In newly diagnosed ITP, there is usually a history of symptoms that can be attributed to infection in the days or weeks before diagnosis. In some cases, a pathogen is detected (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza virus, varicella-zoster virus), which qualifies these cases as secondary ITP. However, in most acute cases of ITP, a pathogen is not identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】SARS-CoV-2 was identified in late 2019 as the cause of a set of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has spread rapidly, resulting in a pandemic crisis. Morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that could progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however most patients are oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Several newly published articles relate platelet count and acute infection by the new corona virus \\[ 10 \\- 13 \\]. Recently, a Chinese meta-analysis associated thrombocytopenia with severe infection by the new coronavirus. This meta-analysis demonstrated that thrombocytopenia is common in critically ill patients and usually suggests malfunction or physiological decompensation, as well as the development of intravascular coagulopathy, often evolving to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In patients with COVID-19, the mechanism for patients with thrombocytopenia is likely to be multifactorial. In SARS, it was suggested that the combination of viral infection and mechanical ventilation would lead to endothelial damage, triggering platelet activation, aggregation and thrombosis in the lung, causing widespread platelet consumption. Coronavirus can also directly infect bone marrow elements, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis or trigger an autoimmune response against blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In another publication with 47 cases of COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia, leukopenia (14%), lymphopenia (34%), lymphocytosis (11%) and thrombocytopenia (36%) were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient had a previous diagnosis of ITP treated with splenectomy, and although with very low platelets, no signs of clinical severity related to the new coronavirus were present. Due to the paucity of data regarding this pandemic virus together with an unprecedented fast knowledge acquisition worldwide we highlight the importance of this case report of a pre-existing ITP exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\n【14】Because it is an emerging disease, we still do not have sufficient data relating ITP to the new coronavirus.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】Our case suggests COVID-19 as a causal factor of worsening previous ITP, with temporal correlation present and exclusion of other clinical conditions. Further studies are needed on the interaction of the new coronavirus with complications of the hematopoietic system, as in this particular case, thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ML, LMC, JP, SL and AA wrote the article.

The incidence differs from developed and undeveloped countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>; 134,490 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the United States on 2016. Patients can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, depending on the location or progression and may present with different clinical features. The diagnosis is usually made with screening colonoscopy on asymptomatic patients, while other patients are diagnosed after presenting symptoms such as hematochezia, iron deficiency anemia, changes in bowel movements, and abdominal pain. Also on emergency surgical procedures, tumor may be found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Uncommon presentations of colon cancer can mimic diverticulitis, and malignant fistulas on rectosigmoid locations and also can be seen as multiple abscesses on different areas of the gastrointestinal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】The case was a 50-year-old woman, G3P3AO, with a past medical history of hypertension, major depressive disorder and hysterectomy in 2003. The patient does not have any toxic habits or family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease; the only history of malignancy is her mother who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 71. Patient’s first visit to emergency room (ER) was in August 2016 with symptoms that included suprapubic pain, flank pain and fever. The patient was managed with oral antibiotics for urinary tract infection and discharged home from ER. Three months later, the patient presented with similar symptoms, but this time, an abdomen-pelvis CT scan was remarkable for acute diverticulitis and was treated accordingly. Patient was discharged home after completing antibiotics and tolerating oral diet. Patient returned to ER on January 2017 with an acute abdomen, loss of appetite, fever, and nausea, and a CT scan with IV and PO contrast was repeated. The CT scan showed concentric thickening of the bowel wall with associated mural abscess, and fistulous connection between the sigmoid colon and vaginal cuff with rectal material on the vaginal cuff. Also a fistulous connection between the sigmoid colon and the left abdominal muscle was found. These findings were consistent with colitis and multiple fistulas; however, colonoscopy was recommended to rule out malignancy. Colonoscopy was performed 2 months later after receiving IV antibiotics and biopsy taken from the sigmoid colon was negative for malignancy. Patient’s symptoms worsened with active purulent secretions from abdominal wall and secretions of vaginal area that she described as fecal material. Patient was seen by gynecology service for evaluation of rectovaginal fistula, abundant fecal material was found at the vagina, and patient was referred to colorectal surgeon. Patient symptoms recurred by May 2017; however, this time, the patient developed new enterocolonic, enterocutaneous, and colovaginal fistula seen on abdomen-pelvis CT scan with wall thickening and stranding in mesentery. At this moment, Crohn’s disease was suspected and was transferred for inflammatory bowel disease specialist evaluation. Colonoscopy was repeated and a biopsy from a mass on the sigmoid colon was taken and pathology reported an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The different fistulas can be classified in accordance to the different anatomic connections. External gastrointestinal fistulas result from connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin and drains to the outside part of the body and are called enterocutaneous. Internal fistulas do not drain through the skin and are connections between the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs. The origin and insertion is used for the nomenclature of each fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Trauma associated with childbirth is the most common cause of rectovaginal fistula which was the first fistula that appeared in this patient. Tears of the perineum that extend to the bowel or procedures to facilitate delivery on prolonged and difficult labor can produce this type of fistula. Crohn’s disease is the second most common cause of inflammatory process on the gastrointestinal tract associated with the development of fistula and also abscesses are common complications of this disease. Malignancy and radiation therapy on the pelvic area can also predispose patients to develop fistulas. Finally, surgical procedures are other common causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The development of multiple abscesses and fistulas on adjacent parts to the colon is a common complication of Crohn’s disease and can also be associated with complicated infectious process along the gastrointestinal tract. This patient had a hysterectomy which is a known risk factor for the development of fistula; however, the hysterectomy was done 14 years before the appearance of the fistulas, suggesting that the surgical procedure was not the primary cause of the development of fistula and abscesses. Prolonged labor is also unlikely to be the primary cause of the development of multiple fistulas because patient time frame of last pregnancy exceeds more than 15 years and this presentation would have occurred earlier. Patient also had a diverticulitis that could result in the complications seen in this case such as multiple abscesses and rarely development of fistula. The patient persisted several months with multiple abscesses that probably led to the development of new fistula seen later. However, the rectovaginal fistula was present at the moment when multiple abscesses were found on the imaging studies. Crohn’s disease is another possible pathology associated with fistula and multiple abscesses were ruled out on two colonoscopies where tissue biopsy was taken.\n\n【15】In this case, the colorectal cancer of the sigmoid was diagnosed on the second colonoscopy. It is atypical due to patient age, negative family history, and initial presentation with rectovaginal fistula and multiple abscesses. From this case, we can learn that colorectal cancer can mimic other conditions such as Crohn’s disease or complicated infectious process and colon adenocarcinoma should be part of the differential diagnosis on patients presenting with fistulas and multiple abscesses. The symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical presentation can be very similar because the inflammation is the pathophysiology process of origin that can result from infectious process, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers are common laboratory findings seen in the three different pathologies. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, and changes in bowel movement can be seen in patients with either infectious process, inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. This case shows that colorectal cancer can present with atypical symptoms and workup should continue aggressively until a final diagnosis is made.\n\n【16】Inflammatory bowel disease can be related with extraintestinal manifestations that are not found in colorectal cancer. For example aphthous ulcers, ankylosing spondylitis, eye manifestations including uveitis and scleritis are not typically found on colorectal cancer. Some skin manifestations that can be found include pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and cutaneous vasculitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is not expected to be found in patients with colorectal cancer and is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, it has been associated with hematologic malignancies such as IGA monoclonal gammopathy, leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma and on rheumatic disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis \\[ 11 \\- 13 \\]. These clinical findings are not found on all patients with inflammatory bowel disease; however, they can help with establishing the correct diagnosis. In the case of this patient, none of these extraintestinal manifestations were found. Anti- Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) can be found in patients with Crohn’s disease in comparison to colorectal cancer. Imaging studies in some cases can have apple core sign that is most commonly associated with colorectal cancer; however, in some cases, Crohn’s disease can also be found. Skip lesions and cobblestone appearance are found in colonoscopy on patients with Crohn’s disease. Colonoscopy findings in colorectal cancer can be variable depending on the stage of the tumor and size can limit the evaluation of the entire colon if the mass is causing complete obstruction. On biopsy histologic findings can be different in the case of Crohn’s disease. Non-caseating granulomas may be found with transmural lymphocytic infiltration. Colorectal adenocarcinoma histology can be variable depending on the stage and the degree of differentiation. The degree on gland formation is variable, and abundant glands are associated with highly differentiated and moderate differentiated tumors, which can be surrounded by tall columnar cells, and extensive necrosis with debris. Non-caseating granulomas are not found on colorectal cancer. These are differences in colorectal cancer and Crohn’s disease; however, Crohn’s disease increases the risk of colorectal cancer, so patients with Crohn’s disease that develop colorectal cancer can have characteristics of both conditions in colonoscopy and histology. Screening colonoscopy is different in patients with Crohn’s disease from normal population without history of colorectal cancer and is done 8 - 10 years after diagnosis every 1 - 2 years.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of Alan Santiago M.D. attending of the Internal Medicine program of San Juan City Hospital, in the diagnosis, guidance of management and the preparation of the manuscript of this article.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No source of financial support to disclose.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease, 49.4% of patients with cirrhosis have serum sodium concentration less than 135 mmol/L. Hyponatremia in the setting of cirrhosis is associated with severe ascites, high frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, hyponatremia is also a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\n\n【2】The etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhotic patients can be attributed to either intravascular volume depletion commonly found in patients who receive high dose of diuretics or hypervolemic hyponatremia due to diminished effective circulatory volume (ECV) resulting from splanchnic vasodilatation. The diminished ECV due to splanchnic vasodilatation will lead to increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which in turn results in decreased ability to excrete the daily water intake. Whereas the treatment of hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to overdiuresis is to discontinue the diuretics and to restore the intravascular volume depletion with isotonic saline, the mainstay of treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to the impaired water excretion is free water restriction. Recently, vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist (V2RA) has been used as an alternative treatment in cirrhotic patients whose hyponatremia fails to correct with free water restriction alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The increase in serum sodium concentration occurs within the first few days of treatment and ranges from 2 to 7 mmol/L on average 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To date, there has been no report of the failure of V2RAs in correcting hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis. We report a patient with cirrhosis whose hyponatremia failed to improve with tolvaptan and conivaptan but subsequently corrected with treatment with midodrine and octreotide.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 51-year-old female with past medical history significant for alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple admissions for hyponatremia was admitted for management of severe hyponatremia. On presentation, the patient had a serum sodium concentration of 118 mmol/L associated with a serum and urine osmolality of 254 and 519 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O respectively. The patient’s hyponatremia failed to improve with free water restriction. Therefore, tolvaptan, a selective V2RA, was started with close monitoring of the patient’s serum sodium concentration (Of note, tolvaptan was FDA approved for treatment of hyponatremia secondary to cirrhosis at that time). Despite adequate up-titration from 15 to 60 mg over a 96-h period, her serum sodium level remained relatively unchanged at a level of 120 mmol/L. Due to the potential concern for inadequate gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, a decision was made to change from oral tolvaptan to intravenous conivaptan. Her serum sodium concentration, however, minimally improved to 123 mmol/L even after up-titration of the conivaptan to the maximum dose. On hospital day 13, the patient was started on midodrine and octreotide for treatment of acute kidney injury thought to be due to HRS, which slowly brought the patient’s serum sodium level from 122 to 132 mmol/L over a 5-day course coinciding with the resolution of the HRS. Repeat laboratory values revealed a stable serum sodium level of 135 mmol/L 2 weeks after initiation of the drugs.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】Hyponatremia commonly occurs in patients with cirrhosis. In cirrhosis, the pathogenesis is thought to be related to the hemodynamic changes and secondary neurohumoral adaptation that occurs in these patients. Patients with cirrhosis usually have a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and mean arterial pressure due to splanchnic vasodilatation. The splanchnic vasodilatation in cirrhotic patients results in arterial underfilling, and the resultant ECV depletion in these patients stimulates the secretion of ADH. The elevated ADH secretion leads to increased water reabsorption in the collecting tubule, which in turn results in decreased ability to excrete the daily water intake. Therefore, V2RAs can be an effective therapy for cirrhosis-associated hyponatremia by antagonizing the action of ADH at the collecting tubule. By reducing the urinary concentration in the collecting duct, V2RAs result in the urinary excretion of electrolyte-free water excretion.\n\n【7】In our patient, her hyponatremia, however, failed to improve with free water restriction and V2RAs. Her hyponatremia was refractory to tolvaptan and conivaptan despite a reduction in urine osmolality from 519 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O to 242 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O. Her hyponatremia persisted until she was started on midodrine (selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist) and octreotide (a somatostatin analog) for treatment of HRS. Treatment with midodrine and octreotide resulted in the resolution of the HRS as well as hyponatremia with an associated increment in her urinary output and relatively constant urinary osmolality.\n\n【8】The lack of response to the V2RAs in our patient was due to disruption in the mechanisms involved with dilute urine formation. The normal physiology of urinary dilution is determined by numerous factors such as normal glomerular filtration rate, adequate delivery of H <sub>2 </sub> O to the diluting segments of the nephron mediated by inhibition of proximal Na <sup>+ </sup> and H <sub>2 </sub> O absorption, intact Na <sup>+ </sup> and Cl <sup>- </sup> reabsorption at both the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubules, and the inhibition of H <sub>2 </sub> O absorption at the collecting duct resulting from the suppression of ADH secretion. In light of the aforementioned factors, the efficacy of the V2RAs in cirrhosis will be limited by the decrease in distal delivery of the filtrate to the collecting tubule which is the site of ADH action . Therefore, the lack of response to the V2RAs in our patient was likely due to the decreased GFR and avid proximal sodium and fluid reabsorption . The low urinary Na <sup>+ </sup> of < 20 mmol/L was consistent with the increased proximal sodium and fluid reabsorption resulting from the decreased ECV. This will in turn lead to diminished distal fluid delivery to the collecting tubule, the site of ADH action. Distal fluid delivery is best assessed by determining the sum of the fraction of filtered chloride excreted (chloride clearance/GFR) plus the fractional free water clearance (free water clearance/GFR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, urinary chloride concentration before and after treatment with midodrine and octreotide was not available to assess distal fluid delivery in this patient. However, the improvement in hyponatremia with midodrine and octreotide in our patient was likely due to increased distal fluid delivery to the collecting tubule as reflected in the increase in urinary output in the setting of relatively constant urinary osmolality. Urinary osmolality initially decreased from 519 mOsm/kg to 242 - 250 mOsm/kg after the administration of tolvaptan and conivaptan. After treatment of HRS with midodrine and octreotide, urinary osmolality remained relatively constant at 245 - 248 mOsm/kg. Although the urinary osmolality remained relatively constant, her urinary output increased from 570 - 1200 mL to 1750 - 1850 mL, thereby resulting in an increment in free water clearance. Free water clearance increased from 0.076 L/day prior to initiation of midodrine and octreotide to 0.31 L/day after administration of midodrine and octreotide. Unfortunately, urinary sodium and potassium concentrations were not available to calculate urinary electrolyte-free water clearance. The increase in free water clearance was likely due to increased fluid delivery to the diluting segments of the nephron and collecting tubule due to improvement in the ECV induced by midodrine and octreotide.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Impaired urinary dilution in cirrhosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】To date, this is the first case report of a cirrhotic patient with hyponatremia refractory to V2RAs which resolved with treatment with midodrine and octreotide. Further studies are needed to help substantiate the effectiveness of this novel therapeutic approach in cirrhotic patients whose hyponatremia fails to improve with V2RAs. In these patients, assessment of distal fluid delivery will be helpful in elucidating the mechanism of action of midodrine and octreotide in the correction of hyponatremia refractory to V2RAs.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is caused by a congenital vascular anomaly that occurs during aortic arch formation which causes extrinsic compression of the esophagus and surrounding structures. The vessel involved is known as the aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), or arterial lusoria. The prevalence is estimated to be between 0.5% and 0.7% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It usually presents in the fourth or fifth decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. About 20-40% of ARSA produces symptoms in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. ARSA has a female predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, with a gender distribution of about 44.7% and 55.3% in males and females, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The most important clinical hallmark in adults is dysphagia, especially to solids with globus sensation. The majority of patients would report one-sided dysphagia; however, most are asymptomatic and are usually incidentally found on imaging. Other symptoms include chest pain, hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve), chronic cough, Horner’s syndrome (due to oculosympathetic pathway compression), and weight loss due to reduced intake. Symptoms may worsen with advanced age due to atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries and increased esophageal rigidity. Treatment depends on multiple factors such as age, corresponding vascular anomalies, as well as comorbidities, and involves both medical and surgical approaches.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 56-year-old woman with a past medical history of peptic ulcer disease presented with a chief complaint of dysphagia to solid foods, globus sensation felt mostly on the right side of the chest, and occasional chest pain for several years. Chest pain was retrosternal, dull, 6/10 with no radiation, associated with shortness of breath, especially on moderate exertion, cough, and easy fatigability. On examination, the patient appeared frail. Vitals were stable. Body mass index (BMI) was 19 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> (18.5 - 24.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). Other examination findings were unremarkable. Laboratory data showed hemoglobin of 13 mg/dL (12 - 16 mg/dL), white blood cell (WBC) of 7.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (4 - 11 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL), serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (0.4 - 1.0 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 8 mg/dL (5 - 25 mg/dL). Troponins and liver function test were unremarkable. The patient had a chest radiograph which was unremarkable. Due to persistent chest pain, a left heart catheterization (LHC) was performed, which was negative for coronary artery disease. Autoimmune antibodies like antinuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1, anticentromere, anti-scl-70, and anti-ribonucleoprotein were all negative.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) done was unrevealing of any abnormality. The patient eventually had a barium esophagogram which came back positive for esophageal stricture . A subsequent computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed an abnormal right subclavian artery around the trachea and esophagus .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Surgical incision was through cervical approach. The aberrant artery was ligated near its root and connected with the right carotid artery.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】Patient recovered well from surgery. On follow-up by the 4 <sup>th </sup> month, she reported being able to tolerate solids without difficulties. She denied any further chest pain. We carried out a follow-up barium esophagogram which came out normal with no external compression of the esophagus.\n\n【14】Case 2\n\n【15】Investigations\n\n【16】A 60-year-old woman with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post LHC with percutaneous coronary intervention presented to the clinic complaining about mild to moderate intermittent dysphagia to solids for many years, unresponsive to acid suppressants. She denied any burning chest pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, laryngeal or esophageal surgeries. Physical examination revealed stable vitals with a body mass index of 18 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Other examination findings were unremarkable. Significant laboratory findings showed hemoglobin of 11.5 mg/dL (12 - 16 mg/dL), sodium of 135mmol/L (136 - 145 mmol/L), and potassium of 3.6 mmol/L (3.6 - 5.1 mmol/L). Troponins were negative. Chest radiography was unrevealing of any acute abnormality. Electrocardiography was negative for any ischemic changes.\n\n【17】Diagnosis\n\n【18】EGD did not show intra-luminal stricture . Esophageal manometry was normal. Barium esophagogram obtained showed esophageal narrowing. Due to high suspicion of a possible vascular anomaly, CT angiography was obtained which showed an ARSA compressing on the esophagus . Considering her cardiac history, patient also had an LHC which showed multivessel coronary artery disease.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3.

Patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery for concomitant coronary artery disease. The aberrant artery was divided at its origin through a median sternotomy and the distal subclavian artery was anastomosed to the aortic arch using a short interposition graft.\n\n【23】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【24】The patient showed successful recovery from surgery with no further complaints about difficulty swallowing.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【26】DL is caused by external esophageal compression by any of several congenital vascular anomalies such as ARSA, double aortic arch (caused by persistent right dorsal aorta), or an arterial lusoria aneurysm. The word aberrant is used when describing DL because the right subclavian artery (RSA) does not arise from the brachiocephalic trunk as it should physiologically but from the aortic arch. Developmental anomalies of the aortic arch are found in about 3% of people during autopsy. Three vessels that arise from the aortic arch during embryogenesis include the left common carotid artery, the left subclavian artery, and the innominate artery which gives rise to the right subclavian and common carotid artery. In the embryonic period, during the development of the heart and the aorta, there are a total of six aortic arches. The first and second arches usually degenerate. The third arch forms the internal carotid artery. The right aortic arch while still connected to the right posterior aorta gives rise to the brachiocephalic trunk which gives rise to the RSA. The right posterior aorta eventually obliterates leaving just the RSA. Occasionally, impaired degeneration of the right dorsal aorta results in a double aortic arch which can cause dysphagia. However, in a majority of DL, the RSA originates just inferior to the left subclavian artery and courses towards the right causing external compression of the esophagus with or without tracheal involvement. In 80% of cases, the aberrant artery crosses between the esophagus and the vertebral column. In 15% of cases, it runs between the esophagus and the trachea, and in 5% of cases, it passes anterior to both the trachea and esophagus. In both patients, we reported that the aberrant artery was between the esophagus and vertebral column. Some studies suggest this anomaly can only produce symptoms in the setting of a concomitant congenital anomaly of the carotid arteries, either a common trunk to both carotid arteries (“bicarotid truncus”) or a close origin of the carotid arteries, leading to decreased distensibility of the esophagus as it is compressed posteriorly by the aberrant vessel. However, this specific anomaly is absent in many reported cases of DL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Vascular abnormalities are more prevalent in children with Down syndrome. Up to 37% specifically have an aberrant RSA and congenital heart disease. The abnormality may be seen in up to 2% of patients with tetrology of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Other vascular anomalies that may cause dysphagia include persistent right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery, a tortuous or aneurysmal thoracic aorta (dysphagia aortica), and left atrial enlargement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This anomaly is often asymptomatic and may be discovered incidentally on imaging or postmortem analysis. The majority of patients, 60-80%, remain symptom-free in their lifetime. Symptomatic patients usually present with dysphagia (91% of cases) consistent with mechanical obstruction. Symptoms are mostly for solids and are associated with regurgitation of food, chest pain (20%), and symptoms that frequently change with position. Other complaints include coughing, thoracic pain, or Horner’s syndrome. Rarely, do patients present with rupture of an aneurysmal aberrant artery or Kommerell’s diverticulum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In infants, respiratory symptoms are most common. This is due to the absence of tracheal rigidity, allowing for its compression and leading to stridor, wheezing, cyanosis, or recurrent pneumonia. However, patients who usually do not present in childhood, develop dysphagia later in life probably due to increased esophageal rigidity, development of atherosclerosis, elongation of the aorta, and aneurysm formation \\[ 8 \\- 10 \\].\n\n【28】The nonspecific symptoms and unfamiliarity of DL to clinicians have made prompt diagnosis more challenging. Most cases are often misdiagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal malignancy, and coronary artery disease. Both patients had a LHC to rule out coronary artery disease. DL may be diagnosed by performing a barium esophagogram which may show some indentation or constriction around the esophagus. In some cases, a pulsating mass or an indented esophagus may be visualized on EGD which was not seen in both of our patients. Confirmatory radiological imaging is CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography, which helps detect the culprit vessel and its anatomy. The management of patients with DL depends on the severity of symptoms and impact to weight and nutrition. Mild to moderate symptoms are often treated symptomatically, with changes in lifestyle and dietary modification, such as avoiding exacerbating foods, eating slower, chewing well, taking smaller bites, sipping liquids, as well as reassurance. As well, acid suppression and prokinetic agents can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. For those who do not respond to medical management, a surgical approach is considered. The surgical approach largely depends on the specific vascular anatomy as well as the surgeon’s personal preference. The goal of surgery is to remove the aberrant vessel and reconstruct the vessel into an appropriate position. This involves ligation of the aberrant artery, followed by restoration of blood flow to the right arm by joining the ARSA to either the right common carotid artery, aortic arch, or ascending aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. There does not appear to be a consensus in the surgical literature as to the best surgical approach. The surgical approaches commonly used include median sternotomy, left thoracotomy, right supraclavicular, or right thoracotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The traditional approach consists of dividing the aberrant artery at its origin through a median sternotomy and translocating the distal subclavian artery to the aortic arch or right carotid artery. A cervical approach is preferred because there is a decreased rate of complications, as well as better visibility of the subclavian and carotid arteries. Through a cervical approach, the aberrant artery is ligated near its root and connected with the right carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Reported mortality rates have been as high as 16-25%, largely due to a two-step surgical repair. With newer surgical techniques, more recent reports quote mortality rates as low as 0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. More recent surgical approaches were reported by La Regina et al in which right carotid-subclavian bypass was followed by a robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the aberrant RSA. Advanced robotic technology helped to move the esophagus and aberrant artery minimizing open thoracotomy. According to same report, ligation of vessel was the most challenging step. As well, presence of aneurysm within the aberrant vessel makes this approach more challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Choosing surgical approach depends on patient comorbidities, candidacy for surgery. Our second patient had a coronary artery bypass and open thoracotomy was the optimal approach to correct aberrant artery. In poor surgical candidates, endoscopic dilation of the esophageal narrowing may temporarily relieve symptoms of dysphagia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. There are not enough cases in the literature to know the success rate of this procedure. DL can be overlooked during endoscopy but a barium esophagogram reveals the disorder most of the time. This disorder should be added to our differential diagnosis especially in patients presenting with chronic dysphagia with atypical chest pain. It is paramount that clinicians acquaint themselves more with this disorder as this would help in prompt diagnosis, treatment, and avoidance of unnecessary procedures not needed by the patient. For patients who cannot undergo surgery, endoscopic dilatation of the esophagus can be done. It is safe and can be repeated safely upon recurrence.\n\n【29】Learning points\n\n【30】The takeaway point from this case is to make clinicians aware of the congenital abnormality, DL, which should be part of differential diagnosis when working on a patient presenting with difficulty swallowing not responding to medical therapy. Even when EGD or barium swallow is negative for any abnormality, CT or MRI angiography should be the next imaging option.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge our library clerk Mr. Frederick Price for supplying us with articles to complete this manuscript.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This project was not supported by any grant or funding agency.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patients had given informed consents for the case reports to be published.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author has individually been involved and participated in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content and have given final approval of the version to be published.

Colon cancer with ossification has been reported as a slowly progressive, moderately to highly differentiated tumor that is not invasive to vessels or lymph nodes. Mucosal and necrotic tissues often coexist \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\].\n\n【14】Heterotopic bone formation has been observed within the tumor stroma associated with necrosis and within pools of mucus \\[ 3 , 5 \\- 9 \\]. However, most colon cancers with necrotic tissue are not associated with ossification, and not all colon cancers with ossification present with an associated necrotic tissue (similar to the tumor in our case). The association between tissue necrosis and bone formation is unclear; however, it is clear that the presence of necrosis is not a prerequisite for bone formation.\n\n【15】Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of heterotopic bone formation: osteoblastic metaplasia of cancer cells and pluripotent mesenchymal cells, both under the influence of factors generated by the cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Electron microscopic studies in two cases of lung cancers have reported a lack of intermediate stages between tumor cells and osteoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.

These reports suggest the osteoblastic metaplasia of normal mesenchymal cells. In our case, the ossification tissue with osteoblasts was completely surrounded by the benign fibrous tissue, suggesting that the osteoblasts were derived from the pluripotent mesenchymal cells and not the cancer cells.\n\n【16】There is no difference between colon cancer with and without ossification with respect to the course, management, and prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.

The patient was evaluated by her pulmonologist for a chronic cough of 1 year duration. Despite three courses of antibiotics, the cough continued to worsen.\n\n【4】She denied any medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, or aspiration pneumonitis. She denied any tobacco smoking or second hand smoking exposure. She consumed two drinks of alcohol on the weekend.

Esophageal cancer can present with respiratory symptoms of cough and lung infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. This mechanism is commonly due to the presence of an acquired tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), which the patient did not have.

Although clinical or symptomatic leaflet thrombosis is uncommon, it is a serious adverse event following TAVR with a grave prognosis.\n\n【2】As indications for TAVR is expected to expand in the future to include patients at intermediate and perhaps low risk for perioperative mortality following surgery, an early diagnosis of leaflet thrombosis and treatment with antithrombotic therapy would be critical to optimize clinical outcomes.\n\n【3】It was recorded that most cases appear to occur in the first year following TAVR, and the role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is being investigated in ongoing trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Accordingly, there is uncertainty on how to prevent and treat this complication in patients who present after 1 year while on DOAC.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Our patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3, coronary artery disease, pernicious anemia, and severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Pre-procedural transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an aortic valve area of 0.67 cm <sup>2 </sup> and preserved left ventricular function. A 29 mm Edwards Sapien III valve was successfully deployed without post dilatation. The post-procedural mean trans-valve gradient was 5 mm Hg, and no significant para-valvular regurgitation was observed by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient opted for off-label Xarelto for anticoagulation because he was not doing well on warfarin, with very labile international normalized ratio (INR). A long discussion about the off-label use of Xarelto in the setting of bio-prosthetic aortic valve replacement led to his decision to pursue this along with aspirin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, stroke prophylaxis. He was then discharged on Xarelto 20 mg daily and aspirin 81 mg daily. He was otherwise doing well, and without dyspnea or chest tightness. On routine outpatient follow-up, we noted a murmur that was increased in intensity and repeat TTE showed that the gradients had increased to a mean gradient of 24 mm Hg. There was thickening of the aortic valve and thrombosis was concerning and suspected. There was no fever, chills, no rash, no weight loss, weight gain, or signs of endocarditis or infection, no tooth aches etc. The patient denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He did undergo TEE which confirmed right coronary cusp thrombus measuring about 1.43 cm by 0.91 cm, which was layered, non-mobile, with normal valve function except for mild restriction leaflets .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Echocardiographic pictures of THV before treatment.

He was discharged from the hospital few days later when his INR reached goal. Repeat TEE 3 months later showed complete resolution of the thrombus and normal valve function .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Echocardiographic pictures of the same patient showing resolution of the thrombus after treatment with warfarin. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】In a recent large consecutive cohort of 405 patients having TAVR performed with the Edwards balloon-expandable trans-catheter heart valve (THV), the thrombus was diagnosed 1 - 3 months after the procedure by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) in 7% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Based on previous studies, tt has been noticed that the occurrence of THV thrombosis was associated with large THV size and in cases in which warfarin was not used as an option for antithrombotic agent \\[ 4 \\- 8 \\]. THV thrombosis is expected to occur in the early period after TAVR and has not previously been reported later than 7 months post-TAVR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>. This case showed that THV dysfunction or an increase in murmur intensity should evoke prompt investigation for possible thrombus formation.\n\n【12】The predisposing factors for TAVR thrombosis in our case were the presence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the use of Xarelto instead of warfarin and the use of mono antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【13】In a recent meta-analysis that compared aspirin versus aspirin and clopidogrel following TAVR, there was no difference in the 30-day clinical and cerebrovascular adverse event rates; however, a trend toward more bleeding in the aspirin and clopidogrel group was demonstrated, also it was recorded that monotherapy with aspirin was associated with a THV thrombosis risk of 25%, and importantly, all patients who experienced obstructive THV thrombosis received antiplatelet therapy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient did not experience any kind of cardiovascular symptoms. The thrombosis was discovered on a regular follow-up at the office with his cardiologist, which stresses the importance of regular long-term follow-up and raises the question of how frequently and for how long should those patients receive echocardiographic assessment of their valves. Based on a study that was done among 460 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with the Edwards Sapien XT or Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California), THV thrombosis occurred in 28 of 405 (7%) patients. A total of 23 patients had subclinical THV thrombosis, whereas five (18%) patients experienced clinically overt obstructive THV thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are no clear guidelines on how to treat THV thrombus or the choice of anticoagulant for prevention. We and others have observed incidence of THV thrombosis in patients who are not on warfarin, thus indicating that short-term warfarin treatment or even long-term NOAC anticoagulants treatment of THV thrombosis might not be sufficient in patients who are prone to developing THV thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】THV thrombosis may develop late after TAVR despite treatment with DOAC and aspirin, and can be reversed with warfarin. As our knowledge of the outcomes post-TAVR continues to increase, this may lead to development of guideline in the future about the use of anticoagulation, especially warfarin, and for how long following the implantation of the valve. Large scale randomized study may be needed in the future to guide the choice of anticoagulant and duration of treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest from any of the authors.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

He also referred photosensitivity and Raynaud’s phenomenon and denied dyspnea, thoracic pain, gastrointestinal or urinary complaints. He was examined in his general practitioner, who requested laboratory blood analyses that revealed severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, and was transferred to our emergency department.\n\n【7】Eight years ago, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology consult because of arthritis in metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal with morning stiffness. Immunological study showed ANA 1/160 with speckled pattern, rheumatoid factor positive (41.3 IU/mL), positive anti-RNP, SSa and SSb. He was diagnosed with undifferentiated connective-tissue disease and after 4 years, he immigrated and lost follow-up.\n\n【8】On physical examination, he was alert and oriented, with pale skin and bruising on upper and lower extremities, had temperature of 37.3 °C, blood pressure of 115/69 mm Hg, pulse of 61/min, and respiration of 16/min. Arthritis of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of right hand was noted. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examination was normal and his abdomen was soft without tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation.\n\n【9】The blood tests on admission showed anemia of 6.4 g/dL with normal MCV and high reticulocyte index, thrombocytopenia (25,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), high LDH (2,059 U/L), haptoglobin < 6 mg/dL, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia (2.6 mg/dL) with normal C-reactive protein. Coomb’s test was negative, renal functional, electrolytes and coagulation profile was within the normal limits. Peripheral blood smear revealed schistocytes. Chest X-rays were normal and abdominal ultrasound showed moderate hepatosplenomegaly. He had a blood transfusion.\n\n【10】The presence of hemolytic commitment, norerosive polyarthritis and photosensitivity associated with an immunological study showing low titers of C3 and C4, ANA 1/640 with speckled pattern and positive anti-Sm, fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for SLE.\n\n【11】Treatment with plasmapharesis sessions and prednisolone 1 mg/kg was started. After 6 days, he improved clinically with normalization of platelet count and in 2 weeks, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and LDH were within normal values.\n\n【12】The patient was discharged thereafter on tapering dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate 10 mg/week and after 2 years of follow-up, he remains in disease remission.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】With this clinical case, the authors pretend to draw attention to an infrequent association between SLE and TTP, which constitutes a difficult diagnosis and requires early effective treatment and follow-up.\n\n【15】Moschcowitz described TTP in 1925 after the autopsy of a 16-year-old patient, who died from anemia and petechiae, which revealed disseminated microvascular thrombi. In 1966, Amorosi and Ultmann, after reviewing a number of cases, formulated the classical pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, kidney failure and fever. In this series, mortality was very high and decreased dramatically from 90% to 8-25% with the institution of plasma exchange transfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Patients with TTP have a deficiency in a protease, called ADAMTS-13, which normally cleaves large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers into smaller and less adhesive forms. These unusually large vWFs promote abnormal platelet aggregation, resulting in microvascular thrombosis and thrombocytopenia affecting numerous organs, such as peripheral blood, central nervous system and kidney. Autoimmune diseases such as SLE have low levels of ADAMTS-13, suggesting a possible common pathophysiology between these two entities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Because treatment of these two diseases is different, distinguishing between the diagnoses is essential to ensure optimal clinical outcome. Therapy mainly consists of plasma exchange in TTP and corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in SLE. However, this may be especially difficult because of overlapping features of the two disorders, like hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurologic and kidney involvement. The characteristics that favor the diagnosis of TTP are the presence of fragmented red blood cells and schizocytes (indicating microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), associated with a negative Coomb’s test and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【18】TTP can present in approximately 2% of the patients with SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In most cases, it appears in patients previously diagnosed and treated for SLE for several years, with a high SLE disease activity index score and renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Being the initial manifestation of SLE, as in our patient, is extremely uncommon. Is still a doubt if patients that present with TTP should be screen with ANA.\n\n【19】Recognition of simultaneous appearance of both conditions diseases is important, since it carries a worse prognosis than SLE alone. Mortality rate has been reported to be about 30% and the cause for this may be the delay in the institution of plasma exchange therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】In brief, the implications of this case are noteworthy for several reasons. Although uncommon, TTP and SLE can present and occur simultaneously. A high level of suspicion for TTP and SLE is demanded in patients who present with hemolysis, low platelets and fever. It is essential to distinguish whether the patient has SLE, TTP or both diseases, since early diagnosis and aggressive management with plasma exchange and immunosuppression is life saving.\n\n【22】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Individuals with lipedema develop these conditions in earlier stages and lymphedema is detected by multi-segment bioimpedance in 50% of those with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【5】The aim of the present study was to report the 3-year follow-up of a male patient with lipedema and subclinical systemic lymphedema evaluated using multi-segment bioimpedance.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A 53-year-old male patient with a history of oncological surgery, prostate, involving lymph node clearance in the right inguinal region followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy subsequently developed edema of the right lower limb and sought a specialized service for the treatment of lymphedema. The physical examination revealed edema from the root of the thigh involving the entire limb. The limb had the physical appearance of lipedema, for which the patient had a family history. At the first evaluation by bioimpedance, the patient’s BMI was 29 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Circumference measurements, volumetry and multi-segment bioimpedance were performed for diagnosis and evaluation treatment. The diagnosis of lipedema is primarily clinical based on history and physical examination. Multi-segment bioimpedance is essential to diagnose systemic edema that suggests changes in the lymphatic system. It is fundamental in the evolution of these patients and was performed during his follow-up period.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】The treatment for lymphedema first time in the Clinica Godoy, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil was during 5 days (8 h per day), involving associated therapy, Godoy method <sup>® </sup> : cervical lymphatic therapy, mechanical lymphatic therapy (RAGodoy <sup>® </sup> ) and grosgrain stocking.

During the 3-year follow-up of the case, only a reduction to 4,100 g in the right leg was maintained. Multi-segment bioimpedance showed the progression from subclinical systemic lymphedema to clinical systemic lymphedema throughout the 3-year follow-up, as displayed in Tables 1 , 2 and 3 . At the first evaluation, abnormally high intracellular and extracellular water, total body water as well as water in both lower limbs and one upper limb were found. Lymphedema detected by bioimpedance was found in the right leg. At the second evaluation, the patient had progressed to subclinical systemic lymphedema, with more water in all extremities and the trunk and bilateral lower limb lymphedema detected by bioimpedance. Three years after the original evaluation, multi-segment bioimpedance revealed clinical systemic lymphedema, with the increase in water in all extremities. The patient was instructed to lose weight and maintain treatment for lymphedema.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1.

The increase in intracellular and extracellular water as well as water in the extremities initially called attention to this condition, but there was no knowledge regarding the evolution of such cases. At the second evaluation 1 year later, the patient presented subclinical systemic lymphedema, which progressed to clinical systemic lymphedema at the 3-year evaluation, as determined by multi-segment bioimpedance.\n\n【20】We have been following patients with lipedema and lymphedema for approximately 8 years, after having included multi-segment bioimpedance in the evaluation of patients, but this is the first case of lipedema progressing to systemic lymphedema in a male patient. Obesity is the main aggravating factor of edema in these patients and the prevalence of subclinical systemic lymphedema increases with the increase in BMI.\n\n【21】With regard to the physiopathology of lipedema, the main changes in which we can interfere involve the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Using multi-segment bioimpedance, we have found that obesity is a major aggravating factor, as a higher BMI translates to greater lymphatic harm. Therefore, the main form of treatment for such patients is to address obesity through weight reduction, which is the only way we currently know to reverse this lymphedema and achieve standards of normality or near normality. Patients with lymphedema and obesity who lose weight experience an important reduction in the edema and, without an additional harm to the lymphatic system, can achieve normality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, but the increase in weight is an aggravating factor in both sexes. This condition initially affects the lower limbs, progressing to subclinical systemic lymphedema, followed by clinical systemic lymphedema determined using multi-segment bioimpedance, demonstrating that edema in patients with lipedema may be systemic.\n\n【23】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. In men, these alterations were not identified. However, it is essential to identify in each patient with lipedema all aggravating factors of the edema and treat each of the pathophysiological aspects involved. However, weight gain is the most serious of all and these are factors that can interfere. Other alterations are described in lipedema of genetic causes, but we cannot interfere. At the moment, weight loss and lymphatic therapy to reduce edema are the main therapeutic bases.\n\n【24】In around 10% of women, the physical aspect of lipedema is detected, but rare in literature in men; as long as they remain thin, the appearance of edema and symptoms is less frequent, a fact that characterizes the lipedema syndrome. Therefore, the patient in the present study has lymphedema and lipedema syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, affects the lower limbs, and can progress to subclinical systemic lymphedema.\n\n【27】Weight gain is one of the most aggravating factors of lipedema.\n\n【28】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis, but in men, these alterations were not identified.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no financial support or funding for study.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict Interest</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient’s informed consent for publication of this report was obtained.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>JMP Godoy: design, analysis and interpretation of data, data collection, article writing, critical review of the text, statistical analysis, and overall responsibility for the study.

Among these chemotherapies, she responded to S-1 for 6 months and to pemetrexed for 18 months. The patient requested crizotinib treatment, and we therefore assessed the presence of the EML4-ALK fusion gene using the same FFPE tissue block. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ALK rearrangements and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ALK expression were both negative, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing identified variant 1 of the EML4-ALK fusion gene .

Indeed, the current patient experienced longer progression-free survival times with chemotherapies such as S-1 and pemetrexed, compared with crizotinib.

For the majority of the 20th century, the physiological signs and behavioral responses that neonates showed in response to pain were at times dismissed thereby resulting in the undertreatment of pain associated with surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Neglected pain management in neonates resulted in short- and long-term physiological, behavioral, and cognitive complications that included impaired brain growth, attention-deficit disorder, poor executive function, poor socialization skills, and poor short-term memory tasks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. This misunderstanding of neonatal pain was refuted by clinical trials that showed a reduction in stress hormone levels and metabolic responses to pain when neonates were given adequate anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Effective pain management in neonates remains a priority in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the operating room (OR) settings as it has been shown to have the potential to improve various clinical outcomes in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, remain the mainstay treatment for severe pain; however, their use may be associated with adverse effects including respiratory depression and delayed gastrointestinal motility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Epidural anesthesia has shown to be safe and effective in pediatrics, even in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Despite its promising efficacy in controlling postoperative pain, adverse effects may occur related to catheter placement or its subsequent use.\n\n【3】We present a 4-week-old, formerly preterm, 2.2-kg neonate who developed apnea after a bolus dose of the local anesthetic agent, 2-chloroprocaine, and was administered into a thoracic epidural catheter. Further investigation revealed the tip of the epidural catheter at a higher level than intended which resulted in a transient high motor blockade and apnea. Adverse effects of epidural anesthesia in neonates are discussed and options for identifying the correct placement of a thoracic epidural catheter are reviewed.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】Review of this case and presentation in this format followed the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). The patient was a 4-week-old, 2.2-kg male neonate presented to the OR for ileostomy takedown. His past medical history was significant for preterm birth at 33 weeks gestation, meconium ileus resulting in small bowel obstruction requiring an ileostomy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring supplemental of 0.1 L/min oxygen. The patient was transported to the OR, and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Baseline vital signs revealed a heart rate (HR) of 135 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 86/40 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on 0.1 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. Following pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with propofol (3 mg) and fentanyl (2 µg/kg). Neuromuscular blockade was provided by rocuronium (1 mg/kg). A 3.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed. Following anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained on sevoflurane and the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position.\n\n【7】The caudal epidural space was accessed through the sacral hiatus with an 18-gauge, 5-cm Epican™ Crawford needle. A 20-gauge styletted epidural catheter was threaded to the T10 level with ultrasound guidance. After negative aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid, a test dose (0.2 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine) was administered into the epidural catheter. No hemodynamic changes were observed, and an epidural infusion of 1.5% 2-chloroprocaine and clonidine (0.1 µg/mL) was started at 2 mL/h per standard clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. An additional 1 µg of fentanyl was administered intraoperatively and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration 0.2-1.2%). There were no changes in the hemodynamic parameters during surgical stimulation. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 120 min. There were no intraoperative concerns. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated in the OR and he was taken to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).\n\n【8】While in the PACU, the epidural infusion rate was decreased to 1 mL/h as the patient’s blood pressure was slightly decreased. The patient was admitted to the NICU postoperatively. Postoperative analgesia was assessed using the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scoring system and neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale (NPASS) scoring system. From postoperative day (POD) 0 - 1, pain was managed with an epidural infusion of 1.5% 2-chloroprocaine with clonidine (0.1 µg/mL) at 1 mL/h and intravenous acetaminophen (10 mg/kg) every 6 h. Two supplemental doses of fentanyl (1 and 2 µg) were administered during the first 24 postoperative hours. On POD 2, the epidural dressing appeared to be leaking which required the catheter site to be cleaned and redressed. In addition, the patient was reported to be more irritable and required additional fentanyl (3 µg total). A 1-mL bolus of the 1.5% 2-chloroprocaine and clonidine (0.1 µg/mL) was administered through the epidural and the epidural infusion was increased to 2 mL/h. Minutes later, the patient developed apnea, a decrease in the HR, and a decrease in the oxygen saturation.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】After the administration of a bolus dose of 2-chloroprocaine into the epidural catheter and the onset of apnea, a high motor block was suspected and confirmed by a radiograph  which revealed the tip of the epidural catheter to be at T4.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest radiograph demonstrating the tip of the epidural catheter at the T4 level (red arrow). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】During this time, the patient’s eyes were open, he was looking around, and was appearing to attempt to cry, but no sound was audible. Although there were respiratory efforts, no chest, diaphragmatic or extremity movements were noted. Positive pressure ventilation was administered by bag-valve-mask and the epidural infusion was discontinued. The HR and oxygen saturation immediately returned to baseline values. Within 5 min of stopping the epidural infusion, the patient became more active, spontaneous ventilation resumed, and a strong cry was noted. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen, the epidural catheter was removed and postoperative analgesia provided by intravenous fentanyl delivered by nurse-controlled analgesia infusion.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】The remainder of the postoperative course was without adverse or unanticipated events. The patient’s pain was routinely assessed with FLACC and NPASS scoring systems, and was adequately controlled with intravenous fentanyl. A change in clinical practice was instituted to routinely obtain and review a postoperative radiograph to identify the site of catheter placement when an epidural catheter is threaded from the caudal to thoracic space in neonates in the postoperative period.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】Intravenous opioids have been the mainstay therapy for providing reliable postoperative analgesia in the pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, due to the immaturity of the central control of ventilation and reduced opioid clearance, infants and neonates are vulnerable to opioid-induced respiratory depression and its sequelae. Regional anesthesia, including epidural analgesia, has been shown to be a safe and effective option for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in neonates and infants. Earlier tracheal extubation, reduced intraoperative opioid use, blunting of hormonal-metabolic stress response, earlier return of bowel function, decreased respiratory complications and shorter hospital stays are benefits to patients receiving epidural analgesia compared to systemic opioids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Despite its promising efficacy in controlling postoperative pain, adverse effects may occur related to catheter placement or an infusion of medications through an epidural catheter. Previous work has demonstrated the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) when higher infusion rates are administered through lumbar catheters to achieve thoracic analgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In order to provide effective analgesia and limit local anesthetic agent infusion rates, effective epidural anesthesia requires placement of the tip of the catheter near the dermatomes affected by the surgical procedure. This requires placement of the catheter at the thoracic dermatomes for thoracic and upper abdominal procedures.\n\n【19】Two common approaches to achieve this desired placement are threading the catheter from the caudal approach and direct placement into the thoracic epidural space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The caudal approach was first described in 1933 by Meredith Campbell, using a single injection into the caudal space (“the caudal block”) to provide postoperative analgesia in children undergoing urologic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Since its introduction, the safety and efficacy of caudal blockade has been well described and has expanded to include continuous epidural infusions. The feasibility of placing a thoracic epidural catheter from the caudal space was first introduced in 1988 by Bosenburg et al in a three-phase study including 14 human cadavers, 12 living piglets, and 20 neonates and infants, ranging in age from 4 weeks to 5 months and in weight ranged from 2.7 to 6.5 kg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This technique was first investigated in human cadavers, followed by a demonstration of its efficacy in an animal model. Proof of concept was then demonstrated in a cohort of 20 neonates and infants, 19 of whom were able to have the catheter placed within one vertebral level of the desired position as confirmed by radiographic imaging. These results were reinforced by two subsequent investigators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. One potential limitation to these studies was that the target level for the epidural catheter was in the lower thoracic segments (T10-12) with limited data on placement at higher thoracic dermatomes.\n\n【20】When the decision is made to thread the catheter to the higher thoracic levels from the caudal space, ensuring appropriate placement is paramount to achieving successful analgesia and avoiding adverse effects. In the three previously mentioned studies, the distance to thread the catheter into the epidural space was determined by measuring externally from the skin puncture site in the caudal area to the desired vertebral level. Despite measuring the distance of the catheter to be inserted, placement at the desired dermatome is not uniformly successful. It has been demonstrated that 32% or 28 of 86 caudally threaded thoracic epidural catheters were not at the desired level when subsequently evaluated using a standard radiograph 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Ten of the 28 inadequately placed epidural catheters were in the high thoracic or cervical region which could have led to an adverse effect similar to that noted in our patient, had radiographic confirmation not been obtained. During threading the catheter from the caudal approach, various issues may be encountered including catheter kinking, doubling back on itself, or meeting resistance. Although traditionally reserved for the adult population, these issues can be avoided by direct catheter placement at the thoracic level. Despite concerns expressed regarding the potential for complications with this practice, no difference in the incidence or severity of adverse effects has been noted when comparing direct thoracic epidural catheter placement with the technique of threading the catheter from the caudal space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Various techniques are available to identify catheter location in the epidural space based on the type of catheter used and whether or not it is radio-opaque. Some catheters are reinforced with an internal wire coil, such as the type used in our patient, and are easily seen on a routine chest radiograph. Catheters that are not radio-opaque require the injection of contrast or a radio-opaque dye to identify their position on standard radiographs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. These techniques do not allow real time advancement of the catheter and would mandate catheter manipulation and repeating the radiograph if the appropriate location has not been achieved. Given that the preliminary clinical work has demonstrated that external measurement and blind placement is not always uniformly successful, other techniques are needed to ensure success. Fluoroscopy can be used in real time to confirm placement, rule out incorrect anatomic space, and predict analgesic coverage. However, such techniques are associated with ionizing radiation and the need for added equipment in the OR, additional cost, and additional time.\n\n【22】Other options suggested that may be effective in ensuring accurate placement of the tip of the epidural catheter include nerve stimulation and ultrasound-guided techniques. Electrical stimulation to document epidural catheter placement or guide its advancement was first described by Tsui et al in the adult population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Catheter placement was considered to be in the correct position based on the presence or absence of truncal or limb movement to 1 - 10 mA of electrical stimulation. This work was later expanded to include the pediatric population and guide advancement of the catheter from the caudal to the thoracic epidural space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Ultrasound has also been used as a modality to identify the location of the epidural catheter in various small studies and case reports \\[ 18 \\- 23 \\]. In the largest study to date which included 25 patients (2 days to 5 months of age), the authors were able to detect the epidural catheter tip via ultrasound in 22 of the 25 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Success in localization of the epidural catheter via ultrasound has been reported to be easier in patients less than 6 months of age because neuraxial structures are more superficial and the vertebrae are less ossified. Techniques that may increase the ability to identify the catheter in the epidural space include displacement of the dura mater by the injection of saline or the use of a hyperechoic stylet within the catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>. Despite the growing popularity and reported accuracy of ultrasound guidance, limitations associated with this method include the need for a skilled provider, poor visualization of the catheter tip in the epidural space especially if the patient is older than 6 months of age, and inability to see local anesthetic spread. As a result, there have been reported cases of misplacement even with this technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Epidural catheters can be left in place for days after a given procedure in order to provide adequate analgesia. Despite the various methods used to secure the epidural catheter in place, Simpao and colleagues demonstrated that caudally threaded epidural catheters can migrate one or more vertebral levels after placement during the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. In a study of 85 patients, catheter migration of ≥ 1 vertebral level was noted in 54 patients (64%) and 23 patients (27%) had a catheter at the T4 level or higher. Catheter migration of two or more vertebral levels occurred more commonly in infants who weighed less than 6 kg. Thus, continuous epidural catheter monitoring via postoperative imaging may be essential for safety and efficacy.\n\n【25】Although generally safe and effective, various adverse effects have been reported with epidural anesthesia in infants and children including those related to initial needle or catheter placement and those related to its subsequent use. Adverse effects related to placement including the potential for bleeding or direct neurologic damage are rare. There were no reports of hematoma formation or permanent neurologic injures in a 2018 review of neuraxial anesthesia from the Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network (PRAN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. More commonly, adverse effects are related to the medications used to provide epidural anesthesia including the local anesthetic agent or adjuncts such as opioids or α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonists. Given the potential for LAST, strict attention to dosing guidelines is mandatory during epidural anesthesia, especially in neonates and infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】We report an uncommon adverse effect of thoracic epidural anesthesia, apnea from high blockade following bolus dosing of epidural catheter with the local anesthetic agent, 2-chloroprocaine. Within minutes following the bolus dose, our patient developed apnea, a decrease in the heart rate, and a decrease in the oxygen saturation. During this time while respirations were absent (no diaphragmatic or thoracic movement), the patient’s eyes were open, he was looking around, and attempting to cry, but no sound was audible. After assisted ventilation was provided by bag-valve-mask ventilation, a radiograph was obtained which revealed the tip of the epidural catheter to be at T4. Although high blockade is generally more common with spinal anesthesia, it can occur with epidural related to large doses or as was noted in our patient, high catheter placement (T4 versus the desired location of T8-10).\n\n【27】Our experience with this patient demonstrates another potential advantage of using the short-acting local anesthetic agent, 2-chloroprocaine, given its short half-life and duration of action, compared to other commonly used agents such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine. Especially in neonates, given the variable pharmacokinetics of the amide local anesthetic agents related to immaturity of the hepatic microsomal enzymes and decreased local anesthetic binding capacity, 2-chloroprocaine is being used more commonly to limit the incidence of LAST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>. Although originally described to provide dense surgical anesthesia during herniorrhaphy using regional instead of general anesthesia, 2-chloroprocaine is now being used more commonly for continuous postoperative epidural infusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 29 , 30 \\]</u>. Its potential advantages over local anesthetic agents of the amide group are illustrated by a recent case report where LAST occurred following inadvertent systemic injection following injection of a thoracic epidural catheter (T7 level) in a 4-kg, 2-month-old infant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Immediately after the injection of 4 mL of 3% 2-chloroprocaine, the patient developed a wide complex bradycardia without evidence of atrial activity. While preparations were being made to initiate resuscitation, the event terminated spontaneously. The duration of the event was approximately 30 s. A similar event was described following bolus dosing of a paravertebral catheter with 2-chloroprocaine in a 9-month-old infant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. This event and the one described in our patient demonstrate the potential advantage of a short-acting agent such as 2-chloroprocaine should adverse effects occur. In our patient, the high motor blockade and respiratory compromise (apnea) resolved in 5 min and required only support by bag-valve-mask ventilation instead of endotracheal intubation.\n\n【28】Learning points\n\n【29】Neuraxial anesthesia remains an important method of providing postoperative analgesia with specific advantages over systemic opioids and an excellent adverse effect profile even in neonates and infants. Although infrequent, adverse effects related to placement or subsequent use of the catheter may occur. We present the rare occurrence of high motor blockade following the administration of a bolus dose of the local anesthetic agent, 2-chloroprocaine, into a thoracic epidural catheter in a 4-week-old neonate. Subsequent radiologic investigation demonstrated that the tip of the epidural catheter was higher than anticipated. Although ultrasound is being used more commonly as the epidural catheter is being advanced from the caudal to the thoracic level, our anecdotal experience suggests that postoperative radiographic evaluation should also be considered. Our experience further reinforces the safety profile of 2-chloroprocaine and its potential advantages over the long acting local anesthetics of the amide class. Givens its rapid metabolism, the high motor blockade dissipated rapidly without the need for interventions beyond brief respiratory assistance with bag-valve-mask ventilation.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from a parent for anesthetic care and use of patient data for publication purposes.

The incidence, prognosis, and treatment are not well defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】We present a case of a patient with Ph-neg B-cell ALL in whom allo-HSCT was performed successfully about a year prior to presenting with sudden flank pain, edema of the extremities, and foamy urine. In this case presentation, we discuss the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment options of a patient with B-cell ALL isolated renal parenchyma relapse after allo-HSCT.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 43-year-old man was referred to our center with a history of bruising, asthenia, and weight loss > 10 kg over 6 months. At diagnosis, laboratory features were as follows: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, white blood cells 14 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, and platelets 15 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. Bone marrow aspirate was ordered and showed 90% lymphoblasts. The immunophenotypic pattern of expression was compatible with B-common ALL (CD19 <sup>+ </sup> CD34 <sup>+ </sup> CD10 <sup>+ </sup> TDT <sup>+ </sup> CD20 <sup>- </sup> ). Cytogenetic studies revealed a complex karyotype with 42 XY, -14, -16, del通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u> -19, -22. The final diagnosis of high-risk Ph-neg B-cell ALL was concluded, and treatment with a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich (BFM)-like protocol was administered. After a month of treatment, he achieved CR and was administered two more consolidation cycles following the same protocol. He was sent for early stem cell transplantation consultation. Allo-HSCT was performed with a familiar haploidentical donor, his 11-year-old daughter, using a myeloablative conditioning regimen (including busulfan, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide) with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis based on post-transplant cyclophosphamide on days +3 and +4, mycophenolate from days +5 to +35 and cyclosporine tapering beyond 6 months after transplantation. The dose of CD34 cells was 8 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> per kg in the recipient. Myeloid and platelet engraftment was observed on day +14. On day +60, the patient was diagnosed with cutaneous acute GVHD grade I-II and treated successfully with topical steroids.\n\n【6】On day +310 after HSCT, the patient started with mild flank pain responsive to low dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), palpebral and bilateral lower extremity edema, accompanied by intermittent foamy urine, and he did not refer hematuria or any other symptoms. Physical examination was normal except for swelling in both lower limbs. He was admitted to hospital for the diagnosis procedures and diuretic treatment.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Laboratory features included hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, total leucocyte count of 4.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, platelet count of 323 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 211 U/L reported in normal ranges, a creatinine of 3.51 mg/dL, urea concentration of 141 mg/dL, and a 24-h urine protein collection of 1 g. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed nephromegaly . Percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed without complications. The pathology department reported seven glomeruli, with kidney parenchyma substituted with infiltrative monotonous cells with middle size suspecting relapsed leukemia; immunohistochemical staining was negative for IgA, IgM, IgG, C1q, C3c, C4c, albumin and light chains (kappa, lambda), but diffuse TdT positivity in the malignant cells  was reported, concluding renal infiltration by ALL. Extension studies with bone marrow aspirate, minimal residual disease, and lumbar puncture were reported negative for infiltration of ALL. The diagnosis of renal iEMR relapse was concluded.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Immunohistochemical staining reporting TdT positivity in the kidney biopsy. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】During hospitalization, high-dose diuretic treatment was started without success. The patient had worsening renal function, so he was treated with sequential hemodialysis, with clinical improvement but was dependent on renal replacement therapy. He was discharged with acceptable urea levels awaiting the result of the kidney biopsy.\n\n【13】When discussing with the patient the treatment options for renal relapse, the patient did not accept high-dose chemotherapy, immunotherapy and second HSCT, and he preferred palliative treatment, therefore he began low-dose chemotherapy. He was treated with 1 mg per kg prednisone for 28 days, twice a week oral methotrexate, and daily mercaptopurine; edema decreased considerably but there was not any improvement in kidney function. One week after the iEMR diagnosis, the patient began with mild respiratory symptoms, cough, sneezing, pharyngodynia, and normal pulse oximetry; he was tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting positive. Due to the above, he was classified as mild COVID-19 and received symptomatic treatment at home, continuing with established chemotherapy.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】Six weeks after the iEMR, and while the patient was receiving oral chemotherapy, he presented with sudden pallor, dyspnea, and generalized purpura at the emergency department. Laboratory showed severe anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and peripheral blood smear did not report immature cells. Bone marrow smear and biopsy demonstrated 60% of lymphoblasts. After the B-cell ALL medullary relapse was diagnosed. He died 8 weeks later from pulmonary hemorrhage due to severe thrombocytopenia. The critical events in the evolution of this patient from the diagnosis of ALL until his death are described in the timeline , achieving an overall survival of 18 months.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Timeline From ALL Diagnosis to Patient Death |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Extramedullary involvement in patients with ALL is not an uncommon finding in those newly diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The molecular mechanisms behind extramedullary relapse are still poorly understood. Leukemic cells spread to different organs via the systemic circulation, potentially infiltrating any site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. According to a study by Ge et al, it seems that patients with ALL have a higher incidence of EMR than those with AML after allo-SCT (12.9% versus 4.6%, respectively). In this study, the most common site of iEMR was the central nervous system in ALL. There were no cases of renal iEMR. The risk factors identified for EMR in patients with previous allo-HSCT included: extramedullary leukemia before HSCT (risk ratio (RR): 3.01, P = 0.38), hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis (RR: 3.382, P = 0.004), and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) as graft source (RR: 5.4, P = 0.002). Conditioning regimen and presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) were not identified as risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Of these risk factors, our patient presented PBSC as a graft source.\n\n【19】Renal involvement during diagnosis or treatment of ALL is joint. Different mechanisms may explain it. These include postrenal, prerenal, or intrarenal causes of acute kidney injury or acute tubular necrosis. It seems that acute kidney injury in leukemias is common. Nonetheless, only 1% are due to infiltration from acute leukemia cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. De et al reported a case of a 16-year-old male who presented with renal relapse after 36 months of completing therapy. He initially developed painless hematuria. Imagining studies revealed an exophytic mass on the left kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Rose et al reported a case of a 37-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with ALL and treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy followed by allo-HSCT. He was admitted to the hospital because of hematuria and left flank pain. The CT scan noted a mass in the kidney. Both renal biopsy and bone marrow aspirate showed infiltration by leukemic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient was also a fourth-decade-old Hispanic man who had received allo-HSCT 10 months prior. It seems the reason for admission is virtually the same in all three cases. Our patient presented with proteinuria, edema, and nephromegaly, suggesting renal involvement.\n\n【20】Treatment for patients with isolated renal infiltration post-allo-SCT is still not well standardized. It is universally agreed that they must be treated as any iEMR. In a study by Shem-Tov et al, 41.3% of patients who had an iEMR after allo-HSCT and received dose-intensive chemotherapy achieved CR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Yoon et al presented two cases of ALL with iEMR after allo-HSCT treated with blinatumomab as a bridge before receiving a second allo-HSCT. Both responded favorably to blinatumomab, with one of the cases receiving it twice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. It seems that blinatumomab might be the future in treating iEMR before a second allo-HSCT, but more studies are needed.\n\n【21】This case shows the clinical picture, the imaging studies, and the diagnosis of an ALL after an isolated relapse to the kidney. The treatment of these patients must be established immediately since the evolution to progression is fast. The choice of treatment in an eligible patient who wants intense chemotherapy could include blinatumomab as bridging therapy in an attempt to achieve a second allo-HSCT.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】ALL isolated renal relapse is an infrequent presentation, and the data are scarce. The clinical features include flank pain, hematuria, and edema; the mandatory workup includes a kidney CT scan and biopsy with immunohistochemical analysis. Because treatment is not well-standardized, renal iEMR in B-cell ALL is a complication with a lousy prognosis and usually is the herald of a bone marrow relapse. More studies are needed to standardize the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge nephrology and pathology departments of our hospital for their collaboration, and all the residents of hematology of our center who were involved in the treatment of this patient.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was waved because the manuscript was made according to the current standard, and the patient identification was kept secret for protection purposes.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Jimenez-Ochoa and Lozano-Jaramillo conceived of the presented idea.

Specifically there was no evidence of anaemia, raised calcium or renal impairment.\n\n【5】MRI head with gadolinium  showed a large posterior fossa skull base mass almost encircling the foramen magnum with distortion of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Subsequent biopsy of the mass revealed sheets of discohesive, monomorphic plasma cells, immunopositive to CD138 with characteristic clock-face nuclei . Serum electrophoresis, immunofixation and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Urine immunofixation showed kappa monoclonal free light chains (Bence-Jones Protein). CT scanning of the patient’s chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no further abnormalities. A bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of myeloma. A diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma of bone was made.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Investigations that should be performed on all patients with a biopsy proven plasma cell tumour include FBC, U and E, calcium, full myeloma screen (serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, serum immunoglobulin levels, serum free light chain assay and full skeletal survey), MRI pelvis/spine and a bone marrow biopsy. There must be no other lytic skeletal lesions and no bone marrow involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A small monoclonal protein can be present in up to 75% of cases and this does not exclude the diagnosis of SPB but can carry prognostic relevance if persistent after treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Any anaemia, renal failure or hypercalcaemia that is present must have a cause not related to a possible plasma cell disorder.\n\n【10】If the bone marrow of patients suspected of having SPB contains > 10% clonal plasma cells then they should be diagnosed as having myeloma. If there are clonal plasma cells present but < 10% then they should be diagnosed as having SPB plus monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, assuming no other myeloma organ or tissue effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】SPB is distinguished from extramedullary plasmacytoma mostly by means of location. SPB tends to affect the axial skeleton (areas of high haematopoietic activity) whereas extramedullary plasmacytoma has a tendency to form in the soft tissue of the head and neck, especially the upper respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Extramedullary plasmacytomas have less of a tendency to progress to myeloma and less than 25% of patients demonstrate a serum or urine paraprotein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】When biopsied, classically plasma cell tumours show discohesive and monomorphic cells with cytoplasmic clearing or “hoff”, and characteristic clock-face nuclei, with dispersed peripheral aggregates of chromatin. Malignant cells have enlarged nucleoli. CD138 (syndecan 1) is considered a reliable marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Radical radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for solitary plasmacytomas. Surgery is generally not indicated however decompressive laminectomy and spinal fusion can be considered in patients at risk of spinal instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are monoclonal in origin. CLL is the most common lymphoproliferative disorder and the most common leukemia in the western world and occurs mainly in older age population. It usually progresses slowly over an extended period of time and is monitored by following the lymphocytosis, peripheral adenopathy and splenomegaly that ensue. Treatment is rendered to those patients who become symptomatic or when they become anemic or thrombocytopenic.\n\n【2】Acute tumor lysis syndrome is the term applied to a group of metabolic complications that usually occur after the treatment of neoplastic disorders. The findings that may be seen include hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia (due to precipitation of calcium phosphate), hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Tumor lysis syndrome after fludarabine therapy is extremely uncommon, but may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 79 year-old Caucasian male with past medical history significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), presented with change in mental status and confusion.\n\n【6】The patient was diagnosed with CLL in 2004, but did not require treatment at that time. He was free of symptoms until a year later when he became fatigued and short of breath and was found to have increased white cell count of 23,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Chemotherapy was initiated at that point, and the patient received 6 cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone between February 2005 and February 2006.\n\n【7】The patient responded well to treatment with no complications and was being observed thereafter with no intervention until he became dyspneic again in September 2006 and was found to have large right malignant pleural effusion consistent with CLL. At that point the decision was made to start treatment with rituxan and fludarabine.\n\n【8】The patient received 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (750 mg) of rituxan and 25 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (50 mg) of fludarabine as a first dose, and on the next day he received a second dose of fludarabine. Later that day he became very weak, lethargic and difficult to arouse so he was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.\n\n【9】The patient was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.9 mg/dl. His uric acid was as high as 21.8 mg/dl, and his potassium was 7.1 mmol/l, phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dl, calcium of 8 mg/dl, WBC of 180,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> with lymphocytes of 85%, and platelets of 83,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of tumor lysis syndrome. Chest x-ray showed large right pleural effusion, and CT of the head was negative.\n\n【10】During his hospital course the patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU secondary to respiratory failure and progressive confusion. He was started on aggressive IV hydration, and Elitek (Rasburicase) 3 mg as a single dose. Chest tube was also placed to drain the large pleural effusion. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was initiated by nephrology service to enhance recovery process.\n\n【11】The patient's condition improved remarkably in the following days and upon his full recovery he was transferred to pulmonary rehabilitation facility.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】The tumors most frequently associated with the tumor lysis syndrome are the high grade, very aggressive lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, and the leukemias, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and less often acute myeloid leukemia \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\].\n\n【14】Since the original description of predominantly acute uric acid nephropathy following the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, the presentation of this syndrome has changed in two ways: 1) The introduction of allopurinol, and to a lesser extent uricase, before the onset of antitumor therapy has reduced, but not eliminated, the incidence of acute uric acid nephropathy. Acute renal failure following therapy is now more frequently associated with severe hyperphosphatemia. 2) Spontaneous acute renal failure prior to therapy is now more commonly recognized and is usually due to acute uric acid nephropathy. These patients have increased uric acid production and hyperuricosuria due to the high rate of tumor cell turnover.\n\n【15】The tumor lysis syndrome should be suspected in patients with a large tumor burden who develop acute renal failure in the presence of marked hyperuricemia (greater than 15 mg/dL or 893 µmol/L) and/or hyperphosphatemia (greater than 8 mg/dL or 2.56 mmol/L). These levels are in contrast to most other forms of acute renal failure in which the plasma uric acid concentration is less than 12 mg/dL (714 mol/L) and the plasma phosphate level is less than 6 mg/dL (1.92 mmol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】While only 6 cases of TLS associated with fludarabine therapy have been reported since 1989 (up to 2011) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>, cautious monitoring of patients treated with fludarabine should be undertaken, even after completion of the chemotherapy course. The same applies to the patients who are about to be treated with rituxan (especially after the first dose), since there have been two cases reported of Rituxan-induced TLS in CLL patients in the literature.\n\n【17】Patients about to receive chemotherapy or radiation for a malignancy with rapid cell turnover should be pretreated, if possible, for at least two days with allopurinol plus fluid loading (with saline and possibly mannitol) to maintain a high urine output (greater than 2.5 L/day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Reversible forms of renal insufficiency (e.g. volume contraction, hypercalcemia, urinary tract obstruction) should be corrected prior to therapy.\n\n【18】For those unable to receive oral medications, intravenous allopurinol was approved in 1996 by the FDA under orphan drug status, and has been commercially available for this indication since 1999 (Aloprim, Nabi, Boca Raton, FL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. A review of its use in over 1100 patients found that this preparation was both safe and effective.\n\n【19】TLS after fludarabine therapy is extremely uncommon, but may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

However, uncommon causes such as spondylodiscitis can potentially cause significant complications, thereby early diagnosis is imperative. Despite being rare, the incidence of spondylodiscitis is increasing due to effective diagnostic techniques and increased intravenous drug usage, spinal surgery, and ageing population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present an unusual presentation of back pain in an elderly gentleman with Streptococcus intermedius spondylodiscitis.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 73-year-old man with known Parkinson’s disease (PD) presented with a sudden onset of central chest pain preceded by a 3-week history of upper abdominal discomfort. Following investigations, biliary colic and acute coronary syndrome were excluded. His PD, diagnosed 17 years ago, was managed with selegiline, stalevo, and a self-administered subcutaneous apomorphine pump. Upon admission, he remained febrile and his inflammatory markers were elevated. A chest radiograph demonstrated left basal consolidation and intravenous co-amoxiclav was initially commenced but subsequently switched to intravenous tazocin when blood parameters failed to improve.\n\n【4】During inpatient stay, he continued having intermittent episodes of pyrexia. A previously described back pain, initially attributed to muscular spasm secondary to dyskinesia, had now become severe and constant with lumbar spine tenderness without neurological deficit. Plain films of the spine demonstrated lower thoracic and lumbar scoliosis. An ultrasound followed by a contrast CT abdomen and pelvis, initially undertaken to investigate an episode of coffee ground vomit, demonstrated severe spinal degenerative changes with mild spondylolisthesis at L4-L5.\n\n【5】Blood cultures obtained during admission had isolated Streptococcus intermedius . Following microbiological advice, infective endocarditis and brain abscess were excluded following transthoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiograms and a CT brain scan. Furthermore, a minimal-preparation CT abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude liver abscess, which incidentally identified an acute destructive process at T11-T12, highly suggestive of discitis. Subsequent MRI scan demonstrated vertebral body destruction, an epidural collection at T11-T12 and grade 1 spondylolisthesis, in keeping with intervertebral spondylodiscitis .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient was treated with intravenous meropenem and gentamicin for 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotics for a further 3 months. A thoracolumbar brace was recommended for stabilization of the spine, but was intolerable due to frequent dyskinesia. Within a few weeks, he improved clinically, his inflammatory markers had normalized, and he continued his rehabilitation at a community hospital achieving preadmission functional state.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Back pain in older people is rarely associated with spondylodiscitis, with the incidence increasing due to spinal surgery, an ageing population, and increased numbers of intravenous drug users and immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.

Our patient was male and between 50 and 70 years of age sharing common demographics described in literature.\n\n【10】Due to the high frequency of back pain, insidious onset, and rarity of the disease, early diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is challenging and often completely missed.\n\n【11】Patients present with non-specific symptoms such as back or neck pain, occasional red flag features, and radicular pain radiating to the chest and abdomen, often leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Initially our patient presented with radicular pain and his lower back pain was initially attributed to dyskinesia. Pyrexia is least commonly elicited by patients with spondylodiscitis, with only half of patients eliciting fever in two studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. However, our patient remained febrile despite being on intravenous tazocin for his chest infection, possibly attributed to his spondylodiscitis.\n\n【12】In pyogenic spondylodiscitis, pathogens commonly enter hematogenously and frequently target the lumbar (58%) and thoracic spine (30%). In our case, spondylodiscitis had targeted the T11-T12 thoracic region. Spondylodiscitis is predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In a study of 1,368 spondylodiscitis patients, the causative agent was identified in 85% of cases, with 48% attributed to Staphylococcus and only 10% to Streptococcus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Gouliouris and co-workers reported a 5-20% prevalence of streptococci species (viridans type and β-hemolytic streptococci) in pyogenic spondylodiscitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These studies demonstrate that streptococcus, the causative organism in our patient, is an uncommon cause of spondylodiscitis.\n\n【13】Common sources of infection for spondylodiscitis include the genitourinary tract (17%), infective endocarditis (12%), and skin and soft tissue (11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.

The patient initially presented with radicular pain followed by low back pain and blood cultures isolated Streptococcus intermedius , an unlikely causative agent in pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Furthermore, we propose the likely source of infection to be the subcutaneous apomorphine pump, augmented by difficult handling due to dyskinesia and infrequent replacement of needles during self-administration.

Different conditions have been associated with IM, and although over 80% of all cases can be attributed to acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, other possible etiologies are cytomegalovirus (CMV), primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, acute Toxoplasma gondii infection, and infections produced by human herpes simplex virus (HSV) 6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

IM was therefore diagnosed and confirmed by the presence of IgM against EBV, with seroconversion 1 month later of IgG against EBV viral capsid antigen. During admission, the laboratory tests made in citrated tubes with manual counts yielded a platelet count of > 120,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . One month later, control testing in tubes containing EDTA revealed a platelet count of 132,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with no platelet aggregates in the smears.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The cause of the reaction with EDTA appears to be related to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (platelet fibrinogen receptor) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The explanation for the platelet aggregates would be a change in the structure of the glycoprotein, with the expression of new surface antigens that would be targeted by certain antibodies.

In addition to a drop in platelet count evidenced by the auto-analyzer, other laboratory test alterations can also be seen, such as pseudoleukocytosis and platelet “satellitism” phenomena.

The patient denied travelling history, nor contact history of influenza, etc. A complete blood count showed WBC of 11.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, platelet of 655 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, and a chest film showed nodular opacities over right upper lung and infiltrate over right lower lung field . A chest CT showed right hilar and mediastinum lymph node enlarged with severe necrotic change  and multiple tiny splenic low attenuation lesions , more in favor of tumor progression after chemotherapy. However, high fever with chill developed rapidly, a follow-up complete blood count showed leukocytosis with WBC of 17.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ and platelet of 282 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, C-reactive protein showed 202 mg/L, the patient developed progressive worsening dyspnea shortly after admission, while an arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxemia with respiratory acidosis, he then received endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, and transferred to ICU for further intensive care. A series of CXR  showed progressive change from right upper lung nodular density  to right upper lobe consolidation and right lower lobe infiltrate  and then rapidly deteriorated to bilateral diffuse infiltrate with ARDS pattern . Unexpectedly, the blood culture indicated the presence of a strain of Burkholderia pseudomallei that was susceptible to ceftazidime, imipenem, and minocycline. He received intravenous ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h for 2 weeks, his general condition improved with successful extubated on the eighth ICU day and was transferred to general ward the next day. Then he received antibiotics treatment with ceftazidime 2 g q8h and minocycline 100 mg q12h for additional 3 weeks. His condition improved and the follow-up blood culture showed no growth, while follow-up CXR revealed substantial improvement of the consolidation, and he then was discharged with stable condition.

Most of the cases are related to neutropenic condition. During the past decades, the attention in management of infections in cancer patients has focused on fever and neutropenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. However, latest guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend that immunocompromised non-neutropenic cancer patients should receive equal attention as those with neutropenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Cytotoxic drugs used for the treatment of lung cancer can affect chemotactic and phagocytic function, without reflecting on the total cell count. The functional capabilities of phagocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells may be intrinsically defective even before the initiation of chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Severe septicemic melioidosis pneumonia with respiratory failure following administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma patient is very rare; to our knowledge, this is the first case in English literature. Patients with septicemic melioidosis pneumonia can present severely unwell with fever and prostration, sometimes with few clinical features to suggest a focus of infection but with chest radiography revealing abnormalities consistent with bacteremic pneumonia, typically multiple nodular opacities or multiple patches of alveolar infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-5 \\]</u>. These cases often progress rapidly with coalescence of lesions, development of new lesions, and cavitation. Clinical progression of acute melioidosis pneumonia is often rapid, and septic shock and death are common outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-5 \\]</u>. Acute pneumonia with upper lobe consolidation in endemic regions warrants consideration of melioidosis.\n\n【9】Previous study demonstrated that acute septicemic melioidosis has an upper lobe predominancy in endemic regions, and may be initially misdiagnosed as having tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. The initial clinical presentations of pulmonary melioidosis can mimic tuberculosis, which exhibits fever, dyspnea, a loss of body weight, and fatigue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It might be difficult to distinguish one from the other, unless microbiological information is confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Previous study demonstrated that multisystemic involvement, particularly multiple splenic abscesses, provides an important clue for melioidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, if the lesion coexists with lung tumor, as in our case, it represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the course of chemotherapy following diagnosis of lung cancer. In image study of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma under stable disease after chemotherapy, it might be mistakenly diagnosed as progressive disease with multiple spleen metastasis, or hilar lymph node metastasis especially when the melioidosis pneumonia developed initially. It is possible that the Burkholderia pseudomallei infection in our patient was community-acquired, and it is likely that the environment may play a role in Burkholderia pseudomallei infection in cancer patients, even those receiving less toxic chemotherapy. In some endemic area, melioidosis pneumonia should be considered in differential diagnosis of severe pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy. This is a very important lesson in the care and management of patients on chemotherapy. The subtle and complicated nature of the course of this patient merits our emphasis on unusual presentation of severe pneumonia in newly diagnosed lung cancer patient. Physicians should be cautious to differentiate progressive disease or superimposed infection with an unusual presentation of severe community-acquired pneumonia in chemotherapy-treated patients.\n\n【10】Declaration of Interest\n\n【11】We declare no conflict of interest.

She was transferred to our hospital from an outside facility with a diagnosis of pneumonia after presenting with fevers and dyspnea. Intravenous antibiotics were continued including ceftriaxone and vancomycin. She was hemodynamically stable when she arrived to the hospital. Her pertinent past medical history included hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis. She was maintained on intermittent hemodialysis three times a week prior to admission for the past 5 years and this was continued throughout her hospital course. Neurology was consulted for evaluation of the “tremor” on hospital day 5. Her examination was remarkable for negative myoclonus of the tongue, extremities and trunk 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplementary Video, www.journalmc.org)</u>. The patient’s family reported that the tremor had developed about 3 days prior to her hospitalization but that it had improved since her admission. She had been taking gabapentin 300 mg three times daily for herpetic neuropathy prior to admission. The gabapentin dose was empirically decreased to 100 mg by mouth three times daily on the day of admission to the hospital on the basis of her reduced renal function. Gabapentin was discontinued on hospital day 5 because it was felt to be the only potential cause of her movement disorder. Following discontinuation of gabapentin, the abnormal movements fully resolved within 2 days.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Numerous clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of gabapentin in neuropathic pain and epilepsy. The adverse events associated with gabapentin administration were generally mild to moderate in severity, tended to be self-resolving and dose-related, and infrequently required discontinuation. The most commonly reported neurologic sequelae which occurred in more than 10% of subjects treated with gabapentin included dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and tremor, which were also reported in the placebo groups, to a lesser degree.

CML accounts for about 15% of adult leukemia cases with slight predominance observed in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The median age at presentation is about 50 years of age. The disease manifests in three phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. Presentation of biphasic transition of chronic leukemia directly to blast crisis is seen in aggressive disease courses and is associated with poorer response to treatment and worst outcomes. We present to you a case of a 41-year-old lady with CML who presented with diffuse adenopathy and was found to have biphenotypic presentation of leukemia.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A pleasant 41-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized body aches, fever, night sweats, and axillary adenopathy. The patient has known history of CML diagnosed 6 years prior to presentation and was initiated on imatinib treatment with good initial response to treatment but poor compliance thereafter. She was doing well until a week prior to presentation, when she developed fatigue and noticed swelling in her left axillary region. At the time of presentation, patient had stable vital signs. Physical examination was only remarkable for diffuse adenopathy. Remainder of the physical examination including cardiac and pulmonary systems was unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed elevated white blood cell count of 30.4 g/dL with lymphocytic predominance (48.8%). Pathologic review of peripheral smear was remarkable for leukocytosis with predominance of blasts. Bone marrow aspirate demonstrated profound hypercellularity with lymphoblasts > 70% consistent with lymphoid blastic phase. Immunohistochemical markers were positive for CD34, CD79a, PAX5 and TdT. Axillary lymph node biopsy demonstrated morphologic, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical findings consistent with CD34-positive blasts which were weakly positive for myeloperoxidase and CD7 and negative for PAX5 expression consistent with myeloblasts . Chromosomal analysis revealed presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion, without mutation in the kinase domain, with additional expressions of MYC gene and notable trisomy of chromosome 8 and MLL gene rearrangement. Given the history, patient’s presentation and pathology findings, the patient was determined to have CML with acute biphenotypic blast crisis transformation with extramedullary involvement. Salvage therapy was initiated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD <sup>+ </sup> ) imatinib regimen and intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. First cycle noted improvement in counts with acute decline from 107,000/µL to 60,000/µL. Evaluation for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant was initiated. A second cycle of the above regimen did not show signs of cytological response. The patient subsequently developed a subdural hemorrhage in the context of thrombocytopenia and expired during the course of the week.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of the disease is associated with the fusion of two genes: BCR on chromosome 22 and ABL1 on chromosome 9. This translocation, t(9; 22)(q34; q11), produces an abnormal chromosome 22 referred to as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which harbors the fusion gene, BCR-ABL1. The dysregulated, continuously activated tyrosine kinase protein product of this chromosome is implicated in the pathogenesis of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】CML has a triphasic clinical course: a chronic phase, which is present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 85% of patients; an accelerated phase, in which neutrophil differentiation becomes progressively impaired and leukocyte counts are more difficult to control with treatment; and blast crisis, a condition resembling acute leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts proliferate in an uncontrolled manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The usual presentation is in the chronic phase. Blast crisis usually occurs in bone marrow; about 10-16% cases present with extramedullary involvement at the time of disease transformation from chronic phase. Common extramedullary sites include lymph nodes, bones, skin, testis, and nervous system. Presence of disease in such sites is associated with a significantly poorer response to therapy and survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL) is rare and is mostly seen in the pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The incidence of ABL in adults ranges from 1% to 20% of acute leukemias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are no set diagnostic criteria for ABL. The European Group for Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL) proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for ABL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Studies of ABL have suggested that these leukemias may arise by malignant transformation of a pluripotent stem cell. The finding of a significantly greater percentage of biphenotypic cases with CD34 <sup>+ </sup> (a marker of immature blast cells) expression compared to non-biphenotypic cases, as seen in our patient, supports the concept that this transformation process occurs at a step close to the hematopoietic progenitor cell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the t通用删除7(英):<u>(9,22)</u>(q34;q11) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality described in ABL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The development of ABL, as was the case here, is believed to be derived from marrow stem cells which have the capacity to express antigens from more than one cell line. These cells have notable immunohistochemical fingerprint with notable expression of CD79a, which serves as transmembrane signal modulator early during the course of B-cell differentiation. Other common associations for the development of ABL include the increased expression of MLL gene product (myeloid/lymphoid leukemia) which plays a key role in the establishment of progenitor cells during hematopoiesis. The MLL gene product itself has two unique characteristics in that the N-terminal of MLL protein product forms a fusion protein with the C-terminal of over 40 different partners, including itself, and MLL rearrangements are found in both ALL and AML, whereas most other translocations are lineage specific thus allowing for dual lineage proliferation and development of leukemic symptoms seen in both AML and ALL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Such findings were seen in our patient who presented with profound anemia and thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, fever and night sweats as well as invasion of extramedullary tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Other factors implicated in the pathogenesis of ABL are compliance to therapy. The Adherence Assessment with Glivec: Indicators and Outcomes (ADAGIO) study has shown that non-adherence to imatinib therapy is shown to have higher correlation with poorer outcomes, likely secondary to accumulation of somatic mutation leading to resistance and thus subsequent transformation from a chronic state to an accelerated phase and subsequently a terminal blast crisis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. As seen with this patient, interruption of imatinib treatment contributed to the development of far more aggressive disease course characterized by biphenotypic expression and extramedullary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Treatment of ABL is challenging and the optimal therapy for this sub-type of leukemia remains unclear. A case series by Xu et al showed that the relapse rate in ABL patients was significantly higher than that in AML patients, while the complete remission (CR) rate after relapse was lower than that in AML patients. Also observed was low CR rate after relapse in ABL patients when compared with ALL patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment for ABL patients, regardless of the existence of any known prognostic factors, with the exception of non-remission (NR) as long as the disease is sufficiently controlled until HSCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Management of CML with acute transformation to ABL with blast crisis is a widely debated topic in the hematology/oncology realm as no clear regimen has been shown to have definitive benefit in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Selection of ALL specific versus AML specific protocol for treatment has yet to be explored. Studies are currently being conducted to select the best course regimen with focus on HSCT as treatment modality; however, the aggressive nature of the disease challenges designs of such study protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】The prognosis of ABL patients is poor when compared with de novo acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ABL patients showed a much higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression, complex abnormal karyotype, extramedullary infiltration, relapse, and resistance to therapy after relapse. Further studies are needed to determine the prognostic factors of ABL and treatment modalities.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, FL, USA.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SI collected data and prepared draft of abstract, case presentation, discussion and conclusion.

Surgical treatment included anterior C6 corpectomy, anterior iliac crest graft placement and fixation using plate and screws. The immediate post-operative course was uneventful. During the 2 years of follow-up, the patient had no complains, and no changes was observed in the radiography. In 2002, cervical radiographs showed fracture of the screws and dislocation of the plate to C7-T2 levels. The patient had no clinical symptoms, and fusion response is obtained radiologically. We recommended removing plate and screws to prevent tissue injuries. However, the patient did not accept. Cervical MR investigation showed cervical fusion decompressed spinal canal and lordotic curvature. On a subsequent cervical CT in 2011, the displaced plate and screws were no longer visible. Only the broken screw in the corpus of C7 was seen. Whole body fluoroscopy could not identify any plate or displaced screws .

Especially, infections after 6 months of operation are very rare, and it may be associated with esophagus perforation due to displaced plate and screw systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. No early and late infection was seen in the patient. Frequent symptoms due to esophagus perforation are neck and throat pain, odynophagia, dysphasia, hoarseness and aspiration. The common clinical symptoms are high fever, neck stiffness, crepitation on the anterior surface of chest and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Gaudinez et al reported the importance of surgical treatment in esophagus perforation after anterior cervical trauma surgery.

In 2007, Martinez et al reported the screw migration after surgery of a C5-7 anterior decompression and fusion. Six years after surgery, the patient presented with dysphasia, and in the radiological examination, the screw could no longer be identified. Plate and screw systems were removed, and the patient was treated for prevertebral abscess secondary to esophagus perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Gazzeri et al reported a case of spontaneous healing of esophagus fistule due to screw elimination through the intestinal tract one week after the patient complained of dysphasia and high fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Cagli et al reported cervical screw missing secondary to delayed esophageal fistula. Two years after the anterior discectomy, iliac graft placement and fixation, plate dislocation and partial migration of the upper screw were observed. After 7 years, the patient complained of dysphasia. Radiographical examination showed that one of the upper screws was missing and two lower screws were broken. Esophageal perforation was found during the removing surgery of plate, and screw systems and perforation were repaired. They concluded the screw was lost via the gastrointestinal due to spontaneous perforation of esophagus fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Fujibayashi et al reported a case of an anterior cervical plate and screws, which were disappeared completely. The plate and screws became dislodged and eroded through the posterior wall of the esophagus, then traversed the limit of the gastrointestinal tract.

However, only one symptomatic missing plate was described. This is first case in literature with asymptomatic, missing plate and screws.

Seemingly, the plate penetrates into esophagus at one side and healing process of esophagus continues on the other side. As a result of this mechanism, the plate and screws left the body without any significant defect in esophagus.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】It can be concluded that in surgery of the cervical spine, anterior instrumentation is useful and relatively safe.

RTS is a rare disorder characterized by high arched palate, broad thumbs, prominent forehead, high-arched eyebrows, antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, beaked nose with flat bridge, abnormal ears, and mental retardation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>. It may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder or arise as a spontaneous mutation. Other associated phenotypic features include microcrania, short stature, ocular defects, deviated nasal septum, incompletely descended testes, finger and toe abnormalities, hyperextensible joints, and hyperactive patellar reflexes. Patients frequently have associated respiratory and feeding difficulties as well as associated congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of RTS is not precisely known, but the incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 in 300,000 in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Discovered 30 years after the initial clinical reports, RTS results from submicroscopic 16p13.3 deletion of the response element-binding protein (CREBBP) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The CREBBP gene controls production of a protein that regulates the activity of several other genes and therefore plays an important role in regulating cell growth and division which is essential for normal fetal development. We present a 5-year-old boy with RTS that required anesthetic care for an adenotonsillectomy. Previous reports of perioperative care of patients with RTS are reviewed and options for anesthetic care are presented.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 5-year-old, 18.8 kg boy who presented for adenotonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. His past medical history was significant for RTS diagnosed at 5 years of age, sepsis, plagiocephaly, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, atrial septal defect (ASD), history of tachycardia during the newborn, anemia, unilateral inguinal hernia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). His past surgical history included a flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with direct placement of a percutaneous G-tube, upper GI endoscopy, G-J tube removal, circumcision, exploration of undescended testicle, tympanostomy tube placement, and previous adenoidectomy. Associated co-morbid conditions included attention-deficit disorder, scoliosis, lack of normal physiological development, developmental speech or language delay, sleep-disordered breathing, and allergic rhinitis. Current home medications included dextroamphetamine-amphetamine extended release (10 mg by mouth once daily in the morning), polyethylene glycol (8.5 g by mouth once daily, adjusted to give 1 - 2 soft stools daily), daily iron supplement, ibuprofen (150 mg oral suspension by mouth once daily), loratadine (5 mg by mouth once daily), and a multivitamin (1 tab by mouth once daily). Allergies included only seasonal problems. Preoperative physical examination revealed a child in no acute distress with moderate scoliosis, dysmorphic facies, broad toes, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Airway examination revealed a Mallampati grade II view. Perioperative laboratory evaluations including electrolytes, urinalysis, coagulation function, glucose, and hepatic function were normal. The last hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL. He had a sip of water with his morning medications, but otherwise was nil per os for 6 h. The preoperative room air oxygen saturation was 100%. The patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. Anesthesia was induced with the inhalation of sevoflurane in a mixture of nitrous oxide. A 22-gauge peripheral intravenous cannula was placed following anesthetic induction. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty. Propofol (2 mg/kg) and morphine (0.05 mg/kg) were administered intravenously. Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade, which revealed a Cormack-Lehane grade I view. A 4.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed on the first attempt and a small amount of air added to the cuff to seal the airway at 20 - 25 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O. The patient was positioned supine with a shoulder roll in place and arms tucked to the side. No intraoperative antibiotics were given. The heart rate varied from 130 to 170 beats per minute with a normal sinus rhythm. No bradycardia or arrhythmias were noted. Intraoperative fluids included 250 mL of lactated Ringers solution. Dexamethasone (4 mg) and ondansetron (2 mg) were administered intravenously to provide postoperative inflammation and nausea relief, respectively. Following completion of the surgical procedure, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for observation of hemodynamic and respiratory function. Per our usual routine, his trachea was extubated in the PACU when he was awake. Postoperative pain control was provided with hydrocodone-acetaminophen every 6 h as needed. He was admitted to the inpatient ward for 8 h of postoperative observation. The remainder of his postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged home the same day.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】As with the anesthetic care of all patients, the focus of effective perioperative care of patients with RTS begins with the preoperative examination and the identification of end-organ involvement by the primary disease process. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers are problems with airway management which have been previously noted in several anecdotal case reports from the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. Difficulties with direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are primarily related to specific craniofacial anatomical features including high-arched palate, hypoplasia of the mandible (micrognathia), and limited mouth opening. Although we were able to successfully accomplish endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy without significant difficulties, the ability to accomplish adequate bag-valve-mask ventilation should be demonstrated prior to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Additionally, the appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway should be readily available including indirect laryngoscopy tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Anecdotal success has been reported with the use of a laryngeal mask airway for elective airway management or as a conduit for endotracheal intubation following failed routine airway management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 11 \\]</u>. The risk-benefit of such a practice must be weighed given high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in RTS patients. In our patient, inhalational induction with sevoflurane was performed as the most humane way to achieve intravenous access followed by endotracheal intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube.\n\n【6】Perioperative respiratory and ventilation issues may be further complicated by congenital tracheal stenosis, abnormal pulmonary lobulation, excessive mucous secretion, and gastroesophageal reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The potential co-morbid condition of the respiratory system is illustrated by the fact that respiratory infections and congenital heart disease are the leading causes of death during the first year of life. Copious secretions have been noted by other authors which may make inhalation induction problematic or complicate the immediate postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The perioperative respiratory problems may be further magnified in patients with preoperative symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing as were noted in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Whenever feasible, short-acting anesthetic agents are preferable to limit their effect on postoperative respiratory function. The use of regional has been suggested as a means of limiting perioperative opioid needs thereby limiting their effects on respiratory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Considering the potential co-morbid involvement of the airway and respiratory system, postoperative monitoring is suggested with continuous pulse oximetry or in an ICU setting for more complex surgical procedures.\n\n【7】Associated congenital heart disease occurs in up to 25-30% of patients with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Reported defects have included atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, pseudotruncus, aortic stenosis, vascular rings, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In addition to structural cardiac defects, conduction disturbances have been occasionally reported, many in association with the administration of perioperative medications including succinylcholine or atropine and neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Stirt reported short runs of supraventricular tachycardia and multifocal premature ventricular and atrial contractions for 5 min following the administration of succinylcholine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. No hemodynamic changes were noted, no treatment was required, and the case proceeded uneventful. Similar problems were noted in the same patient during a prior anesthetic with the administration of atropine and neostigmine. Given the potential for such involvement, preoperative echocardiography and electrocardiography should be obtained based on the clinical examination and history.\n\n【8】Although anecdotal, the use of succinylcholine should generally be avoided. When neuromuscular is required, non-depolarizing agents are suggested. Given the potential pro-arrhythmogenic effects of medications with vagolytic effects, there may be a theoretical advantage to the use of cis-atracurium over rocuronium for non-emergent airway management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Alternatively, endotracheal intubation can be accomplished without neuromuscular blockade as noted in our patient with the combination of sevoflurane and propofol. For intravenous induction, others have reported acceptable conditions for endotracheal intubation using a combination of propofol and remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】In summary, we present concerns regarding the anesthetic management of a patient with RTS. Of primary concern are anecdotal reports regarding anatomical features of the syndrome which may make direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation problematic. Associated respiratory disabilities may lead not only to intraoperative, but also postoperative respiratory insufficiency. Potential co-morbid involvement of the cardiac system includes congenital heart disease and the potential for conduction disturbances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These symptoms had progressively worsened in the few days prior and the patient reported minimal relief with supportive therapy at home. The patient was previously evaluated twice via Telemedicine by an urgent care provider as well as her primary care physician (PCP) who prescribed azithromycin and an albuterol inhaler. Prior to the onset of acute respiratory symptoms, the patient had no recent domestic or international travels, however an asymptomatic family member did visit from out-of-state the past week. The patient denied any known exposure to positive or suspected COVID-19 cases. She lives with her husband and maintained strict adherence to safer-at-home recommendations. She and her husband went to the grocery store once, but otherwise denied any contact to any other individuals.\n\n【5】Upon arrival the patient was alert, oriented, and could speak in complete sentences with no audible shortness of breath or wheezing. She was afebrile at 36.9 °C and not hypoxic with oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 93% on room air. The patient exhibited clear breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation with no tachypnea, no wheezing, no rales, and no rhonchi. Labs revealed mild leukocytosis at 11.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL but were otherwise unremarkable. Swabs for influenza A and B antigens (Ags) were both negative. Initial imaging via chest X-ray revealed clear lung fields without infiltrate or pleural effusion. Results of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab were positive. Over the course of the next several weeks, the patient was managed as outpatient through regular monitoring via telemedicine. On day 51 the results of her antibody testing returned positive for both SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. The patient continued to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 64 days after the initial onset of symptoms despite the near resolution of her symptoms by day 25 .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Laboratory Results for Patient A and Her Husband |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】In comparison, the patient’s husband, a 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension and one cardiac stent, presented himself to the emergency department on the same day as his wife with complaints of flu-like symptoms. He reported a gradual onset of rhinorrhea, generalized weakness, myalgias, cough, fever up to 38.1 °C, chills, and diarrhea 12 days prior to presentation to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient was also alert and oriented with no evidence of respiratory distress. At the time of evaluation, the patient was afebrile at 36.7 °C and exhibited good oxygenation with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 98% on room air. Like his wife, the patient exhibited clear breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation with no tachypnea, no wheezing, no rales, and no rhonchi. Labs were unremarkable. Swabs for influenza A and B Ags were both negative. Initial imaging via chest X-ray revealed clear lung fields bilaterally with no significant lung infiltrates or acute abnormalities. Results of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab were positive. Clinical presentation of the infection in this patient was characterized by a prolonged fever up to 38.9 °C that resolved on day 22. Results of antibody testing returned positive for both SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies on day 51. His symptoms continued to improve through day 53, and his first negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab was on day 60 after initial onset of symptoms . This patient was managed as outpatient through regular monitoring via telemedicine.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】In a household of two individuals who both had COVID-19, the wife with milder upper respiratory involvement had a prolonged positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test compared to her husband who had more severe, longer lasting symptoms. A positive swab test after the resolution of symptoms suggests the possibility of reinfection through household transmission. Among members of the same household, a retrospective case series in Wuhan, China involving a total of 155 household contacts of 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed a 30% rate of transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The wife potentially could have been exposed to the virus and reinfected in the time her husband remained symptomatic. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibodies are detected in the early stages of infection and their levels are significantly reduced 4 weeks after onset of illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, therefore the detection of IgM antibodies in the wife over 7 weeks after initial onset of symptoms and 3 weeks after her recovery supports this hypothesis. The husband who had tested seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies on day 51 still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid via nasopharyngeal swab on day 52, indicating that he could have remained infectious.\n\n【10】The period of infectiousness of COVID-19 remains unknown, however, and sustained viral detection may not necessarily correlate with virus transmissibility. Although both patients’ RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal swab repeatedly returned positive, it is unclear whether the test reflects an actively contagious infection versus detection of viral load. Factors such as patient age, sex, prior medical history, and type of specimen obtained may all contribute to the duration of viral shedding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Elderly age has been found to be an independent factor associated with prolonged viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the results of one study revealed the median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens and nasopharyngeal specimens was 34 days and 19 days, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These findings have the potential implication of prolonged transmissibility as patients with COVID-19 shed the virus longer in their lower respiratory tracts, particularly among the elderly. Recent data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among 790 personal contacts of patients who tested negative for the virus after recovering but later tested positive again showed no new confirmed cases from exposure during the re-positive period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This raises the question whether a recovered patient with a PCR-positive sample still remains infectious.\n\n【11】Rapidly evolving knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission will continue to impact clearance discharge criteria for infected patients. Current CDC guidelines on the discontinuation of home isolation for persons with COVID-19 offer a symptom-based strategy. Patients who have COVID-19 and are symptomatic may discontinue home isolation if at least 10 days have passed since initial onset of symptoms, and at least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without use of fever-reducing medication, and other symptoms have improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who never develop any COVID-19 symptoms may discontinue isolation 10 days after their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The protocol on how and when to ease social distancing guidelines requires a stronger understanding of any potential antibody-mediated immunity after infection. A recent study on the antibody response in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients show that IgG levels begin to decrease within 2-3 months after infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In another report, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was only 5.0% by point-of-care test on 61,075 participants from 35,883 randomly selected households in Spain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These data currently do not support the model of herd immunity.\n\n【12】Limitations of this report include the small sample size, the similar ages of our two patients, and that the study population belonged to the same household. Additional examination is necessary to further understand the serological characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 whose fever and respiratory symptoms have resolved may still continue to test positive for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus after they begin to recover. Prolonged viral shedding may be contributing to sustained viral detection in recovered patients, however the low rate of secondary transmission in recovered COVID-19 patients who later re-test positive raises the question whether all seropositive patients are truly infectious. Our report demonstrates the need for caution when applying a symptom-based strategy for the discontinuation of isolation of COVID-19 patients in community settings in order to prevent further potential spread of this deadly virus.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for publication of this report was obtained from the case subjects.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Christine X.Q.

Hepatic mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN-H) is characterized by an ovarian-like stroma, and usually shows no communication to bile ducts. By contrast, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) shows predominant papillary intraductal growth with frequent communication to neighboring bile duct. Recent pathologic studies have suggested that IPNB and MCN-H are biliary counterparts of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN) and MCN of the pancreas (MCN-P), respectively \\[ 3 \\- 6 \\]. In some cases IPNB and MCN-H are known to be early neoplastic lesions that are followed by invasive cholangiocarcinoma, as is the case for IPMN and MCN-P, which progress to invasive carcinoma of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) rapidly leads to liver injury with a risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver failure, thus having a poor prognosis if left untreated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported to be the malignant tumor arising from the liver in patients with AIH \\[ 7 \\- 12 \\]. HCC in patients with AIH occurs sporadically, and its incidence is low \\[ 7 \\- 12 \\]. However, an increased incidence of HCC in AIH patients is expected because recent advances in treatment regimens based on steroid or azathioprine have achieved a high degree of efficacy, thus decreasing the mortality rates and achieving long-term survival rates of 80-90% or better 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Therefore, the risk of malignant tumors other than HCC associated with AIH might increase in the future. Here, we report for the first time a case of IPNB in the liver of 50-year-old man with AIH, with special reference to the immunohistochemical characteristics of the resected tumor.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 50-year-old man was admitted with a chief complaint of general fatigue and jaundice. He had no history of metabolic disorders, excess intake of alcohol or medication, as a potential cause of liver dysfunction. The laboratory data on admission are shown in Table 1 . The levels of total bilirubin and liver enzymes including aspartate transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were high, and the liver functional reserve represented by serum albumin and the international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time were impaired. Viral markers including hepatitis A, B and C viruses were all negative. Since anti-nuclear antibody was positive with a titer of 1:160 and the serum level of immunoglobulin G was high at 2,200 mg/dL, AIH was suspected as the cause of liver dysfunction. The levels of tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9 were all within normal limits, but that of pancreatic cancer-associated protein-2 (DUPAN-2) was higher (470 U/mL) than the reference level (150 U/mL). Routine liver imaging including ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed a cyst-forming tumor with solid masses in its cavity in the medial segment of the liver. CT angiography demonstrated that the tumor masses had faint arterial staining in the early arterial phase , and intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) of the choledochus clearly showed mass lesions that protruded into the lumen . Based on these results, the tumor was diagnosed as an intrahepatic cyst-forming neoplasm, possibly cystadenocarcinoma.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1.

Two solid, irregular masses arise from the wall of the cystic tumor. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Since no metastatic lesions were found and liver function parameters were all improved almost to within normal limits by glycyrrhizin administration after admission, the patient underwent an extended left hepatectomy. Neither lymph node metastasis nor invasion to the hepatic parenchyma or vessels adjacent to the tumor was detected. The resected specimen was a cyst-forming tumor measuring 54 × 42 × 32 mm. A cut section of the tumor demonstrated a large cyst with solid masses in the intraluminal space of the bile duct filled with 12 mL of fluid. There was a high level of CA19-9 (8,000 U/mL) in the fluid.\n\n【8】The histopathology of the resected tumor is shown in Figure 2 . The epithelial tumor cells showed papillary growth accompanied by a fibrous stroma . No ovarian-like stroma was evident in the specimen. Adenocarcinoma components extended along the epithelium of the intrahepatic bile ducts, showing carcinoma in situ . Mucin production by the tumor cells was confirmed by both acian blue and periodic acid-Schiff staining. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells demonstrated negativity for mucin core protein (MUC)1, MUC2, cytokeratin (CK)20, caudal-type homeobox (CDX)2, cluster of differentiation (CD)56, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor, and positivity for CK7, CK19, MUC5AC, MUC6, p53, Ki-67, cyclin D1, CEA and CA19-9. The expression of MUC5A, MUC6, Ki-67 and CEA in the tumor cells is shown in Figure 3 . The histology of the background liver tissue was compatible with that of AIH, showing interface hepatitis with accompanying plasma cell infiltration  and ductular proliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts . The overall features of this case were compatible with a diagnosis of pancreatobiliary-type IPNB, carcinoma in situ, associated with AIH.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The patient has shown no sign of cancer recurrence for 12 years after hepatectomy. The liver dysfunction associated with AIH has been controllable with steroid maintenance therapy on an outpatient basis.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】IPNB is a rare neoplasm of the liver, which was recently defined in the 2010 WHO classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The present case was diagnosed as an intrahepatic cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma at the time of surgery, before this classification had been published. The rarity of IPNB and paucity of clinical information may cause it to be confused with other cyst-forming tumors of the liver. IPNB has malignant potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, which are both histological phenotypes of IPNB in the liver, share similar radiological characteristics and clinicopathological features, making it difficult to distinguish a malignant tumor from a benign adenoma. It is important for clinicians to diagnose this tumor correctly in order to develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n【15】Imaging modalities for diagnosis of INPB in relation to pathological findings have made some degree of progress. IDUS is able to clearly demonstrate a malignant biliary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In addition, arterial blood flow or enhancement of the tumor wall/nodule tends to be demonstrated more commonly in biliary cystadenocarcinoma by CT or CT angiography than in cystadenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. No tumor markers with reliable sensitivity and specificity have yet been assigned to INPB. In the present case, solid masses in the cystic cavity showing an irregular surface were clearly demonstrated by IUDS, and faint arterial staining of the intraluminal masses evident by CT angiography suggested malignancy. Although the serum level of CA19-9 was within the normal range in this case, but it was high (8,000 U/mL) in the tumor fluid, and the serum DUPAN-2 level was high. Thus, markers of pancreatobiliary tumors are worth measuring as an adjunct for diagnosis of IPNB with malignancy.\n\n【16】Recently, IPNB has been considered a biliary counterpart of IPMN \\[ 3 \\- 6 \\], and the immunohistochemical similarities between them have been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. IPNB and IPMN differ from MCN-H and MCN-P in lacking an ovarian-like stroma expressing ER 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Histopathologically, it has been proposed that IPNB should be classified into four subgroups along the lines of those for IPMN, i.e. the gastric type, intestinal type, oncocyte type and pancreatobiliary type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Among them, both the frequency of invasive carcinoma and survival are reportedly worse for pancreatobiliary-type IPNB, as is the case for IPMN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. It has been suggested that the nuclear expression of p53 or cyclin D1 is involved in the carcinogenesis of IPNB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>, and that Ki-67 is associated with malignancy in cases of IPMN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. In accordance with these tumor characteristics, the present case was diagnosed as a pancreatobiliary-type IPNB, carcinoma in situ, with accompanying malignant potential.\n\n【17】In addition to the results of serologic tests, the histopathology of the background liver showed interface hepatitis with plasma cell infiltration, compatible with that of AIH. The incidence of complications ascribable to malignant liver tumors with AIH remains unclear. So far, liver cancer in patients with AIH reported previously has been HCC \\[ 7 \\- 12 \\]. One of the proposed mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis in AIH is long-standing liver inflammation, similar to that resulting from virus-related hepatitis. However, the low incidence of hepatocarcinogenesis in AIH \\[ 7 \\- 12 \\] in comparison with virus-related hepatitis suggests that this theory may not be wholly valid. One of the major histopathological features of AIH is interface hepatitis, involving severe inflammation of the portal and periportal areas. Proliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts is also often observed, as in the present case. The occurrence of biliary carcinoma in patients with AIH might be associated with both abnormality of the immune system and persistent inflammation of the bile duct. Although IPNB itself is a rare tumor, further investigation is needed to clarify whether it is a malignancy associated with AIH. It has been proposed that curative resection of IPNB with malignant potential may offer a favorable prognosis with a chance of long-term survival \\[ 23 \\- 25 \\], and in fact the present patient has remained free of cancer recurrence for 12 years after hepatectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pancreatobiliary-type IPNB, carcinoma in situ, arising from the liver in a patient with AIH.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None reported.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In this unique finding, the T wave direction during “memory”, or periods after altered depolarization, is similar to that of the QRS complex during periods of abnormal depolarization. Such T wave abnormalities have been seen after termination of ventricular pacing, elimination of ventricular pre-excitation after ablation of an accessory pathway and temporary resolution of conduction abnormalities (predominantly left bundle branch block (LBBB)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We present a case of a high-risk elderly male who developed deep T wave inversions (TWIs) postoperatively in the setting of intermittent LBBB. A discussion of the differential diagnosis of TWIs and the differentiation of CM from ischemia follow.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 93-year-old man with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease with prior coronary artery bypass graft developed sinus bradycardia with new ST-T wave changes after endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.\n\n【4】The patient’s baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, first degree atrioventricular (AV) block, LBBB, TWIs in I, aVL, v5 and v6 and atrial premature depolarizations. The postoperative ECG  demonstrates sinus bradycardia at 48 beats/min and first degree AV block with resolution of LBBB. There are voltage criteria consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and notably TWIs in all leads, and particularly pronounced in the precordial leads.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Baseline ECG. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Postoperative ECG from current presentation. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】An echocardiogram done postoperatively showed LVH with an ejection fraction of 25% and an akinetic apex and anteroseptal wall (unchanged from prior). Serial troponins were negative (< 0.015 ng/mL). On postoperative day 1, the patient was no longer bradycardic resulting in reinstitution of his baseline ECG with LBBB, and resolution of the deep TWIs. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his hospitalization and was discharged 2 days later.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】In an elderly patient with extensive atherosclerotic disease, ischemia of the proximal LAD was highest on the differential diagnosis as the cause of new deep precordial TWIs (Wellens’ sign) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Other causes of TWIs include electrolytes abnormalities (especially hypokalemia), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, persistent juvenile T waves, medications and an intracranial process (particularly hemorrhage).\n\n【10】Another possible explanation for the aforementioned ECG changes is the phenomenon of CM. While this is a diagnosis of exclusion, the deep TWI in the setting of temporary resolution of LBBB, negative serial troponins and absence of any other clinical explanation are strongly suggestive. Typically, the presence of a bundle branch block during physiologic heart rates and resolution at lower heart rates suggests significant but not complete anatomical disruption of that bundle. As the Purkinje fibers conduction is governed by the “all or none” principle, with no effect of the autonomic nervous system, there is a heart rate threshold over which all electrical impulses are blocked. This threshold decreases as the Purkinje network becomes more diseased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This should be distinguished from the presence of right bundle branch block at higher heart rates, which is a normal functional phenomenon and a result of the refractory period of the right bundle branch being longer than that of the left bundle branch.\n\n【11】CM poses a challenge in ECG interpretation, as it often imitates findings of ischemia. Distinguishing T wave changes in CM from those in ischemia is important, as correctly identifying CM can avoid unnecessary additional invasive testing. The presence of a positive T wave in aVL, a positive or isoelectric T wave in lead I, and a maximal precordial TWI that is greater than the TWI in lead III, is 92% sensitive and 100% specific for CM as suggested in a cohort of 60 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our patient was known to have structural heart disease and therefore, baseline ST-T changes are expected and thus, the TWIs seen in Figure 1 are likely due to LVH or an old infarct. Existing data in patients with structural heart disease suggest that when TWIs are present in leads I and aVL at baseline, they can remain inverted even with the development of CM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】This case demonstrates the complexities that CM can add to the interpretation of ECGs in a high-risk patient. While criteria exist to help to distinguish CM ECG changes from ischemic changes, there can be confounding data and the diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation of other causes of TWI. Most importantly, T wave memory remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and therefore, history, clinical presentation and review of prior ECGs remain the foundation of clinical decision-making.\n\n【14】Disclosures\n\n【15】There are no relevant financial disclosures, acknowledgments or conflicts of interest.

Based on autopsy findings, Chung et al detected thyroid metastasis from RCC in 5% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A 20-year retrospective review of surgical pathology and autopsy pathology database for patients with metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid identified a total of 10 patients with metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid; six were in surgical pathology specimens out of a total of 1,295 thyroid carcinomas (0.46%) and four were diagnosed at autopsy out of a total of 2,117 (0.19%) autopsy cases during this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The primary tumor was RCC only in one of these 10 cases.\n\n【12】Metastatic deposits in the thyroid may be asymptomatic or present with few symptoms. The usual symptoms of metastatic RCC to the thyroid gland are enlarged solitary or multiple neck swellings, painless palpable thyroid nodules, shortness of breath, vocal changes, wheezing and difficulty in swallowing, but most secondary metastases of the thyroid are asymptomatic.

Aside from the skin, malignant melanoma has been observed in the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, head, and genital regions. The rectal region is the most frequently affected part in gastrointestinal malignant melanoma. These mucosal tumors, unlike the skin, derive their origin from the melanocytes in the non-keratinized squamous epithelium. Malignant melanoma of the rectum is an extremely rare and very aggressive tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It constitutes only 0.5-4% of all anorectal malignancies and less than 1% of all melanomas. Most patients present usually in the fifth or sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Some cases have reported an association between rectal melanoma and Caucasian women; however, due to inadequate population-based studies, this remains inconclusive. The common presenting symptoms are rectal bleeding, anal mass, and changes in bowel habits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PRM is lethal with a median survival of 24 months and 5-year survival of 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 72-year-old Caucasian male widower, with a past medical history of an alcohol use disorder, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of bleeding per rectum, anal mass, and diarrhea for 11 months associated with anal pruritus and tenesmus. He denied any personal or family history of cancer. Significant findings on physical examination included a frail appearing elderly man with a distended abdomen, and a soft, tender, friable mass protruding from the anus. The skin was negative for any abnormal pigmentation or lesion. Significant laboratory findings included hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL (reference range of 14 - 18 g/dL), platelet of 247 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (150 - 440 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> ), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 75.7 fL (80 - 100 fL), albumin of 2.8 g/dL (3.1 - 4.5 g/dL), aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) of 28/21 U/L (15 - 37/12 - 78 U/L), serum iron of 18 µg/dL (65 - 175 µg/dL), ferritin of 17.9 ng/mL (22 - 322 ng/mL), and iron saturation of 6.2% (20-55%).\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】The patient had a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen which showed numerous hepatic lesions, with the largest measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, a large soft tissue mass at the anorectal junction with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed a mass at the rectum with friable mucosa, measuring about 3 cm .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Colonoscope retroflection in rectum revealing rectal mass (blue arrow). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】The result of the biopsy showed a malignant proliferation of atypical pleomorphic cells with cherry-red macronuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm containing pigment . The neoplastic cells were positive for Sox10 and S100, confirming the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. (a) Submucosal melanoma (blue star) (H&E stain, × 200).

Abdominoperineal resection (APR) surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy was discussed with the patient but he opted for palliative care with no intent for surgery or chemotherapy. The patient died 5 months after diagnosis.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】PRM is a type of melanoma arising from melanocytes in the rectal mucosa, more than 4 cm from the anal verge. This constitutes the primary difference from anorectal melanoma, which develops at or near the squamocolumnar junction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. PRM is a rare entity and not well documented in case reports and literature reviews. Most cases are misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids, adenocarcinoma, polyp, and rectal ulcer. Diagnosis is difficult for most clinicians due to its low incidence, non-specific symptoms, lack of melanin pigmentation, and histologic similarities with other cancers like lymphoma and sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases reported a higher incidence of anal melanoma compared to PRM. Goldman et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported 49 cases of primary anorectal melanoma among 24,323 patients with anorectal tumors in the total Swedish population between 1970 and 1984. Of these 49 tumors, 45 (91%) were located at or near the anorectal junction, three at the anal verge (6%), and only one in the rectum (3%) approximately 8 cm from the anal orifice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Brady et al reported in another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> that summarized the largest series of PRM in the literature at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1929 to 1993. This retrospective review reported 85 patients who were considered to have primary anorectal melanoma. Seven patients (8%) had tumors that were considered primary rectal malignant melanoma, while 78 patients (92%) had tumors that arose in the anal canal or the anal margin. In our case report, our patient had PRM arising 5 cm from the anus with no other cutaneous lesion detected at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【14】The cause of mucosal melanoma remains unidentified. However, some reports have found the Caucasian race to be a predisposing factor. The rate of mucosal melanoma remains twice as higher in Caucasians compared to African Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Immunosuppression whether it is due to medications or infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with a high risk of melanoma. In a review of 619 patients who received cardiothoracic transplants, there was a 65-fold increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and a threefold increase in the risk of malignant melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Two susceptibility genes, CDKN2A and CDK4 , have been identified to be associated with melanoma. In familial melanomas, a mutation in the CDKN2A gene, on the short arm of chromosome 9, increases the risk of melanoma. This is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p19. Mutations in this gene have been found in 25% of familial melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition, BRAF mutations are frequently reported in nevi and malignant melanomas. The frequency of BRAF mutation in mucosal melanomas is low compared to that of primary cutaneous melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In our patient, there was no family history of melanoma. Genetic testing was not done as he declined it. PRM has a high tendency of spreading with the most common sites for metastases being inguinal lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, hypogastric lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, liver, lung, skin, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. About 20% of recently diagnosed PRM patients are positive for lymph node disease in the inguinal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Distant metastases are identified in about 26-38% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Biopsy through colonoscopy or proctoscopy is the gold standard to establish the diagnosis and staging of tumor extent. CECT and magnetic resonance imaging aid the characterization and extent of the tumor. A positron emission tomography scan can be used for lesions that are indeterminate on CECT. Histology and immunochemistry aid in the confirmation of diagnosis. Useful markers commonly used include S100 protein, Sox10, HMB 45, melan A, and microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Our patient’s biopsy was positive for Sox10 and S100.\n\n【16】PRM is staged on a clinical basis, focusing on locoregional and distant metastasis. Stage I is a local disease involving two categories (stage IA with a depth of 0.75 mm, stage IB with a depth 0.75 - 1.5 mm), stage II has increased thickness with ulceration and has two substages (stage IIA with a depth of 1.5 - 4 mm, stage IIB > 4 mm), stage III involves regional lymph nodes, and stage IV shows distant metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】There is no consensus at this moment on which surgical approach is preferred in the treatment of malignant melanoma of the rectum. Traditionally, APR was recommended due to its ability to control lymphatic spread predominantly to mesenteric nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Most recent studies however suggest a less aggressive wide local excision (WLE). Combining radiation therapy with WLE has shown a decreased risk of local recurrence associated with this procedure. In a study carried out at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 54 patients who had WLE with radiotherapy between 1990 and 2008 had an excellent 5-year rate of local control with no significant improvement in survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. APR is usually indicated for bulky tumors especially those with > 4 mm thickness, extensive tumors involving the anal sphincter that is not amenable to local excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Some studies have shown that APR is associated with increased mortality, especially in those with lymph node-positive disease. Nusrath et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> conducted a study on 30 patients with anorectal malignant melanoma, 15 had APR with a median survival of 13 months while five patients who had a WLE had a median survival of about 36 months. This was attributed to larger tumor size (3.5 cm) and positive nodal disease in the APR group compared to WLE. A retrospective study by Pessaux et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> showed no significant difference in survival between those that had APR versus WLE. This was attributed to the small sample size. WLE however was recommended for patients with easily achievable negative surgical margin and APR, for those with extensive disease involving the anal sphincter. In a meta-analysis study conducted by Smith et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, no oncological benefit was found between APR and WLE but recommended WLE with regular surveillance in most patients because of increased morbidity associated with APR. In some cases, surgical procedure is combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in metastatic disease to achieve a good response. Chemotherapeutic agents used include cisplatin (CDDP), vinblastine (VB), dacarbazine (DTIC), interferon B (IFN), and interleukins (ILs)-2-8. According to a retrospective study by Kim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, the majority of patients who received combination therapy with CDDP/DTIC/VB/IFN showed a major response with a median survival of 12.2 months, and only one with a complete response had survival duration of about 43 months. Our patient had a tumor size of 3 cm with distant metastasis to the liver, reflecting stage IV disease. The benefit of APR with chemotherapy was discussed with him but he declined further treatment and opted for palliative care.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The rarity of PRM and the limited number of patients who present early have prevented definitive trials examining the optimal treatment of curable rectal melanoma. Most patients however die irrespective of the therapy chosen due to the rapid tumor progression. Clinicians are therefore advised to carry out an appropriate investigation of any rectal mass encountered in practice.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】The takeaway point from this case is to make clinicians aware of primary rectal malignant melanoma and to consider it a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with rectal bleeding with or without visible anal mass. PRM is an uncommon and aggressive disease that carries a poor prognosis.

{"seq_id": "ed1b23c7-35d5-4cea-9725-f5df0d10c65d", "title": null, "text": "| Introduction | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【1】Sugammadex (Bridion <sup>® </sup> , Merck & Co, Whithouse Stations, New Jersey) is a novel pharmacologic agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade, which was approved for clinical use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2015. It is a synthetically modified γ-cyclodextrin that selectively reverses steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) including rocuronium and vecuronium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Sugammadex selectively encapsulates the NMBA in a one-to-one molecular interaction forming a complex and effectively removing the NMBA from the plasma. In contrast to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, sugammadex is able to rapidly reverse even profound neuromuscular blockade occurring immediately after the administration of a NMBA. Given this rapid reversal of profound blockade, it has been suggested for use in critical situations where the rapid reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade is necessary including the “cannot intubate-cannot ventilate” (CICV) scenario \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]. We report the use of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade following difficulty with positive pressure ventilation after endotracheal intubation in a neonate with duodenal atresia and a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The potential for its use in critical airway and ventilation scenarios is reviewed.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 1.77 kg, 34-week gestation neonate with duodenal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), presenting for emergent gastrostomy tube placement and ligation of the TEF. Following birth, multiple congenital anomalies were noted including a solitary kidney with a sacral anomaly and possible tethered cord. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 min and 5 min, respectively. A preoperative chest radiograph revealed a markedly distended stomach bubble with termination of an esophageal tube high in the upper thorax. Mild diffuse bilateral lung disease was noted suggesting either aspiration or hyaline membrane disease. On day 1 of life, she was taken to the operating room. Her vital signs were stable while breathing spontaneously on room air with a blood pressure of 48/26 mm Hg, heart rate of 137 beats/minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 98%. Given the risks of aspiration and the potential for insufflation of the stomach through the fistula with positive pressure ventilation, the decision was made to proceed with awake endotracheal intubation followed by the induction of anesthesia. Following the administration of dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg), the infant’s trachea was intubated and positive pressure provided. As it appeared that the lungs could be effectively ventilated without insufflation of the stomach, rocuronium (1 mg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg) were administered. Following the administration of rocuronium, ventilation became problematic and air entry was noted into the stomach with a decrease of the SpO2 to 72%. Sugammadex (8 mg/kg) was administered and spontaneous ventilation was regained within 1 - 2 min. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane with spontaneous or assisted ventilation as needed and the gastrostomy tube was placed. The TEF was ligated and the patient was returned with the endotracheal tube in place to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient’s trachea was extubated on postoperative day 5 and the remainder of the postoperative course was uneventful.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】For anticholinesterase inhibitors to effectively reverse competitive blockade with non-depolarizing NMBAs, the concentration of the neuromuscular blocking agent in the synaptic cleft must be relatively low and there must be significant residual neuromuscular function present. As such, in a patient such as ours, who had just received a full dose of rocuronium for endotracheal intubation, these agents would be ineffective. Three prospective trials involving a total of 180 pediatric patients have demonstrated a significantly more effective and more rapid return of the TOF to ≥ 90% with sugammadex than with neostigmine \\[ 5 \\- 7 \\].\n\n【6】Given these clinical effects, sugammadex may allow the potential for the rapid pharmacologic reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade and therefore has been suggested for use in critical airway and ventilation scenarios including a CICV scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its potential utility in such scenarios was evaluated in a prospective trial in adults which compared the administration of rocuronium (1 mg/kg) plus sugammadex (16 mg/kg) with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The time to resumption of spontaneous ventilation was shorter in the rocuronium-sugammadex group (216 s versus 406 s). However, others have published models to simulate the duration of anesthesia, apnea, and respiratory depression using common anesthetic induction techniques with predicted rates of oxygen desaturation to explore to what degree the rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex might improve the return of spontaneous ventilation in CICV situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Their simulations demonstrated that the duration of neuromuscular blockade was longer with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine than with 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium followed 3 min later by 16 mg/kg sugammadex (10.0 vs. 4.5 min). The authors concluded that the duration of intolerable ventilatory depression after sugammadex reversal may be as long as 15 min in 5% of individuals and therefore, the clinical management of CICV should focus primarily on restoration of airway patency, oxygenation, and ventilation consistent with the American Society of Anesthesiologist’s practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway.\n\n【7】We report anecdotal experience with the use of sugammadex for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade in a patient with a TEF, in whom positive pressure ventilation became problematic after the administration of rocuronium, due to gastric insufflation through the fistula. Spontaneous ventilation resumed and oxygen saturation increased 1 - 2 min after the administration of sugammadex. To date, there is only one previous report of the use of sugammadex in a critical airway scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The patient was a 9-month-old, 5.9 kg infant with severe stridor, scheduled for upper airway evaluation. Anesthesia was induced with a combination of propofol and fentanyl followed by the demonstration of effective bag-valve-mask ventilation and the administration of vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). After several failed attempts at direct laryngoscopy, bag-valve-mask ventilation became difficult due to insufflation of the stomach and the oxygen saturation decreased to 75%. Sevoflurane was discontinued and sugammadex (8 mg/kg) was administrated. The time from the administration of vecuronium to the administration of sugammadex was less than 6 min. Effective spontaneous ventilation returned 25 s after the administration of sugammadex. Ninety seconds after the administration of sugammadex, the skeletal muscle tone was regained and oxygen saturation returned to 99-100% with an inspired oxygen concentration of 0.4.\n\n【8】This anecdotal information may be useful as recent reports and guidelines have suggested a reappraisal of specific tenets of airway management and recommend the consideration of instituting neuromuscular blockade when facing a “cannot ventilate scenario” to overcome functional airway obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The report of the national project from the United Kingdom recommends that when CICV occurs, waking up the patient is not a first step anymore and the administration of neuromuscular blockade should occur prior to proceeding to a surgical airway. The pediatric airway guidelines from the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (APAGBI) recommend that further attempts at endotracheal intubation should not occur without using neuromuscular blockade. They note that rocuronium is regarded as a favorable choice because of its rapid onset and the potential for reversal with sugammadex.\n\n【9】In summary, we present anecdotal experience with the efficacy of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium in neonate during a critical airway and ventilation scenario. When positive pressure ventilation became problematic and oxygen saturations decreased due to gastric insufflation from the TEF, spontaneous ventilation resumed and oxygen saturations increased 1 - 2 min after the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex offers the potential for the rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade in various critical airway and respiratory scenarios. Future anecdotal experience and prospective trials are needed to future outline its utility in these clinical scenarios.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination was unremarkable except for an area of hypophonesis on the left basal lung compatible with pleural effusion and a tracheal murmur at the level of C7. An echocardiogram showed the presence of pericardial effusion (max 17 mm) and revealed an echogenic mass, before the right ventricle, in the mediastinum with a disomogeneous echogenicity . In the suspicion of a mediastinal tumor, a chest X ray and subsequently a cardiac MRI were performed, this last better defined the mass dimension and its contiguity relationship and confirmed the suspicion of a lymphoproliferative disease . A biopsy was performed for the mass characterization and revealed an infiltrating non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma at B big cells; chemotherapy was started. Following the mother willing and inaccordance with a team of experts, it was planned to wait as much as possible for a safe caesarean delivery. Meanwhile the mother clinical and hemodynamic conditions and the fetus growth were monitored. Pericardial fluid and mass influences on cardiac hemodynamic were followed up by echocardiography until the 30th week of gestation when the instabilization of mother’s clinical condition requested the interruption of pregnancy. The caesarean delivery succeeded excellently; the newborn was vital and normal for the gestation time. Through a transternal thoracothomy, after debriging of mediastinal, pulmonar, vascular and cardiac structures, the mass was excised.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The tumor growth may be favoured by hormonal and immunitary changes typical of pregnancy.

Among these, the primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, known as PMLBCL, is the rarest and its prognosis is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is often difficult because symptoms may be late and secondary to compression and infiltration of the nearer structures.

The microbiological aetiology of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) has changed over the last 20 - 30 years, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae has been implicated in pneumonia.

Although the lifetime incidence of venous thrombosis is 0.1%, it still remains a rare condition especially in patients below 30 years of age \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) accounts for approximately 66% of all VTE. Some DVT with pulmonary embolism (PE) may present with a similar clinical, radiological and laboratorial characteristics of CAP, represent a diagnostic challenge to the physician, especially in its difficulty in the differential diagnosis during treatment process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition. It has similar aetiological factors to lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Hypercoagulability related to hematological or neoplastic abnormalities, venous stasis secondary to extraluminal pressure from tumours or inflammatory processes and vessel injury due to trauma have all been implicated as primary mechanisms in the pathophysiology of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】We present the case of atypical presentation of community acquired pneumonia associated with huge deep vein thrombosis with IVC thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such case reported.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 27-year old male, non-smoker and with no known systemic disease, was admitted due to fever and right chest pain for 2 days, and had recent history of left lower lobe pneumonia discharged from other hospital one month prior to this admission. There was no thigh pain or lower limb swelling at initial presentation. On examination, he had a pyrexia of 38.5 °C with a pulse rate of 96 beats/min and blood pressure of 126/74 mm Hg. He had only slight chest pain during coughing otherwise no back pain no venous distension or pitting edema noted. The hematological analysis showed a platelet count of 274 ×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, white cell count of 16.8 ×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, CRP: 74.5 mg/L. The CXR revealed air space opacification over right lower lung . Sputum culture revealed Hemophilus parainfluenzae, which was compatible with the pathogen isolate in other hospital. He was treated under the impression of pneumonia with suspicious parapneumonic effusion initially, adequate antibiotics treatment were used for severe sepsis and possible pathogen. His condition once improved and follow up CXR revealed separated consolidative patch over right lower lung filed with slight resolution . However, left inguinal pain and left leg swelling developed several days after fever subsided. The sonography of the left lower extremities showed deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity. A cardiac echogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary arterial pressure of 55 mmHg. A contrast enhanced CT angiogram  scan from chest to pelvis and thigh revealed peripheral patches and consolidation in the right lower lung  with abnormal filling defect over right main pulmonary artery and right descending pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary embolism of right main and descending arteries , complete thrombosis of left femoral to common iliac veins, and partial thrombosis of right common iliac vein to infrarenal IVC without other congenital IVC anomalies and no evidence of external compression of bilateral iliac veins .

The patient was initially placed on a heparin drip and intentional radiology was consulted. A venocavogram was performed and he was found to have a filling defect in IVC and right common iliac vein, and non-opacification of left iliac vein. A COOK Celect IVC filter was deployed at infrarenal IVC without significant tilting . The patient tolerated the procedure well, and anticoagulants agent with heparin, and urokinase were given. His condition improved after 7th day in ICU, and the follow up angiography revealed improvement of IVC thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 4.

It demonstrates that unusual infectious pattern or noninfectious diseases should always be suspected and included in the differential diagnosis of patients with presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia but who present with treatment failure or disease progression, especially young patients or those without comorbidity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The first step toward those diagnostics is to constantly be aware of their possible presence.\n\n【12】Pulmonary infection may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). In previous literature Alikhan et al. reported that acute respiratory infection was an independent risk factors in the generation of venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. H parainfluenzae pneumonia associated with DVT and IVC thrombosis complicated with pulmonary embolism is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case ever reported.\n\n【13】Pulmonary embolism is an insidious disease with protean manifestation requiring high index of suspicion especially in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. PE can present with cough, fever, C-reactive protein elevation and pulmonary opacity, so that bacterial pneumonia could represent a confounding diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In such condition the diagnosis of PE is difficult to obtain during initial stage of community acquired pneumonia before empiric antibiotics treatment. The classical presentation of IVC thrombus varies according to the level of the thrombosis with up to 50% of patients presenting with bilateral lower extremity swelling and dilatation of superficial abdominal vessels. However, some asymptomatic subjects might have had subclinical thrombosis that no one was able to diagnose before some complicated situation \\[ 7 \\- 9 \\].\n\n【14】In our case, there is no leg pain, no swelling during initial presentation. The coagulation screen showed negative for anti-phospholipid antibody, RA factor, and anti nuclear antibody. It ruled out the possibility of certain acquired deficient. Additionally, the serological study also showed negative for p- ANCA and c-ANCA, which further ruled out the possibility of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's Granulomatosis. It is possible that acute pulmonary infection predisposed the thrombotic event.\n\n【15】Neoplasms have a strong relationship with IVC thrombosis because of hypercoagulability. Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava from extraluminal obstruction has been described in a variety of neoplasms and in inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, puerperal sepsis, and hepatic abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Reports of IVC thrombosis secondary to compression by abdominal aortic aneurysms, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and retroperitoneal hematomas also exist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Following ultrasonic identification of an ileo-femoral thrombosis especially when bilateral, CT or MRI imaging, are required to delineate IVC anatomy and ascertain proximal extent of the thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Chest CT scans should extend up to the renal veins as this will identify common IVC anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Concurrent occlusion of the common iliac(s) as well as the IVC, with distal extension of thrombus leads to clinical symptomatology in patients with both normal and abnormal IVC anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. We therefore performed CT scan from the thoracic inlet down to pelvis and popliteal area. However the chest and pelvis CT of this patient has ruled out the above possibility. Following exclusion of May Thurner syndrome and other pathologies, it is possible that in this patient the thrombus was a primary event associated with pneumonia. The diagnosis of this patient was therefore of H parainfluenzae pneumonia associated with DVT and IVC thrombosis complicated with pulmonary embolism. Awareness of hemophilus parainfluenzae active role in thrombosis is an important point for suspect embolism and to avoid pitfalls in none resolving or relapsing pneumonia. From our case, acute Hemophilus parainfulenza infection can be the cause or precipitating factor of thromboembolic events in immunocompetent patients. For this reason we suggest considering PE as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with atypical presentation of community acquired pneumonia especially in those patients with risk factors.\n\n【16】In conclusion, an unusual presentation of pneumonia in young patient merit special attention, and a high index of suspicion is warranted for early detection of IVC thrombus with pulmonary embolism in the young patient with lower back and limb pain, swelling of the lower limbs, with a concurrent rise in inflammatory markers and pyrexia.\n\n【17】Grant of Support\n\n【18】None.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We declare that the content has not been previously published and has been submitted solely to Journal of Medical Cases.

However, ureteral obstruction due to surgical clip migration into the ureter is an extremelly rare phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. We report here an interesting case of spontaneous migration of metal clip into the ureter in a female patient that underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 1 year previously for polymyomatous uterus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case decribed in a patient after laparoscopic hysterectomy. The purpose of presenting this case report is not only to report an uncommon case of surgical clip migration, but also to raise awareness among clinicians that this rare entity can occurs after laparoscopic hysterectomy.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 45-year-old lady presented with repeated episodes of right flank pain since 3 weeks. Her past history was significant for laparoscopic hysterectomy for polymyomatous uterus 1 year ago.

The medium-sized surgical clip was identified and removed using a dormia basket device and a double J stent was placed for 2 months. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with absolutely normal renal function test and absence of ureterohydonephrosis in abdomen ultrasonography.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. (a) Ureteroscopy showed a metallic parallelepiped foreign body at the lower right ureter. (b) The foreign body was removed by use of a ureteroscopic stone basket device and was identified as a metallic unresorbable clip. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Surgical clips have been used for many years in a variety of surgical procedures and they have proven competency and efficacy. The number of the surgical clips used is variable and unpredictable which depends on the procedure. However, regardless of their type, migration of the surgical clips away from the surgical site is a well-known phenomenon that occurs quite regularly.\n\n【10】While migration of clips into the common bile duct has been previously reported in several laparoscopic cholecystectomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, migrations of surgical materials into the urinary tract like pelvicalyceal system, ureter and bladder are a rare condition. It has been reported following various urological procedures either in the ureter after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy \\[ 5 \\- 7 \\] or into the bladder after surgery laparoscopic radical prostatectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, a case of intrarectal migration after prostatectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and a case of migration in the colon after partial nephrectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> have also been reported.\n\n【11】This case is very interesting because to the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of migration of surgical clip into the ureter after laparoscopic hysterectomy.\n\n【12】It was suggested that migrated clips are more often associated with laparoscopic procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. This implies that we would expect to see more of migrated clips with the vast preferred use of laparoscopy\n\n【13】The exact sequence of events leading to clip migration is poorly understood, but is thought to be partly affected by technical factors such as correct placement and use of minimal numbers of clips 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A proposed mechanism of clip migration after cholecystectomy involved the compression of the clipped cystic duct by the liver. The cystic duct and clips then become inverted into the lumen of the common bile duct. Over time, this structure becomes necrotic, and the clips fall away into the common bile duct. The number of clips used during the initial surgery is also an important factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In our patient, the non-absorbable surgical clip probably eroded into the ureter which has obstructed subsequently probably due to chronic inflammatory reactions, and caused ureterohydronephrosis.\n\n【14】The median time of clip migration is usually 2 years, but it can vary from 11 days to 20 years, while the median number of migrated clip is 1 (range: 1 - 6) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In this patient, clip migration was diagnosed 1 year after laparoscopic hysterectmy which concord with the literature.\n\n【15】The choice of treatment is based on the location, type and extend of ureteral injury caused by migrated clip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.There is a report of the migration of absorbable Lapra-Ty suture clips in the collecting system after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and Massoud 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> also reported the migration of a metal surgical clip into the ureter after open partial nephrectomy, all of which were passed spontaneously. The majority of patients with delayed diagnosed ureteral injuries should be managed by an initial endourological approach.\n\n【16】To improve the management of ureteric injury, there must be a high index of suspicion, especially after laparoscopic operations. Most reported cases were treated with endourological treatment which yields acceptable results.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Surgical clips may migrate postoperatively and cause secondary complications. Therefore, the surgeon must be aware of the possibility of clip migration. Furthermore, clips should be absorbable and applied selectively over vessels and far from the collecting system.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized as innervation of medial and lateral part of palm involving the deep branch of the ulnar nerve crossover to the recurrent branch of the median nerve in the hand. Clinical presentation of RCA can be three forms. All hand muscles can be innervated by ulnar nerve (all ulnar hand) or motor innervation can be dominantly provided by ulnar nerve and lastly some of median innervated muscles can be innervated by ulnar nerve \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\].\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 44 years old right handed woman had been suffered from pain and numbness in the hands was examined. Her neurological examination was normal. There was no wasting or weakness of the hand muscles, nor sensory impairment. The pain was dull in character, continuing all day long. Phallen and Tinel signs were negative and peripheral nerves were normal by palpation.\n\n【4】Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography was performed using standard techniques. Skin temperature was kept above 32 °C. Motor nerve conduction studies were obtained by recording compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles following stimulation of median and ulnar nerves. Orthodromic sensory responses from the median and ulnar nerves were obtained from 2nd and 5th digits by using ring electrodes. Left median nerve motor conduction studies recorded from APB muscles obtained by stimulating the nerve at the wrist showed unusual bifid appearance with a small amplitude. Also stimulating the nerve at the elbow showed a similar appearance and amplitude so this also excludes Martin Gruber anastomosis. Recording from APB, this time ulnar nerve was stimulated at the wrist and cubital tunnel surprisingly responses with normal CMAP amplitude and latencies obtained . Recording from ADM ulnar motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. After median nerve stimulation no response was recorded from ADM muscle. Similar findings were obtained on the right hand, though mildly higher CMAP amplitudes in right median nerve in comparison to left median nerve. Normal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were recorded from median and ulnar nerves bilaterally. Needle electromyography of APB, ADM, biceps, triceps and deltoid muscles were normal.

The two main differentiated subtypes are papillary and follicular with papillary having favorable long-term survival rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) has a higher propensity to metastasize and thus a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The World Health Organization (WHO) defines FTC as “A malignant epithelial tumour showing follicular differentiation and lacking the diagnostic nuclear features”. FTC accounts for 10-20% of differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Demographically it affects women 3:1 compared to men and usually presents in fifth to seventh decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. FTC demonstrates vascular invasion and so usually metastasizes to both bone and lung mostly without nodal spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Although thyroid cancer is well known to metastasize to bone, including vertebrae, cord compression is very rare as an initial presentation for the carcinoma and our literature search could only locate nine documented cases. Treatment of FTC usually involves a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach including surgical resection, hormonal therapy and radioactive iodine ablation therapy (RAI). We present the case of a patient who presented to hospital with symptoms of spinal cord compression due to an undiagnosed metastatic FTC.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 53-year-old man presented to our emergency department with several weeks of progressive leg weakness, constipation and difficulty in voiding urine. On further questioning he admitted 1 year’s history of mild mid-back pain and occasional neck pain. He had no significant past medical history. Neurological examination demonstrated he had reduced power to the lower limbs bilaterally and decreased sharp and light touch sensation to the lower limbs with hyperreflexia. Additionally he had decreased sensation bilaterally up to the T7 dermatome. Urgent computed tomography (CT) spine showed T5 cord compression from a lytic T5 lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a T5 vertebral body mass  with multiple other enhancing foci within the spine, a destructive lesion in right iliac crest and a left-sided neck mass .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

There is a large cervical soft tissue mass, with the left thyroid lobe as the focal point measuring 6.3 × 7.3 × 10 cm (highlighted by the arrow) with deviation of the trachea. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】The patient underwent urgent T5 laminectomy with T3-7 fixation. Post-operatively the patient underwent targeted radiotherapy to the spinal lesion site as well as the right iliac fossa mass. Despite urgent surgery and radiotherapy, the patient did not show signs of neurological recovery. Post-surgery and post-radiotherapy, he lost power to his lower limbs, became double incontinent and became wheelchair bound.\n\n【10】Histology of the T5 mass was reported as metastatic FTC.\n\n【11】Endocrine surgeons were consulted and a CT of neck was performed. This revealed a large left-sided thyroid mass with deviation of trachea. Further to his CT, the patient underwent a bone and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. He underwent a total thyroidectomy and left central neck dissection on day 26 of his admission. Pathology was reported as a left-sided 90 × 70 × 70 mm sized moderately differentiated FTC with vascular invasion and nodal spread.\n\n【12】During his post-operative recovery, he was evaluated for RAI treatment. It was deemed that the large right iliac crest metastasis would greatly reduce the efficacy of RAI for his other metastatic disease, so the patient was referred to a specialist orthopedic MDT meeting for surgical resection assessment. Unfortunately the mass could not be safely operated on due to significant neovascularization and the patient underwent cryotherapy embolization via interventional radiology in an attempt to reduce the size and metabolic activity of the metastasis.\n\n【13】Subsequent repeat bone scans showed new areas of macroscopic spread including those in the sternum and the base of the lung, as well as an increase in the size of the iliac metastasis despite embolization. Nuclear medicine was consulted throughout his admission, and after review the decision was made that the patient would not benefit from RAI, so the direction of care was transferred to a palliative approach. After extensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy input the patient was discharged home with ongoing allied healthcare and community palliative care input.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】Thyroid carcinomas as a group are an uncommon cancer and account for approximately 1.5% of cancers in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Of the subtypes previously mentioned, FTC accounts for approximately 10-30% of cases and is classed as a differentiated cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. FTC is characterized by an indolent growth rate and can remain without signs and symptoms beyond metastatic dissemination. Despite this, FTC usually presents as a single thyroid nodule and patients diagnosed at this stage without metastatic spread have an excellent 10-year survival quoted as 85% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Of note, the patient discussed in this case was of Fijian background and had lived in Fiji the majority of his life.\n\n【16】A key component of the pathophysiology of FTC is its ability for early vascular invasion and hematogenous spread to bone and lung. It is estimated that 10-25% of newly diagnosed cases of FTC present with metastatic disease \\[ 8 \\- 11 \\]. The primary patient complaint of bone metastases is usually pain. Although bony metastases are a known complication of FTC, presentation due to cord compression is extremely rare. As a slow growing malignancy, this represents late-stage disease. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression due to a lesion can pose a diagnostic conundrum, whereby thyroid cancer may not be investigated before a histological result is back. This case demonstrates that along with other cancers that readily metastasis to bone, such as breast, lung and prostate, thyroid cancer must also be considered early, clinically assessed and treated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgical resection is advised as the initial treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers such as FTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The choice of lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy depends on factors including size of nodule, multifocal disease and risk factors such as radiation exposure and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. If diagnosed with metastatic disease, the patients are usually discussed in an MDT setting, with additional therapies such as RAI and thyroid hormone suppression being offered to the patient as they have shown to be beneficial to patients with metastatic disease, age > 45 or large primary tumors > 4 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Ten-year survival for these patients has been quoted as 26-60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Therefore, most patients with metastatic disease will initially undergo thyroidectomy and undergo subsequent RAI ablation several weeks later. The result of the orthopedic MDT had ruled out the possibility of surgical resection of the large metastatic iliac mass, which had already undergone external beam radiation and cryoembolization. This meant that RAI would not be effective and so it was not offered to the patient.\n\n【18】A specific issue for the clinicians in this case was the management of the patient’s neurological deficits. Regaining some function to be able to defecate and void urine without assistance as well as the upper body strength development to help with movement increases quality of life in patients, even if no further active measures are indicated for their malignancy. This is best achieved through a spinal rehabilitation facility. Despite compromised survival, patients with malignant spinal cord compression make clinically significant functional gains and exhibit favorable discharge outcomes following inpatient rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, this case highlights the rarity of malignant cord compression from metastatic FTC, its difficulty in management and barriers to discharge. In tandem with other reported cases, this patient presented without significant back pain, symptoms of thyroid disease but with signs of metastatic cord compression. As discussed, these aspects are most likely due to the indolent cancer growth coupled with early vascular invasion and spread. Despite emergent spinal surgery and thyroidectomy, due to the patient’s significant metastatic disease, completion treatment with RAI was not possible. This resulted in a cancer that usually has a good survival even when metastases are present, to a terminal disease for this patient.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was gained prior to completing the case report.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RP and KB both contributed to the conception, writing and editing of the case report.

Patients can present with a range of symptoms from nausea, vomiting to confusion, seizures and loss of consciousness. The condition has been widely reported in the literature amongst endurance athletes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, psychiatric patients \\[ 3 \\- 11 \\] and military recruits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Water intoxication has also been reported in patients preparing for imaging studies that require fluid preparation such as abdominal or pelvic ultrasonography \\[ 14 \\- 18 \\].\n\n【2】Urine flow studies are performed for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and a history of prostate disease as an objective assessment of urinary function. Patients are generally instructed to drink one to two litres of fluid immediately prior to the procedure to fill the bladder in order to perform the study. However, there is limited data from the literature on overhydration leading to symptomatic hyponatraemia with only one report published on water intoxication in the setting of uroflowmetry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. We present a patient from our practice that developed severe symptoms from water intoxication as a result of excessive fluid intake prior to a urine flow study to improve awareness of this potential adverse outcome and stimulate discussion around developing practice guidelines on preventing this condition.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】An 82 year old Caucasian male with a previous history of TURP, AF, hypertension and depression was reviewed for ongoing follow up of chronic lower urinary tract symptoms. His symptoms had worsened since his last visit with his WHO International Prostate Symptom Score rising from 17 to 23 in six months. A flow study was performed and this demonstrated a peak urinary flow of 11.2ml/sec on a voided volume of 142 ml and the ultrasound measured post void residual volume was 100 ml. While preparing for the study the patient consumed approximately three litres of water over four hours.\n\n【5】Several hours after the study his family noticed that the patient had difficulty finding words and was progressively more confused. He was brought to a local emergency department and found to be acutely confused with a GCS of 14. The physical examination was unremarkable aside from an ejection-systolic murmur with prosthetic heart sounds. His serum sodium level on admission was 114 mmol/L (normal range: 135 - 145 mmol/L). There were no acute infarcts or haemorrhage on a non-contrast CT brain scan. The patient was admitted to ICU for management of severe hyponatremia and commenced on an 800ml daily fluid restriction. Mirtazapine and ramipril were withheld during the admission. After several days of slow correction, his alertness and confusion improved. Seven days later he was discharged with a sodium level of 127 mmol/L and a diagnosis of hyponatraemia secondary to excessive fluid hydration exacerbated by tricyclic antidepressant therapy.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】The case presented demonstrates the importance of appropriate counselling when preparing patients for urine flow studies. Patients with predisposing medications or conditions should be warned of the risks of excessive fluid consumption before they begin to prepare for a study. Medications that are commonly known to cause hyponatraemia include diuretics (e.g. thiazides, indapamide, loop diuretics), anti-depressants (SSRIs, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors), anti-psychotics (e.g. haloperidol), anti-convulsants (e.g. sodium valproate, carbemazepine) and anti-neoplastic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】In rare instances, some commonly prescribed medications including ACE-inhibitors, amlodipine, proton-pump inhibitors, amiodarone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin have also been known to cause SIADH-related hyponatraemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure, malignancy, hepatic cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome are at risk of developing hypervolaemic hyponatraemia with a large fluid load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Our patient was on a regular tricyclic antidepressant (mirtazapine) and ACE inhibitor (ramipril) that were both identified as significant contributors to his hyponatraemia. These medications were withheld during his admission until further review by his family practitioner. There was a trend towards mild hyponatraemia on review of his previous biochemistry with a level of 132 mmol/L one month prior to his admission. This demonstrates the complexities of performing urine flow studies in a population with predisposing risk factors. Risk stratification within best practice guidelines will be necessary to identify patients undergoing such studies that would benefit most from tailored fluid intake volumes.\n\n【10】Hyponatraemia from overconsumption of fluid is an underreported adverse outcome of preparation for urinary flow studies with a risk of high morbidity and mortality. There is currently limited guidance on the quantity of water intake recommended for bladder preparation in both urine flow studies and abdominal or pelvic ultrasonography. Previous studies have recommended the need for standardised practice guidelines especially for patients at risk of serum inappropriate ADH syndrome related hyponatraemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The case we have presented provides further evidence of the need for an improvement in current best practice. We recommend that a consensus guideline should be developed for patients undergoing urine flow studies on pre-study fluid consumption to minimise the incidence of future cases as demonstrated in this report.\n\n【11】Grant Support\n\n【12】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Anomalies of the pancreas could involve the pancreatic ductal (major pancreatic duct: Wirsung duct, and minor pancreatic duct: Santorini duct) as well as the extra-ductal system. These anomalies are very uncommon, and its precise incidence rate is yet to be known. Usually, patients with congenital anomalies of the pancreas are asymptomatic, hence the most common presentation is an incidental radiological finding during adulthood period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. On the contrary, sometimes, these anomalies can cause recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis. Therefore, these anomalies should be included in the differential diagnosis as a cause of adult patients with recurrent episodes of idiopathic acute pancreatitis. To a lesser extent, it can present as an unexplained minor gastrointestinal symptom such as recurrent mild upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Due to the high number of radiological imaging tests that had been used during the last two decades, the incidence rate of pancreas anomalies has increased exponentially. This in turn makes physicians, especially radiologists, to become more familiar with such anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The used imaging tests nowadays are highly sensitive for the recognition of these anomalies and include mainly abdomino-pelvic high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although being regarded as a good diagnostic and therapeutic tool for bile and pancreatic ducts diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an invasive procedure which carries a complications risk such as post-ERCP pancreatitis (the most common complication), cholangitis, bleeding, and perforation, with the latter being the least common. Thus, its use for the diagnosis of pancreatic duct anomalies is far less common than the previously mentioned tests.\n\n【3】Pancreatic ductal anatomy can be subjected to multiple variations in course and in configuration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition, duplication anomalies, mainly of the main pancreatic duct, as well as cystic dilation of the terminal portion of the Wirsung and Santorini ducts are well known. Combination anomalies of the aforementioned variations are even rarer and up to date are regarded as unknown and never reported.\n\n【4】Herein, a case of 47-year-old male patient, suffered from recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain due to severe idiopathic pancreatitis is presented. Radiological exams including abdominopelvic CT scan and MRCP revealed an unknown combination anomaly of the pancreatic ducts, with dominant duct of Santorini without divisum and proximal cystic dilation of the Santorini duct. These findings were never reported in the English literature and newly introduced anomaly as “Kluri” anomaly after the names of the authors Kluger and Khuri.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 47-year-old healthy male patient, presented to our emergency department complaining of severe upper abdominal pain. The pain lasted for 6 h, started instantly and was described as diffuse and radiating to the back. He also suffered from general weakness, nausea, recurrent vomiting, and reduced appetite. The patient denied fever, rigors, or another symptom. His past medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, treated by subcutaneous insulin injections and his surgical history was relevant for status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis at age 40 years.\n\n【8】The patient’s background included a history of two admissions during the last year to different peripheral hospitals, due to severe idiopathic necrotizing pancreatitis. During his admissions, patient suffered from severe pancreatitis with multiorgan failure, which necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for several weeks of conservative management. Between the two episodes, the patient complained of continuous upper abdominal pain treated by different narcotics. Few months following the second episode, the patient underwent abdominal MRCP which was consistent with pancreas divisum and 17-mm cystic lesion at the pancreatic head. Moreover, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed cystic dilation of the duct at the pancreatic head up to 17 mm, and a suspicion for main duct intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was raised. Cyst aspiration and cystic fluid analysis for amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was not done for unknown reasons.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Vital signs, upon his admission were within normal limits: blood pressure (BP) 123/86 mm Hg, pulse (P) 76 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 11/min, temperature (T): 36.8 °C. Abdominal examination was consistent for diffuse upper abdominal tenderness without guarding, as well as without palpable masses. Digital rectal examination was normal. A complete blood count showed increased white blood cells of 12,000 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, with 12% band neutrophils. Serum amylase (608 U/L), as well as urine amylase (15,596 U/L) levels were highly elevated. Liver function tests (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs) and arterial blood gases (ABGs) were within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed cystic lesion at the pancreatic head without bile duct dilation or choledocholithiasis. The patient was diagnosed with a recurrent episode of acute pancreatitis and admitted to the General Surgery ward for conservative management by nil per os (NPO), rigorous intravenous (IV) fluids and IV painkillers. Following the initiation of conservative management, the patient felt well and resumed oral intake. Revision of the abdominal MRCP revealed unknown combination anomaly of the pancreatic ducts, with Santorini duct dominance without divisum and cystic dilation of the proximal part of the Santorini duct .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. An abdominal MRCP showing dominant duct of Santorini without divisum (short arrow) and proximal cystic dilation of the proximal part of Santorini duct (long arrow). MRCP: magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】A recent (during current admission) abdomino-pelvic CT scan  revealed findings identical to what have been seen by the abdominal MRCP; dilation in the form of cyst at the proximal Santorini duct along with dominant duct of Santorini without divisum. In addition, Atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail were demonstrated. Other known pancreatitis causes were excluded: the patient negated alcohol consumption or recent abdomino-thorax trauma. Serum triglycerides (following overnight fasting) and calcium levels were within normal limits. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 levels (IgG4-related pancreatitis) were as well within normal levels. As there was no clinical suspicion for an infectious agent (hepatitis A, mumps and others) as a causative agent for acute pancreatitis in our patient, no specific laboratory tests were done. As part of our department protocol, tumor markers, mainly CEA and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) are routine serum tests to be made during the workup program. Serum levels for these tumor markers were within normal limits.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. An abdominopelvic CT scan reveals cystic dilation of the proximal part of Santorini duct (arrow). CT: computed tomography. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】Treatment\n\n【15】In light of the aforementioned findings, the patient was presented at a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDTM), including pancreatic surgeons, gastroenterologists and abdominal radiologists. It was decided, that due to the recurrent episodes of severe acute pancreatitis (necessitating admissions to the ICU) in young patient with radiological proven pancreatic duct anomaly and pancreatic body and tail atrophy, surgical resection with total pancreatectomy would be the best approach. Surgical resection in the form of pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was discussed. Due to the fact that the patient is already known to suffer from DM type 2 treated by insulin injections, and if Whipple procedure to be done, most probably the procedure will be without pancreato-jejunostomy anastomosis due to high risk for postoperative pancreatic fistula (atrophy of the pancreatic texture and non-dilated main pancreatic duct), it was decided to resect the whole pancreas organ.\n\n【16】Six weeks after his discharge, the patient was admitted electively to our surgical ward for operative management. On his admission, the patient denied any complaint and was in stable condition. His physical exam was unremarkable. During the patient’s hospitalization he underwent total pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract by an open approach surgery. His perioperative and postoperative periods were uneventful. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 9, and prescribed Creon (pancreatic enzyme supplements) and subcutaneous insulin injections.\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The patient was followed on our outpatient clinic once per 2 weeks (initially) followed by once/month up to 3 months following discharge. During his follow-up, the patient was doing well with no gastrointestinal or other complaints. The histopathological report was consistent with dilated pancreatic duct at the head, with foci of low-grade Pancreatic Intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Body and tail of the pancreas showed atrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. No evidence of malignancy was reported.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【20】Pancreatic duct anomalies are uncommon gastrointestinal congenital diseases, yet a forgotten cause of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis. Multiple variations of the duct of the pancreas exist and can be at the level of the duct course, duct configuration, duplication anomaly or cystic dilation of the terminal part of the ducts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Combination anomalies of the previously mentioned variations are even rarer.\n\n【21】Although pancreatic duct course can be sigmoidal, vertical or loop, the most common course is the descending one (50%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pancreas divisum is known as the most common pancreatic duct anomaly. The pathogenesis for pancreas divisum is as follow: during the initial weeks of gestation, mainly at the seventh gestational week, the dorsal pancreatic bud (which contribute to the formation of the body, tail and minor part of the head of the pancreas, as well as Santorini duct) fails to fuse with ventral pancreatic bud (forms the majority of the pancreatic head and uncinate process) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The exact incidence rate is unknown yet reported rates of 3-8% and almost 9% found on ERCP and MRCP tests, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Ductal configuration anomalies are uncommon. The most common form of pancreatic duct configuration is the bifid configuration with Wirsung dominant duct (60%), followed by absent duct of Santorini (30%), ansa pancreatica and dominant duct of Santorini without pancreas divisum (1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Ansa pancreatica is an extremely rare pancreatic duct anomaly and is characterized by reversed S-shaped of the Santorini duct which usually connects the Wirsung duct by a side branch.\n\n【22】A rare pancreatic duct anomalies can also include cystic dilation of the ultimate parts of the different pancreatic ducts. These anomalies are known as Wirsungocele, when it involves the last portion of the Wirsung duct, and Santorinicele, when the terminal Santorini duct is dilated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cystic dilation of the proximal part of the pancreatic ducts, as well as combination anomalies have never been reported in the English literature. Herein, we present a new and non-reported combination anomaly of the pancreatic duct; proximal cystic dilation of the Santorini duct with dominant Santorini duct without pancreas divisum. As already mentioned before, these findings were never reported in the English literature and are introduced as “Kluri” anomaly after the names of the authors Kluger and Khuri.\n\n【23】Currently, there is not an established scientific-based consensus regarding the best therapeutic strategy to be followed in treating this unique and uncommon pancreatic anomalies. This is largely due to the fact that pancreatic duct anomalies are very rare. Asymptomatic patients found incidentally do not require usually further therapeutic management. On the other hand, the choice of therapy in symptomatic patients depends usually on several parameters such as frequency, severity and duration of symptoms and the presence/absence of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therapeutic intervention (either endoscopic or surgical) is usually indicated for patients with recurrent mild attacks of pancreatitis or following single attack of severe pancreatitis. The importance of multidisciplinary team approach for such cases should be highly appreciated and routinely advocated. Since our patient is young and suffered recurrent episodes of severe acute pancreatitis, MDTM decision was surgical resection in the form of total pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【24】In conclusion, congenital pancreatic duct anomalies are rare, yet becoming more familiar medical phenomenon among physicians. In the presence of ductal anomaly along with recurrent episodes of severe pancreatitis, MDTM is highly advisable. Authors are encouraged to report such rare cases to gain knowledge of the different characteristics, presentations, and management of such anomalies.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】The main take away points from this case report are to know that pancreatic duct anomalies are rare anomalies, and usually forgotten cause of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis. In addition, due to the recent rise in the use of the highly sensitive abdominal imaging studies for different purposes, physicians are familiar more with these anomalies. In the setting of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis and proven radiological pancreatic duct anomaly, a MDTM is highly recommended. Herein, we introduce a never reported pancreatic duct anomaly, known as “Kluri” anomaly as a cause of recurrent severe pancreatitis.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding sources.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SK contributed to writing as well as for the design of the manuscript.

There is a higher prevalence of no obstructive CAD in women compared to men, and women exhibit a greater symptom burden and more functional disability compared to men \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]. Microvascular Coronary Dysfunction (MCD) is thought to be a key contributory mechanism for myocardial ischemia in women with chest pain and no obstructive CAD. Identification of angina caused by MCD is crucial due to the associated major adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. MCD as a cause of angina also contributes to poor quality of life, morbidity, and health care costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Thus, a thorough evaluation of patients with persistent chest pain is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present the case of a woman with persistent chest pain symptoms following a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and no obstructive CAD documented by angiography. This case highlights the utility of coronary reactivity testing as a diagnostic tool for evaluating cardiac etiologies of persistent chest pain.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 53-year-old female was referred to a tertiary heart center for a second opinion and further evaluation of persistent episodes of chest pain. Her medical history was significant only for hyperlipidemia on statin therapy. She had no additional cardiac risk factors including no history of diabetes, hypertension, or family history of premature CAD. The patient had quit smoking 29 years prior.\n\n【4】Two months prior to presentation she began experiencing left arm tightness and tingling, for which she was hospitalized at an outside center. Her initial ECG showed T-wave abnormalities in an anterior-inferior distribution, with inverted T waves in V1 to V6. Troponin on this hospitalization peaked at 6.35 ng/mL and patient was transferred to an outside facility for further work-up. She underwent coronary angiography that found an LVEDP of 10 mmHg, ejection fraction of 60% with normal wall motion, and open coronary arteries. The patient was discharged home on aspirin 81 mg, clopidogrel, and pravastatin. She visited a cardiologist as an outpatient and was started on metoprolol XL.\n\n【5】One month prior to presentation at our facility she experienced a similar episode, with neck and back pain, and subsequently went to her nearest emergency room. Her ECG on this second visit again showed T wave abnormalities with T-wave inversions in V1 through V3, flattened T waves in V4 through V6, as well as lead III and aVF. There were no ST elevations. A resting 2-D echo showed no wall motion abnormalities and an EF of 73%. Troponin level peaked on this admission at 5.88 ng/mL and she was discharged home pain-free and scheduled for outpatient follow-up.\n\n【6】Six days prior to presentation, the patient was driving with her husband when she developed acute onset of neck and squeezing left arm pain with associated nausea, unrelieved by ibuprofen and minimally relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient ignored the continued pain that persisted, and she was eventually seen at an outside hospital where she was found to have an elevated troponin to approximately 7 ng/mL. Patient was then transferred to a tertiary heart center for further evaluation.\n\n【7】On initial examination she was afebrile, with blood pressure 130/60 mmHg, pulse of 80 bpm, respirations 18, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical exam was unremarkable. ECG and 2-D echocardiogram were unchanged from her prior hospitalization. Laboratory values were notable for a positive factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygote), and an elevated ESR of 27 mm/hr. Given the constellation of persistent chest pain, absence of obstructive CAD, and prior NSTEMI, a diagnosis of MCD was suspected. Adenosine stress MRI showed no perfusion defects and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was discharged on her previous medications with the addition of isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg every morning.\n\n【8】She subsequently underwent coronary reactivity testing (CRT) with intracoronary infusions of adenosine, acetylcholine (Ach), and nitroglycerin (NTG) to test non-endothelial and endothelial micro- and macrovascular coronary function   using previously published methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The Results of the Coronary Reactivity Testing |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】Coronary angiography once again demonstrated no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The right coronary was small with possible scalloping suggestive of luminal irregularities consistent with atherosclerosis. Left ventricular end diastolic filling pressure was elevated at 18 mmHg. CRT was markedly abnormal, with an abnormal coronary flow reserve to intracoronary adenosine at 2.3 (normal is greater than 2.5), and abnormal coronary endothelial function response to acetylcholine with 60% vasoconstriction (normal response is positive dilation). Microvascular endothelial coronary blood flow was calculated to be abnormal at 62% decrease in response to Ach (normal response is greater than 50% increase). There was a normal nitroglycerin response, consistent with normal smooth muscle function of 38% dilation (normal response is greater than 20%). CRT results were consistent with a diagnosis of MCD. The patient was continued on her beta-blocker and nitrates. Given endothelial dysfunction, an ACE inhibitor and a statin were added to her regimen. Due to her positive factor V Leiden and recurrent NSTEMIs she was transitioned from aspirin to warfarin therapy.\n\n【13】Four months later, the patient presented to a community hospital after experiencing nausea and vomiting, and chest pain unrelieved by nitroglycerin. She was found to have a troponin peak of 6.5 ng/mL and INR of 3.2 on admission. Patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip for her persistent chest pain and elevated troponins. After transfer to a facility providing higher-level care, she became stable and chest pain free. Again troponins were down trending, and vital signs, examination, and laboratory values were within normal limits. The patient underwent repeat coronary angiography that showed no obstructive coronary disease, normal LVEDP (8 mmHg), and normal EF (73%), but was noted to have vasospasm of the right coronary ostium during the procedure with a drop in pressure suggestive of a vasospastic response. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed and was negative for myocarditis or an infiltrative process such as sarcoid or amyloid. Given that vasculitis was a possible cause of persistent troponin elevation, she received a vascular workup, including anticardiolipin IgA and IgM, which were negative, and complement C3, C4 levels, which were within normal limits. Similarly, ANA was undetectable. A Russell viper venom and lupus anticoagulant were both negative.\n\n【14】The patient was discharged in stable condition with phase II cardiac rehab and the following changes in her medication regimen. Her beta-blocker was switched to Cardizem given the ostial spasm seen on angiography. She was started on Ranolazine 500 mg twice daily given non-obstructive CAD, presence of MCD, and refractory pain with nitroglycerin. Warfarin was switched back to low-dose aspirin given that her heterozygous factor V Leiden had not produced a thrombotic event, and the coronary protective effects of aspirin. The patient’s symptoms were improved at 1-month follow-up, and she is currently asymptomatic by self- report.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】The etiology of persistent chest pain is not only difficult, but also encompasses a broad array of diagnoses. Too often, once coronary angiography reveals normal or open coronary arteries and patients are usually reassured and discharged with the diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain without further cardiac evaluation. This can lead to adverse effects on quality of life, morbidity, and cost of healthcare. Eighty six percent of patients with continued chest pain and no evidence of CAD were found to have chest pain at least weekly for up to one year post-angiogram, with unchanged or even worsening pain, and with half reporting functional disability including limitations on activities of daily living and/or inability to work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Despite open coronary angiograms, twenty to fifty percent of patients are re-hospitalized for chest pain with an average lifetime cost per patient set at approximately eight hundred thousand dollars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Approximately 50% of women with symptoms of persistent chest pain, evidence of ischemia, and presence of no obstructive CAD have been found to have MCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study group has shown that MCD is prevalent in women with the triad of chest pain, evidence of ischemia by stress testing, and non-obstructive CAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. These women tend to be younger with mean ages in the fifth decade of life (range 21 - 86 years) \\[ 2 \\- 4 , 6 \\]. The diagnosis of MCD is challenging because the coronary microvasculature is not directly visualized during routine coronary angiography. It is the microvasculature however, which is responsible for coronary blood flow regulation and therefore oxygen delivery. Autoregulation involves both endothelial dependent and independent mechanisms. Coronary endothelial dysfunction is an indicator of early atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> and is independently associated with cardiovascular events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Patients with coronary endothelial dysfunction and non-obstructive CAD have an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal major adverse cardiac events including sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. The above case illustrates that although the patient had no detectable ischemia on stress testing, this likely reflects the low sensitivity of the diagnostic modality and not the absence of ischemia, and the cause of her persistent chest pain is, at least in part, due to MCD.\n\n【18】During CRT four measures of coronary vascular autoregulation are assessed: 1) coronary flow reserve (CFR) in response to intracoronary administration of adenosine as an indicator of non-endothelial microvascular function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>; 2) coronary blood flow (CBF) indicative of endothelial microvascular function; 3) coronary artery diameter in response to intracoronary administration of acetylcholine as measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) an indicator of endothelial macrovascular function; and 4) coronary artery diameter in response to intracoronary nitroglycerin as measured by QCA indicative of non-endothelial macrovascular function. Data regarding the safety of CRT has found that this diagnostic modality is at least equal to routine coronary angiogram with approximately 1 in 1,000 risk of serious adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Moreover, because the risk of fatal and non-fatal major adverse cardiac events associated with endothelial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 8 , 17 \\]</u>, and MCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u> is high (up to 2.5%) compared with the risk of serious and/or adverse events with CRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u> (0.7%), patients with the triad of persistent chest pain, objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, and no obstructive CAD should be considered for CRT when the diagnosis is uncertain.\n\n【19】Treatment of MCD can also be challenging due to a lack of universally accepted diagnostic criteria and multiple pathways contributing to the pathophysiology. Goals, as with therapy for obstructive CAD, include controlling debilitating symptoms, improving quality of life, reducing hospitalization incidence and repeat testing, and improving survival. Cardiac rehabilitation can be initiated to minimize symptoms and has been shown to be effective in these patients in increasing exercise capacity and symptom relief 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Statins may improve endothelial function by lipid-independent mechanisms through their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, or like ACEIs and ARBs, through their ability to restore vascular nitric oxide and thus endothelial-dependent relaxation of coronary resistance vessels \\[ 20 \\- 22 \\]. Beta blockade, particularly with atenolol, has been shown to reduce the number and severity of anginal episodes and improve functional capacity in patients with MCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Additional benefit may be seen from agents with alpha-blockade, such as carvedilol, in patients with coronary spasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Recently, a pilot study of Ranolazine, an anti-anginal agent that reduces calcium flow in myocytes through inhibition of the late sodium current, has been shown to improve angina in women with evidence of ischemia but no obstructive CAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. While there are no clinical trials regarding the role of nitrates in patients with MCD, at least observationally, their effects on angina frequency and duration can be unpredictable in these patients. Similarly, the use of calcium channel blockers for management of MCD is not yet supported by evidence, although it is first line therapy for vasospastic angina and has been shown to improve exercise capacity and chest pain in patients with no obstructive CAD and limited vasodilatory reserve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】In conclusion, this case highlights the clinical importance and challenges of diagnosing MCD. In women with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia, NSTEMI, and no obstructive CAD, MCD may be a mechanism leading to symptoms. It is therefore important to identify and diagnose in the appropriate clinical setting, as MCD is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, MCD is the presumable cause of symptoms that can lead to repeated testing, hospitalization, and disability, creating substantial economic, physical, and emotional hardships 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is imperative that clinicians are aware of this condition, as early identification of MCD by CRT in the appropriate clinical setting may be beneficial in prognostication and/or stratification of these patients for optimal medical therapy.\n\n| Grant Support | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【22】This work was supported by contracts from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, nos.

CMV pneumonitis is an unpredictable, life-threatening infection especially in immunocompromised hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. There have been 13 published cases of IBD complicated by CMV pneumonitis, 10 of which were in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Of these 10, five were on steroid treatment (50%), and all were on various combinations of mesalazine (5-ASA), azathioprine, cyclosporine A and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These cases are in line with studies of opportunistic infection risk in IBD patients, which has been linked to treatment with immunosuppressive medications (odds ratio (OR): 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-5.3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】We report a case of CMV pneumonitis complicating quiescent CD, in a patient treated with 6-MP. Furthermore, this case describes a sequential infection with adenovirus (ADV) following the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis (“domino” effect), an aspect of infection in immunocompromised individuals that should be considered.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 24-year-old male with quiescent CD, presented with a 4-day history of fever (< 39 °C), rigors and fatigue, while he also reported an increase in seropurulent fluid effusing from two known fistulae located in his right lower abdominal quadrant. His past medical history was significant for CD of the terminal ileum, as diagnosed histologically 3 years prior. His treatment over the 6 months preceding admission consisted of 6-MP, and occasional corticosteroids.\n\n【5】On admission, the patient was ill-looking, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 68 beats/min and an axillary temperature of 38.6 °C. Clinical examination was significant for mild splenomegaly and seropurulent effusion oozing from the fistulae. Laboratory tests  were significant for increased lactate dehydrogenase (449 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (11.8 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray (CXR) and abdominal CT were unrevealing.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Schematic representation of lab values, CMV serology and treatment regimens through the course of disease. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】After blood and fistulae culture samples were obtained, the patient was empirically put on ciprofloxacin 400 mg bid iv and metronidazole 500 mg tid iv . Twenty-four hours later, white blood cell count declined (1.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor was started, in order to manage a supposed bone marrow suppression due to 6-MP.\n\n【8】Over the next 5 days, the patient’s condition worsened. Fever persisted (≤ 41 °C), he developed nonproductive cough and bilateral lung base crackles could be heard on auscultation. Repeat CXR revealed reticulo-micronodular infiltrates of the right lung base , and subsequent chest CT confirmed a bilateral ground glass appearance and small right pleural effusion. Significant pancytopenia and markedly elevated liver function tests, and mild hypoxemia were present. The initial viral serology tests performed on day 3 (including CMV, Coxsackie, EBV, hepatitis A/B/C viruses, HIV, HSV1/2 and VZV), and serology tests for M. pneumoniae, Toxoplasma and Leptospira , came back negative. Bronchoscopy showed no signs of inflammation, while Gram, Ziehl-Nielsen, PCP-silver stain were negative, as were cultures for common and opportunistic pathogens.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Patient imaging studies. (A) Chest X-ray on day 5. Reticulo-micronodular infiltrates at the right lung base. (B) Chest X-ray on day 12.

Extensive central bilateral infiltrates, including atelectatic lesions and pleural effusions are depicted bilaterally. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】Based on clinical examination and given the underlying IBD and 6-MP immunosuppressant therapy, current differential diagnosis considered etiologies of abdominal infection leading to the enterocutaneous fistulae copiously effusing seropurulent fluid, such as E. coli, Enterococci and Bacteroides spp . Respiratory findings were tentatively attributed to a possible atypical pulmonary infection ( Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila ). Antibiotic therapy was changed to cover the most likely causative pathogens, while low pulse and borderline QT-prolongation (QTc: 0.442 sec) despite the patient’s high temperature, was attributable to the use of moxifloxacin (which was subsequently discontinued).\n\n【11】On day 8 following admission, the patient’s respiratory status further deteriorated (arterial blood gases, on room air: pH 7.44, pO <sub>2 </sub> 54 mmHg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 23 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> 17 mEq/L), and continuous positive airway pressure was introduced to maintain O <sub>2 </sub> saturation > 90%. At this time, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (both susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin) were respectively isolated from the two separate enterocutaneous fistula cultures taken during initial assessment. New laboratory serology was also positive for Coxiella IgM and rheumatoid factor (104 IU/mL; reference range < 20 IU/mL).\n\n【12】Given the temperature elevation, accompanying severe hypoxemia, reticulo-micronodular infiltrates at the right lung base, elevated serum transaminases, pancytopenia, an elevated RF, and positive C. burnetti IgM antibodies, the differential diagnosis included viral pulmonary infections, along with atypical pneumonia ( M. pneumoniae, C. burnetti pneumonia, non-icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Ricketsiae ). Thus, the therapeutic scheme was switched to doxycycline 200 mg uid per os, ceftriaxone 2 g qd iv, linezolid 600 mg bid iv (to enhance the therapeutic effect in abdominal tissue and fistulae) and metronidazole 500 mg tid iv; amphotericin 320 mg/day was continued to cover against possible fungal superinfection due to prolonged hospitalization and antibiotic use. Intravenous immunoglobulin 400 mg/kg/day was also initiated as compassionate treatment of a possible viral illness for which no confirmatory results were available, given that the patient did not demonstrate signs of improvement. Furthermore, based on the presence of pancytopenia, positive C. burnetti serology and RF (which can be false-positive in systemic CMV infection, due to rosette formation from viral-specific IgM antibodies), we were on alert for evolution of radiologic findings, in favor of an underlying CMV pneumonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Indeed, as the patient’s condition persisted, a repeat CXR at day 12 showed bilateral ascending reticulonodular infiltrates expanding from basal bronchopulmonary segments (from the costophrenic angles) towards the hila and upper lobes . Chest CT scan confirmed extensive central bilateral infiltrates, including atelectasic lesions and pleural effusions . The above clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings were strongly suggestive of CMV pneumonitis; thus, intravenous foscarnet (6 g bid/d) was initiated. Foscarnet was selected over ganciclovir, due to existing pancytopenia and effectiveness against possible resistant CMV strains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therapy to cover for atypical pneumonia was continued until a definitive diagnosis could be reached. Additionally, clindamycin 600 mg qid iv and primaquine were prescribed to cover against a possible emerging superinfection with PCP, since CMV and PCP commonly co-exist in immunocompromised hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>; only the former was initiated due to non-availability of primaquine.\n\n【14】Within 48 h, serum laboratory results showing CMV IgM(+)/IgG(+), pp65 antigen(+) and CMV-PCR 13,850 copies/mL were obtained confirming the clinical diagnosis of CMV pulmonary infection .\n\n【15】However, after 5 days of appropriate antiviral therapy, the patient remained febrile, even as the purulent effusion from the fistulae ceased. Thus, this round of differential diagnosis included hospital acquired infection following bronchoscopy, infection with a resistant CMV strain, ADV co-infection, or drug-related fever. White blood cell count exhibited an increase at 6.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, despite persisting anemia and thrombocytopenia. Antibacterial coverage was altered to cover against frequent hospital acquired pathogens of our institution, and linezolid was switched back to vancomycin in order to avoid further thrombocytopenia.\n\n【16】Over the next 2 weeks, the patient’s condition markedly improved. However, the ADV antibody screen came back positive (IgM 28.6 AU (ref. range < 11 AU) and IgG 41.6 AU (ref. range < 11 AU)). Thus, fever was attributed to concomitant ADV infection. At this point, given the patient’s restored blood count, persisting hypokalemia and possible effectiveness against ADV (based on in vitro susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>), antiviral medication was switched to gancyclovir 400 mg bid iv. Finally, the patient was discharged in good health on day 34, having completed 21 days of antiviral therapy.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】CMV in CD most frequently manifests as colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. CMV pneumonitis has been reported in 10 CD patients, as reviewed by Cascio et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u>, while it is rarer in ulcerative colitis \\[ 4 , 12 \\- 20 \\]. Hookey et al reported a similar case to the presented patient, where a 19-year-old student with quiescent CD under therapy with 6-MP, developed CMV pneumonitis with a favorable outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In a later case report, van Langerberg et al also noted a patient with quiescent CD under azathioprine presenting with persistent CMV respiratory infection, further complicated with hemophagocytic syndrome, and finally resolving under ganciclovir and anti-MAP ( Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. These two cases were diagnosed with CMV pneumonitis while CD was in remission, similar to our report.\n\n【19】Immunosuppressant agents such as thiopurines (AZA and 6-MP) induce myelotoxicity in patients with IBD with an incidence rate of 4-7%, most frequently during the first months following initiation of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>. It seems that the incidence of infections in this population, due to AZA/6MP-induced myelotoxicity is quite similar (6.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Toruner et al have shown that use of AZA/6MP for IBD is significantly associated with increased risk for opportunistic infection (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.0-7.0). Interestingly, AZA/6MP were most commonly related to opportunistic viral infections such as VZV, HSV, EBV and CMV, attributable to compromise of T-lymphocytic antiviral activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We also present a possible association with confirmed ADV infection in the patient.\n\n【20】Multiple tests can be employed to diagnose CMV infection. Histology/cytology has long been the cornerstone of diagnosis, since cytomegalic intranuclear (owl’s eye) inclusions in tissue are pathognomonic for CMV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Rapid CMV culture (shell vial culture, e.g. of blood samples) has largely replaced this method, along with conventional culture, as a more practical choice with reduced reporting time and increased sensitivity \\[ 26 \\- 29 \\]. Blood culture has high specificity of 89-100%, but a still low sensitivity compared to antigen (pp65) and PCR tests, which are now widely employed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 31 \\]</u>. Antigen detection of virus protein pp65 in circulating leukocytes provides high sensitivity and specificity in CMV diagnosis; however, skilled personnel is required, and it is of limited value when the patient is leukopenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 32 \\]</u>. Real-time PCR to detect CMV DNA is a quantitative technique with great sensitivity, which provides a good estimate of the systemic viral load and correlates well with pp65 antigenemia and clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Of note, the variable subset of immunocompromised patients (e.g. liver transplant, solid organ transplant, stem cell recipients, HIV) requires for different levels of measured viral copies/mL to be set for each group as cut-offs that determine infection status, hence complicating diagnosis. Although serologic tests also have relatively high sensitivity and specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>, they were not helpful in this case with respect to early virus detection, since 7 days following the onset of symptoms CMV IgM antibodies remained negative. Possible explanations for this include: 1) antibody measurement at an early stage of the course of infection and 2) inability of the immunocompromised host to mount an adequate IgM response. A delay in the culmination of the antibody response has been previously described in immunocompromised individuals infected by CMV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect fluorescent antibody test and complement fixation test may show false-positive results or cross-reactivity when samples are positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. The issue of cross-reactivity between infections, especially when clinical manifestations are similar remains to be further resolved. Samples from patients infected with Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella , Leptospira , and Coxiella burnetti are frequently RF-positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Several studies \\[ 14 , 37 \\- 42 \\] imply cross-reactivity, while in certain cases the persistence of antibody from previous infection cannot safely be ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>. A combined IgM and IgA determination method for C. burnetti has been shown to improve the specificity in the diagnosis of acute Q fever with no cross-reactivity with the sera of patients with CMV and Ebstein-Barr infections, although cross-reactivity was observed with M. pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. In our case, by utilizing a series of methods we confirmed the clinical diagnosis and monitored therapeutic efficacy. Interestingly, CMV viral load estimated by real-time PCR at the time of diagnosis was 13,850 copies/mL, and was markedly reduced to 700 copies/mL following 11 days of antiviral therapy .\n\n【22】ADV infections are most commonly reported in the transplant population, particularly in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients, reaching an incidence of 5-89% \\[ 44 \\- 47 \\]. Mortality rates associated with ADV infection among transplant recipients range from 2 to 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. ADV co-infection is common with Candida, CMV and bacterial infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ADV infection to be reported in the presence of concomitant CD and developing CMV pneumonitis. The presentation of a “domino” ADV infection in a clinically improving, albeit persistently febrile, patient was in accordance with our experience in other immunosuppressed patients.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The presented patient demonstrates the difficulty of setting the final diagnosis in a complicated case. Early diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis requires a high index of suspicion in deteriorating febrile patients, in the presence of pancytopenia, elevated serum liver enzymes, hypoxemia and ascending-bilateral chest infiltrates, especially when accompanied by positive rheumatoid factor and/or C. burnetti serology. Diagnostic confirmation of CMV infection (virus-specific IgM antibodies, pp65 and PCR) may come later on, making the early recognition/management of respective cases an important approach to consider, especially among immunocompromised patients. Finally, among the immunocompromised population, a “domino” effect in the emergence of consecutive infections should be anticipated; this calls for the treating physician to be alert and astute so that new infections are promptly diagnosed and managed.\n\n【25】Declaration of Interests\n\n【26】No funding was received.

While there are several case reports on CAP due to P. aeruginosa in previously healthy hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>, only one report described a patient with anorexia nervosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Here, we report a case of fulminant CAP due to P. aeruginosa in young woman with anorexia nervosa who died within several days.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 29-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with general malaise. She was in good health until the previous day. Her past medical history included anorexia nervosa for 11 years, and her body mass index was 11 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . She had never been a smoker and had no family history of tuberculosis. She denied using any hot tubs, whirlpools or home humidifiers. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate, 65 beats per minute; blood pressure, 80/55 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 98% (room air) and temperature, 35.9 °C. On physical examination, no rale was heard but her sputum was bloody.\n\n【4】Laboratory tests showed remarkable leukocytopenia (1,300 cells/μL) and thrombocytopenia (60,000 cells/μL). The result of the human immunodeficiency virus serologic test was negative. Beta-D glucan measurement was negative. The chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed consolidation in the right upper lobe with a cavity . In the 6 h since her arrival in the emergency department, her respiration deteriorated rapidly. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. The chest X-ray (a) and computed tomography (CT) (b) on admission showed consolidation in the right upper lobe with a cavity. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】She was diagnosed to have septic shock due to CAP. The sputum Gram stain showed numerous gram-negative rods, few gram-positive cocci, few gram-positive rods and rare leukocytes . The urinary antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were negative.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. The sputum Gram stain on admission showed numerous gram-negative rods and rare leukocytes. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】She received meropenem and pazufloxacin, considering the possibility of CAP due to P. aeruginosa . High doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin were necessary to treat severe hypotension. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for hyperkalemia and progressive metabolic acidosis. During the first 8 h after admission, airway hemorrhage as much as 1,400 mL occurred. Bronchoscopy showed massive hemorrhage coming up to the tracheal tube, which required massive transfusion and high positive end expiratory pressure (18 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O). As the dynamic CT scan revealed no extravasation and the hemorrhage ceased until day 2 of hospitalization, bronchial artery embolization was not performed.\n\n【9】Despite the intensive care mentioned above, the patient’s condition worsened progressively. The consolidation on the chest radiograph was localized to the right upper field on admission but extended to almost all lung fields . She died on day 4 of hospitalization. The blood and sputum cultures showed P. aeruginosa susceptible to meropenem and pazufloxacin.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. The consolidation extended to almost all lung fields on the day 4 of hospitalization. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】This case suggested two clinically important issues. Anorexia nervosa can be a risk factor for CAP due to P. aeruginosa . Gram-negative rods found in the sputum Gram stain can lead to immediate administration of antipseudomonal drugs in CAP patients requiring admission to the ICU.\n\n【13】Firstly, anorexia nervosa can be a risk factor for CAP due to P. aeruginosa . P. aeruginosa is a rare pathogen that causes CAP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>. Several risk factors have been reported for CAP due to P. aeruginosa such as probable aspiration, previous hospital admission, previous use of antibiotics, pulmonary comorbidity, male sex and pneumonia severity index risk class IV to V 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Although the present case had no known risk factors listed above, she had suffered from anorexia nervosa for 11 years. There are several reports of patients with anorexia nervosa who developed pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, pulmonary aspergillosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u> or mycobacterial infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Because malnutrition from anorexia nervosa has negative effects on immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, anorexia nervosa may be a risk factor of CAP due to P. aeruginosa .\n\n【14】Several cases of CAP due to P. aeruginosa in patients without these risk factors have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. A study using the administrative database of the Department of Veterans Affairs showed that only one-third of patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa had at least one of the following risk factors: prior oral corticosteroid use in COPD, prior antibiotic use and bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In terms of severity, the condition of the presented patient was fulminant. Mortality was higher in patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa than that in patients with CAP due to other pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Among patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa , a fulminant variant in previously healthy patients was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This review of the literature on P. aeruginosa CAP in 12 previously healthy adults showed that the mortality rate was 33%, and the median time between hospital admission and death was only 11 h among the non-survivors. Although the mechanism causing a fatal variant of CAP due to P. aeruginosa is uncertain, necrotizing pneumonia with gram-negative rods invading the walls of alveolar blood vessels may contribute to its rapid progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. The present case had massive hemoptysis, suggesting necrotizing pneumonia.\n\n【16】Secondly, gram-negative rods on the sputum Gram stain can lead to immediate administration of antipseudomonal drugs in CAP patients requiring admission to the ICU. The current guidelines for CAP stratify initial antimicrobial therapies according to P. aeruginosa risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. As mentioned above, risk factors for CAP due to this pathogen, however, have not been completely understood. As a result, many patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa receive inappropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment, resulting in high mortality rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although a sputum Gram stain may be a useful tool to decide the initial antimicrobial treatment in CAP, the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines on CAP recommend a pre-treatment Gram staining of sputum only if a good quality sputum specimen can be obtained and the quality performance measures for collection, transport and processing of samples can be met. In the present case of severe CAP without known risk factors for P. aeruginosa , the gram-negative rods in sputum were a key to choose an antipseudomonal drug. A case report on two cases of fulminant CAP due to P. aeruginosa suggested that gram-negative rods in sputum microscopy should be considered as a clue for an early diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A recent study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> assessing the usefulness of sputum Gram staining in the etiologic diagnosis of CAP showed that sputum Gram staining was highly specific for CAP due to P. aeruginosa (99.8%) in spite of the low sensitivity (22.2%). The result indicated that physicians should consider using antipseudomonal drugs when gram-negative rods are observed in the sputum of a patient with CAP regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors for P. aeruginosa .\n\n【18】The patient in the present case died within 4 days despite administration of antipseudomonal drugs.

Actinomycosis can involve almost any organ system but actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall is rare and follows recent abdominal organ surgery. We describe herein a rare primary anterior abdominal wall actinomycosis without abdomional organ involvement.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 50-year-old male complained of chest pain and an 8 cm sized mass in the right lower lateral chest wall that he had fist noticed 6 years previous to admission. There were no remarkable findings in his family and past history. His vital signs were stable and the results of routine blood tests were within normal ranges. Computer tomography (CT) indicated an 8 cm sized mass in the right lower hemithorax with extension of the right abdominal wall . An isotope bone scan showed an increased hot uptake in the 9th rib . We recommended preoperative culture and biopsy of the mass but the patient refused and wanted surgery for correct diagnosis and complete removal of mass . A 10 cm transverse skin incision was made on his mass area in the left lateral position under general anesthesia. There were inflammatory change on muscle, ribs and diaphragm. En bloc resection including latissimus dorsi muscle, external oblique muscle, intercostal muscles including 9th and 10th ribs and a partial portion of diaphragm was made. And direct closures of the diaphragm and abdominal wall defects were possible without prosthetic material. The cut surface of the resected specimen showed several necrotic areas in the fibrotic background on gross appearance. Microscopically, tangled clumps of filamentous organisms were found in the neutrophilic abscess. The filaments had a radial distribution. Neutrophils were adherent to the periphery of the colonies of organisms . The microorganisms were consistent with diagnosis of actinomycosis. The patient was discharged on the seventh day after the operation following an uneventful recovery. The patient has been receiving minocycline for three months now due to positive penicillin skin test.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In healthy subjects, Actinomyces is a part of normal flora of the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the genital tract. Healthy mucosa acts as a barrier to the spread of the organism, but tissues damaged by neoplasm, surgery, trauma, or foreign body allow multiplication and spread of actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Actinomycosis most commonly affects the head and neck (50%) but can involve almost any organ system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Abdominopelvic actinomycosis is uncommon and typically follows recent bowel surgery such as procedures for acute appendicitis, diverticulitis or abdominal trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Primary actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall is very rare and has been reported only in 29 cases in the literature by 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Immunocompromised status, such as diabetes mellitus, steroid therapy, and neoplasm, is a significant predisposing factor for actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Patients usually present with a slowly developing indolent swelling of the soft tissue. The disease usually presents as a slowly growing mass with eventual formation of sinuses discharging serosanguinous pus containing “sulfur” granules, which represent macrocolonies of actinomyocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The “sulfur” granules are pathognomonic, but these are not always present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In most cases, clinical and diagnostic exams are not able to identify the disease and therefore the treatment becomes complex. Hematological laboratory exams show elevated non specific inflammatory markers and serology is not diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ultrasonography, computed tomography or MRI do not suffice to differentiate between actinomycosis and other inflammatory or neoplastic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】It is also very difficult to isolate the bacterium from cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Negative culture rate was reported to be 76% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most difficult task for the management of actinomycosis is to reach a diagnosis before a surgical approach. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of non-specific clinical, laboratory and imaging findings. In many cases, the diagnosis is often possible during surgical exploration or after extensive debulking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This is the reason why a wide primary resection including the surrounding tissue is inevitable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Operative management is required for diagnostic biopsy or total excision.\n\n【13】Surgery is necessary in many cases, especially when the mass is large or there are some complications such as peritonitis, compression of abdominal organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Surgery is also necessary when there is no benefit and general health conditions deteriorate after a week of antibiotic treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The treatment of choice is proper surgical drainage at the primary site of infection. If a soft tissue tumor is suspected, a wide primary resection including the surrounding tissue is sometimes inevitable. The abdominal wall defect may be closed by prosthetic mesh if the abdominal wall defect is large and direct closure is impossible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Surgical treatment without antibiotic therapy is not always sufficient to achieve a cure for actinomycosis. When antibiotic therapy is combined with surgery, it is relatively simple to treat and the cure rate is more than 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Intravenous penicillin is the initial therapy of choice. In the case of penicillin allergy, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin or minocycline are acceptable alternatives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.

Isolated cases of keratitis, endophthalmitis, central nervous system infections, sinusitis, otitis media, prostatitis, cholangitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Spinal involvement with osteomyelitis due to Abiotrophia is extremely rare. We report a case of bacteremia and vertebral osteomyelitis associated with Abiotrophia adiacens .\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】A 62-year-old male patient presented with a history of few weeks of constant mid back pain after an accidental fall. He had noticed several episodes of fever and chills associated with the pain. He had no bowel, urinary complaint or other symptoms. He was on medications for his hypertension. The patient did not have any predisposing factors including diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, immune suppression or malignancy. The patient denied any dental procedure or any other surgery done recently. He does not smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. The patient is retired and lives with his wife. On examination, the lower thoracic spine was tender to firm palpation. The patient did not have any dental caries. Sensory and motor examination was intact in all extremities. The remainder of the clinical examination was grossly unremarkable with no possible source of infection.\n\n【6】The culture from blood was taken, which later grew A. adiacens (two out of two bottles). Susceptibility testing later revealed that the bacterium was sensitive to penicillin, oxacillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, clindamycin, linezolid and levofloxacin but resistant to gentamicin. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) however ruled out vegetation on the heart valves. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed phlegmonous changes at T10-T12 in the epidural space and paravertebral regions consistent with osteomyelitis and compression fracture at T11.\n\n【7】A diagnosis of diskitis/osteomyelitis was made based on the imaging results. Laminectomy with fusion surgery of T9-L2 vertebrae was done followed by complex wound closure. Bone culture from the T11 vertebral body was sent which revealed no organism. Patient was initially started on ampicillin and later changed to vancomycin as patient developed interstitial nephritis. The patient was treated with 6 weeks of intravenous vancomycin. Patient was transferred to acute rehabilitation unit for restoring baseline functional capacity. His symptoms resolved during his stay in the hospital. The repeat blood culture indicated no bacterial growth. The MRI result after completion of treatment showed fragmented T11 vertebral body and hyperintensity with in the T11 vertebral body.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Abiotrophia species have formerly been referred to as NVS because of their particular nutritional growth requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This species should be suspected when Gram stains of specimens reveal microbial cells but cultures are negative. Supplementation of laboratory media is desirable and often necessary to encourage the growth of these organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Bacterial pathogens can reach the spine by different routes and hematogenous spread is the most common route. The organisms reach the vertebral body first and then spread to the disk space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. At times the presentation could be misleading, as in our patient who came after the fall accident, and one would think fracture as the main differential diagnosis. Therefore obtaining a microbiological diagnosis is mandatory in vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Spinal infections are commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, and in approximately one-third of patients the infective organisms cannot be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cases of Abiotrophia infection may be misdiagnosed as culture-negative infections due to its fastidious nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, two out of two bottles from peripheral blood grew the bacteria, thus laboratory contamination was unlikely.\n\n【12】Literature review indicated that there are extremely few cases that have been reported to date with spinal infection due to Abiotrophia species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8-10 \\]</u>. The organism was identified only from blood culture for almost all cases. In one case, diagnosis was confirmed by identification of A. adiacens from infected disk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our patient, Abiotrophia vertebral osteomyelitis was documented by the growth and culture of the organism from blood.\n\n【13】Different data suggest that NVS account for 5-6% of microbial endocarditis cases and may be an essential cause of culture-negative endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Abiotrophia endocarditis carries higher morbidity and mortality than endocarditis caused by other streptococci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although vegetations seemed to be comparatively small, embolization was common. These infections proved difficult to treat with a relapse rate of 17% and a bacteriologic failure rate of 41% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Abiotrophia bacteremia has been reported along with endocarditis in most cases, but in our patient TEE has revealed normal study with no vegetation.\n\n【14】Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates should be done for detecting drug resistance and selecting appropriate therapy. In those patients with suboptimal response to initial therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics, treatment with vancomycin should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Our patient was treated with 6 weeks of vancomycin. The post-treatment MRI of spine showed signs of osteomyelitis; however, the patient’s symptoms improved with antibiotic and rehab services.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Although infection with Abiotrophia species is rare, clinicians should be aware of this highly aggressive organism. We understand that diagnosing infection with this fastidious microorganism might be challenging, therefore high index of suspicion is essential for adequate diagnosis and treatment. We believe reporting this case would contribute to increasing awareness about this organism among health care professionals.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

He had no other complaints. The physical examination revealed a 5/6 cm, round, palpable smooth mass in subcutaneous tissue of the right upper thigh.\n\n【5】Laboratory results which include renal and liver function tests showed that a haemoglobin level, a total leukocyte count and differentiation, were in the normal range. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 6 mm/h and C-reactive protein, 0.144 mg/dL (normal, 5 mg/dL) was detected. ELISA test for cyst hydatid IgG was negative.\n\n【6】Ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass, 6 × 4 cm in diameter in the lateral muscular plans which was compatible with a haematoma or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right upper thigh showed a cystic mass with multiple fine septa which was hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images with an 4 × 4 × 4 cm dimension .

Albendazole therapy was administered for two months postoperatively.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Although some authors report an incidence of musculoskeletal echinococcosis including involvement of subcutaneous tissue as 0.5-4.7% among all cases of hydatid disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, this statement is not clear because musculoskeletal cyst hydatid disease is a rare clinical condition even in the region where this zoonosis is endemic. It has been hypothesized that the reason for rarity of primary muscle localization could be due to bypassing through precapillary anastomosis (between pre and post parenchyma circulation) in liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Though the muscle environment is not favourable for hydatid cysts the volume of the muscle mass and its excessive blood supply could explain the rare localization in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs.\n\n【14】Preoperative diagnosis of the musculoskeletal hydatid cyst is difficult. Routine laboratory investigations are of little help. The sensitivity of various serological tests used for hydatid disease varies from 64 to 87% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Hydatid serology is only valuable when it is positive, negative serologic test does not exclude the diagnosis.

The postoperative period was complicated with acute lung rejection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism (treated with high dose glucocorticoids, antibiotics and anticoagulation). She developed chronic renal failure in relation to CI nephrotoxicity. Her maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Her prophylaxis included inhaled amphotericin B lipid complex, colistimethate and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. In March 2014, she was admitted for gastroenteritis and treated with ciprofloxacin and fluids. No lesions were found in endoscopic study and colonic biopsies were unremarkable. The CMV load blood assay revealed 36,000 copies/mL. Valganciclovir was added and mycophenolate mofetil was switched to mycophenolic acid with clinical improvement. In a follow-up visit in May 2014, spirometry showed decline in lung volumes and a bronchofibroscopy was performed. The patient missed next visits and stopped anticoagulation on her own. On July 2014, she was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, cough, sputum and malaise for the last 2 weeks. On examination, she was tachypneic, and had BP of 105/63 mm Hg and HR of 97 bpm; lung auscultation showed crackles on the lower half of the right lung and rhonchi bilaterally. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio 210 and chest X-Ray showed a right lung hypodensity . Blood sample analysis revealed Hb 11.5 g/dL, leucocytes 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, 9.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L neutrophils, 0.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L lymphocytes, 249 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L platelets, urea/creatinine 126/2.59 mg/dL, Na <sup>+ </sup> 126 mEq/L, K <sup>+ </sup> 5.6 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase 338 U/L, and C-reactive protein 176 mg/L. A diagnosis of pneumonia was made. Reviewing the patient previous medical records, on routine bronchial lavage performed on May, Aspergillus fumigatus was identified on mycologic sample and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. fumigatus and CMV were positive. Transbronchial biopsy was not suggestive of rejection. She was admitted to intensive care unit and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and voriconazol. The mycophenolic acid was suspended. A thoracic tomography scan (CT) revealed moderate loculated pleural effusion , and several areas of consolidation. Thoracentesis was performed and an exudative pleural fluid, rich in neutrophils with pH 7.3 was drained. On the second day, tacrolimus level was 68 ng/mL (range 5 - 20 mg/dL), probably in relation to interaction with voriconazol, and it was suspended. In the next days, the patient evolved with multiple organ dysfunctions: neurologic (normal brain CT), respiratory (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was started) and electrical, with two episodes of atrial fibrillation. Due to clinical deterioration, high dose intravenous methylprednisolone was started for a possible acute rejection beyond infection. Renal failure progressed and patient started hemodialysis on the third day. At that moment, all the blood cultures were negative as well as the mycologic and bacteriologic cultures of pleural effusion. The PCR assay to A. fumigatus was negative but the PCR for CMV was positive in different pleural fluid samples. Blood CMV PCR showed 42,000 copies/mL. Ganciclovir was associated.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest X-ray showing right hypodensity. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2.

A TMA, probably related to tacrolimus high levels, was identified and plasma exchange was initiated on the eighth day. Tacrolimus levels remained over therapeutic range until the ninth day. On the 11th day, due to unresponsiveness, plasma exchange was intensified to twice daily, without success, and on the 14th day, the patient died.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】The two main complications of lung transplant are rejection and infection. Differential diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in the cases when both entities coexist. This patient was initially treated for pneumonia and later, received high dose corticosteroids to a possible acute rejection. When the immunophenotyping of pleural effusion became available, it was not suggestive of rejection and the patient had no conditions for transbronchial biopsy.\n\n【9】At 6 months of transplant, opportunistic pathogens, as well as community and hospital acquired organisms have to be considered. In our patient, microbiologic results prior to admission suggested pulmonary aspergillosis and so voriconazol was started.\n\n【10】The CIs are essential components of maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation. They are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A and a variety of drug interactions can occur, namely with voriconazol, increasing the tacrolimus levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There may be multiple mechanisms for toxic drug-mediated kidney injury. The CI (such as tacrolimus) can cause endothelial dysfunction and increased platelet aggregation possibly through the inhibition of prostacyclin. They also inhibit the VEGF function in renal endothelial cells and podocytes and cause gradual development of glomerular TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This toxicity seems to be dose- and time-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Tacrolimus-associated TMA is a rare, but potentially fatal, complication in solid organ transplantation, with an estimated incidence of 1-4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. In lung transplant, the estimated incidence is 2.3%, but only four case series and 11 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 8 \\]</u>. Fifty percent of cases occurred during concurrent disease as in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In a recent review, a survival rate of 38.9% was described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>; however, in the majority of case reports, TMA is associated with a favorable prognosis and managed with suspension or only dose reduction of CI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. In our case, tacrolimus was stopped, plasma exchange was started and intensified but still without success. Prolonged toxic levels and severe concurrent disease may had been contributing factors for the adverse outcome in our patient.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】As lung transplant is a growing reality, physicians should be alert to potential complications. TMA is a rare complication of CI, which in our case was more severe than the previously described in literature. Prolonged tacrolimus toxic levels and concomitant infection might have contributed.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Abdominal X-ray  supported the diagnosis and CT scan revealed that the caecum was hugely distended (12 cm), although there was no clear cut off point. Prompt surgical review raised the suspicion of impending caecal perforation. Rectal examination and rigid sigmoidoscopy showed collapsed rectum which made the possibility of pseudo-obstruction less likely. Emergency laparotomy was performed. Intra-operative findings showed rotation of the caecum over itself resulting in a sharp twist on the ascending colon with patches of necrosis and serosal tears of the caecum.

Both are predisposing factors for caecal volvulus.\n\n【9】Presentation of volulus is uncommon in adulthood and recognition during pregnancy and puerperium is often delayed, which can lead to serious morbidity and mortality. Reports on caecal volvulus mortality rate show a 12% rate in patients with viable caecum compared to 33% if the caecum was gangrenous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The usual presentation of distension and pain can mimic more familiar conditions after cesarean section such as paralytic ileus and pseudo-obstruction. Paralytic ileus is common following cesarean sections complicated by postpartum hemorrhage and repeat Cesarean Section with adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. High index of suspicion is a key factor to early correct diagnosis.\n\n【10】The classical radiological features of caecal volvulus are: comma-shaped caecal shadow in mid-abdomen or to the left upper quadrant in supine abdominal X-Ray and single long fluid level on erect film.\n\n【11】The treatment is surgical, and laparotomy is necessary in most patients. Right hemi -colectomy is the treatment of choice. It eliminates all risks or recurrence and has small risk of leak. Other procedures, if the caecum is viable, are caecostomy and caecopexy. However there are associated risks of abdominal wall sepsis, fasciitis, recurrence (0-25%) and mortality (0-33%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】It demonstrates the importance of having an open mind when evaluating obstetrics patients with common symptom of pain and abdominal distension. Such symptoms might be dismissed or attributed to usual obstetrics disorders.\n\n【13】In conclusion, early involvement of consultants and multidisciplinary approach including liaison with surgeons, radiologists and urgent access to investigations out of hours was exemplified in this case. With a steady rise of cesarean section rate reaching an incidence of 24.3%, trainees will need to be more vigilant and extend their awareness to even rare complications of commonly performed procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> .High index of suspicion of such a rare but serious complication in puerperal period is crucial to accurate diagnosis and prompt management if serious morbidity and mortality is to be avoided.\n\n【14】Poster Presentation\n\n【15】Salih A, Mumdjzans A, Jha R, Salim E .Caecal Bascule: A Rare Complication Following Caesarean Section.Obstetrics and Gynaecology Annual Regional Conference Day in Leeds, United Kingdom on 29th Jan 2010; (Page 37).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It may be difficult to differentiate a primary gastric cancer from secondary based on clinical, endoscopic, radiological and histopathological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. However, the differentiation is very important in order to manage these patients to avoid over-treatment. Most series report a greater tendency for lobular carcinoma to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In this report, we described a case of breast cancer metastasis to the stomach, which was initially diagnosed and treated as primary gastric cancer, and subsequently diagnosed as a metastatic spread of breast origin after pathological evaluation.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A fifty-year-old postmenopausal woman was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of weight loss and epigastric pain. Physical examination revealed no abnormality except for cachexia. Laboratory tests including hemogram, biochemical parameters and tumor markers were unremarkable. She was initally investigated with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (GE). GE demonstrated diffuse hyperemic nodules in the mucosa of the greater curvature and the corpus posterior wall. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the biopsy specimens revealed diffuse carcinoma with signet-ring type. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickened gastric wall . Based on these findings total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy reconstrcuction was performed. Histopathology after surgery revealed involvement of the stomach by a malignant neoplasm composed of diffuse infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa . Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CK 7, GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein-15), ER and PR, where as negative for CK 20.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Mammography revealed microcalcificiations in the upper outer quadrant with no mass in left breast of patient while USG showed a solid nodule measuring 18 mm × 13 mm. The contralateral breast was normal and both axillary was impalpable with nodes. The mass was non-palpable so a USG-guided tru-cut biopsy of the lesion was done, which revealed infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Finally, the patient was evaluated as metastatic breast cancer masquerading as primary gastric cancer and therefore simple mastectomy was performed and the patient was referred to medical oncology for adjuvant therapy.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】It has been known that gastric metastasis from breast cancer are rare entities that are usually found after the diagnosis or treatment of the primary tumor. It is very rare to determinate such kind of metastasis in the absence of known primary breast cancer. In this report we presented a case of gastric metastasis from asymptomatic breast cancer admitted to our clinic with the complaints of weight loss and epigastric pain.\n\n【10】Primary and metastatic cancers of the stomach usually presents similiarly with non-specific symptoms of anorexia, vomiting, epigastric pain and/or haemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These non-specific symptomatolgoy can usually delay the diagnosis as seen in our case. Endoscopic, radiological and histological assessments are usually unhelpful to discriminate between primary gastric cancer and breast cancer metastasis to the stomach. Since metastatic gastric infiltration is frequently limited to the submucosa and seromuscular layer, endoscopic evaluation may be normal in 50% of cases or only show discrete mucosal abnormalities such as nodular and polypoid or ulcerated lesions indistinguishable from other tumors or benign disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In their review of the literature from 1943 to June 2012, Massimo et al found that 125 patients has been reported with gastric metastasis from breast cancer including 57 presenting with linitis plastica, 27 with obstruction/stenosis, 12 with ulcer erosion/bleeding, 11 with dyspepsia, 10 with pain as the main symptom, 2 with polypoid lesions, 2 with perforation, and in 4 cases with no symptoms in presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Imaging findings on CT scan or barium studies include encasement of the whole stomach as seen in linitis plastica, multiple lesions of the stomach or extrinsic lesions of the gastric wall. Deep biopsies are needed to obtain representative material and the histological features should be compared with those of the primary breast tumor in order to confirm the diagnosis. Occasionally, lobular breast carcinoma may produce a signet ring morphology which can be confused with a primary gastric adenocarcinoma as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The large number of signet-ring cells combined with a gastric mucosal spreading pattern can compromise the diagnosis, and metastatic disease to the stomach can be almost indistinguishable from primary gastric linitis plastica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Madeya et al reported that 73% of patients with gastric metastases had diffuse intramural infiltration imitating linitis plastica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Further immunohistochemical studies may be the only reliable method to differentiate between metastatic and primary gastric carcinoma. Metastatic breast carcinoma is usually positive for CK7, GCDFP-15, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ER and PR, and negative for CK20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although ER and PR positivity in gastric biopsies suspects breast cancer metastasis to the stomach, it is has been estimated that ER and PR positivity with weak to moderate staining intensity in 32% and 12%, respectively, of patients with primary gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. ERα can be used to differantiate gastric metastasis from breast cancer as van Velthuysen et al reported that no primary gastric tumor expressed ERα. They also observed that the absence of E-cadherin staining was significantly related to metastatic breast carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Positive staining with GCDFP-15 has been found to be a sensitive (55-76%) and specific (95-100%) marker for correctly identifying a malignant lesion as metastatic breast carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>. The positivity for CK7 and GCDFP-15 including hormone receptor expression of ERα.and PR, and in addition the negativity for CK20 were of great value in accurated diagnosing in the presented case.\n\n【13】Most series report a higher tendency for lobular carcinoma to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract, the gynecological organs and the peritoneum while ductal carcinoma most frequently relapses in the liver, the bones, the lungs and the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>.The reason for this mode of spread has not been clearly identified. Taal et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported that 83% of patients with gastric involvement had lobular breast cancer as a primary histological subtype as described in our case.\n\n【14】Reports on treatment of gastric metastasis of breast cancer has varied in literature. Breast cancer metastasis to the stomach represents evidence of systemic disease and the need for systemic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 11 \\]</u>. Surgery is usually required to palliate symptoms in the case of obstruction, bleeding and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 11 \\]</u>. McLemore et al reported that surgical intervention did not have a significant effect on survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, Pectaides et al stated that patients with metastasis only to the gastrointestinal tract who underwent palliative surgical resection tended to have an increased median survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.The overall prognosis at a progressed stage from most of the reported case series is rather poor, with a predicted median survival of only 24 - 36 months from the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Contrary to the most previous reports, the patient in this report were initially diagnosed with an apparent primary gastric cancer and therofore this diagnosis was revised to metastatic spread of breast cancer, but only after surgery had been performed.\n\n【16】Conlusion\n\n【17】We remind that metastases to stomach may rarely be the first manifestation of breast cancer metastases. Surgeons should be awake of patients affected by breast cancer who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms. Detailed diagnostic procedures could be required to obtain a conclusive histopathological diagnosis allowing a satisfactory treatment for the patients.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

High prolactin levels, secondary to a number of iatrogenic and medical conditions, may explain the cause for some of these idiopathic thrombi. In this paper, we report a case of hyperprolactinemia as a potential cause of pulmonary embolism (PE) and review the literature to elucidate the connection between high prolactin levels and increased thrombotic risk.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 68-year-old female presented with sudden onset of dyspnea on exertion and frontal headaches, mainly in the mornings. On physical examination, she was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Routine labs were positive for an elevated troponin. Imaging studies with an echocardiogram and computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest showed right heart strain and confirmed a diagnosis of sub-massive PE. She was then admitted to the hospital for initiation of anticoagulation and observation. A CT scan of the head performed for morning headaches showed a mass lesion on the right side of the pituitary fossa. Given imaging findings of a PE and a pituitary mass, additional laboratory studies were obtained. A hypercoagulable workup including levels of protein S, protein C, homocysteine, anti-phospholipid antibodies (e.g. lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein antibodies), prothrombin G20210A mutation, and factor V Leiden mutation was negative. Pituitary hormone levels obtained in existence of the pituitary mass were within normal levels, with exception to a markedly elevated prolactin of 270.9 ng/mL (4.8 - 23.3 ng/mL).\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Prolactin is commonly known for its effects on human milk production, but it also plays a key role in a number of other cellular processes. Prolactin acts in a cytokine-like manner to regulate cell cycle related functions such as growth, differentiation and apoptosis. These cytokine-mediated functions influence hematopoiesis and angiogenesis and are involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. High prolactin levels caused by pituitary tumors, prescription drugs, paraneoplastic processes, hypothyroidism, and substances like marijuana may explain the cause for some cases of idiopathic thrombosis.\n\n【6】Although the data are somewhat limited, results have indicated that elevated prolactin levels may be associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Wallaschofski et al demonstrated higher prolactin levels in patients with thrombosis without an identified congenital or acquired hypercoagulable state compared to patients with a thrombus explained by a congenital and acquired hypercoagulable state and in healthy subjects. Based on this research, platelets express a prolactin receptor which plays a role in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. As evidenced by platelet aggregation studies, no clotting took place with prolactin alone and modest platelet aggregation was seen with ADP alone. However, when platelets were incubated with prolactin in combination with ADP, a cumulative effect was seen on platelet aggregation which was more pronounced than with each agent alone. In addition, more robust platelet aggregation was seen with increasing concentrations of prolactin. Furthermore, epinephrine co-stimulation of platelets exposed to prolactin and ADP induced marked platelet aggregation suggesting prolactin’s effect on the Gi-protein-coupled pathway associated with the P2Y12 ADP receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】In 2012, Stuijver et al reported results of a case-control study evaluating prolactin in relation to coagulation factors as a risk of VTE. This study demonstrated that patients with prolactin levels > 150 µg/L had a concomitant increase in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. Patients with prolactin levels in the 99th - 100th percentile (> 42.6 µg/L) had an increased risk of developing a VTE (odds ratio 1.4), compared to subjects with a prolactin level in the 0 - 1st percentile (< 3.4 µg/L) (odds ratio 0.8). These patients were more prone to developing pulmonary emboli rather than deep venous thrombosis with odds ratios of 1.8 versus 1.2, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】In our patient, elevated prolactin secondary to a prolactinoma remained the most likely etiology of VTE given a negative history and workup for other causes. Literature investigating prolactin’s effect on ADP-mediated platelet aggregation along with clinical scenarios in which elevated prolactin is the only sound explanation for a venous thrombosis may make it a novel risk factor which should be evaluated following a patient history indicative of a prolactin derangement.\n\n【9】Author Contributions\n\n【10】B.

Furthermore, scaphoid fractures can be difficult to visualize on standard X-rays 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. If suspicion of a scaphoid fracture has risen, further evaluation may be warranted. This is supported by the fact that scaphoid fractures relatively commonly lead to non-union due to the limited vascularization of the scaphoid bone. Therefore, additional imaging such as MRI, bone scintigraphy or CT scanning is frequently used in order not to miss the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Treatment consists of prolonged immobilization or osteosynthesis and screw fixation.\n\n【2】However, the literature on this topic is scarce, especially in addressing the late results of untreated scaphoid fractures. Therefore the following case report was started. This case report clearly shows the late results of an untreated scaphoid fracture and stresses the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 50-year-old female presented nine months after a skiing accident with progressive pain at her left wrist. Initial examinations did not raise suspicion of a missed scaphoid fracture. One year after the accident the X-rays of the wrist showed a hook shaped pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid, a deep irregularity of the distal radius articular surface due to erosion by the distal scaphoid fragment, and collapse of the carpus, matching a scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC) of the wrist . The SNAC wrist was treated with a four-corner arthrodesis. After the arthrodesis the patient developed a type 1 Complex Regional Pain Syndrome for which a Wafer procedure was warranted. Immediately after the procedure the pain of the wrist was reduced. Due to the limited mobilization a contracture of the fifth finger developed. The patient was treated with intensive physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychotherapy, which led to a reduction in the contracture of the fifth finger and a reduction of the pain. However, the movement restrictions remained in the fifth finger. The patient was prescribed a knuckle bender splint on her fourth and fifth finger when participating in activities such as work, sports and driving. The loading capacity of the wrist is still increasing while the usage of the splint is decreasing.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. A: Lateral view of the left wrist.

Due to the limited literature little is known about the natural history of the scaphoid fracture.\n\n【8】Scaphoid fractures can be accompanied by unspecific physical complaints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Standard X-rays of the wrist fail to demonstrate a fracture in up to 50% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore it is likely to encounter an untreated scaphoid fracture.

These metastases are overwhelmingly seen only after bone metastases have occurred and generally present in one of two basic radiological patterns. The most common radiologic presentation is that of lymphangitic spread illustrated by diffuse interstitial thickening/nodularity. Hematologic spread presenting as multiple pulmonary nodules is identified in 8 to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Solitary cavitating pulmonary metastasis has been reported in the literature but is extremely rare \\[ 7 \\- 10 \\]. Almost all patients with metastatic prostate cancer present with a high PSA level, thereby enabling the marker to be used as a measure of disease burden/response to treatment. Less than 1% of metastatic prostate cancer cases have low serum PSA levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. To the authors’ knowledge, metastatic prostate cancer to the lungs presenting as multiple bilateral cavitary lung lesions without bony metastases and normal PSA has not been previously reported.\n\n【13】Multiple cavitary pulmonary nodules have a diverse differential, including benign and malignant etiologies. Benign entities may be infectious in nature such as septic emboli, fungal, atypical (mycobacterial), and aspiration pneumonia. Noninfectious benign causes include sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, and collagen vascular/connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and Wegener’s granulomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Malignant etiologies include primary and metastatic cancers. Of primary lung neoplasms, squamous cell carcinomas most frequently cavitate but usually present as a single lesion. Furthermore, extra-pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas are the most common type of cavitating metastases, composing 69% of such lesions. Other rare reported cases of cavitary transitional cell carcinoma, adenocarcinomas and sarcomas are documented in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Vascular insufficiency eventually leads to necrosis and cavitation in pulmonary metastases. Vascular compromise may be secondary to direct involvement or tumor outgrowth of blood supply 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The prognosis of prostate cancer is mainly determined by the presence or absence of metastases. Among 19,316 routine autopsies performed from 1967 to 1995 on men older than 40 years of age, reports from 1,589 (8.2%) with prostate cancer were analyzed by Bubendorf L. and associates. When hematogeneous metastases were present, skeletal involvement was found in 90%.

HIV screen was negative. The patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of neurosyphilis given concurrent uveitis. Upon admission she underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) with results as follows: two nucleated cells; 0 red blood cells (RBCs) (100% polymorphonuclears (PMNs)); protein 23, glucose 60; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) non-reactive; herpes simplex virus (HSV) IgG and IgM negative.\n\n【8】The rash was biopsied which showed superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis with treponemal organisms consistent with cutaneous syphilis. Ophthalmologic exam revealed an inferior retinal hole in the left eye and bilateral panuveitis. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended 14 days of IV penicillin. Ophthalmology recommended concurrent use of topical cyclopentolate 1% and prednisolone 1%. The patient tolerated the treatment course well and had complete resolution of her rash and uveitis, without any long-term effects on visual acuity. As CSF findings were normal, no repeat LP was performed. Follow-up RPR titers checked at 6 months decreased to 1:32.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】True to its nickname, “the great masquerader” has been reported to affect almost every structure in the eye and can mimic other infectious and immune ocular inflammatory disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Panuveitis is the most common manifestation of ocular syphilis and usually presents with eye pain, vision loss, flashers/floaters, and photophobia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ocular syphilis can occur and overlap with any stage of syphilis infection; however, eye involvement occurs most frequently in secondary syphilis and late syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is usually presumptive based on the presence of inflammatory eye changes and positive serologies.\n\n【11】Ocular syphilis is distinct from neurosyphilis and can occur with or without other neurologic symptoms or CSF changes. All patients with ocular syphilis should receive an LP even in the absence of neurological symptoms to evaluate for neurosyphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Up to 70% of patients with ocular syphilis will also have evidence of neurosyphilis on CSF testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Ocular syphilis should be treated the same as neurosyphilis even if the LP is normal. The recommended regimen is aqueous crystalline penicillin G 3-4 million units IV every 4 h or continuous infusion for 10 - 14 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. If the LP is positive, patients will need serial LPs to ensure proper response to therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Of note, the duration of therapy for ocular syphilis is shorter than the course needed for treatment of tertiary and late latent syphilis, therefore one should consider an additional dose of intramuscular (IM) penicillin G after completion of IV penicillin for those patients with ocular manifestations during these states 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Management of ocular syphilis should be done in consultation with infectious disease and ophthalmology.\n\n【14】Ocular syphilis should be considered on the differential of any inflammatory eye disorder. When suspected, the diagnosis requires urgent workup including LP and ophthalmologic exam, along with prompt initiation of antibiotics. Most patients will have complete recovery; however, delay in treatment can result in serious sequala including blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent from the patient was obtained for this case report.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>George Boghdadi contributed to the literature review and drafting of the manuscript.

This rare phenomenon occurs in approximately 0.66 per 100,000 pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology relates to the exaggerated intracellular release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Susceptible patients often have mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) or dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor, leading to unregulated calcium release following exposure to triggering agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The unregulated increase in intracellular calcium leads to accelerated muscle contraction resulting in hypercarbia, hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. If untreated, the process has a high mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Treatment includes early recognition, removal of the inciting agent, management of the systemic complications, and the administration of dantrolene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In susceptible patients or in patients with a family history of MH, general anesthesia can be provided with the use of non-triggering agents including nitrous oxide and intravenous agents (propofol, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, opioids, and midazolam) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Alternatively, for specific surgical procedures, spinal anesthesia can be used in place of general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was first reported in infants and children in the late 19th and early 20th century when the potential for morbidity and mortality from general anesthesia was significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Spinal anesthesia saw a resurgence during the 1980s when it was used in former preterm infants as a means of avoiding intraoperative intubation in patients with underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), as well as apnea and respiratory insufficiency following general anesthesia with halothane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, enthusiasm waned as the risk of apnea was shown to be less likely when newer inhalational anesthetic agents were introduced into clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Moreover, the introduction of surfactant and the improved management of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants have changed the acuity of BPD, reducing the severity of the underlying respiratory disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. More recently, there has been a renewed interest in the use of spinal anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia due to concerns raised by laboratory and animal studies suggesting that exposure to certain anesthetic agents is neurotoxic and may be associated with long-term neurocognitive effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Although the evidence demonstrating an actual clinical effect on long-term human neurocognitive outcomes is equivocal, our center has initiated a program providing spinal anesthesia instead of general anesthesia for many surgical procedures in infants and children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Spinal anesthesia may also have a role as a means of avoiding general anesthesia in specific patient populations with co-morbid diseases associated with an increased risk of general anesthesia. We present the use of spinal anesthesia as a means of avoiding general anesthesia in two infants with a family history of MH.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】At Nationwide Children’s Hospital, formal Institutional Review Board approval is not required for case presentations involving two or fewer patients.\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】An 8-month-old, 10-kg boy with a hidden penis, penoscrotal webbing, and phimosis, presented for elective buried penis repair, complex scrotoplasty, and circumcision. The boy was otherwise healthy and there was no prior history of general anesthesia. His family history was notable for MH in both the father and paternal grandmother. Due to the potential risks of MH in this patient, spinal anesthesia was discussed with the parents and selected for the operative procedure. On the day of surgery, the infant was held nil per os (NPO) for solids for 6 h and clear liquids for 2 h. A topical anesthetic cream was placed over the lumbar area and the patient was transported to the operating room. Spinal anesthesia was placed using a 1.5-inch, 22-gauge spinal needle, which was inserted at the L3-4 interspace. Following free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 1.2 mL of isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine (0.6 mg/kg bupivacaine) with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 10 µg of clonidine was injected. Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) monitors were placed. Adequate surgical anesthesia with sensory and motor blockade was attained. A peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the foot after the onset of sensory blockade. No intraoperative medications were required to supplement the spinal anesthesia or provide sedation. No clinically significant respiratory or hemodynamic changes were noted. There were no clinical signs of MH. The surgical procedure lasted for approximately 1 h. The patient was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. Postoperatively, a single dose of fentanyl (1 µg/kg) was administered for irritability. His postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged home after 3 h of monitoring.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 9-month-old, 10.5-kg boy with a right ectopic testicle and penile adhesions, presented for elective right orchidopexy and lysis of penile adhesions with circumcision. The infant was otherwise healthy with no prior anesthesia or surgical history. His family history was notable for MH in a maternal nephew. Due to the potential risks of MH in this patient, spinal anesthesia was discussed with the parents and selected for the operative procedure. On the day of surgery, the infant was held NPO for solids for 6 h and clear liquids for 2 h. A topical anesthetic cream was placed over the lumbar area and the patient was transported to the operating room. Spinal anesthesia was provided using a 1.5-inch, 25-gauge spinal needle, which was inserted at the L3-4 interspace. Following free flow of CSF, 1.2 mL of isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine (0.6 mg/kg bupivacaine) with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 10 µg of clonidine was injected. Routine ASA monitors were placed. Adequate anesthesia with sensory and motor blockade was attained. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted in the foot after the onset of sensory blockade. No intraoperative medications were required to supplement the spinal anesthesia or provide sedation. No clinically significant respiratory or hemodynamic changes were noted. There were no clinical signs of MH. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 1.25 h. The patient was transferred to the PACU and discharged home after 1 h of monitoring following an unremarkable postoperative course.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】Although used most commonly to avoid the deleterious effects of general anesthesia on the central control of ventilation, to avoid the need for endotracheal intubation, or to avoid the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthetic agents, there are many co-morbid conditions which may increase the risk of general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In the two patients described, spinal anesthesia was chosen instead of general anesthesia due to the potential for increased morbidity given the patients’ family history of MH. Spinal anesthesia effectively provided surgical anesthesia for the urologic procedures, thereby avoiding the need for general anesthesia. Neither patient required intraoperative sedative or analgesic medications and maintained hemodynamic stability without signs of MH. The postoperative PACU stay of the first patient was prolonged because a dose of fentanyl (1 µg/kg) was administered, mandating longer monitoring per our institutional guidelines. Our second patient highlights another benefit of spinal anesthesia as he required no postoperative analgesic or sedation medications, and therefore was discharged rapidly from the PACU to the phase two recovery area.\n\n【11】Previous reports of the use of spinal anesthesia in MH susceptible adult patients are outlined in Table 1 \\[ 17 \\- 23 \\]. Adverse effects were rare with hypotension noted in one parturient and respiratory difficulties in another patient related to a high spinal block (T3) and the concomitant administration of dantrolene. Our two patients represent the first reports of the use of spinal anesthesia in potentially MH-susceptible pediatric patients. Overall, these reports and our experiences demonstrate the safe and effective use of spinal anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia in patients at risk for MH due to their previous anesthetic history or family history.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. Use of Spinal Anesthesia in MH Susceptible Patients \\[ 17 \\- 23 \\] |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Although generally considered safe in patients with MH, anecdotal reports suggest the onset of MH following neuraxial (spinal or epidural) anesthesia \\[ 24 \\- 26 \\]. These anecdotal reports include MH-like symptoms after neuraxial administration of both ester (tetracaine) and amide (bupivacaine) local anesthetic agents. Sheu et al describe the potential development of MH following spinal anesthesia with tetracaine in a 62-year-old patient undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Caffeine-halothane contracture testing was not available and while MH was unable to be confirmed, the author reported a hypermetabolic state demonstrating features of acute rhabdomyolysis. Albeit rare, the potential to trigger MH with neuraxial anesthesia mandates appropriate intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of temperature and physiologic function. Dantrolene should be available for specific treatment of MH.\n\n【14】Adverse effects related to spinal anesthesia are generally low, especially in the pediatric population. Relative contraindications include uncorrected coagulopathy, localized infection at the insertion site, and evidence of intracranial hypertension. Given the later development of the sympathetic nervous system, hypotension is rare and in fact, blood pressure stability is better with spinal anesthesia than general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) remains uncommon in pediatric patients less than 10 - 12 years of age when compared to the adult population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Other neurological complications that may occur from spinal anesthesia are rare, including subdural hematoma formation. Anecdotal reports suggest that such complications generally occur in the setting of co-morbid defects of coagulation function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Developed over the past 24 months, the following outlines our standard practice for spinal anesthesia from our institution. The intrathecal space is accessed using a 1.5-inch, 22-gauge or a 1.5-inch, 25-gauge spinal needle (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The local anesthetic used is preservative-free isobaric bupivacaine (0.5%) in a dose of 0.2 mL/kg (1 mg/kg). The maximum dose is generally 1 mL (5 mg) in most infants. However, for longer procedures or larger children, a higher total volume can be used (1.2 mL or 6 mg). To prolong the duration of the surgical block and maximize postoperative analgesia, the syringe is washed with 1:1,000 epinephrine prior to filling it with the local anesthetic agent and clonidine (1 µg/kg) is added to the solution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】With its excellent safety profile, spinal anesthesia is a useful alternative to general anesthesia in patients with a past history or family history of MH. Our pediatric cases highlight the benefits of spinal anesthesia instead of general anesthesia in patients with co-morbid conditions. With concerns for respiratory complications following general anesthesia with the volatile agents and ongoing controversy regarding the potential long-term neurocognitive outcomes of general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia may have a larger role in the anesthetic management of pediatric patients.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest for any authors.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The course of CML can be divided in three phases: chronic, accelerated or blast phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Most patients being diagnosed are in the chronic phase.\n\n【2】The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy changed the landscape of this disease. Long-term outcomes of imatinib-treated patients in the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) showed an overall survival rate of 83.3% at 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Resistance-associated mutations will develop in more than 30% of CML patients treated with TKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Most known resistance-associated mutations are simple point mutations that take place in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain and result in ineffective drug binding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Next-generation sequencing has allowed detection of leukemia-associated mutations in patients with TKI resistance in the absence of kinase domain mutations. For example, mutations in DNMT3A and ASXL1 could lead to TKI resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Mutation mechanisms independent of BCR-ABL1 are more likely seen in primary resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】High-complexity scenarios like molecular diagnostic issues, primary refractory CML, and emergence of TKI resistance-associated mutations frequently pose therapeutic challenges. In this article, we will discuss some of these clinical scenarios using a case-based approach.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Case 1: primary imatinib resistance in P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML\n\n【6】A 71-year-old male presented to our practice in November 2017 for incidental finding of persistent leukocytosis on laboratory studies. His complete blood count (CBC) showed a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 22.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.9 g/dL, and platelets of 114 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 4% myelocytes and 2% metamyelocytes. A diagnostic bone marrow performed in January 2018 showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (almost 100% cellularity) characterized by marked granulocytic hyperplasia consistent with a diagnosis of CML. Cytogenetics showed abnormal male karyotype with loss of Y chromosome and t(9;22) detected in all cells examined. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 on peripheral blood and marrow identified presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript e1a2 involving minor 通用删除11(英):<u>(p190)</u> breakpoint. He was started on imatinib in mid-January 2018. He achieved a complete hematological response soon after initiation of TKI therapy, but his BCR-ABL transcript levels over the following 6 months raised concerns for TKI-resistant disease. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis did not show any resistance-associated mutations. He was switched to the second generation TKI therapy with dasatinib in June 2018. BCR-ABL1 transcripts level by qRT-PCR on peripheral blood was 61.726% by international scale (IS) prior to dasatinib. Follow-up result in October 2018 was 17.046% by IS, with a log reduction of 0.706. There was response to dasatinib noted at 3 months with more than 50% decrease from baseline levels . Although he was still above the desired 10% mark, we decided to continue treatment and revaluate again in 3 months. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up after that office visit.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Percentage of p190 BCR-ABL1 via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) over time according to TKI choices. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】CML with isolated BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript e1a2 involving minor 通用删除11(英):<u>(p190)</u> breakpoint is extremely rare. In a MD Anderson Cancer Center study, P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML represented only 1% of patients with CML and it was associated with an inferior outcome to therapy with TKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML is often associated with peripheral monocytosis, absence of splenomegaly and bone marrow morphologic features that are intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. It has also been associated with frequent additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A recent study presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology meeting recommended P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML to be considered as a high-risk group. The authors from Helsinki University demonstrated that p190 activates specific cancer pathways, notably Src signaling and interferon pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Management of these patients requires strict TKI response monitoring and early consideration of stem cell transplant in eligible patients. Frontline use of the second generation TKI in patients with P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML should be strongly considered.\n\n【10】Case 2: primary imatinib resistance with ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations\n\n【11】A 37-year-old African American male was initially admitted to our center for persistent headache and fatigue. His CBC showed WBC of 323 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 6.7 g/dL, and platelets of 1,120 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 28% myelocytes and 4% blasts. He underwent a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy in September 2017 which showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (100% cellularity) with myeloid hyperplasia and increased atypical megakaryocytes. Chromosome analysis showed 46XY karyotype with translocation (9;22). BCR-ABL by qRT-PCR was detected at 42.369% by IS involving the major break point 通用删除11(英):<u>(p210)</u>. Molecular profiling showed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. He was started on imatinib at time of hospitalization. He achieved a complete hematological response with imatinib, but no molecular response. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis was done in January 2018 with no mutations detected. He was then switched to dasatinib 100 mg daily in May 2018 with eventual dose reduction to 70 mg due to grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity with diarrhea. He failed to achieve a molecular response to dasatinib. In January 2019 he was switched to ponatinib and referred for allogeneic stem cell transplant evaluation. BCR-ABL1 transcript level by qRT-PCR prior to initiation of ponatinib was 38.848%. Fluctuating transcript levels were attributed to issues with treatment adherence. Latest qRT-PCR results in December 2019 (11 months after ponatinib initiation) showed a BCR-ABL1 level of 2.350% by IS with a 1.485 log reduction .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Percentage of p210 BCR-ABL1 via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) over time according to TKI choices. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Patients with CML diagnosed in the chronic phase can be triaged into initial TKI treatment choice based upon prognostic scoring systems, such as Sokal or European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS), with higher risk patients generally being offered frontline second-generation TKIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Our patient was high risk based upon the Sokal system, but unfortunately was not a candidate for the second generation TKI due to cost and insurance issues. The patient achieved a complete hematologic response with imatinib but did not show any signs of molecular response with rising BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Primary imatinib failure in chronic phase CML is not an uncommon scenario, and patients in this category may still achieve a response to the second and third generation TKI with a 72% overall survival at 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our patient was tested for ABL1 kinase mutation and found to be negative, which is seen in about 50% of patients who are non-responders to TKI medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Next-generation sequencing performed at the time of diagnosis revealed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. It has been previously described that the development of clonal evolution is associated with decrease in both response and overall survival with the use of imatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. More recently there has been growing evidence that both ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations are associated with TKI resistance and progression to more advanced stages of CML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Next-generation sequencing for common myeloid somatic mutations may be helpful to determine the risk of initial TKI failure in patients with chronic phase CML.\n\n【15】Case 3: primary imatinib resistance with c.1424 35-NT mutation\n\n【16】A 45-year-old female was admitted to our center in June 2017 with hyperleukocytosis. Her initial CBC showed WBC of 334 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 8.7 g/dL and platelets of 268 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 23% myelocytes, 12% metamyelocytes, 3% promyelocytes, and 4% blasts. She underwent a diagnostic bone marrow in June 2017 showing a hypercellular marrow with 100% cellularity. Cytogenetics showed 46XX karyotype with positive t(9;22). The FISH studies confirmed t(9;22). She had some delays in starting treatment due to financial barriers but was eventually started on imatinib 400 mg once a day. She achieved a complete hematological response rapidly. However, she continued to have persistent detection of BCR-ABL mutation at 12.7% with log reduction of 0.773 at 6 months . A mutation analysis was performed showing an ABL kinase domain mutation, specifically a c.1424 35-NT insertion. By the end of January 2018, she was started on bosutinib 500 mg per day. The patient developed significant gastrointestinal toxicity and required a dose reduction to 400 mg per day. She achieved a major molecular response 12 months after bosutinib initiation, which has sustained so far with latest qRT-PCR in July 2019 showing 0.016% by IS with log reduction of 3.571 . The patient continued to have major molecular response after bosutinib dose reduction.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Percentage of p210 BCR-ABL1 via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) over time according to TKI choices. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】This case highlights another instance of failure to achieve an adequate response with frontline imatinib. The patient was initially treated with imatinib with an increase in BCR-ABL transcripts nearly two-fold from baseline. A prior study has indicated that two-fold rises in consecutive samples of BCR-ABL transcripts predicts a greater than 60% possibility of identifying a kinase domain mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The patient had ABL1 kinase mutation analysis that showed a c.1424 35-NT insertion. Point mutations are generally thought to confer resistance to imatinib therapy and nearly 100 different types have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Interestingly, this patient’s point mutation has conflicting reports as to its contribution to TKI resistance. One group reported that a 35-base pair insertion alters the tyrosine kinase in a manner similar to the T315I mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Another group concluded that the 35-NT insertion did not correlate with TKI resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The patient was ultimately transitioned to bosutinib with an excellent response achieving a major molecular response (MMR). Our case demonstrates that 35-NT insertions can lead to imatinib resistance and may respond to the second generation TKIs.\n\n【20】Case 4: positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(9;22) with negative RT-PCR for BCR-ABL1\n\n【21】A 72-year-old female initially presented to our center for evaluation of leukocytosis. Her CBC showed WBC of 73 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 12 g/dL and platelets of 464 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 3% myelocytes, 14% metamyelocytes and 1% blasts. The cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood showed an abnormal female karyotype, with t(9;22) on all cells examined. FISH analysis confirmed t(9;22) in 95.5% of analyzed nuclei (normal < 1.5%). BCR-ABL by PCR was negative, including standard p210, p190 testing and non-standard BCR-ABL PCR testing for p230. She was started on the frontline treatment with imatinib in July 2018. She achieved a complete morphologic response but soon after developed grade 3 skin rash and was unable to tolerate imatinib further. She was then switched to dasatinib. FISH analysis on peripheral blood was reported as negative in February 2019 (6 months after initiation of therapy). FISH has remained undetectable since then, except for a one-time low level positive at 2% during a temporary TKI-treatment interruption. She has been reluctant to have a bone marrow biopsy performed from time of initial diagnosis. We have provided frequent education regarding its importance for morphological evaluation, and for the subsequent assessment of cytogenetic response. Most recent peripheral blood FISH in September 2019 remains undetectable.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Peripheral blood studies for detection of t(9;22) or BCR-ABL1 are not considered enough for diagnosis of CML. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required for all patients in whom CML is suspected. It will confirm the diagnosis and provide information needed for staging in terms of the blast and basophil percentages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Our patient was informed in detail of the rationale behind a diagnostic bone marrow examination, but she still refused. To further complicate the situation, although cytogenetics and FISH on peripheral blood were both positive, molecular testing for BCR-ABL1 transcripts by RT-PCR was negative making response assessment challenging. Possible reasons for discordance between FISH and RT-PCR testing were discussed with molecular pathologist. Standard commercial testing included reverse transcription of extracted sample ribonucleic acid (RNA) to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) for BCR-ABL1 fusions e13a2, e14a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p210)</u> and e1a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p190)</u>. Additional non-standard testing for e19a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p230)</u> was also performed. A false-negative PCR result was considered initially, but repeated testing was consistently negative making sampling or procedural errors unlikely. We believe the discordant results in this case could be explained by the presence of an atypical fusion transcript. Rare breakpoints having junction configurations other than e13a2, e14a2, e1a2 or e19a2 have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Management of these cases is challenging, especially when access to advanced molecular testing is limited. Most practices rely on standardized send-out testing using commercially available products. After extensive discussion with the patient, it was agreed to initiate TKI therapy and to monitor using FISH on peripheral blood. For correlative purposes, a complete cytogenetic response was considered equivalent to a negative FISH test (± 2%), given the lack of a marrow examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n| Conclusions | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】Upfront treatment with imatinib although attractive from a cost benefit standpoint has limitations for selected patients with unusual BCR-ABL1 transcripts or presence of specific mutations. The second generation TKIs are appropriate in these situations as frontline therapy. Close monitoring, transition to ponatinib if no response to the second generation TKIs and consideration of bone marrow transplant evaluation in eligible patients is recommended.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received.

In the adult patient cohort, central nervous system infection leading to meningitis is clinically one of the most commonly seen manifestations of Listeria infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The incidence rate of listeriosis in those on anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy is around three cases per 10,000 patient-years, significantly higher than in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The inflamed bowel mucosa is made up of a variety of stromal and immune cells that produce both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-18 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Hence, TNF inhibitors are a clinically effective option in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory disorders making it even more important for clinicians to be aware of their risks. These agents essentially alter the natural course of ulcerative colitis by encouraging mucosal healing and delaying potential colectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There are multiple case reports detailing the development of opportunistic infections associated with anti-TNF therapy. Examples of opportunistic infections described in the literature include tuberculosis, listeriosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and viral or invasive fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】This report explores the rationale, risks and benefits of anti-TNF therapy through a case where infliximab was introduced as rescue therapy for steroid-unresponsive ulcerative colitis (UC). This is one of the few case-based reviews on listeriosis in patients on anti-TNF therapy to present a conundrum with regards to immunosuppression. Most case reports reviewed as part of this article demonstrate the potential severity and heterogeneity of L. monocytogenes infection 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>. Primary teams generally had to commence the patient on an extended course of antibiotics and consider alternative immunosuppression or reintroduce the same agent once their patient was more stable. However, what makes our report stand out is the “domino effect” of listeriosis where severe infection compels the clinician to hold immunosuppressants only to lead to worsening colitis.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】We hereby present a case of a 62-year-old female with a history of UC first diagnosed in December 2020, initially maintained with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). She had an acute severe flare of UC in August 2021 which prompted initiation of infliximab with a 10 mg/kg loading dose (week 0, 2, 6 and 8). Computed tomography (CT) findings show significant colonic inflammation . Other investigations included positive serology for perinuclear anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and antinuclear antibody (ANA). She had a prior history of breast carcinoma and a family history of UC.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. (a, b) There is circumferential thickening of the distal ascending (blue arrow), transverse (green arrow), descending (yellow arrow) and rectosigmoid colon (orange arrow) in keeping with colitis. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】The patient received two infliximab infusions at week 0 and 2 and re-presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, vomiting and diarrhea associated with generalized weakness, confusion and lethargy. On examination, her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was low (12/15) with acutely altered mental status and mild neck stiffness. General examination was unremarkable. Along with baseline bloods, a chest X-ray was performed and a full septic screen including blood and urine cultures was sent. C-reactive protein was elevated at 94 mg/dL (normal range 0 - 5 mg/dL). Hemoglobin was stable at 12.8 g/dL (normal range 12 - 15 g/dL). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) was not detected. Chest X-ray demonstrated a lower respiratory tract infection and she was commenced on broad-spectrum intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin) as well as fluids.\n\n【9】Due to new-onset confusion and persistent hypotension, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Shortly after admission, her blood cultures were positive for L. monocytogenes . There was no acute intracranial pathology detected on the brain CT with normal parenchymal brain appearances reported . Neck stiffness is a red flag symptom for meningeal irritation and hence a lumbar puncture was performed.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Computed tomography of brain (09/10/2021) demonstrating normal parenchymal appearances. Lumbar puncture revealed grossly cloudy cerebrospinal fluid with massively elevated white blood cell count of 1,600/mm 3 , with 70% polymorphonuclear neutrophils and 30% mononuclear cells. No organisms were seen on gram stains with no growth on cultures but Listeria monocytogenes DNA was detected via polymerase chain reaction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose was low at 1.8 mmol/L (2.22 to 4.44) and CSF protein was raised at 1.75 g/L (0.15 to 0.6) which confirmed a bacterial meningitis. Apart from bacteremia and meningitis, there were no other manifestations of listeriosis in this patient. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】After appropriate inpatient management, she suffered a flare of colitis 2 months later which showed Mayo 3 endoscopic appearance .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. Endoscopic photograph of sigmoid - edematous mucosa (blue arrow), erosions (green arrow) and ulcerations (grey arrow). Also note absence of vascular pattern with marked erythematous appearances. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n\n【14】Her initial diagnosis was an acute severe UC. She received high-dose immunosuppression with infliximab thereafter and developed L. monocytogenes sepsis with meningeal involvement.\n\n【15】Treatment\n\n【16】With the diagnosis of L. monocytogenes septicemia, her infliximab was held and was started on a 21-day course of intravenous amoxicillin. After completing the antibiotic course, infliximab was discontinued (third induction dose was not administered).\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The patient recovered from L. monocytogenes meningitis and was followed up in the outpatient clinic. Vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin antagonist, was commenced in November 2021 after discussion with multidisciplinary team (MDT) as a more gut selective biological agent. During this period, the option of a colectomy was discussed with her at several points but was declined.\n\n【19】Unfortunately, she presented again with an acute flare of severe UC 2 months later with Mayo 3 on endoscopy. Upon discussion with MDT, she was a suitable candidate for colectomy due to severe pancolitis, recurrent flares and recent sepsis while on biological therapy. She underwent a subtotal colectomy and had an unremarkable post-surgical course.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】IBD patients on immunosuppression are at increased risk of opportunistic infections compared to the general population. This risk may be further compounded by a patient’s comorbidities or advanced age. An opportunistic infection is often described as a microbial infection that is non-pathogenic in the general population but occurs with increasing frequency and severity in patients with a weakened immune system either due to their underlying disease or its management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This case is important because it encourages clinicians to remain vigilant for opportunistic infections in IBD patients on potent immunosuppression. It also raises awareness of the importance of tuberculosis and virology testing before the initiation of anti-TNF biologics. We highlight such infections as a key safety issue and discuss how we can better handle them in clinical practice. Early recognition and prompt workup is imperative to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with pathogens like L. monocytogenes . ECCO guidance recommends the discontinuation of anti-TNF-α biologics during infection with Listeria monocytogenes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. As seen in the case described above, the consequent decision to withhold immunosuppression runs the risk of relapse of inflammatory colitis. Such inflammatory exacerbations often call for a multidisciplinary team approach, and at times, escalation to surgical management.\n\n【22】We searched PubMed using the search terms “listeria” and “TNF”. A total of 522 results were generated. Additional reports and articles were identified by reading the literature found via electronic searches, of which 25 articles were examined for existing knowledge on this subject as well as clinical learning points. Other articles were excluded due to either pathophysiology dominant content or because they were unrelated to the topic at hand. There were only three articles excluded due to non-English language. Our literature review is not exhaustive but comprised of the most relevant case reports published to date regarding listeriosis in patients commenced on anti-TNF agents 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u> \\[ 2 , 8 \\- 31 \\].\n\n【23】We included 25 articles in our review which discussed a total of 44 cases. Of note, we also included a case report of pseudomonas meningitis during vedolizumab treatment. Listeria infections related to immunosuppression presented as meningitis in 23 cases (53.5%), isolated bacteremia in 11 cases (25.6%), and brain abscess in two cases. Other sites of infections also included cerebritis, rhombencephalitis, ankle osteomyelitis, endocarditis, terminal ileitis, septic joint arthritis and gallbladder infections. This demonstrates the heterogeneity of listeriosis leading to variable patient presentations, thereby highlighting the high index of suspicion we need to maintain for such opportunistic infections in patients with risk factors. Seventeen patients (38.6%) had UC, 11 (25%) patients had Crohn’s disease (CD), and 13 (29.5%) had rheumatoid arthritis. There was one case of multiple myeloma as well as psoriatic arthritis. Thirty-five case reports featured the use of infliximab. Where infliximab was commenced, 21 cases (60%) developed symptoms of infection after 1 - 2 doses. Nearly all of the reported cases had concomitant immunosuppression on board such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or mercaptopurine which further rendered these patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>.\n\n【24】Immunosuppressants such as anti-TNF therapy, corticosteroids, mercaptopurine and azathioprine have become the mainstay of management in IBD. Anti-TNF therapy is also used widely for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>.\n\n【25】Most patients diagnosed with listeriosis tend to have an invasive infection, meaning the bacteria can potentially spread from their intestines to the blood, causing severe bloodstream infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. The World Health Organisation recognizes the following as risk factors for listeria: pregnancy, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer and hematological malignancies like leukemia, solid organ transplant recipients or a background of chronic steroid use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 for which she underwent resection and received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was also more susceptible to opportunistic infections due to the recent initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy and recurrent admissions where concomitant high-dose steroids were prescribed for flares of acute severe UC. These vulnerable patient groups should be advised to avoid high-risk meat products such as deli meat as well as supermarket processed meats - this may include cured, cooked and/or fermented sausages and meats, unpasteurised dairy products and cold-smoked fish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In this case, two biologics were featured - infliximab and vedolizumab. Infliximab is a mouse/human chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the cytokine TNF-alpha. In the European Union, it is licensed for the management of IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis as well as psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with α4β7 integrin antagonist activity. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody with selectivity for the gut that is indicated for use in adults with moderate to severe UC or CD. This is seen being used in clinical practice for patients who either had an inadequate response to, experienced disease relapse, or had intolerance to either conventional UC or CD management or a TNF-alpha inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The above patient’s treatment for UC was escalated to infliximab (second-line rescue therapy) and eventual surgical intervention in accordance with the guidance provided by the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Although she refused colonoscopy at the index admission, CT imaging at the time demonstrated circumferential thickening of the distal ascending, transverse, descending and rectosigmoid colon in keeping with colitis. The extensive nature of her colitis in conjunction with the prolonged duration of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain warranted the use of oral 5-ASA (mesalazine) and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. She was later escalated to anti-TNF therapy due to frequent flares.\n\n【29】There is ongoing debate surrounding the optimal dosing of infliximab as rescue therapy in acute severe colitis. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends an initial dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab as second-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Induction with an “intensified” regimen has been explored in one of two ways: either through 1) higher infliximab concentrations or through 2) an accelerated infliximab dosing strategy. There is some evidence that during periods of severe inflammation, there is increased infliximab clearance due to factors such as inflammatory burden, fecal loss and generation of anti-drug antibodies. Further, case-control and case series level data have revealed that an intensified induction strategy may reduce colectomy rates in the short term after an acute exacerbation of UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. This is one of the reasons why some clinicians have adopted the 10 mg/kg dose as “salvage” therapy; however, there is insufficient data to make a recommendation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Surgical management is indicated in UC where patients have disease refractory to medical therapy or have intolerable adverse effects to medications. Other surgical indications also include toxic megacolon, perforation or life-threatening bleeding. In the acute setting, a subtotal colectomy with formation of an end ileostomy with long rectal stump is generally recommended. The gold standard would be a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) which has been shown to generate satisfactory patient outcomes. It is avoided in the emergency setting as there is a higher risk of surgical complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient underwent a subtotal colectomy as an intermediate procedure for severe pancolitis and recurrent disease flares.\n\n【31】Serious and opportunistic infections should be on our diagnostic radar even before we commence immunomodulator therapy in IBD. It is important to screen patients for viral infections such as hepatitis, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) as well as tuberculosis and recommend vaccination and prophylaxis as appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a patient with acute severe colitis, immunosuppression plays a significant role in their management but they also potentiate severe infections and septicemia. However, if stopped or held during infections, the patient can develop worsening colitis culminating in colectomy. In conclusion, we should aim for more rigorous pre-biological screening, patient education about high-risk foods and better recognition and prompt management of both opportunistic infections and acute severe colitis.\n\n【32】Learning points\n\n【33】Our review demonstrates the risks of opportunistic infections with anti-TNF therapy and the importance of counselling patients before initiation of immunomodulators about the avoidance of high-risk foods for listeriosis such as soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk. In addition, we should be wary of holding immunosuppression in patients with severe colitis - worsening colitis may lead to need for future colectomy. Lastly, it is important to consider a patient’s immune risk profile (i.e. underlying malignancy, comorbidities, older adults, obesity, diabetes, etc.) when commencing immunosuppression - this may guide dosing and also encourage early and close surveillance of high-risk patients.\n\n| Supplementary Material | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【35】Suppl 1.

It involves cases which were previously categorized as subcutaneous panniculitis like T-cell lymphoma with gamma delta T-cell phenotype. Gamma delta T-cell lymphomas have been separated from alpha beta phenotype on the basis of carrying a poorer prognosis, decreased survival, more occurrence of necrotization, ulceration and association with hemophagocytic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. There have been a few case reports of CGDTCL, and according to literature, CGDTCL has been seen to commonly involve the extremities, but to our knowledge, this is the first case with such extensive involvement of the body involving scalp, head and toes with ulcero-necrotic nodules. The rate of spread of lesion in our case from a single bump on cheek to whole body involvement in just 3 months points towards an aggressive course. Therefore, a rare case of CGDTCL presenting with widespread ulcero-necrotic lesions involving whole body with atypical cells expressing only CD4 positivity, responded very well to radiation therapy, that contradicts typical presentation and behavior.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 57-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department of our hospital with painful skin lesions since 3 months. She reported that it started as a spot which was a red bump with a white center on her left cheek 3 months ago and then progressed to pruritic, painful and ulcerative lesions all over her body, including scalp, palms and soles. The lesions remained persistent throughout 3 months. On examination, the patient had tender, red purple nodules, some crusted and few ulcerating with fouls smelling discharge all over her body, including scalp, palms and soles. She also had a large ulcer on her left cheek, with rolled borders and purulent discharge. Lymph nodes of left axillary region were firm and enlarged. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【4】CT scan of chest and abdomen showed non-specific B/L pleural effusion without any malignant internal organ involvement. Whereas PET scan revealed innumerable hypermetabolic cutaneous lesions consistent with her presentation and hyperactive B/L axillary, inguinal and intra-parotid lymph nodes. FNAC of axillary lymph nodes and biopsy of bone marrow were negative for lymphoma or any other malignancy. Histopathology of biopsied skin lesion showed proliferation of large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei, demonstrating a phenomenon called epidermotropism . Immunophenotyping study on paraffin sections showed strong expression of CD3  with weak and focal expression of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> by the atypical cells . CD8 <sup>+ </sup> is expressed by scattered lymphocytes with loss of CD7. Expression of both perforin and granzyme indicates cytotoxic phenotype. No significant expression of CD25 was seen. PCR studies showed strong expression of TCR gamma by atypical cells  and small lymphocytes expressed TCR beta. Flow cytometry showed minute atypical CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells of uncertain significance. Complete blood count showed normal leukocyte and RBC count with no eosinophilia. EBV, HTCL, HIV, and HSV tests were all negative.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Wound care was done with normal saline, dilute hibiclens wash twice daily and 1% silverdene ointment. Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT), a definitive dose of 36 Gy, was given. Throughout her hospitalization, the patient’s condition was stable and improved by above therapy. Patient responded very well to radiation therapy and in remission now. Later, stem cell transplant team has made the recommendations for stem cell transplant.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】CGDTCL is an extremely rare lymphoma. It comprises of only 1% of primary cutaneous lymphomas and has finally been incorporated as a definitive disease entity in the latest WHO classification of lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. CGDTCL presents with deeply embedded plaques, patches, nodules often with ulceration and necrosis in adults with equal distribution in both sex, commonly involving the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-5 \\]</u>. There can also be involvement of mucosal and other extra nodal sites, but involvement of lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Presence of such clinical features without previous history of lesions, suggestive of mycosis fungoides should arouse suspicion of CGDTCL. Previous case reports of involvement of brain and lungs have shown aggressive clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7-9 \\]</u>, but to our knowledge, there has been no case reported of such widespread skin lesions involving whole body, without any internal organ involvement.\n\n【12】CGDTCL has varied histological presentations including epidermotropic, dermal and subcutaneous. There is often more than one histological pattern present in different biopsy specimen from the same patient or sometime within a single biopsy specimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>. Histology may reveal proliferation of small, medium or large pleomorphic lymphocytes and can be associated with intra-epidermal vesiculation, necrosis, angiocentricity and angiodestruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Immunophenotypically, the tumor cells express CD3, CD2, CD56 (NK cell marker) with or without CD7 and strong expression of cytotoxic proteins (T cell intracellular antigen, granzyme, perforin). The cells are beta F1-ve, lack CD4 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , though CD8 <sup>+ </sup> may be expressed in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 12 \\]</u>. Our patient had CGDTCL with a rare phenotype of atypical cells positive for CD4 <sup>+ </sup> . In frozen sections, the tumor cells are strongly positive for TCR delta. Absence of beta F1 may be used to infer the origin of a gamma delta, if paraffin sections are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 13 \\]</u>. Genetic clonal rearrangement occurs for TCR gamma gene which can be confirmed with PCR.\n\n【13】CGDTCL is a belligerent disease which is resistant to treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy and radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. A study by Jorge et al concluded that 33 (n = 104) patients who tested positive for CGDTCL showed decreased survival when CGDTCL histologically involves the subcutaneous fat in comparison to only epidermal/dermal involvement (P < 0.0001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 11 \\]</u>. Results of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy were disappointing. Allogenic stem cell transplantation is the ultimate treatment option for such highly aggressive and lethal lymphoma by literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Incongruous to results of previous studies in literature, our patient was treated with TSEBT and responded very well. After radiation, her lesions were resolved and in remission now.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】In conclusion, we emphasize that CGDTCL not only presents involving extremities and less common mucosa and extra nodal sites but also with whole body involvement. Clinical features suggesting of mycosis fungoides should arouse the suspicion of CGDTCL. Sometimes, CGDTCL can have atypical cells expressing only CD4 positivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> responding very well to radiation therapy in contrast to present literature.\n\n【16】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【17】All authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (EF). Although its frequency is not high, clinicians have to keep in mind this condition because of high mortality rate in its severe cases. PPCM, even with a normal heart beat, may sometimes develop ventricular thrombus due to reduced EF and hypercoagulable status during the perinatal period.

Physical examination of the patient revealed pitting edema in both legs but no cyanosis.\n\n【5】Blood chemistry analyses revealed the following: mildly elevated white blood cell counts (9,220 cells/μL), mild anemia (red blood cell count, 431 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> cells/μL; hemoglobin, 11.2 g/dL), mild hypoproteinemia (5.5 g/dL), mild hypoalbuminemia (3.4 g/dL), mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245 IU/L), slightly elevated serum creatinine levels (0.84 mg/dL), and remarkably elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels (2,000 pg/mL). There was no evidence of coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time, 71%; activated partial thromboplastin time, 26.2 s).\n\n【6】Ultrasonography and non-contrast computed tomography were performed and revealed an edematous gall bladder and dilated hepatic and inferior jugular veins . Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with a cardio-thoracic ratio of 58%; moreover, there was evidence of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion . Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 130 beats/min, poor R progression in leads V1-V3, and inverted T wave in leads V4-V6. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle of 63 mm in diastolic phase and 58 mm in systolic phase with a reduced EF of 17% . Color Doppler revealed moderate mitral regurgitation. At this time, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy, which was consistent with PPCM.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In a US survey conducted between 2004 and 2011, the incidence of PPCM was 1 in 968 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, more than the Japanese rate of 1 in 20,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The definition of PPCM includes the following criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>: 1) onset of new congestive heart failure between 1 month before and up to 5 months after; 2) history of cardiac condition, 3) no other causes of heart failure; and 4) LVEF < 45-50%, LV fractional shortening of < 30%, and LV end-diastolic dimension/body mass index of > 27 mm/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【14】Etiology of PPCM is generally unrecognized; however, there are several presumable causes for PPCM, including viral infection, abnormal reactions in the immunology system, circulatory overload accompanied by pregnancy, and endocrine disorders. Considering the difference of incidence between the US and Japan, etiology of PPCM may chiefly depend on ethnicity. With the growing awareness of this disease, the number of cases diagnosed as PPCM is expected to increase. PPCM is also associated with the occurrence of myocarditis or potential dilated cardiomyopathy caused by cardiac overload in prenatal and postnatal period. Recent animal experiments focused on the association with prolactin or angiogenic growth factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The risk factors of PPCM include a multiple pregnancy, advanced age pregnancy, prolific childbirth, people of African descent, gestational hypertension, history of hypertension, smoking, obesity, and use of tocolytic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Among these factors, pregnancy hypertension is the biggest risk factor; approximately 57% of patients with PPCM are reported to have associated pregnancy hypertension, with no difference between races 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In 50% of patients with PPCM, cardiac function is restored, whereas 50% of patients have reduced cardiac function. In our case, the patient’s cardiac function did not improve, as observed on the 6-month follow-up. A small number of patients deteriorate and require heart transplant or risk death.\n\n【16】Treatment for PPCM in its acute phase is a standardized strategy for heart failure, including diuretic drugs, beta blockers, catecholamine, and mechanical circulatory support devices (intra-aortic balloon pumping and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support). In its chronic phase, oral drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretic drugs, are generally used. In patients with severe and refractory heart failure, heart transplant is required. In some patients with PPCM, immunosuppressive agents and anti-prolactin drugs are attempted. There is no established consensus or guideline on the cessation of medical treatment in the chronic phase.\n\n【17】Seventeen percent of PPCM cases are reported to have associated ventricle thrombus. This may be caused by the hypercoagulable status during the perinatal period or congestive blood flow with reduced cardiac function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Immediate anti-coagulant therapy is effective in reducing the ventricle thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It is unclear whether anti-coagulant therapy is necessary in congestive heart failure patients with a normal sinus rhythm because of hemorrhagic risks; anti-coagulant therapy is recommended for congestive heart failure patients in atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In patients with PPCM, administration of anti-coagulant agents should be considered to prevent thromboembolic complications due to the hypercoagulable status.\n\n【18】In our case, coagulation test was studied on day 10 when the left ventricle thromboses were evident, revealing elevated levels of plasmin-α2 plasmin inhibitor complex 1.9 μg/mL (normal levels < 0.8 μg/mL) and thrombin-antithrombin complex 3.6 μg/mL (normal levels < 3.0 μg/mL). This result might suggest that the overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Hence, reduction in thromboses in this patient was expected.\n\n【19】In our patient, upper abdominal pain at admission was due to congestive cholestasis. The mechanism of upper abdominal pain in patients with congestive heart failure is to occur mainly from the expansion of hepatic cells by elevated sinusoidal pressure caused by cholestasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. An additional mechanism of congestive heart failure due to gallbladder edema and infection may cause decreased blood flow in cystic artery, leading to acalculous cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Not only with imaging modalities but also with clinical symptoms and manifestation, it was crucial to recognize the presence of congestive heart failure in this patient.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】PPCM is one of the differential diagnoses in cardiomyopathy that occurs in perinatal or postnatal women. Clinicians should remember that PPCM may be associated with ventricle thrombus caused by the hypercoagulable state in the perinatal period or vascular congestion in reduced cardiac function. They should also remember that PPCM may present gastrointestinal symptoms due to liver congestion.\n\n【22】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It results from molecular defects in one of the proteins in cytoskeleton of RBC membrane. The disease, usually autosomal dominant, can also be inherited in autosomal recessive pattern. It manifests clinically as a triad of anemia, splenomegaly and jaundice. However, development of pulmonary thromboembolism in hereditary spherocytosis is unusual.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】An unmarried 36 year old male presented to us with chief complaints of left lower limb swelling and tenderness along with breathlessness on exertion for past 7 days. He was symptomatic for anemia 6 years back and was diagnosed as a case of moderate hereditary spherocytosis. At that time his upper GI endoscopy, barium meal study, direct and indirect Coomb’s test, methaemoglobin reduction test for G6PD, hemoglobin electrophoresis, Heinz body test, BT/CT/PT/PTTK was done with negative results. Osmotic fragility was increased. He underwent splenectomy with subsequent recovery. His mother and sister were screened for hereditary spherocytosis with negative result. No genetic studies were done.\n\n【4】The physical examination at the time of admission revealed tachycardia, tachypnoea, normotension with raised JVP. Systemic examination revealed right ventricular S3, clear lungs and mild tender hepatomegaly. Left lower limb showed superficial thrombophlebitis in the distribution of great saphenous vein. Homan’s sign was negative.\n\n【5】Lab investigations including complete blood count were unremarkable. Peripheral blood film was suggestive of spherocytosis with increased nucleated RBC’s and Howell Jolly bodies. ABG and thyroid profile was within normal limits. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with right ventricular strain pattern. Lower limb Doppler studies failed to show any evidence of thrombus in proximal veins. Chest x-ray and fundus examination were unremarkable. Echocardiographic studies revealed dilated RV and RA, PA pressure of 75, reversal of E/A ratio, dilated IVC with poor inspiratory collapse, LVEF of 60% and decreased RV systolic function. HRCT and CECT chest showed multiple pulmonary emboli in the left main pulmonary artery and descending branch of right pulmonary artery, wedge shaped infarct in left lower lobe of lung and RV mural thrombus. Patient was started on low molecular weight hepain shifting to oral anticoagulation later on with marked symptomatic improvement in clinical symptoms. He was investigated further for presence of various coagulation disorders.

There is some evidence from animal models that there may be a risk of thrombosis related to the abnormal red cells in mice, with both HS and hereditary elliptocytosis, but this has not, as yet, been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, the thrombosis risk is abolished in these mice by infusion of a small number of normal stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Some studies have shown that splenectomy done for treating hemolytic anemia predispose the patient to subsequent pulmonary thromboembolism.

Although the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension was believed to be a consequence of splenectomy, a recent report seems to challenge this notion, indicating that irrespective of whether they are splenectomised or not, the patients with haemolytic anaemia are predisposed to pulmonary hypertension probably secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Pulmonary embolism is increasingly recognized as an infrequent complication of splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anaemias.

This syndrome was first identified after medical treatment of peptic ulcer disease with milk and alkali was widely adopted at the beginning of the 20th century. With the introduction of histamine 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, the occurrence of MAS became rare; however, a resurgence of MAS has been witnessed because of the wide availability and increasing use of calcium carbonate, mostly for osteoporosis prevention. The aim of this review was to determine the incidence, pathogenesis, histologic findings, diagnosis, and clinical course of MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Here we present a case of a 54-year-old male who developed hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis after ingesting about 70 tablets of Tums and baking soda over a period of 3 days.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】A 54-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy alcohol use came to the emergency room complaining of abdominal pain for the past 2 days. The pain was in the epigastrium, and non-radiating. It was associated with nausea and multiple episodes of vomiting, which was non-projectile and non-bloody. On further questioning it was found that the patient was taking a large quantity of Tums and baking soda for the past 3 days for his abdominal pain.\n\n【5】On examination the patient was dehydrated and in distress. Initial pertinent lab findings were blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, calcium of 13.3 mg/dL, and bicarbonate of 49 mEq/L. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.61, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 48 mm Hg, and a pO <sub>2 </sub> of 53 mm Hg. UDS results were negative. The patient was placed in ICU due to his severe metabolic derangements and was hydrated with intravenous normal saline. The patient’s condition improved after 2 days of aggressive hydration. The follow-up labs showed calcium of 7.6 mg/dL, BUN of 13 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and bicarbonate of 26 mEq/L. He was now comfortable and subsequently discharged with outpatient follow-up.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced an antacid regimen designed to neutralize gastric acidity and promote the healing of peptic ulcer disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The regimen included the hourly administration of milk with Sippy powders(a powder containing 600 mg of magnesium carbonate and 600 mg sodium bicarbonate alternating with a powder containing 600 mg of bismuth carbonate and 1,200 to 1,800 mg of sodium bicarbonate) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 1936, a report associated hypercalcemia with alkalosis and kidney injury in patients treated with the Sippy regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

The syndrome was originally described in association with the use of milk and sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The most common causes of hypercalcemia are hyperparathyroidism and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. MAS is now considered the third most common cause of hypercalcemia with a prevalence of 9% to 12% among hospitalized patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. With the development of non-absorbable alkali and histamine 2 blockers for treatment of peptic ulcer disease, MAS became a rare cause of hypercalcemia; however, with the increased use of over the counter calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and supplementation, there is a revival of MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】In the era of introduction of antacids, MAS was common in patients with peptic ulcer disease. However, modern era calcium-alkali syndrome is now more common in postmenopausal women, pregnant women, transplant recipients, and dialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Long-term exposure to high calcium levels can result in nephrocalcinosis, tubular necrosis, and other structural changes. Hypercalcemia produces the following effects in the kidney: 1) vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>; 2) activation of the calcium-sensing receptor in the medullary thick ascending limb, which inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter causing natriuresis and blockade of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-dependent water reabsorption in the collecting duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The calcium-induced diuresis results in volume depletion, which stimulates the renal tubular absorption of bicarbonate. The combined effects of increased alkali intake, volume depletion, and decreased GFR lead to metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【12】Alkalosis may contribute to the maintenance of both volume depletion (by enhancing the activity of the calcium-sensing receptor) and hypercalcemia (by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule via the pH-sensitive calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid member 5 (TRPV5)). Volume depletion due to vomiting will also worsen the metabolic derangements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Treatment of MAS consists of withdrawing of the offending agent and hydration with intravenous isotonic saline and furosemide. Usually there is rapid clinical improvement and resolution of the metabolic derangements.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Patients who develop MAS have a good prognosis; however, they are often misdiagnosed. Detailed medication use history, including over the counter medications, should prevent MAS from escaping detection. MAS almost never results in death, but a significant number of patients may be left with permanent renal impairment, in the form of chronic renal disease.

It has a low rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, with hemorrhage (1.8 - 2.5 percent) and perforation (0.34 - 2.14 percent) being the most common.

Extra-colonic or visceral complications include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mesenteric injury and colonic volvulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Splenic rupture is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication. Not much documentation is found in the medical literature. For this publication a PubMed search was performed. It was reported by Wherry and Zhener in 1974 and so far less than 100 cases have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, with the increasing use of colonoscopy endoscopists, surgeons and radiologist will more often encounter this complication.\n\n【3】The most likely mechanism of injury is that of traction on the spleen by way of pre-existing adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This occurs during manipulation of the colon at the time of colonoscopy. Excessive spleno-colic adhesions, splenomegaly and other splenic pathology are therefore regarded as predisposing factors. Patients with a history of recent abdominal trauma are also at risk, as will be discussed below.\n\n【4】A delay in diagnosis has been noted in the literature, the main reason being the ignorance of many physicians regarding this potential negative outcome. Splenic rupture should be considered in all presentations of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability after colonoscopy, especially with a history of past surgical interventions and therefore potential spleno-colic adhesions. Patients with recent abdominal trauma should be screened with appropriate investigation beforehand.\n\n【5】We present two cases of splenic injury secondary to colonoscopy. The first is a 61-year-old male that was involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident one month prior to colonoscopy. The second is a 45-year-old female with no significant past medical history. Both presented with abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, a few hours after colonoscopy. Both warranted splenectomy as a lifesaving procedure.\n\n| Case Reports | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A fit 61-year-old male without significant medical history underwent colonoscopy as regular surveillance for a family history of bowel cancer. He had been involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident one month earlier, when his car had skid off the road into a tree. He self extricated, and did not suffer any major injuries. Paramedical staff attended to him and discharged him home in a stable condition. Persistent left sided chest pain was treated with simple analgesics.\n\n【9】The colonoscopy was uneventful, without difficulty, well tolerated and he was discharged home two hours post-procedure. Four hours post colonoscopy he developed abdominal pain, felt light headed and collapsed at home.\n\n【10】On admission to emergency department he was hypotensive (blood pressure 92/62, Hemoglobin 106 g/L). He complained of pain in the left shoulder (Kehr’s sign), had generalized abdominal pain and was acidotic (serum pH 7.2, lactate 3.43 mmol/L). Digital rectal examination and chest X-ray were normal . Resuscitation commenced with intravenous fluids and four units of packed red blood cells transfused. CT scan of the abdomen revealed a Grade III splenic hematoma with associated hemoperitoneum .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Unremarkable chest X ray. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 2. Hemoperitoneum with splenic hematoma. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, at which 4.5 Litres of blood was removed from the abdominal cavity. A ruptured subscapular hematoma was present at the lower pole of the spleen. A splenectomy was performed, delivering a 91 gram spleen with histologically confirmed rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient made an uneventful recovery.\n\n【14】Case 2\n\n【15】A healthy 46-year-old female presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain, radiating to the left shoulder. Six hours earlier, she had a colonoscopy for investigation of rectal bleeding and had a sigmoid polypectomy. On presentation the patient was hemodynamically unstable with pallor, diaphoresis, hypotension (blood pressure 84/58) and anaemia (Hemoglobin 107 g/L). Examination further revealed significant generalized abdominal tenderness with guarding in the left upper quadrant and a positive Kehr’s sign. A chest X-ray was normal without evidence of free intra-peritoneal air .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 3. CXR showing no free air under the diaphragms. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】Despite active resuscitation with 2 litres of saline, the patient remained hypotensive and developed tachycardia (pulse 120 per minute). Due to her unstable condition and inability to lie supine due to severe pain, CT abdomen was deferred. The patient had a diagnostic laparoscopy with follow on exploratory laparotomy, all of these performed within 3 hours of her initial presentation. An hemoperitoneum with clot formation in the left upper quadrant was encountered; this was due to a laceration of the lower half of the spleen leading to eventual splenectomy. Apart from 2 litres of blood loss, no other significant findings were encountered. She required 5 units of packed red blood cells to maintain end organ and tissue perfusion. She was discharged home seven days post-operative with a stable hemoglobin. The histology revealed a full thickness 4.5 cm laceration in an 88.8 gram spleen, consistent with a Grade III splenic injury .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 4. Full thickness splenic laceration with capsule stripping. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【20】No definitive pathophysiology has been established to explain the reason for splenic injury following colonoscopy. One proposed mechanism referred to traction on the splenocolic ligament (or previously formed splenocolic adhesions) leading to an avulsion related injury of the spleen. Another mechanism could be direct contact splenic trauma due to colonoscopic manipulation within the bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. The splenocolic adhesions are mostly found between the splenic angle of the colon and the spleen. It is suspected that these adhesions are stretched by the manipulation of the colon. Such can be “looping of the colonoscope” in the colon, a simple rotational manoeuvre to guide the colonoscope past the splenic and hepatic flexure, followed by gentle straightening of the scope. A forceful straightening may increase the tension on the splenocolic ligament, leading to tearing of blood vessels in the vicinity of inferior polar artery, without necessarily the ligament itself .\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 5. Excessive downward stretching of the splenocolic ligament can induce a tear in the splenic capsule and severe hemorrhage (courtesy of Dr Drago Popovic, Hervey Bay Hospital, Australia). |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【22】Patients with previous abdominal surgery are at a proposed increased risk for splenic injury due to the possibility of splenocolic adhesions. This is more commonly encountered in females. A review by Saad et al gives the risk ratio for females to males as 3.2:1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Another important consideration is the past history of trauma in patients due for colonoscopy. In our first case report, citing a patient with abdominal trauma a short while before the procedure, subacute subcapsular splenic hematoma could have been present, thus leading to splenic capsular rupture with minimal colonoscopic manipulation. A history of recent trauma should hence be considered a contributing factor to splenic rupture in post-colonoscopy patients and needs to be elicited from the history.\n\n【24】The presence of Kehr’s sign in a hemodynamically unstable patient is a very important indicator of splenic rupture. Nausea, vomiting with hypovolemia and sudden onset of anaemia post-colonoscopy is often associated with splenic ruptures. With these clinical signs and in the absence of visible hemorrhage per rectum, a splenic injury should be suspected and therefore treated as an emergency. Review of the literature indicates that most of these signs do appear within the first 24 hours following the procedure.\n\n【25】A contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen is the test of choice for the evaluation of splenic injury and most frequently reported (in 60 percent of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan exceeded 95% in several reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Ultrasonography is used less frequently (in 10.9 percent). It is an excellent tool and should be considered in all patients with hemodynamic instability. It is also a part of the ATLS protocol of investigation. A few cases of angiography have been reported (1.8 percent).\n\n【27】Diagnostic laparoscopy has been used in 23.6 percent of patient. This is especially significant in an hemodynamically unstable patient that requires a surgical exploration rather than a CT scan.\n\n【28】In the literature reviewed, splenectomy was the most commonly performed (67.9 percent), followed by conservative treatment (28.30 percent). One publication reported spleen rupture treated with arterial embolisation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Spleen rupture is a rare complication of the colonoscopy. Mild discomfort is common even hours after colonoscopy, but significant abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability following the intervention should warrant a high index of suspicion for splenic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.This is especially true for patients with previous surgical interventions causing potential splenocolic adhesions and for patients with previous history of abdominal trauma.\n\n【31】The significant sign of referred pain to the left shoulder tip as a result of diaphragmatic irritation can be present in up to 88 percent of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Although sensitive, it not very specific, as gas distension alone may cause this in 50 percent of patients post uncomplicated colonoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The presence of hemodynamic compromise however, makes it very specific for splenic injury.\n\n【32】CT scan is regarded as the best diagnostic modality and an appreciable help for choosing the best treatment option. The severity of injury will determine whether management should be non operative or splenectomy.\n\n【33】Competing Interests\n\n【34】The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【35】Authors’ Contributions\n\n【36】DP initiated the case series.

Intravesical therapy with BCG is generally considered safe, however, serious complications including hematuria, granulomatous pneumonitis, suppurative lymphadenitis, distant intramuscular and bone abscesses, hepatitis, and life-threatening BCG sepsis are well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, although late bacteriuria and sepsis due to BCG instillations, have not been described yet. The reported incidence of other than minor complications is under 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

Prevention of these complications requires implementing rules of good practice for the instillations. The undesirable side effects should be recognized early. Their treatment should be rapid and adapted to the patient. In order to prevent complications from BCG immunotherapy, a French study showed that side effects were significantly reduced by administration of ofloxacin after each instillation of BCG. The number of side effects requiring antitubercular treatment was also reduced in the patients in this study who had received ofloxacin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.

What we report, to our knowledge, is the first case of disseminated BCG infection causing septicemia and death 6 years after intravesical treatment with BCG therapy for bladder cancer.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】An 83-year-old man was hospitalized with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, anorexia and bleeding from a back drainage. The patient had previously undergone two trans-urethral resections receiving 12 intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations without any complications for a high grade transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Due to tumor progression he was performed a radical cystoprostatectomy 5 years earlier of this admission. He also had an endovascular stent-graft repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Six months before this new admission, he was diagnosed from multiple retroperitoneal abscesses in which mycobacterium bovis grew. Since then, the patient received a combination of antitubercular medication.\n\n【7】Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing man. Pulmonary and cardiac examinations were unremarkable. He complained of abdominal pain in the right flank. Laboratory tests revealed abnormal liver function tests, anemia, renal insufficiency, leukocytosis and signs of coagulation disorder. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a diffused and enlarged left psoas muscle. High doses of corticosteroids were associated to the antitubercular treatment. The patient developed a severe sepsis. Blood cultures were positive for acid-fast bacilli stains. Despite partial improvement, the course was complicated with a multiple organ failure, and the patient died two weeks after admission.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】Permanent increase in neoplasm incidence including bladder neoplasm makes physicians to search for new forms and methods of treatment that prevents either appearance and/or progression of the disease. Application of new preparations entails in many cases appearance of side effects which sometimes are difficult to manage and thus must be monitored constantly. To avoid complications which in case of BCG application are very burdensome and sometimes dangerous for patient, it is necessary to intervene in due time.\n\n【10】The BCG therapy has been effectively used in the management of superficial bladder cancers. It is especially useful as an adjuvant therapy following bladder surgery for cancer. For instance, Demkow et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, in a recent study, reported that nearly 66% of the patients who received intravesical BCG therapy following complete transurethral resection of a bladder tumor were cancer free after a median follow-up of 45 months.\n\n【11】Adverse events following intravesical BCG therapy are related to strain virulence, allergic reactions or to nosocomial urinary tract infections. BCG is a potent immunostimulator that exerts its urological effects by inducing a strong immune response and by causing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. A multicenter reviewed and studied complications on 1,278 patients after bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Cystitis occurred in 91% of the patients. Complications identified included fever in 50 patients (3.9%), granulomatous prostatitis in 17 (1.3%), bacillus Calmette-Guerin pneumonitis or hepatitis in 12 (0.9%), arthritis or arthralgia in 6 (0.5%), hematuria requiring catheterization or transfusion in 6 (0.5%), skin rash in 5 (0.4%), skin abscess in 5 (0.4%), ureteral obstruction in 4 (0.3%), epididymo-orchitis in 2 (0.2%), bladder contracture in 2 (0.2%), hypotension in 1 (0.1%), and cytopenia in 1 (0.1%). Deaths due to BCG sepsis and the high frequency of BCG-induced cystitis have compromised the use of BCG. However, with increased experience in applying BCG, the side-effects now appear to be less prominent. Serious side-effects are encountered in fewer than 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Major complications can appear after systemic absorption of the drug, therefore BCG should not be administered during the first 2 weeks after transurethral resection, in patients with hematuria and after traumatic catheterization. Morbidity secondary to intravesical BCG may present both locally and systemically. Most patients suffer a self-limited irritative voiding syndrome. Prevention of these complications requires implementing rules of good practice for the instillations. The undesirable side effects should be recognized early. Their treatment should be rapid and adapted to the patient. Besides the commonly seen side effects of intravesical BCG instillations, very rare complications have been reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

DCM is frequently associated with heart failure, cardiac rhythm abnormalities and intra-ventricular thrombus formation. If heart failure is intractable to drug therapy, heart transplantation is indicated. The particular pathophysiological mechanism leading to ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction is poorly comprehended. During the last few years, however, attention has been focused on abnormalities of contractile and structural myocardial proteins and on disorders of the mitochondrial energy metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A number of CMs were attributed to abnormal respiratory chain functions, particularly those caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\].\n\n【2】The heart contains abundant mitochondria, which constitute approximately 40% of total cardiomyocyte volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Their major function is the provision of energy in terms of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). ATP is required by the actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) for contraction and relaxation of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, membrane-bound ATPase utilizes ATP for depolarization and repolarization of cell membranes. Decreased ATP levels may thus not only impair contractility but may also lower the mitochondrial membrane potential and thus impair impulse generation and conduction along the cardiac conduction system, manifesting as arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Energy production in mitochondria involves five oligomeric complexes which are embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Bc1 is one of these complexes and composed of three catalytic subunits (cytochrome-b, cytochrome-c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein) and seven or eight non-catalytic subunits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Cytochrome-b plays a crucial role for the activity of the bc1 complex since it harbors two b-hemes and determines the shape of the two ubiquinone fixation sites. It is the only subunit of bc1 encoded by an mtDNA located gene. The cytochrome-b gene ( MT-CYB ) is located at nucleotide position 14747-15887, and is flanked by the tRNA genes for glutamic acid and threonine. It encodes a protein of 380 amino acids (AAs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Mutations in MT-CYB resulting in decreased complex-III-activity have been frequently described in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and experimental models \\[ 9 \\- 13 \\] of CM or heart failure. In order to elucidate the cause of DCM in a patient with a complex-III defect, MT-CYB was screened for pathogenic mutations in the proband and 100 healthy controls.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient is a 40-year-old male in whom DCM was diagnosed upon clinical, echocardiographic, and angiographic investigations, carried out in the Department of Cardiology, Rabta University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) of 65 mm; a fractional shortening (FS) of 23%; and an ejection fraction (EF) of 48%. Coronary angiography was normal. The control group comprised 100 healthy adult subjects. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Tunis (SN745556).\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Muscle histopathological and biochemical studies\n\n【8】Muscle specimens were obtained by open biopsy, frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Biochemical measurement of the ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NADH) dehydrogenase (complex-I), succinate-cytochrome-c-reductase (complex-II and complex-III), cytochrome-c-oxidase (complex-IV) and citrate synthase activities were done as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Cytochrome-b gene analysis\n\n【10】Total DNA was extracted from lymphocytes or from muscle tissue according to established methods. The fragment that overlapped the entire sequence of MT-CYB 通用删除7(英):<u>(14747-15887)</u> was attained by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with cytb-1F as the first forward primer (nucleotides 14667-14687), cytbTB-1R as the first reverse primer (nucleotides 15289-15269), cytb-2F as the second forward primer (nucleotides 15189-15209) and cytb-2R as the second reverse primer (nucleotides 15941-15921). PCR amplification was performed in a 50 volume containing 100 ng DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 4 µL MgCl <sub>2 </sub> , 5 µL dNTP, and 0.2 µL Taq polymerase. Conditions for DNA fragment amplification included 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 52 °C, 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C.\n\n【11】Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments\n\n【12】Direct sequencing of PCR fragments was conducted using an ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by using a Big Dye Terminator V.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied 4337455 (100 reactions)) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. All sequences were numbered according to the L-strand (the coding strand) of the Cambridge reference sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Prediction data\n\n【14】Mutated protein structures change due to biochemical differences of the AA variants (acidic, basic, hydrophobic) or due to the variant changing the protein sequence and affecting the tertiary or quaternary structure or the active site. To distinguish deleterious from functionally neutral mutations we used the PolyPhen algorithm, which predicts the pathogenicity of a specific variant by using a set of empirical rules, based on sequence, phylogenetic and structural information characterizing the variant. In addition to sequence alignments, PolyPhen utilises protein structure databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), Protein Quarternary Structure (PQS), Dictionary of Secondary Structure in Proteins (DSSP), or three-dimensional structure databases to assess if a variant affects the protein’s secondary structure, the interchain contacts, functional sites, or the binding sites.\n\n【15】Biochemical studies of the muscle homogenate revealed low activities of complex-II and -III but virtually normal complex-I and complex-IV activities  indicating a complex-III defect. Molecular analyses of muscle and lymphocyte mtDNA revealed the transition thymine for cytosine at np14757 , changing medium size and hydrophobic methionine (M) to medium size and polar (hydrophilic) threonine (T) (M4T). This mutation was not found in lymphocyte mtDNA of 100 healthy subjects without comorbidities or known genetic defect. A substitution of adenine for guanine at np15326, changing medium size and hydrophilic threonine (T) to small size and hydrophobic alanine (A) (T194A), was considered a neutral polymorphism based on previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n| Click to view | Table 1.

Accordingly, several studies found reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes in patients with DCM, where complex-III being the most frequently decreased \\[ 18 \\- 21 \\]. Most frequently cytochrome-b gene mutations were shown to be responsible for DCM, as confirmed by the regularly updated database Mitomap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Myocardial tissue from the index patient was not available for molecular genetic analysis, but screening of MT-CYB in skeletal muscle revealed a novel modification from the Cambridge mtDNA sequence (M4T) with slightly reduced complex-III activity. The mutation was absent in the control population and was not reported as neutral polymorphism despite sequencing of MT-CYB in 2,704 normal individuals from different ethnic backgrounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The physico-chemical properties of M and T residues are dissimilar. Methionine is medium hydrophobic and threonine is medium polar. The genetic code seems to have evolved towards minimising changes of the physico-chemical properties and to favor the rate of synonymous substitutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, suggesting that AA replacements resulting in a dissimilar AA are generally more deleterious than replacements resulting in an AA with similar properties.\n\n【24】We predicted the possible effect of the mutation on the structure and function of complex-III by using Polyphen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. As shown in Table 2 , the substitution was predicted as “possibly damaging”, suggesting that codon-4 might be under evolutionary selective pressure and that the 4M variant is likely to be functional.\n\n| Click to view | Table 2. Prediction Data of Mutations Detected in the Index Patient |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【26】The exact effects of the M4T mutation on the enzyme activity were difficult to elucidate. Previously reported missense mutations in MT-CYB impaired the assembly or stability of the complex, thus leading to either a dramatic decrease in the amount of assembled enzyme or to reduced catalytic activity of the complex with little effect on its assembly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Some mutations in MT-CYB were investigated in the yeast system. In humans, the G34S mutation has been reported in a patient suffering from exercise intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u> and the substitution of the corresponding glycine by aspartate led to extinction of the bc1 complex activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. The G339E mutation manifested as myopathy and the same mutation abolished the bc1 complex assembly in yeast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>. The G251D mutation, which substitutes a glycine by aspartate at np251 of MT-CYB , causes histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. This mutation is located in the intermembrane space loop connecting the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments. Analyses of myocardial mitochondria revealed a defect of the succinate cytochrome-c-oxidoreductase activity and of the cytochrome-b assembly, documenting the importance of residue 251 for proper bc1 function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Limitations of the study were that the mechanism by which the mutation determined the phenotype could not be demonstrated and that the OXPHOS enzyme analysis was not carried out in myocardial tissue.\n\n【28】In conclusion, the variant M4T in MT-CYB was considered pathogenic because it was consistent with the biochemical complex-III defect, it was not found in 100 healthy controls, and because it has not been reported as neutral polymorphism despite extensive sequencing of MT-CYB in 2,704 healthy individuals from different ethnic backgrounds. Future studies of transgenic mice with defined mutations may help assessing their contribution to the pathophysiological background of DCM.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology in Tunisia.

{"seq_id": "a5a6a18c-36d3-4242-8789-ab562d2c123c", "title": null, "text": "| Introduction | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【1】Cervical cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed gynecological cancer worldwide, 40% of which are diagnosed in women of childbearing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Traditionally, the standard of care for a patient diagnosed with cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy or chemoradiotherapy, both of which will lead to loss of fertility potential. As more women are delaying their childbearing for professional and financial reasons, many wish to consider fertility sparing treatment when diagnosed with early cervical cancer. Radical trachelectomy (RT) has been commonly performed for reasons to preserve fertility in young women with early cervical cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Case series suggest that RT is as efficacious as for the standard surgery of radical hysterectomy for the treatment of early cervical cancer with the added advantage of preserving fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-13 \\]</u>. The pregnancy rates following RT are encouraging; however, the resulting obstetric complications such as miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm premature ruptured of membrane (PPROM) and severe neonatal prematurity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> can be devastating. Before undergoing fertility sparing surgery, all women and their partners should be fully informed of their options for treatment, the risks of surgery, success and failure rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. The risk of premature labor is up to 20% of cases owing to ascending chorioamnionitis. This is attributed to the lack of cervical mucus plug after the cervix has been removed. Anatomically and physiologically, the cervix is important and necessary to conceive, hold a pregnancy and retain the pregnancy to term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Therefore, all pregnancies after RT are high risk for early pregnancy loss and preterm delivery. We present a case of a pregnancy conceived after vaginal RT complicated with PPROM and chorioamnionitis.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】Madam L is an otherwise healthy 35-year-old Caucasian primigravida with a history of having had a vaginal trachelectomy, cervical cerclage and laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy done in April 2012 for stage 1b1 cervical squamous cell carcinoma. She had had a spontaneous conception and received antenatal care privately. She presented at 23+5 weeks gestation for leaking of liquor. Speculum examination confirmed PPROM with an ultrasound showing oligohydramnios. She was admitted and given intravenous (IV) antibiotics (augmentin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole and erythromycin) for duration of 10 days before subsequently changing to IV vancomycin, amikacin and clindamycin at the subsequent development of signs and symptoms of chorioamnionitis.\n\n【4】She was then transferred to a public sector tertiary care center at 25+4 weeks gestation for further management in view of extreme prematurity. An obstetric ultrasound growth scan was done upon her arrival and showed an appropriately grown fetus with breech presentation. She was febrile and tachycardic with uterine tenderness. Emergency cesarean section was immediately performed due to maternal sepsis from chorioamnionitis. Risks of extreme prematurity were discussed with the multi-disciplinary team of neonatologists and perinatalogists. A pfannenstiel incision was made, and the cesarean section was carried out under regional anesthesia. Intra-operative findings reveal a broad lower segment. Decision was made to proceed with a transverse lower segment cesarean section. A baby girl weighing 890 g was delivered via breech extraction with an Apgar score of 4 at 1 min and 6 at 5 min of birth. There was significant hemorrhage requiring the use of carbetocin for uterine contraction. Uterine incision was repaired in two layers. The baby was subsequently transferred to NICU after intubation due to poor respiratory effort.\n\n【5】Placental swabs for culture and histology were sent in light of signs of severe chorioamnionitis. IV prophylactic antibiotics were continued post-operatively in order to prevent endometritis and risk of post-partum hemorrhage. The histology confirmed chorioamnionitis and funicitis with neutrophilic infiltration. Placenta culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to aztreonam and vancomycin respectively. At post-operative day 4, IV aztreonam and vancomycin were initiated due to rising serum C-reactive protein and total white cell count. Her post-operative recovery had been complicated by wound infection that required extended antibiotics and regular wound care in a hyperbaric clinic.\n\n【6】Madam L’s daughter also developed complications of extreme prematurity, with respiratory disorders such as hyaline membrane disease, pulmonary hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia; cardiovascular malformation such as patent ductus arteriosus; neurological problems such as meningitis and cerebral ischemic infarct; ophthalmological complications such as retinopathy and corneal perforation; and systemic Pseudomonas sepsis. Her prognosis was guarded and best supportive care was discussed.\n\n| Discussion | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Cervical cancer is commonly diagnosed in women of childbearing age years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. With earlier cervical cancer detection in women, fertility sparing surgery is increasingly performed. A series of studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> revealed the recurrence rate for cervical cancer to be 5.8% for radical vaginal trachelectomy versus 4.4% for radical hysterectomy. However, there was no significant statistical difference. The 5-year survival in both groups was 97% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Since the recurrence rate is low, women who wish to maintain their fertility can opt for such treatment.\n\n【9】Literature review has shown that pregnancies are possible after RT, with 41-79% of women able to conceive subsequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. However, the obstetric outcomes reported an increased incidence of preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, PPROM and miscarriages. Only 70-75% of pregnancies delivered at term. The rate of miscarriage in first trimester was quoted at 16-20%, similar to background population, but second trimester miscarriage rate was higher at 8-10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Undoubtedly, RT attributes to the increase in incidence of obstetric complications. However, no specific consensus or pregnancy management guideline after cervical surgery exists. Therefore, all pregnant women with history of cervical surgery should be followed up vigilantly by a high-risk obstetric team to reduce the risks and provide early intervention should complications arise, to ameliorate the situation.\n\n【11】There is no strong evidence in current literature that fetal growth and placental function is affected with respect to the neovasculization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> and healing process after an RT. In general, in an RT, cervix and upper vagina with a surrounding tissue of 1 - 2 cm cuff of paracervical tissues are removed. The descending branch of uterine artery is divided below the ureter. Once the specimen is fully mobilized, the cervix is amputated from the body of the uterus. An isthmic cerclage is then applied using non-absorbable suture. The main branch of uterine vessels is left undisturbed, it is therefore unlikely that the uterus and endometrium blood supply will be compromised. Women are advised not to conceive at least for the next 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Due to the absence of cervix, premature labor, PPROM and chorioamnionitis are not uncommon. Various measures have been proposed such as Wurm suture and Saling procedure to prevent ascending infection, this is however not promising due to subsequent anastomosis results in scaring and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】PPROM is a recognized complication and should be treated with 10-day course of erythromycin alone as a prophylactic antibiotic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. This has shown a statistically significant reduction in chorioamnionitis as well as a decrease in the number of babies born within 48 h and 7 days of PPROM onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. At present, there is no evidence to suggest the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as co-amoxiclav or in combination, as they have been associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. In addition, prolonged and over-zealous antibiotic regimes may inadvertently lead to emergence of nosocomial infection in pregnant women with PPROM and in neonates. PPROM may be preceded by infection which most commonly ascends from the lower genital tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Hence, screening for urinary tract infection, genital infections or even sexually transmitted infections should always be considered.\n\n【13】In 2003, Kenyon et al presented a systematic review which consists of 19 randomized controlled trials involving over 6,000 women and babies. The aim was to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects on maternal and fetal morbidity as well as childhood development, when antibiotics are administered to women with PPROM before 37 weeks. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in chorioamnionitis and a delay in delivery, and therefore support the use of antibiotics in PPROM. However, co-amoxiclav should be avoided because of increased risk in necrotizing enterocolitis. Royal college of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Greentop Guideline number 44, published in November 2006, also suggests oral erythromycin as the prophylactic antibiotic in PPROM.\n\n【14】Another case study conducted by Casetta et al in year 2003 looked at the emergence of nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection in pregnant women with PPROM and in neonates. Of the 63 women, 11 patients (17.5%) acquired P. aeruginosa vaginal colonization during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis, the duration of antibiotic treatment was one of the independent risk factors for acquisition of P. aeruginosa carriage. Of most concern, neonates of colonized mothers are associated with increased risk of fulminant sepsis and mortality. Most importantly attempt must be made to avoid broad spectrum antibiotics in PPROM as studies have shown that this encourages Pseudomonas infection. Instead of attempting to prolong the pregnancy in a septic environment for the fetus, delivery should be considered even at borderline viability when promising neonatal support is available. Advice from the high-risk obstetric team should be sought and timing of delivery was planned in pregnancies complicated with PPROM, should chorioamnionitis arise despite appropriate treatment of antibiotics. In Madam L’s case, once PPROM and chorioamnionitis was confirmed, delivery plan was made.\n\n【15】In the absence of clinical signs of chorioamnionitis, delivery should be considered at 34 weeks of gestation. Immediate delivery is warranted if signs and symptoms of chorioamnionitis are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. For Madam L, cesarean section was the only option for delivery due to previous RT and cerclage application. If spontaneous labor ensues, there is risk of severe antepartum hemorrhage from cervical tear with lateral extension to uterine vessels that may lead to maternal compromise. Shepherd emphasized in his paper 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> that in any woman with a history of RT, delivery must be done via a classical cesarean section using a low vertical incision owing to the absence or extreme narrowing of the lower segment. In addition, this area is usually significantly fibrosed. If a transverse incision is made into the “presumed” lower segment, one runs the risk of lateral extension and tearing through the uterine vessels causing major hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In our case, a transverse cesarean section was chosen as the lower segment was judged to be sufficiently broad. This was successfully performed without any major complications. The method of cesarean section should be individualized on case by case basis. As obstetricians will encounter more of such cases, a comprehensive protocol should be formulated.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Due to the increasing feasibility of the RT and favorable pregnancy rates, we will encounter more cases in the future. At present, there is no general consensus on how pregnancies should be managed under such circumstances. However, expert opinion suggests all pregnancies after RT should be managed in high risk obstetric clinic with close surveillance owing to its recognized obstetric complications. In some studies, attempts have been made to leave part of the endocervix intact while others have tried closure of the cervical os to prevent ascending infection and pre-term labor. These have not been proven successful and some centers may provide such options if there are such expertise available. Despite all efforts and attempts to prevent premature labor and PPROM, such obstetric complications may still arise. These should be managed based on individual institution guidelines and plan for delivery should be discussed despite extreme prematurity. Erythromycin should be given in cases of PPROM based on the RCOG green-top guidelines and cesarean section arranged in the event of chorioamnionitis. While classical cesarean section with a low vertical incision is recommended due to the risk of lateral extension of a transverse incision leading to uterine vessel injury and massive hemorrhage. The decision should be individualized on case by case basis and senior obstetrician input is necessary.\n\n【19】Grant\n\n【20】None.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Collateral history obtained suggested changes in personality and behavior from pre-morbid baseline which include disorganized behavior, increasing agitation and poor coping over a 4-week period. A brain CT was normal. An electroencephalography (EEG) showed moderately diffuse slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with glucose and protein within the normal range. Her serum and CSF were sent to screen for infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic cause of encephalitis which were all subsequently negative . She was commenced on levetiracetam and intravenous acyclovir .\n\n| Click to view | Table 1. List of Investigations and Results |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1. Timeline of the case report. |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】On day 2, her symptoms deteriorated rapidly. She evolved into a state of mutism, unpredictable episodes of extreme agitation and a dramatic deterioration in social conduct. Further EEG studies and brain imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable. She was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone on day 2.\n\n【7】On day 3, her symptoms deteriorated further. She became increasingly confused with intermittent episodes of psychomotor excitation and abrupt stereotyped movement. She was assessed by the liaison psychiatry team. On mental state examination, the patient was sitting abnormally still with minimal interaction. She was verbally unresponsive to majority of the questions. She had a fixed stare with occasional shifts of attention. There was no evidence of posturing. When she did verbalize, there was evidence of intermittent echolalia. There was evidence of abrupt repetitive motor activity, i.e. abruptly standing on the bed followed by tumbling forwards. There was evidence of automatic obedience and ambitendency, i.e. she was observed to be stuck in mid-way from standing to sitting position for several minutes. She scored 16 out 69 on a Bush-Francis catatonia rating scale.\n\n【8】Her condition deteriorated further on day 12 with worsening agitation which required sedation to manage the challenging behavior due to risk of self-injury. She was commenced on regular olanzapine at this stage. Methyprednisolone was stopped after 5 days and was switched to oral prednisolone. On day 9, she was commenced on intravenous immunoglobulins for 5 days with no response. On day 15, she developed symptoms of autonomic instability which include episodes of bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypoventilation. She was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in which she required intubation and full assisted ventilation. In ICU, she had five sessions of plasmapheresis with a trial of weekly rituximab. She responded well to the combination of plasmapheresis and rituximab. There was a difficulty in weaning off sedation initially due to her challenging behavior which required high-dose olanzapine. She gradually improved and was transferred to the ward after 32 days in ICU. On re-assessment, she had residual emotional lability with poor abstraction. She received full score on Addenbrooke’s cognitive assessment (ACE-R). She was discharged from hospital on day 62 on prophylactic antiviral, reducing prednisolone, levetiracetam and olanzapine. She was reviewed 10 days post-discharge. Her mental state was stable, and had improved concentration with normal behavior.

We report a case of parasitic infection Anisakiasis, which affects the large intestine.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A woman of 51 years of age attended the emergency department for acute abdominal pain localized in right iliac fossa. The personal background of the patient includes gallstones and cholelithiasis. The patient has a family history of colon cancer (two brothers). At physical examination the patient had good general condition, no fever without spontaneous pain. On palpation, she showed a globular abdomen at the level of right upper quadrant, with tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Blumberg's sign was negative. Laboratory tests showed 12,000 leukocytes without neutrophilia or eosinophilia. The other values were normal. Radiological techniques demonstrated a thickening of the right bowel wall without occluding the light with ascitic fluid. With suspicion of intestinal cancer in the right colon, colonoscopy was performed, which demonstrated no tumor process that emerges from the intestinal mucosa. Since the patient remained in severe pain, along with clinical suspicion and family history of bowel cancer, right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis was performed. The macroscopic study and the opening of the surgical specimen showed an increase in thickness of the wall. We show the level of the mucosa in an area slightly eroded, with the presence of an elongated structure, 1 cm in length, which penetrated the mucosa intestinal (we suggested a parasite) . Histological study of intestinal thickening showed a slightly eroded mucosa, edema at the level of the submucosa with vascular congestion. At the level of deep and superficial muscle layer, an intense acute inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils was identified. At the level of blood extravasation, there was serous mesothelial hyperplasia . Histological examination of the filamentary structure corresponded with a parasitic nematode, showing a thick cuticle, neural cord, and gastrointestinal structure . With all these findings the diagnosis was made of Anisakiasis of the colon. No evidence of malignant tumor process was seen. The patient reported taking fish in the last month. The patient did not show alterations in relation to infection after 6 months.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

These crustaceans are eaten by a fish or cephalopods such as octopus or squid, staying the nematode in the gut wall, into the muscle or under the skin. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked fish \\[ 1 \\- 8 \\]. Three species of Anisakis larvae are pathogenic to humans: Anisakis simplex, Pseudoterranova decipiens, and Contracaecum. The areas with the highest incidence of cases caused by Anisakis are Japan, Netherlands and South America, although in recent years there has been a surge in non-endemic countries caused by an exchange of food cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The highly variable clinical manifestations, digestive disorders are more common as right iliac fossa pain, obstruction, abdominal pain, vomiting, epigastric pain and bleeding. They may also have allergic skin reactions in the form of generalized papular erythema. These symptoms are caused by local action of the parasite causing gastrointestinal disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE \\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]. According to laboratory values, the eosinophilia is not usually present in the gastric or intestinal Anisakiasis as showing in most cases, and leukocytosis is not usually present in the intestinal involvement as in our case. Serological diagnosis and skin testing are important in acute and chronic cases. Elisa Western Blott, monoclonal antibodies, eosinophilic cationic protein and IgE determination to Anis 1 are used.\n\n【11】The differential diagnosis should be performed with numerous processes such as eosinophilic enteritis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ischemia, tuberculosis and malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】There are studies to control the growth of the disease and control mechanisms and prevention.

While hemorrhagic complications remain the most common adverse effects, the prevalence of drug reactions in patient on anticoagulants has been estimated to be between 0.01% and 7.5% \\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]. As DOACs are increasingly utilized over time, several spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions have become apparent in the recent pharmacovigilence systems. Early recognition of these drug reactions such as drug eruptions, vasculitis and angioedema to DOACs is critical to allow for timely management and treatment of symptoms as well as to prevent more severe adverse events such as limb ischemia, amputation or death \\[ 8 \\- 12 \\].

Verbal consent was obtained during routine clinical care encounter which was then documented in the medical records along with the use of images provided by the patient in this case report.\n\n| Case Report | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【3】A 63-year-old African American man with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, aneurysm of iliac artery and prostate cancer presented to the emergency room (ER) with chief complaint of back pain rated as 9 on 10 on pain scale. Patient was being followed by outside oncologist for ongoing radiation therapy since December 2018. Patient also reported experiencing decrease in appetite with some nausea, taste alterations and > 8% weight loss over 2 months. Patient had no known drug or food allergies. Patients’ risk factors for VTE include obesity (body mass index (BMI), about 40.31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), chronic tobacco use, increased age (> 60 years) and driving for long periods of time. Chest computed topography (CT) scan revealed right lower lobe pulmonary embolism with associated opacity and atelectasis. Upon admission, patient’s liver function tests (LFTs) were within normal limits. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed low hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (elevated).\n\n【4】Patient was placed on intravenous heparin drip. Inpatient medications included ondansetron, hydrocodone prn for pain, and ketorolac for muscle relaxation. He also received one dose of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone on day 2 of hospital admission. At this time, patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, thereafter to be continued as 20 mg daily. Patient was discharged on day 11 and consult for pharmacist-led anticoagulation clinic was placed. On day 23, patient called the primary care provider to report that he developed generalized urticaria that appeared every couple of hours. These reactions were intermittent and self-limiting that usually appeared 1 - 2 h after taking rivaroxaban and were not specific to an area of body and moved across different areas of patients’ body. Patient also reported to have swollen hands. Some symptoms such as itching associated with rash were alleviated with the use of diphenhydramine 50 mg 2 - 3 times a day; however, no relief was reported with the swelling in his hands. Patient denied any changes in soap, detergents or intake of new food items. Patient was on low residual diet for recent small bowel obstruction. No new medications were started since the hospitalization other than rivaroxaban. Patient was instructed to continue rivaroxaban at this time along with diphenhydramine for symptom relief by the primary care provider and advised to call in case of worsening symptoms.\n\n【5】On day 25, patient woke up with generalized urticarial with erythema (raised plaques also known as wheals), swollen hands and feet. This quickly progressed to angioedema manifested as shortness of breath, bronchospasm as well as swelling of tongue and face and was immediately taken to ER at nearby hospital. These symptoms were confirmed based on the medical chart documentation by ER physician. The causality assessment is not very accurate due to lack of availability of serum biomarkers/immunoassay tests. Patient was discharged from the ER with prescription for 5 days of prednisone 20 mg. CBC was within normal limits; however, differential count was not checked. LFTs were not available for assessment either.\n\n【6】At the time, the patient was switched to dabigatran 150 mg twice daily as he could not afford to travel 2 h for international normalized ratio (INR) check and refused to take warfarin. On day 36, 10 days after dabigatran initiation, patient called the anticoagulation clinic pharmacist to report that 10 - 15 min after ingestion of dabigatran, he experienced rash with hand swelling. Patient denied swelling of lips, tongue or throat as well as shortness of breath or wheezing. Upon examination by medical provider, patient was confirmed to have developed pruritic morbilliform exanthamas eruptions on his elbows, axillae and lower extremities accompanied by swelling of hands . Patient had repeat LFTs and CBC which were all within normal limits. Laboratory abnormality if present would have been likely shadowed due to prednisone use. Patient continued to use diphenhydramine 2 - 3 times per day that provided some relief with the rash but did not help with the swelling. Patient was seen at the anticoagulation clinic for further management and providing counselling on available anticoagulation therapy options. With the help of social worker, patient was approved to have his labs done at a nearby hospital to avoid commuting long distance for INR monitoring. Patient was provided in depth education and was switched to warfarin with enoxaparin bridge on day 40. Patient’s cutaneous manifestations as well as swelling of extremities resolved 1 week after the drug discontinuation. At day 50, patient’s INR was 3 and enoxaparin was discontinued. Patient has remained stable on warfarin since then and continues to deny any skin reactions or swelling. Patient was assessed against Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale for both rivaroxaban and dabigatran.\n\n| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Anticoagulants-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. With superior risk-benefit profile and simpler dosing regimen, DOACs are being increasingly utilized over warfarin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Angioedema is characterized by localized rapid swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous or submucosal tissues of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract manifested as swelling of oral cavity, tongue or larynx leading to life-threatening airway obstruction and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. A variety of adverse drug reactions including angioedema (three of the 22,222 DOAC-treated patients) have been reported in the patients taking DOACs in the pivotal randomized clinical trials \\[ 17 \\- 20 \\]. Currently there are at least two published case reports that specifically link rivaroxaban with angioedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. According to the monograph, the incidences of cutaneous reactions reported in the clinical trials were: blisters (1.4%) and pruritis (1.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Overall incidence of cutaneous manifestations and anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock associated with factor-XA inhibitors reported is < 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In one of the case reports of rivaroxaban-induced angioedema, patient experienced generalized urticarial, erythema, severe pruritus and angioedema of orbital area and lips along with shortness of breath an airway obstruction. The drug was promptly discontinued, and patient was managed with supportive oxygen, IV antihistamines and methylprednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In another case report, rivaroxaban-induced hypersensivity syndrome manifested as rash, and hepatic cytolysis was reported along with histopathological evidence of spongiotic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytes and eosinophilic infiltrates. The authors suggest that the causative effect of rivaroxaban can be established with more certainty in this case than other cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. According to the eHeathme database of 137,932 people who experienced side-effects to rivaroxaban, about 88 patients (0.06%) report experiencing angioedema. Patients who are older than 60 years of age, female, who have been taking the drug for less than 1 month, who are on concomitant aspirin and have past medical history of stroke seemed more prone to experiencing angioedema. Of note, the risk of experiencing angioedema is 80% in the first month and is reduced to 0% after 5 years of initiating rivaroxaban 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Dabigatran-induced morbilliform exanthamas has been reported as the most common drug reaction. Patients have reported to have isolated or diffuse pruritic, palpable purpura on trunk and limbs which resulted in discontinuation of dabigratran. In both cases, patient was switched to warfarin. The reaction resolved in 5 - 7 days after dabigatran discontinuation. It is pertinent to note that in most of the cases, the drug reaction was not confirmed using serum biomarkers for allergic reactions or skin testing neither were the patients re-challenged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Our case study provides an advantage over previously published case reports as we not only report rivaroxaban-induced urticarial and angioedema but also the evidence of cross-reactivity to dabigatran. This can provide further information to the clinicians when considering alternative treatment in the patients who develop adverse drug reaction to one of the agents in the drug class. Initially dabigatran was chosen assuming its difference in pharmacodynamics compared to rivaroxaban. It would be useful to see if patients in this scenario can benefit from using apixaban. In our case, since the patient had experienced adverse drug reaction to two out of three available DOACs at our facility, it was decided not to challenge patient with apixaban.\n\n【11】Well-documented case reports are essential component of post marketing safety surveillance; however, they typically suggest a probable reaction based on the Naranjo score and are inadequate for making causal inferences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. A recently published cohort case-crossover study by Connolly and colleagues, aimed to quantify the association between DOACs and angioedema relative to warfarin in AF patients who were drawn based on study eligibility from three different databases. This cohort reported 249 incident angioedema events among 267,681 DOAC users and 281,143 warfarin users with an average follow-up of 89 days. The hazard ratio for metanalysis of the results from three different databases comparing any DOAC versus warfarin was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 - 1.2). The odds ratio for association between warfarin and angioedema in the case-crossover design was 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 - 1.21) based on 431 cases. This study did not observe a large relative increase in the angioedema rate comparing DOACs with warfarin. These findings seemed to suggest a much smaller increase in risk as compared to the previously published case reports and the pivotal trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. There have been at least four cases of hypersensitivity reaction case reports published with rivaroxaban, and six case reports associated with dabigatran; however, there were not many reported cases with apixaban until recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Two patient cases were identified that reported adverse drug reactions associated with apixaban. In one case, patient experience cutaneous adverse drug reaction secondary to apixaban leading to cessation of the medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. In the other case, patient experienced angioedema with significant laryngeal edema without presence of urticaria or pruritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】With a score of 7 out of possible 13 points on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u> for rivaroxaban and 8 points for dabigatran 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 2 , www.journalmc.org)</u>, causality between rivaroxaban/dabigatran and the observed clinical events are deemed probable in our patient case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. We believe that our case report can help highlight the rare adverse drug reactions associated with the DOACs to create vigilance and help with prompt intervention by clinicians.\n\n【13】Implication on clinical practice\n\n【14】Early identification and treatment of these drug reactions is critical in avoiding escalation to morbidity and mortality. Well-documented case reports that provide further clinical evidence and increase awareness amongst the clinicians treating patients with DOACs specially with the rapid increase in its use are important.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】In this report, we have described a case of rivaroxaban-induced urticaria and angioedema manifested by severe pruritic rash, swelling of tongue and face as well as shortness of breath and bronchospasm. We further provide evidence of possible cross-reaction to dabigatran which in our patient manifested as morbilliform exanthamas along with swelling of hands. The pharmacologic mechanism by which DOACs might lead to angioedema is unclear. Further evidence to establish presence or absence of cross-reaction to apixaban may provide useful information in guiding clinical decisions when treating patients on DOACs who provide challenge for warfarin use. Additionally, use of skin patch testing at different concentrations to all factor-Xa inhibitors under direct medical supervision can also be considered given the severity of reaction to the suspected agent. Furthermore, use of immunoglobulin E specific testing may confirm the causal relationship between DOACs and these adverse drug reactions. DOACs are structurally different and the manifestations developed also differ in pathologies. Hence future studies are necessary to explore the implications on clinical practice in patient developing adverse drug events to one of the DOACs.\n\n| Supplementary Material | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Supplementary Material 1.
