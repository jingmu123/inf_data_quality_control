Immunodeficiency is the only well-documented risk factor. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of PCNSL in immunocompetent patients. Although the overall incidence remains low, there has been an increase in the number of cases over the past 3 decades, particularly in immunocompetent individuals \\[ 2 \\]. Owing to the low incidence of PCNSL, it has been difficult to establish the optimum treatment protocol for this disease \\[ 3 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 44-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented in April 2009 to his general practitioner with numbness in his left arm, and subsequently his left leg, causing him to limp with no significant discomfort. A brain MRI scan revealed a right hemisphere small ill-defined mass in the posterior centrum ovale and extending inferiorly towards the basal ganglia ( Fig. 1A ), which was considered to be inflammatory.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (A).

An MRI scan at that time demonstrated that the ring-enhancing lesion had increased in size and developed central cavitation ( Fig. 1B ). From this time the patient began to clinically deteriorate with increasing left hemiparesis. On examination he had marked left upper motor neuron facial weakness, and power was 3/5 and 4/5 in the left arm and leg respectively.\n\n【8】In November 2009, the patient suddenly deteriorated, with an abrupt loss of sensation in the left arm and impairment of coordination in the left leg. There was no headache, dizziness, visual or hearing impairment. Clinical examination revealed fixed-flexion of the left arm, and brisk reflexes in the left lower limb accompanied by an up-going plantar reflex. Cranial nerve examination was normal, except for the previously reported left-sided weakness of the face, which was now accompanied by a loss of sensation. A third MRI scan demonstrated further progression, with increased size of the mass (2 cm), cavitation, and irregular thick ring enhancement ( Fig. 1C ).\n\n【9】At this time routine haematological examination was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was also within normal limits with an opening pressure of 12 cm (10 - 25 cm), 1.33 g/L protein (< 0.4g/L), 3.9 mmol/L glucose (2.8 - 4.4 mmol/L), normal cytology, negative bacterial culture and gram stain. No monoclonal or oligoclonal bands were detected and polymerase chain reaction for Toxoplasma, Cryptococcus, syphilis, hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Anti-nuclear, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic, anti-mitochondrial, anti-smooth muscle, anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies were all negative. CSF angiotensin-converting enzyme however, was elevated at 115 U/L (< 1.2 U/L). Human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies were negative.\n\n【10】A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed, which identified a mass on the lower pole of the right kidney measuring a maximum diameter of 6.6 cm. The possibility of renal cell carcinoma with cerebral metastases was considered, but renal biopsy revealed a diagnosis of an incidental oncocytoma.\n\n【11】Dexamethasone 6 mg TDS was initiated leading to a significant clinical improvement. Due to the development of intolerable side effects, the steroid dosage was gradually reduced to 2 mg BD, and azathioprine therapy was initiated. However, due to adverse effects (hepatic dysfunction), azathioprine was discontinued after one week.\n\n【12】Three months later the patient was admitted with weakness in the left side of the face, left arm (particularly the fingers) and left leg. On examination, there was marked weakness and hypertonia, and reflexes were brisk throughout the left side. Sensation was impaired in both the upper and lower left limbs, particularly light touch and pin-prick. The MRI at this stage revealed that the pre-existing lesion was of similar size but had become less discrete, and with less contrast enhancement but greater restricted diffusion ( Fig. 1D ).\n\n【13】In addition to the neurological features mentioned, the patient also complained of lethargy and dyspnoea on mild exertion together with episodes of epistaxis and per rectal bleeding. He did not report any weight loss or night sweats and there was no clinical evidence of lymphadenopathy. The full blood count demonstrated a pancytopaenia with 8.4g/dL haemoglobin (13 - 18 g/dL), 105.3 fL mean corpuscular volume (76 - 96 fL), 86 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L platelets (150 - 400 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and 4.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L leukocytes (4 - 11 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【14】In view of the patient’s deteriorating haematological profile bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were performed. The bone marrow aspirate demonstrated abnormal mononuclear cells, the morphology favouring a haematopoietic process (for example, large cell lymphoma). There was also evidence of hemophagocytosis and erythroid hyperplasia, accounting for the anaemia. There was a grossly abnormal cellular infiltrate raising the possibility of haematological malignancy. Trephine biopsy revealed small clusters of cells in keeping with marrow involvement by DLBCL.\n\n【15】The patient was initiated on rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone therapy for treatment of PCNSL with bone marrow involvement. Two further brain MRI scans in May and July 2010 showed poorer definition of the lesion, which had remained constant in size, but with greater surrounding oedema ( Fig. 1E, F ). Unfortunately, the patient’s symptoms progressed to include visual impairment, and power on the left side deteriorated to 0/5 throughout. Treatment was complicated by several episodes of neutropenic sepsis, from one of which the patient died, two months later.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】* * *\n\n【18】This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of a rare, but increasingly encountered condition in immunocompetent hosts \\[ 3 \\]. Owing to the relative rarity of PCNSL, it has proved difficult to study, and the optimum treatment strategy has yet to be determined \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】Clinical manifestations of PCNSL include neuropsychiatric signs, raised intracranial pressure, seizures, ocular symptoms and other focal deficits \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. The so-called, ‘B symptoms’ include weight loss, fever and night sweats, and are rarely encountered at initial presentation \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【20】Neuroimaging is important in the diagnosis of PCNSL, with contrast-enhanced MRI being the modality of choice \\[ 4 \\]. Lesions may be multiple, and may resemble inflammatory and infectious diseases, as well as other neoplastic processes \\[ 1 \\]. PCNSL masses have acquired the pseudonym of “ghost tumours”, as radiological changes may disappear, particularly after corticosteroid therapy \\[ 1 \\]. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by stereotactic biopsy, although this is sometimes unnecessary owing to the presence of lymphomatous cells in the CSF \\[ 1 \\]. Glucocortcoid therapy may obscure the histological diagnosis, so steroids should not be administered (pre-biopsy) if PCNSL is likely \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【21】The development of effective chemotherapy regimens has meant that a proportion of patients may achieve remission. Relapse however, is a common occurrence, and only 20-30% of patients are cured \\[ 1 \\]. The spontaneous remission of symptoms that occurred initially in this case is an extremely unusual occurrence, and may impose a significant diagnostic challenge in cases with PCNSL. Consequently, this patient’s symptoms were initially considered to be due to an inflammatory or demyelinating process, culminating in a delay in the initiation of appropriate cytotoxic therapy.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of PCNSL in the case described was not established until symptoms of bone marrow involvement had developed. The incidence of systemic involvement following PCNSL is controversial, with some studies suggesting that extensive staging is unnecessary \\[ 1 \\]. However, investigation for occult systemic disease is increasingly undertaken, with full body CT scanning and bone marrow biopsy now recommended for staging of PCNSL \\[ 3 \\]. Testicular ultrasonography may be performed in elderly males, as testicular lymphoma frequently disseminates to the brain \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】The incidence of PCNSL in immunocompetent hosts is increasing. Spontaneous remission of symptoms is unusual, but can occur, and should not discourage a differential diagnosis of PCNSL if consistent with clinical and radiological findings. Extra-neural disease is increasingly recognised in PCNSL, and patients should undergo thorough staging to exclude systemic disease.\n\n【25】**Declaration**\n\n【26】The authors declare no competing interest.\n\n【27】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Considered one of the very few dermatological emergencies, it comes with a high mortality rate where patients often succumb to the illness from thrombosis \\[ 1 \\]. It was first described in 1884 by Guelliot in children \\[ 1 \\]. It can manifest in three forms: neonatal, idiopathic, and the more common infectious variety, which can be secondary to mostly bacterial, and rarely viral, etiology \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【4】Vasopressin is a vital stress hormone released internally in cases of low perfusion state like shock \\[ 3 \\]. It is considered a second-line pressor agent in critically ill patients where perfusion is essential to maintain life. Dermatological side effects are rarely reported and are mostly limited to skin necrosis \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【5】Here we describe a unique case of PF induced by vasopressin with resolution of skin manifestations after discontinuation of the inciting agent.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】**Investigations**\n\n【9】A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (unknown type) and methamphetamine abuse (inhalation, intravenous) presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mentation. He was found to be tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypothermic in the ED, with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 10. There was documented use of recent methamphetamine use. On the initial physical exam, he was noted to be a disheveled man, obtunded, and confused. The rest of the systemic physical examination was unremarkable. Labs on admission are shown in Table 1 . Notable findings were elevated leucocytes, increased lactic acid, increased procalcitonin, increased anion gap, severely decreased bicarbonate levels, and elevated serum creatinine.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Initial Laboratory Values on Admission_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】**Diagnosis**\n\n【12】Meeting 4/4 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, he was started on intravenous (IV) fluids as per sepsis protocol and initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics-vancomycin and zosyn. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol was commenced with IV fluids and IV insulin. Subcutaneous heparin was initiated as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【13】Initially, on admission, his lowest recorded blood pressure (BP) was 96/62 mm Hg with mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 73 mm Hg. Because of increasing respiratory demand in the background of encephalopathy, he was intubated the following morning. He became hypotensive after intubation with an MAP of 52 mm Hg and was started on norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Later that afternoon, vasopressin and phenylephrine were added due to increasing norepinephrine requirement with persistently low MAP. Phenylephrine was discontinued later that night, while vasopressin was continued until the next day. When the patient was reexamined in the morning, he was found to have sharply demarcated non-blanching purpura on the base of the penis, diffusely over the scrotum, bilateral knees, bilateral anterior distal lower limbs, with an area of necrosis in the right lateral knee, measuring approximately 1 × 1 cm ( Fig. 1a-d ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Skin findings the morning following initial vasopressin use. (a) Left lower leg. (b) Right lower leg. (c) Right lateral knee. (d) Scrotum._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】**Treatment**\n\n【16】Labs on the next morning are shown in Table 2 . There was a significant drop in platelet count with persistently elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with improving lactic acid values, anion gap, and serum creatinine. Blood cultures came back positive for _Klebsiella pneumonia_ and antibiotics were tapered down to zosyn alone. Heparin was held and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) panels were sent. Pressor use thereafter ranged from norepinephrine, and phenylephrine, to no pressors, as his day-to-day MAP was labile. While awaiting HIT and DIC results, platelets count continued to drop daily, from 74,000 to 52,000, to 31,000, and to 12,000 within the following 48 h.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 2.** Laboratory Values on the Second Day of Hospitalization_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】A peripheral smear stained with Wright’s stain was sent. It showed normocytic normochromic anemia with anisocytosis, including schistocytes (accounting for approximately 1% of the red blood cells), nucleated red blood cells, severe thrombocytopenia, and mature neutrophilia with unremarkable morphology ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Peripheral blood smear with schistocyte marked._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】After consulting hematology, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ADAMTS13 levels were also obtained as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was considered as a possibility ( Table 3 ). The haptoglobin level was normal and there was no elevated bilirubin level which argued against the possibility of hemolytic anemia and overall TTP was considered unlikely.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 3.** Laboratory Values_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【25】Over the subsequent week, the patient’s need for vasopressors subsided, and most of the purpura, although not entirely resolved, had significantly improved, as shown in Figure 3a-d . One important thing to mention here, all throughout this time he did not require vasopressin anymore and for pressor support was only put on norepinephrine as needed. His labs also got significantly better with near normalization of platelets, WBC, and creatinine levels. His condition improved throughout hospitalization, and he was subsequently discharged to long-term rehabilitation unit. After being discharged from the rehab, he has been lost to follow-up as he never showed up for his subsequent outpatient clinic visits.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Skin findings 9 days after initial vasopressin use.

As it is a rarely encountered disease, articles describing this diagnosis are commonly case reports or case series \\[ 3 \\]. It may manifest in three forms: neonatal (a hereditary deficiency of anticoagulants), idiopathic (a postulated post-infectious autoimmune disorder), and acute infectious (seen in severe acute sepsis) \\[ 3 \\]. In addition, DIC, HIT, and acute hepatic failure (AHF) have been reported to be the most prevalent associated causes of this rare cutaneous phenomenon \\[ 8 \\]. Few medications have been implicated in literature precipitating PF as well, which include phenytoin, quinine, diclofenac, ketorolac, and seldom, vasopressin \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【30】Vasopressor use in the setting of shock, regardless of shock type, is a mainstay of therapy to achieve hemodynamic stability in critically ill patients. The most used agents for critically ill shock patients include norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, and epinephrine, with their use varying on the type of shock present. Septic shock is a subdivision of distributive shock wherein a vast systemic inflammatory response leads to widespread vascular endothelial damage and altered vascular tone, causing extravasation of intravascular contents into peripheral tissues and extracellular matrix, despite adequate fluid resuscitation. First-line therapy for such shock includes tailored antibiotic therapy and vasopressor support, particularly with norepinephrine \\[ 10 \\]. When septic shock becomes refractory, the addition of second-line agents, such as vasopressin, is required to maintain an adequate MAP \\[ 10 \\]. Although these agents have been used as lifesaving supportive measures, they are not without adversity: ischemia of mesenteric and renal circulation, decreased cardiac index, thrombocytopenia with preserved coagulation and elevated liver function tests. Several pressors have been reported in the literature to have effects in splanchnic circulation and, more remarkably, the peripheral systemic circulation \\[ 4 , 11 \\]. The following discussion dives into the differential diagnoses of PF, an incredible phenomenon, and by a process of elimination, unravels vasopressin as the culprit at hand.\n\n【31】Initially, TTP was thought to be the diagnosis of such skin manifestations in our patients. TTP is caused by deficiency in the ADAMTS13 protein, a von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease \\[ 12 \\]. Without this protease, these large vWF multimers cannot be cleaved, causing platelet binding and forming microthrombi \\[ 13 \\]. The ADAMTS13 level obtained was 0.52 IU/mL, slightly below the lower end of normal. Normally, activity below 0.10 IU/mL is seen in acquired and hereditary TTP. Also, there were no features of microscopic hemolytic anemia which is common in TTP. As a result, further inhibitor assays were not performed since the established diagnosis was not met, arguing against this differential as the etiology for the above clinical scenario.\n\n【32】DIC is a clinical and laboratory diagnosis using a few different scoring systems that have been validated. The Japanese Association of Acute Medicine (JAAM)-DIC score is sensitive to predicting DIC in the setting of sepsis (with a score of ≥ 4 supporting a diagnosis of DIC). Our patient’s score was 4/12, arguing against a conclusive diagnosis. However, fibrinogen levels would be low in acute DIC as it becomes consumed. In our patient, fibrinogen levels were significantly elevated and remained elevated, thereby eliminating DIC as a cause of the current scenario \\[ 10 \\]. In a retrospective study by Siegal et al, they reported that the main clinical manifestations seen in DIC of increasing frequency are bleeding, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, shock, thromboembolic phenomena, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Although our patient exhibited renal dysfunction and shock, these manifestations preceded the cutaneous manifestation of PF, making DIC less likely \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【33】HIT, defined as a ≥ 50% decrease in platelet count post heparin exposure, can occur in one of two forms: type I or non-immune and type II or immune-mediated. The former typically develops 5 - 10 days after heparin exposure, whereas the latter can occur in 24 - 48 h due to preformed antibodies from previous exposure to heparin \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Diagnostic testing for either form includes obtaining assays for platelet-factor 4 with the strength of reaction correlating to the probability of disease (IgG-specific enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) > 1.0 OD units) \\[ 16 \\]. Our patient not only had a value of < 1.0, but serum tests were also negative for heparin-induced platelet antibodies, and the lesions occurred in less than 12-h period. Thrombocytopenia, in this case, could have been induced by ongoing severe sepsis.\n\n【34】AHF, also known as “shock liver”, is another precipitant of PF. In critically ill patients, AHF is commonly caused by hypoperfusion from severe hypotension and loss of vascular tone. As the synthetic function of the liver is lost in AHF, this leads to dysfunction of coagulation proteins \\[ 17 \\]. Additionally, liver function tests like aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are expected to be significantly elevated, with AST and ALT in the thousands \\[ 18 \\]. The patient presented here had elevated ALP and mildly elevated AST on admission, which all had resolved, excluding AHF as a predisposing factor for PF.\n\n【35】Among infectious causes, bacteremia is most implicated in etiology of PF. Meningococcus species-related infection is considered the most common cause \\[ 19 \\]. Other common bacteria that cause this illness are Hemophilus influenza, _Staphylococcus aureus_ , Streptococcus species, and _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【36】PF has been considered a subtype of DIC, which is highly pro-thrombotic \\[ 21 \\]. The pathophysiology of this condition still needs to be better understood. However, endothelial cell breakdown, along with the unregulated thrombomodulin-protein C system, is considered the root cause of this hypercoagulable state \\[ 20 \\]. Abnormal protein C and its associated proteins are the common denominators in PF-related pathology. It has been observed that there is a substantial decrease in circulating antithrombin, protein C, and protein S which are important innate components of the thrombotic pathway. The widely cited article by Faust et al \\[ 22 \\] discovered that endothelial protein C receptor and endothelial thrombomodulin level expression was much lower in meningococcal sepsis-related PF patients compared to controls.\n\n【37】Treatment is primarily supportive and aimed at the underlying cause, especially infectious etiology. IV hydration and anticoagulation are beneficial in its management \\[ 5 \\]. In infectious etiology like our case, broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Neisseria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus are preferred. IV immunoglobulin has also been used as antibodies to these toxins \\[ 23 \\]. Activated protein C has also been attempted to help with the coagulation pathway but with mixed results and is not recommended presently \\[ 20 \\]. Therapeutic plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma has also been tried, and there are no guidelines for it \\[ 20 \\]. Lastly, repeated debridement of affected areas is required based on the clinical scenario \\[ 5 \\]. In cases of PF induced by vasopressin, the medicine needs to be stopped like in our case, and other types of pressors need to be commenced.\n\n【38】**Learning points**\n\n【39】This review provides supplementary updates regarding one of the uncommon etiologies of an already established rare disease not frequently encountered. The aim of the case and discussion presented is meant to guide clinicians who encounter this cutaneous disease towards other etiologies should the common culprits (DIC, HIT, TTP, and AHF) be ruled out. However, further studies are of great interest and are needed to deepen our understanding of said critical illness dermatopathy.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Vasopressor use has been frequently documented to cause severe peripheral constriction, notably with norepinephrine’s effects in the distal phalanges. However, very few reports with vasopressin were published, noting necrosis at the extravasation sites or the muscular regions of the limb, as in the case reported herein \\[ 24 \\]. As the conditions intensely and frequently associated with PF had all been ruled out, particularly DIC, it is evident that the culprit at hand had been the addition of vasopressin, a unique development causing a rare cutaneous disease in such a short span of use. It is essential to keep this rare yet potentially life-threatening manifestation in mind in critically ill patients so that recognition and early reversal of the underlying cause may be addressed.\n\n【42】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【43】None to declare.\n\n【44】**Funding Disclosure**\n\n【45】None to disclose.\n\n【46】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【47】The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\n\n【48】**Informed Consent**\n\n【49】The patient consented for publication of this study and the written consent form is available to authors for submission if requested.\n\n【50】**Author Contributions**\n\n【51】Each author has been individually involved in and has made substantial contributions to conceptions and designs, acquisition of data, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting, and editing the manuscript.

Davis and colleagues described this disease first as “Job’s syndrome” in two girls suffering from recurrent “cold” staphylococcal abscesses, pneumonia and neonatal-onset eczematoid rash \\[ 4 \\]. In 1972, the syndrome was characterized further by Buckley et al. \\[ 5 \\] who found extremely high serum IgE levels in the patients. Since that time, other manifestations of the disease were established, like skeletal, connective tissue, cardiac, and brain abnormalities \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\].\n\n【3】Most cases are sporadic, but at the present time, two forms of HIES are recognized: a dominant form, caused by mutations in _STAT3_ (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and a recessive form for which a genetic cause is unclear \\[ 6 , 9 \\- 11 \\] although some cases are due to mutations in the gene _TYK2_ . The dominant form (the classic HIES) is the commonest one, characterized by non-immunologic features including skeletal, connective tissue, and pulmonary abnormalities in addition to recurrent infections and eczema \\[ 3 \\]. This type was the one presented by the first reports of the disorder \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In contrast, the recessive form lacks the somatic features and has severe recurrent viral infections, extreme eosinophilia and devastating neurologic complications \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【4】This article presents 3 patients suffering from HIES that were followed in our hospital at different times and with different outcomes; then, a description of the clinical, laboratory and therapeutic aspects of the disease will be made.\n\n| **Case Reports** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】**Case 1**\n\n【8】The first patient was a woman, born in 1975, without consanguineous parents, but 3 of her 4 siblings died in the first 2 years of life (cause of the deaths unknown). Since birth, she suffered from recurrent herpetic keratitis of the eye, motivating a corneal transplant at seven years old, that was rejected three years later. She also had a history of atopic eczema, recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, multiple _verrucae_ , infected cutaneous ulcers and dental abscesses, one episode of intestinal infection with _Giardia lamblia_ , and multiple hospitalizations from recurrent infected bronchiectasis. The infectious agents identified were _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) and _Acinetobacter spp_ . Her IgE values ranged from 2000 to 5000 UI/mL. She was hospitalized almost every month because of infected bronchiectasis and hemoptysis (pulmonary artery embolization was necessary). She had poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens and started intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) in a dose of 0.4 g/kg/month. There was no change of the clinical picture. At 26 years old a spinocellular carcinoma in the vulva (T1N0M0) was diagnosed and she was submitted to surgery. She developed persistent respiratory insufficiency and died, at 27 years old, from one episode of infected bronchiectasis.\n\n【9】**Case 2**\n\n【10】The second patient was a woman born in 1976, with consanguineous grandparents (one healthy brother). She had a history of multiple infections of the eye, with three rejected corneal transplants. Recurrent respiratory infections were the rule in her life (the infectious agent identified was always _Staphylococcus aureus_ ) with structural and functional respiratory abnormalities. She also had recurrent infections of other organs (otitis, skin abscesses and purulent gingivitis). It was described, from the records, a rough skin and scoliosis. Her IgE values ranged from 900 to 1500 UI/mL. It was described an increased activation of lymphocyte B (increased expression of CD23). At 21 years old, she started IVIg in an irregular basis (0.4 g/kg), because of poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens, and prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole because of persistent skin abscesses and respiratory infections. The quality of life was improved after this treatment, with decreased number of hospitalizations. At 28 years old she had an advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and started chemotherapy. She died two months later from sepsis.\n\n【11】**Case 3**\n\n【12】The third case is a man, born in 1985, that at present is followed in our hospital. There is no known consanguinity in the family, but he has a cousin with the same disease. Since childhood, there has been a history of recurrent pneumonias (Staphylococcus aureus) and purulent otitis. At 20 years old he was hospitalized because of skin abscesses in the buttocks and dental abscesses, treated with antibiotics. Months later he had corneal ulcer of the eye ( _Staphylococcus aureus_ ) and prolonged febrile syndrome, and it was the first time he had contact with our team. We documented some characteristic features like prominent forehead, facial asymmetry, a broad nasal bridge, prognathism and rough skin with prominent pores, scoliosis, lack of some teeth, eczematoid dermatitis, oral candidiasis and central depression on the tongue. He had no abnormalities in lung imaging and respiratory functional tests. No cause for the fever was encountered. He started topic treatment with antibiotics, and also systemic empiric antibiotics and antifungal (ciprofloxacin, flucloxacilin, itraconazole,trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and albendazole). The fever and the ulcer were treated, although he maintains a chronic diminished visual acuity. His IgE levels are between 8000 and 24700 UI/mL and eosinophilia is 2 - 4 times higher than the normal range. The levels of IgE and eosinophilia never were correlated with the clinical status of the patient. He had a low response to polysaccharide antigens. Since then, he has been with IVIg 0.4 g/kg/month, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (960 mg twice a day) and vitamin C. Now he is 25 years old and no longer has new infections.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】**Clinical manifestations of HIES**\n\n【16】HIES usually presents very early in life. The clinical manifestations of the dominant form are resumed here.\n\n【17】Almost all patients suffer from recurrent staphylococcal infections, beginning in infancy and predominantly involving the skin and lungs \\[ 1 , 2 , 12 \\]. A newborn pustular and eczematoid rashes are usually the first manifestations of the disease, typically affecting the face and scalp, with an eopsinophilic infiltrate and caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ . Boils are a classic finding \\[ 6 \\]. Trouble areas may persist in intertriginous areas such as the axillae, the inguinal region, or under the breasts \\[ 3 \\]. Recurrent pyogenic pneumonias are very common, starting in the childhood. They may present with fewer symptoms, leading to a subsequent delay in clinical presentation, contributing to advanced disease and significant tissue damage before identification and initiation of therapy \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【18】In these patients, the degree of inflammatory symptoms is variable. The “cold” abscesses, without external signs of inflammation, initially described by Davis and colleagues \\[ 4 \\], are common. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is the bacterium most frequently isolated, but _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , _Haemophilus influenzae_ , enteric Gram-negative bacteria, _Candida_ and _Aspergillus_ are also common. Pneumonia is frequently followed by pneumatocele or bronchiectasis, that are commonly superinfected by _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ \\[ 2 , 13 , 14 \\]. The secondary infections are more indolent and difficult to clear. These long-term infections are more frequently associated with mortality than the acute pyogenic infections, causing rupture into large pulmonary vessels with life-threatening hemoptysis or fungal dissemination to the brain, for example \\[ 13 \\]. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is the most common opportunistic infection. Several cases of _pneumocystosis_ , _cryptococcosis_ and _histoplasmosis_ have also been reported \\[ 6 , 13 , 15 \\- 19 \\].\n\n【19】The facial appearance is very characteristic: facial asymmetry, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, mild prognathism, and rough appearance of the facial skin with prominent pores \\[ 6 , 20 , 21 \\]. Some individuals retain their primary teeth, because of the failure of those teeth to exfoliate. The secondary teeth can be present simultaneously when the secondary teeth emerge before primaries have fallen out. Other features are central depressions in the tongue and high arch of the palate \\[ 6 , 22 \\].\n\n【20】One of the most recent documented features are arterial aneurysms, which can be coronary and extra-coronary. We must recognize in the adult patients the high risk of myocardial infarction as the result of an aneurysm \\[ 8 \\]. Brain abnormalities, like T2-weighted hypersensities seen on brain MRI are also present, but gross neurologic abnormalities are not detected in the majority of patients with these findings \\[ 1 , 7 , 8 \\]. Ophthalmologic pathologies such as extensive xanthelasma, giant calazia and undefined tumors of the eyelid have been reported \\[ 23 \\- 25 \\].\n\n【21】Osteoporosis is common \\[ 10 , 14 \\], and other skeletal abnormalities include scoliosis, minimal trauma fractures, hyperextensibility, and degenerative joint disease \\[ 3 , 6 , 26 , 27 \\].\n\n【22】An increased risk of malignancy is associated with this disorder, contributing to the high mortality. Several malignancies have been reported, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemia, and cancers of the vulva, liver and lung \\[ 23 , 28 \\- 31 \\].\n\n【23】**Laboratory investigations**\n\n【24】Serum IgE concentrations are extremely high in patients with HIES (> 2000 IU/ml) sometimes even at the time of birth. The molecular mechanism of hyper-IgE-emia remains unclear \\[ 3 , 14 \\]. The IgE levels are not static: they usually are undetectable in cord blood and rise to the adult range slowly over the years, and can diminish again. Substantial fluctuation has been documented over time without any obvious change in clinical presentation \\[ 6 \\]. HIES patients have normal or decreased serum IgM, IgG and IgA levels, but most have defects of various types in the antigen-specific antibody response to immunization. IgG subclass deficiencies have been reported in some patients \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【25】Eosinophilia is the other consistent laboratory finding \\[ 3 \\]. There is no correlation between eosinophilia and IgE levels or eosinophilia and infectious complications of HIES \\[ 2 \\]. Total white blood cell counts are normal but they often fail to elevate appropriately during acute infection \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【26】An impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils or monocytes has been described, a defect that explains the “cold abscesses” presented by the patients \\[ 32 \\].\n\n【27】There is a lack of other pathognomic laboratory signs \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【28】**Autosomal recessive HIES**\n\n【29】Patients with the recessive form have no skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. They have recurrent or severe infections by _Staphylocuccus aureus_ , _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Proteus mirabilis_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Cryptococcus_ , chronic refractory _Molluscum contagiosum_ infections, recurrent aphtoid herpes simplex infections. They are also susceptible to intracellular bacteria (mycobacteria, _Salmonella_ ). The neurological symptoms are more severe, from partial facial paralysis to hemiplegia. The levels of serum IgE are more elevated than the dominant form. Eosinophilia is also more severe \\[ 2 , 9 \\].\n\n【30】**Therapy of hyper-IgE syndromes**\n\n【31】There is no cure for HIES yet. The consensus favors long-term prophylactic therapy of _Staphylococcus aureus_ skin and lung infection with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \\[ 2 \\]. The efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis remains unproven \\[ 3 \\]. If possible, the etiologic agent should guide treatment of pneumonia; bronchoscopy may be helpful \\[ 3 \\]. Because patients feel well and are unware of how severely ill they are, we need to have a low threshold for investigating slight changes \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【32】IFN-gama had inconsistent effects on IgE levels \\[ 33 \\]. Intravenous immunoglobulin may decrease the number of infections for some patients \\[ 34 \\- 36 \\].\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】In the past five years, there was a significant improvement of the diagnosis of the HIES syndromes. These primary immunodeficiency disorders are rare and usually first manifest during childhood. Patients usually die prematurely due to pulmonary infections; early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving and can lead to a significant reduction in morbidity. To best diagnose and treat, we should be familiarized with the clinical and laboratorial aspects of the disease. Besides the infections, we should not forget the risk of malignancy that is associated with HIES. The long-term prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is mandatory. We hope that developmental, biochemical, and molecular studies should help us to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and lead to new therapies for patients with HIES.\n\n【35】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Whilst some patients may be asymptomatic, those with moderate to severe stenosis often present with exertional dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope and heart failure. Less commonly described complications of aortic stenosis include disorders of conduction. This case report describes a patient with previously undiagnosed aortic stenosis presenting with isolated presyncopal episodes.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 62-year-old gentleman with no cardiac history was admitted with a 3 weeks history of recurrent presyncope. These episodes occurred on moderate exertion, lasted only a few seconds and resolved with rest. He denied symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness but did report an awareness of intermittent palpitations, which he described as a ‘heavy thud in the chest,’ mainly in bed at night.\n\n【6】Examination was generally unremarkable, with the exception of mild systolic hypertension 165/80 mmHg and a soft, grade 3/6, systolic murmur over the precordium radiating to the neck. Initial investigations including full blood count, electrolytes and thyroid function were normal. His resting ECG ( Fig. 1 ) showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis. There was right bundle branch block morphology and the PR and QTc intervals were normal. The patient was admitted and monitored for 24 hours before being discharged with plans for outpatient echocardiography and Holter monitoring.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** 12 lead ECG on initial presentation._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】The patient was readmitted the following week with further presyncopal episodes on exertion. History and examination were unchanged. His baseline ECG was almost identical, except a prolonged PR interval of 210 ms was noted. Routine monitoring again revealed no abnormality. The patient suggested that he could try to replicate his symptoms through exercise. Under supervision, he walked briskly along the corridor without any symptoms. After two minutes rest, he had an episode of presyncope and an ECG confirmed second degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type II), and a prolonged ventricular pause of approximately 6 seconds ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** ECG recording 2 minutes after a brisk walk._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】An urgent echocardiogram was arranged. The aortic valve was found to be moderately thickened and calcified with restricted opening. Continuous wave Doppler velocities suggested a peak gradient of 70 mmHg in keeping with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. In addition, mild aortic regurgitation was noted. There was mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved systolic function. No other structural abnormalities were identified. Coronary angiography demonstrated only minor coronary artery disease.\n\n【12】A dual chamber pacemaker was implanted 2 days after admission. Atrial pacing at the time of pacemaker implantation confirmed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction up to 130 beats per minute. The patient was discharged the following day with plans for early review and reassessment of his aortic valve. He has had no further episodes of presyncope since discharge. His nocturnal palpitations have resolved and he can exercise freely without breathlessness or angina.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Syncopal or presyncopal symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis are well recognised and thought to be caused by heightened left-ventricular baroreceptor activation. The development of these symptoms is an important marker of increased mortality and often prompts referral for aortic valve replacement. However, calcific aortic valve disease is also associated with impaired atrioventricular node conduction, particularly in cases with marked annular calcification \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【16】This case serves as a reminder to consider investigating patients with aortic valve stenosis for conduction disease if they present with isolated syncope or presyncope. This also raises the dilemma of when it is sensible to exercise patients with significant aortic stenosis. Generally, guidelines discourage formal exercise testing in symptomatic patients \\[ 2 , 3 \\], but, as we have demonstrated, this approach risks missing a significant and treatable alternative diagnosis.\n\n【17】**Conclusions**\n\n【18】To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report presyncopal symptoms on exercise related to transient AV node block, in the presence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【19】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【20】There are no conflicts of interest to be declared.\n\n【21】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is meant to educate readers of the potential benefits of early childhood screening in reducing the morbidity and mortality of this condition. Early treatment implementation is crucial for those affected and advancements in drug therapies, specifically PCSK9 inhibitors, have shown promising results.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 47-year-old male of Irish heritage presented to the endocrinology department on September 5. 2015 with concerns of a raised blood total cholesterol of 10.8 mmol/L. With a cholesterol level being double the normal limit (5.2 mmol/L), there was concern of some genetic involvement.\n\n【6】Genetic testing was performed on September 11, 2015, indicating the patient was heterozygous for a mutation p.E57K in the LDLR gene. This variant has been reported as causing a genetic susceptibility to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). As this is an autosomal dominant condition, he was encouraged to have his offspring tested for the genetic mutation.\n\n【7】Genetic testing was performed on his three biological children aged 11, 12 and 13 years. Results indicated all three of his children had inherited the p.E57K mutation in keeping with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease. Blood lipid levels were obtained from each child which further supported this diagnosis as all three children had significantly elevated serum total cholesterol (5.6 mmol/L, 5.1 mmol/L, and 5.3 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol levels (5.3 mmol/L, 7.6 mmol/L, and 6.05 mmol/L).\n\n【8】Given the importance of obtaining a correct diagnosis, a repeat genetic test was performed to ensure accurate results. As expected, this reconfirmed the previous result.\n\n【9】Due to the consequences of uncontrolled lipid levels, all patients were placed on statins. The father was also placed on ezetimibe to further improve his elevated cholesterol levels. A new family of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors will be launched in Ireland in 2016. These PCSK9 inhibitors are showing tremendous results for reducing lipid levels in FH patients \\[ 1 \\]. Should his current treatment not adequately lower his lipid levels, it is very likely the father may be offered a PCSK9 inhibitor once it becomes available.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】FH is a genetic disorder which has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is more common than previously thought. Work done by De Ferranti \\[ 2 \\] estimated that the prevalence of FH was roughly 1 in 500 persons; however, more recent evidence suggests it is more accurately 1 in 200 persons \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【13】The most common form of FH is the heterozygous form. This is often asymptomatic until adulthood. Most patients develop early cardiac events as there is a 20-fold increase in atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease mortality \\[ 2 \\]. In very rare cases, FH can present in a homozygous form. These patients will present in early infancy with xanthelasmas and if not promptly diagnosed, can lead to myocardial infarction as early as 2 years of age \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【14】As in this case report, children often remain undiagnosed until later in life when they present with major health events. It is for this reason that screening lipid levels in children has been recommended by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Expert Panel \\[ 4 \\]. With the prevalence of FH being higher than what was previously estimated, screening can provide youth with treatment options and hopefully this will lead to a reduced rate of premature cardiac events.\n\n【15】Treatment of FH is multifactorial. Lifestyle modification is the mainstay first line treatment in anyone with elevated cholesterol levels. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables yet low in saturated and trans fat is highly encouraged. Exercise is also beneficial and it is recommended that 30 min of daily physical activity for 5 days out of 7 has proven to be beneficial \\[ 2 \\]. However, lifestyle modification can only go so far, especially where genetics are concerned. For most suffering from FH, statins are the primary pharmacological treatment. In the pediatric FH population statins have shown to reduce LDL levels by 32% with some evidence of increasing HDL 3.4% \\[ 5 \\]. However, there is concern with the long-term safety of their use as there are limited data available on childhood statin therapy. Other agents commonly added to statin therapy are ezetimibe (as seen in this case report) and bile acid sequestrants. Their use has been shown to be beneficial for both the pediatric and adult population; however, adherence is a major concern due to side effects of bloating and constipation \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【16】As mentioned in the above case, if the patient’s lipid levels are not lowered sufficiently with his current treatment, our patient could be offered a PCSK9 inhibitor (protein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) which binds to the LDL receptor promoting its degradation \\[ 1 \\]. This is a novel treatment to be introduced this coming year in Ireland and appears to be an effective strategy to further lower the LDL cholesterol in patients with FH. Recent evidence published by the Canadian Prescriber’s Newsletter \\[ 6 \\] states that PCSK9 inhibitors can lower LDL levels of patients who are already receiving maximum statin dose. This does come at a significant financial cost to the patient as the drug is roughly €5,000 per annum and not likely to be universally covered by all drug plans. This class of drug is new and is currently being evaluated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The programme director at NICE, Meindert Boysen, stated that although evolocumab (PCSK9 inhibitor) is effective in reducing levels of LDL cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia, it was felt that the drug does not have sufficient long-term data to support improvement of CVS outcomes nor does it have long-term safety data \\[ 7 \\]. There are currently four long-term studies assessing the CVS outcomes; however, results of these studies are not expected until 2017 \\[ 8 \\]. Hopefully these studies will help ascertain whether PCSK9 inhibitors will be a proven therapy option to decrease CVS morbidity and mortality in FH patients.\n\n【17】FH is notably a rising concern for our population. With its prevalence being higher than previously thought, it is suggested that lipid screening be instigated in childhood as early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the high rate of mortality and morbidity caused by the disease \\[ 9 \\]. Evidence does suggest that early treatment is beneficial in reducing this CVS risk; however, more work needs to be done to bring this condition to the forefront. Often at the time of diagnosis, it is difficult to reverse the damage which has silently been wreaking havoc on the body for decades. With newer drugs being introduced and the persistent push towards initiating a child screening protocol, there is hope that this disease will become more manageable and less detrimental to those affected.\n\n【18】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Both cases described the accumulation of numerous cells with Russell bodies (RB), initially characterized by Russell in 1890 \\[ 3 \\], which expanded the duodenal lamina propria in the absence of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection. The RB-containing cell was determined to be a plasma cell by its CD138 immunoreactivity, and exhibited a polytypic pattern of immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda light chains \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Prior to this, collections of RBs had been documented to occur in the stomach, termed Russell body gastritis (RBG) by Tazawa and Tsutsumi in 1998 \\[ 4 \\], where the majority of cases, but not all, were associated with _H. pylori_ \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【3】In this article, we present a case of isolated Russell body duodenitis with associated _H. pylori_ gastritis in a 59-year-old female patient.

Her past medical history was significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity. Her past surgical history was remarkable for left mastectomy for breast cancer and abdominal hysterectomy. She quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation after a 20-pack-year smoking history. She denied any alcohol use.\n\n【8】The physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed normal complete blood count, serum electrolytes and liver enzymes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and a colonoscopy were performed. The EGD revealed a normal appearing esophagus and stomach, with nodular mucosa in the duodenum ( Fig. 1 ). Multiple random biopsies were taken from the stomach and the duodenum. The colonoscopy revealed pandiverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. Random biopsies were obtained from the colon.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** The EGD revealed normal gastric cardia (A) and antrum (B) but mild nodularity in the duodenal bulb (C) and nonspecific duodenitis in the second portion of duodenum (D)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】**Histological and immunohistochemical findings**\n\n【11】HE stained sections from the stomach demonstrated mild chronic gastritis with patchy activity. There was no evidence of Russell bodies ( Fig. 2A ). A few _H. pylori_ organisms were identified by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 2B ). Sections from the duodenum showed fragments of benign duodenal mucosa. Some of the fragments had a dense infiltrate of cells containing numerous Russell bodies in the lamina propria ( Fig. 3A, B ), and other fragments had focal neutrophilic inflammation, Brunner’s gland hyperplasia, and focal gastric foveolar metaplasia ( Fig. 3C ). No obvious microorganisms, lymphoepithelial lesions, or neoplastic cells were identified. By immunohistochemistry, the RB-containing cells were polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains ( Fig. 4A, B ), but negative for CD138, CD68, and AE1/AE3 ( Fig. 4C, D, E ). The overall features were that of mild peptic duodenitis with a dense infiltrate of RB-containing plasma cells.

Herein we report an additional case. The clinicopathologic features of all three cases are summarized in Table 1 . Unique to our case is its sole presence in the duodenum as opposed to the stomach, the lack of concurrent Russell body gastritis, and the presence of _H. pylori_ infection in the stomach. The cause for Russell body-containing plasma cells infiltrating the duodenal lamina propria remains unclear. It may be related to chronic inflammation due to peptic injury as a result of _H. pylori_ gastritis. The benign nature of this process is substantiated by the polytypic nature of the RB-containing plasma cells. In the current study, these RB-containing plasma cells were immunonegative for CD138, which is different from the previous two reports \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. This discrepancy may be due to a different type or concentration of antibody used in those studies. However, the CD138 immunonegativity in our case should not argue against the nature of plasma cells, as these cells clearly demonstrated expression of kappa and lambda chains and were not histiocytes. In addition, the immunonegativity for pan-cytokeratin helped rule out signet ring cell carcinoma.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Demographic, Clinical, Endoscopic, and Pathologic Features of Russell Body Duodenitis_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】Similar to the previous reports by Savage et al (2011) \\[ 1 \\] and Paniz Mondolfi et al (2012) \\[ 2 \\], gastric foveolar metaplasia was also noted in our current case. In addition, we observed Brunner’s gland hyperplasia and focal neutrophilic inflammation. These features are consistent with peptic duodenitis. While the case described by Savage NM et al (2011) \\[ 1 \\] reported no evidence of _H. pylori_ organisms on routine and toluidine blue staining, the diffuse superficial infiltrates of mononuclear cells in the gastric lamina propria, as presented in their case report, is suggestive of previous _H. pylori_ infection or a mild _H. pylori_ infection undergoing partial treatment. In such cases, immunohistochemistry may be needed to document _H. pylori_ infection. Our results show that chronic peptic duodenitis due to _H. pylori_ infection may manifest as RBD. The presence of _H. pylori_ is not required for the formation of Russell body plasma cells, supporting the notion that defective excretion of immunoglobulin, rather than the accumulation of _H. pylori_ , is the underlying mechanism for RB formation.\n\n【22】In summary, we report the first case of isolated Russell body duodenitis with concurrent _H. pylori_ gastritis.\n\n【23】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Spinal stenosis is currently the most frequent reason for back surgery and the leading cause of impaired mobility in the elderly population \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. LSS is the compression of the neural elements due to the narrowing of the spinal canal that occurs in the lumbar region of the spine \\[ 3 \\]. Symptoms associated with spinal stenosis can have a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and physical function because they may have pain with walking and static standing \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【3】Most commonly these patients are limited to a choice between nonsurgical conservative care and more invasive decompressive surgical producers, such as laminectomy and/or fusions. Lumbar fusion rates are increasing rapidly especially in the geriatric population \\[ 5 \\]. The X-Stop interspinous spacer (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA, Fig. 1 ) provides a minimally invasive, clinically beneficial, alternative therapy for the treatment of patients aged 50 or older suffering from NIC secondary to a confirmed diagnosis of LSS (with X-ray, MRI, and/or CT evidence of thickened ligamentum flavum, narrowed lateral recess and/or central canal narrowing) \\[ 6 \\]. Previous research indicated that the X-Stop implant can be a safe alternative and garners similar treatment outcomes compared to non-operative and more invasive surgical techniques \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. The X-Stop spacer is normally used for those patients with moderately impaired physical function, experienced relief in flexion from their symptoms of leg/buttock/groin pain, with or without back pain, and undergone a regimen of at least 6 months of non-operative treatment. The X-Stop spacer may be implanted at one or two lumbar levels in patients, in whom operative treatment is indicated at no more than two levels \\[ 6 \\].

This approach allowed us to observe the spinal and postural motion not limited by the constrains of an MRI or an X-ray, to demonstrate the benefits of the procedure on the overall functional movements of the patient. In addition, levels of muscle activities necessary to make flexion/extension movements and the patient’s quality of life were assessed. The purpose of this project was not to highlight new indications for use but rather provide objective functional outcomes that may assist clinicians in the future in decision making and selection of patients who would gain the most benefit from this procedure.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】This study reports the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian female who was referred to orthopedic surgery because of chronic low back pain and more recently, nonsymmetrical leg pain particularly with ambulation. The patient’s past medical history includes restless legs syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, osteoarthritis, anxiety, depression, asthma, ankylosing spondylitis and anemia. The patient past surgical history includes right total knee arthroplasty, right rotator cuff repair, and right elbow surgery. A diagnosis of spinal stenosis and spoldylolisthesis was confirmed by X-ray and MRI in May 2013. The patient had failed conservative therapy including physical therapy, injections and medications including oxycodone, Tylenol No. 4 and Celebrex. The patient underwent an X-Stop and laminectomy procedure in June 2013. The patient was placed under general anesthesia and positioned prone. At L2-L3 level, a sizing device was used to select a 14 mm polyetheretherketone spacer, and at level L4-L5 a 10 mm polyetheretherketone spacer was inserted. In addition, a limited laminectomy was performed at the L4-L5 level. X-rays were performed postoperatively to confirm correct placement. Patient was placed in an abdominal brace for 6 weeks postoperative in which she reported adherence. Preoperative and at 2 months postoperative, flexion/extension radiographs are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 respectively.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** (A) Preoperative standing lateral radiographs of the patient in extension.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Eastern Maine Medical Center. The patient underwent the informed consent process and agreed to participate in the study prior to collection of study data. In order to study the effects of the minimally invasive X-Stop implant surgery on movement kinematics, lumbar active range of motion (AROM) was captured using MX40 Vicon motion capture system (VICON, Centennial, CO, USA) at the operating frequency of 100 Hz. Twenty-two reflective markers were placed on the patient on C7, T3, T5, T7, T9, T11, L1, L3, L5, S2 spinous processes, bilateral acromion process, anterior and posterior superior iliac spines, greater trochanter, later knee joint line and lateral malleolus to create a 3D image for the spine, pelvis and lower extremities. The patient performed three repetitions of lumbar flexion and extension. The flexion was defined as starting in standing posture and bending forward as if to touch the toes, then returning to neutral, and extension was described as standing then leaning backwards, with hands forward, followed by returning to the neutral posture. The patient performed the movements as far as she could until onset of pain or anatomical restriction occurred.\n\n【13】In addition, activation of the bilateral rectus abdominis, erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles were measured using surface electromyography Noraxon Telemyo 8 channel system (Noraxon, Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and normalized. In order to normalize the EMG signal, the patient performed isometric maximum voluntary muscle contractions (MVC) prior to completing the flexion/extension tasks. MVC of the rectus abdominis and the erector spinae were measured while the subject resisted seated forward trunk flexion and trunk extension respectively. The biceps femoris MVC was identified while the patient resisted knee flexion in sitting. Maximal muscle contractions were held for 3 - 5 s against the maximal manual resistance performed by a physical therapist and repeated three times. The EMG signals were captured at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz and filtered using fourth order Butterworth band pass filter (20 - 500 Hz), rectified and smoothed using the root mean square (RMS) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【14】The Swiss spinal stenosis questionnaire \\[ 10 \\] and PROMIS-29 questionnaire were collected to assess patient quality of life and to quantify severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient’s satisfaction after treatment in both pre- and postoperative tests. Also, a 6-minute walk test was performed to assess physical function \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】Previous research studies have been done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the X-Stop spinal process spacer procedure. Zucherman et al \\[ 13 \\] treated a group of 191 patients with NIC. One hundred out of 191 patients underwent the X-Stop spinal process spacer procedure and 91 patients had non-operative therapy consisting of epidural steroid injection and physical therapy. These authors utilized the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) which consists of symptom severity, physical function and patient satisfaction domains \\[ 14 \\] to evaluate the outcomes. They reported that the X-Stop patients had significantly better outcomes in each domain based on ZCQ. They reported that at 2 years, the X-Stop patients improved by 45.4% over the mean baseline symptom severity score while the non-operative therapy group had 7.4% improvement; the mean improvement in the physical function domain was 44.3% in the X-Stop group and 0.4% in the non-operative therapy group. They also reported that the X-STOP procedure does not yield significant changes to the lumbar spine (disc height, curvatures of the spine, angulation of the spine) on radiographs \\[ 13 \\]. In another study, Anderson et al \\[ 15 \\] published 2-year follow-up data from 70 patients which showed statistically significant improvement in ZCQ and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores in X-Stop device-treated patients. These authors reported the overall success of 63.4% in X-Stop device-treated patients in comparison with the non-operative control group of patients with only 12.9% improvement. Also a comparison between medical records and radiographs of patients with LSS treated with three different interspinous implants (X-Stop, Wallis, Diam) were reviewed by Sobottke et al \\[ 16 \\]. Their results showed that the X-Stop implant improved the foraminal height, cross-sectional area and width more than other two implants.\n\n【18】Pain and symptom relief may affect functional movement patterns leading to changes in overall posturing and compensational movement patterns. To assess overall posturing and movement kinematics of the patient, the lumbar AROM was studied in this case based on the angle between third thoracic (T3) spinous process, sacrum at S2 level and the knee joint midline in the sagittal plane during a lumbar extension/flexion task. Figure 4 illustrates the measured angle in five frames of preoperative flexion. The patient performed three repetitions of lumbar standardized flexion and the flexion angle was calculated ( Fig. 5A ). The flexion angle increased from 72.5±2° for the preoperative test to 91±1.5° for the 2 months postoperative test. Compared to preoperative condition, flexion AROM increased by 18.5°. The lumbar flexion angle of the patient at the postoperative test was in the range of normal and healthy subjects (94±17°) as reported by Lariviere et al in 2000 \\[ 17 \\]. By asking the patient to preform three consecutive lumbar extension tasks the extension angle showed 14° improvement in the lumbar extension AROM at 2 months postoperative ( Fig. 5B ). The lumbar extension angle increased from 20±1.5° before surgery to 34±0.5° at 2 months after surgery. Also at 2 months postoperative the patient could maintain the extension posture up to 5 s without having pain which improved from the preoperative test where she could not maintain maximum extension for more than 2 s. The results highlight a significant improvement in movement kinematics of the patient.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Snapshots from the spine model during flexion and angle measurement._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【20】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** (A) Flexion angle preoperative/postoperative.

The level of muscle activation has been analyzed for lumbar standardized flexion test ( Fig. 6 ). The EMG signal of each muscle pre- and postoperative was normalized against its MVC value within the same session. As indicated in Figure 6 less muscle activation was observed at 2 months postoperative for all muscles. The rectus abdominis muscles reached the maximum level of contraction before the maximum flexion angle and the erector spinae muscles showed low level of activation at the maximum flexion angle. This phenomenon called flexion-relaxation has been studied in healthy subjects and patients with back pain by Dieen et al in 2003 \\[ 18 \\]. According to their study, most of healthy subjects showed complete electromyographical silence of the erector spinae during full flexion while the muscle activations of patients with back pain were higher. The results of the X-Stop patient also showed much lower level of activations of the erector spinae muscles after the surgery in comparison to preoperation.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 6.** Normalized muscle activation signal (EMG) during trunk flexion pre-post operation, the dashed vertical lines indicate the maximum flexion, the dashed lines represent preoperative and the solid lines represent postoperative muscle activation of right and left rectus abdominis (A, B), right and left erector spinae (C, D) and right and left biceps femoris (E, F)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】  \n\n【26】In order to assess patient quality of life and quantify severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient’s satisfaction after treatment the Swiss spinal stenosis and PROMIS-29 questionnaire, which include subscales for physical function, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, pain interference, pain intensity, fatigue, and satisfaction with social role, were used. Table 1 presents the results of the seven separate domains of quality of life assessed before and after surgery. Compared to preoperative, physical function (43 - 57) and satisfaction in social role (39 - 64) increased at 2 months postoperative. Pain interference (64 - 56) and pain intensity (7/10 to 6/10) decreased at 2 months postoperative. Similarly disability assessed using the Swiss spinal stenosis, disability decreased (55 - 29) at 2 months postoperative. In addition to evaluating the patient’s quality of life and movement kinematics, functional mobility was evaluated using the 6-minute walk test. Distance covered during the 6-minute walk test increased by 79 m (424 to 503 m) which demonstrates an improvement in functional mobility and endurance.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** The Swiss Spinal Stenosis and PROMIS-29 Questionnaire Results_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】Although it is believed that the interspinous device limits the range of motion at the level of implant, for the case reported, lumbar continuous AROM (flexion and extension) increased following X-Stop surgical intervention. Also, functional mobility, and quality of life improved and less muscle activities were observed for even more lumbar AROM after surgery.\n\n【30】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【31】The authors gratefully acknowledge support from Eastern Maine Medical Center and the Maine Technology Institute under grant number MTAF-3001 for funding of the laboratory facility.\n\n【32】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【33】The authors declare they have no financial or any conflicts of interest.\n\n【34】**Disclosure**\n\n【35】The study was conducted at Human Performance Laboratory, Multidisciplinary partnership between University of Maine and Eastern Maine Medical at Cutler Health Center, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA.\n\n【36】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Whereas AKI is well known to occur frequently in patients with heat stroke, no studies have examined potential changes in creatinine clearance in this patient population. We herein present the case of a patient with AKI due to heat stroke whose creatinine clearance was elevated.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 40-year-old male without past medical or family history presented to our hospital with nausea and generalized muscle pain after working outdoors on a hot summer day. On arrival, his rectal temperature was 37.6 °C, and his serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 2.58 mg/dL, 68 IU/L and 82 IU/L, respectively. His serum creatinine kinase (CK) was 237 IU/L. On physical examination, his tongue was dry; however, no other abnormal findings were observed. He was diagnosed with heat stroke and renal dysfunction and admitted to the intensive care unit. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, his renal dysfunction was classified as stage 3 AKI based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Fluid resuscitation successfully decreased serum creatinine level to 0.84 mg/dL by 12 h after admission. However, his creatinine clearance, measured by a 12-h urine collection, was elevated to 230 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . He was discharged home from hospital on day three.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】The presented case can suggest that in patients with elevated serum creatinine due to heat stroke, creatinine clearance calculated by a 12-h urine collection might also be elevated. The KDIGO criteria and severity classification for AKI have an important role in predicting mortality and CKD risk. Previous studies found that AKI was associated with increased short and long-term risk of death and increased risk of CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Conversely, one study reported that while AKI occurred in about 90% of heat stroke patients, more than 95% of the AKI patients were alive with serum creatinine levels that were recovered to baseline at the time of discharge \\[ 3 \\]. Thus, renal function may not be impaired in heat stroke patients diagnosed with AKI.\n\n【9】Rhabdomyolysis is known to be associated with heat stroke, and cause AKI. CK level in this case was under 250 IU/L throughout the hospital stay. It was much lower than the reported cases of rhabdomyolysis \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Thus, we consider that the AKI was not caused by rhabdomyolysis, but by hypovolemia from heat stroke. The elevation of serum creatinine is potentially caused by muscle injury by heat stroke, thereby meeting the AKI criteria \\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\].\n\n【10】As shown in this patient, creatinine clearance is also known to be probably elevated in septic AKI, ultimately affecting dosing of drugs such as antibiotics. In septic AKI patients, renal function was reported not to decline as low as expected, which could lead to underestimation of glomerular filtration rate and insufficient drug dosing \\[ 10 \\]. This phenomenon is termed augmented renal clearance in which renal function for solution clearance is elevated more than expected by visible laboratory data in critically ill patients \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. Therefore, more sensitive biomarkers such as the measured creatinine clearance are needed.\n\n【11】**Conclusions**\n\n【12】The measured creatinine clearance might be elevated in AKI due to heat stroke, and renal function for solution clearance might be underestimated with estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【13】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【14】No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\n\n【15】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

GrMF is caused by unusual expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 T lymphocytes, a part of immune system. GrMF has an incidence of 1 in 100,000 - 350,000. Most cases are in people 40 - 55 years of age. It is twice more common in males than in females. The granulomatous component may be intense and obscures the lymphomatous component in some patients \\[ 1 \\]. We present a 51-year-old female with significant plaque measuring about 10 cm in the L3 - L5 lumbar area and a similar plaque in the region of right ankle which was initially diagnosed as sarcoid granulomatous dermatitis on immunohistopathology. It was later diagnosed as GrMF on repeat biopsies of the plaques. GrMF simulating sarcoidosis has rarely been reported in literature.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 51-year-old Caucasian woman with diabetes, hyperlipidemia and chronic pain initially presented to the clinic after she noticed a patch associated with pruritus on her right ankle, below medial malleolus. A similar lesion was found on her back in L3 - L5 dermatomal region ( Fig. 1 ). Further history and exam were largely unremarkable. Skin biopsy with immunohistopathology of the two regions showed areas of epithelioid histiocytes with multinucleated giant cells mixed with a significant lymphocyte component. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen showed no adenopathy. The granulomatous reaction was initially diagnosed as sarcoidosis, and was started on corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there was no improvement in the lesions.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Erythematous violaceous plaque over back in the lumbar area._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Subsequently few years later, two other biopsies of the hyperpigmented and erythematous plaques were performed. Immunohistochemical staining of the specimen composed of T-helper cell subtypes CD2+, CD3+, CD5+ with partial loss of CD7. Numerous T-suppressor/CD8+ subsets was seen with none expressing B-cell markers. There was prominent positivity of numerous histiocytes with CD4. A few rare cells stained CD30+. Loss of one or more of the pan T-cell markers, mostly CD5/CD7 is common in mycosis fungoides. Twenty percent of early mycosis fungoides show CD8+ ( Figs. 2 , 3 ). Molecular studies with T-cell receptor gene rearrangement showed evidence of T-cell clonality, favoring diagnosis of GrMF.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Skin biopsy. (a) CD3 stain.

However, she later developed significant numbness and tingling of the toes as an adverse effect of brentuximab, leading to its discontinuation. The biopsy at this stage stained positive for CD30. Finally, radiation therapy was started, following which the lesion showed marked improvement in its appearance ( Fig. 4 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Improvement of plaque over back._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】Mycosis fungoides is the most commonly described primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. GrMF is a rare subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma first described by Ackerman and Flaxman in 1970. GrMF is characterized by dermal invasion of T cells with associated epithelioid and giant cells. It typically affects middle-aged adults and may present initially as a patch and then progresses to plaque and eventually evolve into a tumor in some individuals. In different studies, it is also found that there is a slightly increased incidence of lympho-proliferative disease, occurring after chronic sarcoidosis, probably as a consequence of immunologic abnormalities observed in lymphoproliferative disease \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【18】A strong granulomatous component can sometimes obscure the underlying cutaneous lymphoma, which is mistaken for cutaneous sarcoidosis \\[ 3 \\]. Only few cases have been reported in literature about GrMF being mistaken for sarcoidosis as depicted in our case \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. In most cases, cutaneous granulomatous lesions follow the course of underlying lymphoproliferative disease and are considered as a possible malignant lymphoma \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】Diagnosis can be challenging due to heterogeneous clinical and histopathological features. No particular diagnostic clinical criteria are available for diagnosis of GrMF, because of its variable presentations and hence the detection of GrMF is primarily considered histopathology diagnosis \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【20】Histologically, GrMF shows dermal T-cell intrusion with epithelioid and giant cell granulomas without necrosis mimicking other granulomatous disease like sarcoidosis. Variants may be misleading simulating other inflammatory dermopathies when the epithelioid and giant cell feature dominates \\[ 7 \\]. Distinct clinical characteristics are not present. Apart from granulomatous formation, no other noticeable features are evident. The same features were seen in our patient, which misdirected the diagnosis as sarcoidosis. The International Society of Cutaneous Lymphoma consensus algorithm advocates immunophenotyping and molecular gene rearrangement studies to aid clinic-pathological diagnosis of GrMF \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【21】Patients with stage 4 disease, advanced age, blacks have worse prognosis, while a survival rate of stage 1 disease is more than 20 years. The clinical significance of granulomas in prognostication of mycosis fungoides is uncertain as both indolent and aggressive cases have been described.\n\n【22】**Conclusions**\n\n【23】GrMF is a diagnostic challenge, in the light of perplexing histopathological variants. Our case adds to growing number of GrMF cases misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis highlighting the plight of diagnostic obstacles. When the patient’s clinical course does not support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the coexistence of granulomas and typical histologic features of mycosis fungoides should indicate GrMF. Clinical dissection of atypical clinic-pathological variants coupled with immunophenotyping and molecular genetics, is crucial for early diagnosis and accurate treatment.\n\n【24】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【25】None to declare.\n\n【26】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【27】No funding.\n\n【28】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【29】No conflict of interest to disclose.\n\n【30】**Informed Consent**\n\n【31】Patient consent was taken.\n\n【32】**Author Contributions**\n\n【33】All authors equally contributed to this manuscript.\n\n【34】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination revealed a firm 1.5 × 1 cm sized firm mass in the scaphoid fossa and protruded slightly into the posterior helix ( Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent an excisional biopsy for diagnosis. After local infiltration with 2% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine, a helical incision was made. After elevation of the subperichondrial flap beyond the mass, a tangential incision was made around mass through the cartilage. After extirpating the mass, the perichondrial flap was returned to its original position and sutured back. In order to prevent hematoma formation, a compression dressing was applied for 2 days after surgery. Histological examination revealed an intracartilaginous cyst without an epithelial lining, and fibrosis with focal destruction and inflammation of the cartilage ( Fig. 2 ). The pathologic features of the mass were diagnostic for a BICC. The patient is now 7 months post surgery and is free of recurrence and cosmetic deformity of his auricle.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (A) A painless, dome-shaped cystic mass (arrow) in the right auricle.

This however, was not present in our patient’s history. The second hypothesis is that the auricular cartilage dysplasia can be a cause of BICC \\[ 3 \\]. In the embryologic development of auricle from the first and second branchial arch, residual tissue may be leaved within the cartilage by dysplasia. An additional stimulus might be required to open this potential space to form a BICC \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【13】Histologically, BICC is an intracartilaginous cystic space without epithelial lining ( Figs. 2 , 3A ) unlike other auricular pathology such as otohematoma ( Fig. 3B ), hence, called pseudocyst \\[ 5 \\].

The therapeutic goal is to remove the BICC with restored the normal architecture of the auricle and without recurrence. Treatment options include intralesional injection of corticosteroids after aspiration and surgical excision. A simple needle aspiration often causes fluid to reaccumulate and recurrence. In “de-roofing” techniques \\[ 2 \\], the anterior wall of a BICC is resected along the entire circumference of the lesion. The granulation on the posterior wall is also curetted, leaving the posterior wall intact. By leaving the posterior wall intact, there is no cosmetic deformity.

Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP) is rare but a potentially life-threatening lesion. Although many clinical interventions have been postulated to be responsible for development of UAP, cesarean section (CS) has seemed to be the most frequent cause of UAP because CS has possibilities of causing vessel injuries involving branches of uterine arteries \\[ 3 \\]. The initial usefulness of ultrasonography for suspecting UAP has been well documented \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]. The unexpected appearance of uterine anechoic lesions at ultrasonography can suggest the presence of UAP. The utilization of color Doppler seems to assist the confirmed diagnosis of UAP. Within the UAP, in addition, swirling arterial flow with different directions and velocities has been reported to be observed like the current case \\[ 2 \\]. We present here a case of UAP following emergency CS diagnosed by ultrasonography.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 30-year-old woman, gravid 1, para 1 with no previous disease or family history underwent an emergency CS at 40 weeks of gestation because of intrauterine infection and fetal asphyxia. A male infant weighing 2,922 g was born with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Histopathology of the placenta did not demonstrate any abnormal findings except acute funisitis with chorioamnionitis. Total blood loss during surgery was 500 mL. The clinical course until several hours after CS was uneventful without any further complications. Seven hours after CS, sudden massive vaginal bleeding of 1,500 mL occurred. The hemoglobin concentration decreased to 6.6 g/dL. And then, genital bleeding of about 1,000 mL/h persisted for 2 h. Transvaginal ultrasonography with color Doppler revealed the presence of low density cyst with a diameter of 4 cm with spiral pulsating blood flow in the cavity of the cyst in the vicinity of the ascending branches of the left uterine artery ( Fig. 1 ). The arterial blood flows like a jet into the cavity during systole were also observed ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Transvaginal ultrasonography showing the presence of low density cyst with a diameter of 4 cm with spiral pulsating blood flow in the cavity of the cyst in the vicinity of the ascending branches of the left uterine artery._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Transvaginal ultrasonography showing the arterial blood flows like a jet into the cavity during systole._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】We diagnosed it as UAP, and total hysterectomy was performed because of unstable vital signs under transfusion.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】In the current case, we were able to diagnose UAP only by ultrasonography; however, the diagnosed period seemed to be too late unfortunately.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis should be made using color Doppler ultrasonography to avert life-threatening bleeding since it plays a significant role in demonstrating the vascular nature of this anechoic uterine lesion. If the earlier diagnosis of smaller UAP could be performed, an informed consent concerning arterial embolization might be possible to be performed.

SPPT was first described by Frantz in 1959 \\[ 2 \\] and was designated as a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas by WHO in 1996 \\[ 3 \\]. These tumors affect predominantly young females between 20 - 30 years of age \\[ 1 , 4 \\] and are of unclear pathogenesis and low malignancy which with an overall 5 years survival rate of 98% and 10 year of 93% respectively after surgery \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【3】Surgical resection offers an excellent chance for long-term survival, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy, local tumor resection, segmental pancreas resection, resection of pancreatic body and tail and spleen resection.\n\n【4】Pancreatic resection for pancreatic borderline and malignancy tumor such as SPPT is selected only if all gross tumors can be removed to increase the cure rate. As the pancreas is so close to the blood vessels include SMV, SMA and HA, which make tumor resection being a great challenge. Radical cure by traditional surgical procedures may be difficult \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In order to achieve radical resection, pancreatoduodenectomy combined with vascular reconstruction as a type of curative surgery should be performed by excellent surgical technology which leads to less postoperative complication \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【5】We present the case of a young girl who successfully underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy accompanied by SMA reconstruction in our center for an SPPT of the pancreatic head with blood vessels invasion.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】**Present history**\n\n【9】A 19-year-old girl was referred to our clinic for the management of a mass located in the right upper abdomen.

For further treatment, she was admitted.\n\n【10】**Physical examination**\n\n【11】Vital signs are stable. A huge mass can be touched in right upper abdomen.\n\n【12】**Laboratory data**\n\n【13】Blood investigation and tumor markers (CEA, CA-153, CA-199, and CA-125) were within normal limits.\n\n【14】**Image findings**\n\n【15】In our hospital, we investigated the computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan, which revealed that the mass was located in the right upper abdomen and the celiac, gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were tumor feeding vessels ( Fig.1 , 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** CT scan showing a cystic mass (12.2 cm \\* 15.4 cm) at the head of the pancreas in a 19-year-old girl with duodenum and pancreas compressed._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** CTA showed that SMA was invaded._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed a space-occupying lesion of maximum diameter of 18.2 cm located in the right upper abdomen, with compressed and displacement of the common bile duct and dilation of pancreatic body and tail duct ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** MRCP showed a space-occupying lesion (15.9 cm \\* 14.6cm) located in the right upper abdomen, with compressed and displacement of the common bile duct and dilation of pancreatic body and tail duct_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【22】For diagnosis, a B ultrasound-guided puncture of the mass was performed before surgery and the pathology showed small round cell malignancies.\n\n【23】**Treatment**\n\n【24】She underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) done by our surgical team. In the operation, we found duodenum and pancreas were compressed and the SMA and SMV were both invaded and came through the tumor. So the SMA and SMV reconstruction were performed. Especially, we reconstruct the SMA by self great saphenous vein transplantation. The resection material was sent to the pathology department ( Fig. 4A, B ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Gross appearance. A.

Microscopic analysis revealed the diagnosis of solid pseudo-papillary tumor. Results of immunoperoxidase stains showed tumor cells that were positive for CK, CD56, CD10 and β-catenin. In the evaluation of Ki-67, less than 2% of the tumor cells showed nuclear proliferative activity.\n\n【27】The patient was subsequently discharged after 2 weeks. CT scan performed 6 months postoperatively showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【29】* * *\n\n【30】SPPT was first described by Frantz in 1959 \\[ 2 \\]. Frantz tumor, solid and cystic tumor, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm, papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, and Hamoudi tumor have been used to describe this rare lesion \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. From 1996, the tumor was designated as a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas by WHO \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【31】Patients with SPTT usually experience epigastric discomfort, nausea, weight loss, pain which are vague and unspecific, and they may have a palpable abdominal mass \\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]. Some patients have no clinical symptoms but are discovered by common physical examination. In the present case, the patient remained asymptomatic although an increase of the lesion up to more than 18 cm diameter and SMV compression was assessed when she came to our department.\n\n【32】Most of the tumor was 5 - 10 cm in size while in our case the rare size of 19 cm was observed \\[ 5 \\]. SPTT cells are typically positive for vimentin, CD10, CD56 and alpha-1-antitrypsin and may reveal focal immunoreactivity for neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin and synaptophysin, demonstrate abnormal nuclear localization of beta-catenin and may express galectin-3, all of which are useful in differentiating them from endocrine pancreatic tumor cells \\[ 10 , 14 , 15 \\]. In the present case, immunoperoxidase stains showed SPTT cells were positive for CK, Vimentin, CD56, CD10 and β-catenin, which confirmed that SPTT is not an endocrine origin.\n\n【33】Surgical resection is the first choice of treatment which including pancreaticoduodenectomy, local tumor resection, segmental pancreas resection, resection of pancreatic body and tail and spleen resection according to the location of the tumor \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. Other adjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, had shown no demonstrable response \\[ 18 \\]. Up to now, open laparotomy has been considered as the treatment of choice. To avoid metastatic spread, laparoscopic or laparotomic biopsy should not be performed in patients affected by SPTT \\[ 19 , 20 \\].\n\n【34】About 15% of cases of SPT have shown aggressive behavior consisting of extension into adjacent blood vessels and organs, local recurrence and distant metastasis \\[ 18 , 21 \\]. In our case, the tumor located in the pancreatic head with SMA invaded. So the reconstruction of blood vessels was performed. An excellent outcome has been achieved with 3 months follow-up at the time writing this article.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】In this article we described a rare case of SMA involvement and blood vessels reconstruction was performed.\n\n【37】**Conflict of Interest Statement**\n\n【38】All the authors indicated that we have no financial relationship with the organization that sponsored the research.

Of the endemic mycoses, it is the most common cause of hospitalization and death in the United States \\[ 2 \\]. The clinical spectrum of this disease is broad and can be classified based on disease cadence (acute, subacute, chronic), onset (primary versus reactivation), distribution (pulmonary, mediastinal, disseminated, extrapulmonary), and severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe) \\[ 1 \\]. The geographic distribution of histoplasmosis is poorly understood; however, several hypothesized factors for increasing incidence include moderate temperatures and bird or bat guano exposure \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【3】Patients in non-endemic regions may also experience histoplasmosis. The most common reason for histoplasmosis in non-endemic regions is prior exposure to _H. capsulatum_ in an endemic region \\[ 3 \\]. Another modality for developing non-endemic histoplasmosis is reactivation of an old infection, which has been noted in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) \\[ 3 \\]. Patient risk factors for developing histoplasmosis include extremes of age, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), AIDS, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, and use of immunosuppressive medications \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【4】In particular, nearly all patients infected by HIV, or those who have progressed to AIDS, develop progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) due to primary infection with _H. capsulatum_ \\[ 1 \\]. PDH develops when the inhaled yeast overcomes the host’s immunological defense mechanisms and spreads through the blood, seeding to other organs such as the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, skin, lungs, and adrenal glands \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Thus, due to the propensity for multiorgan involvement in PDH, prompt treatment is necessary, as is consultation with an infectious disease expert. Here, we describe the case of a 33-year-old male who presented to a California hospital, developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and was ultimately diagnosed with PDH based on urinary testing and bronchoscopy pathologic findings.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】**Investigations**\n\n【8】A 33-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to our emergency department with chronic diarrhea of 1 month’s duration, odynophagia, and abdominal pain. He reported three to four episodes of non-bloody diarrhea daily, non-bloody, non-bilious emesis, yellow-colored sputum production, cough, fevers, chills, and dyspnea. He denied any hematochezia, melena, mucoid stools, rash, weight loss, night sweats, sick contacts, previous hospitalizations, or previous surgeries. He also denied active tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. His family history was unknown, as he had been estranged from his family. At the time of presentation, he worked in a taco restaurant in San Bernardino County, California and denied any recent travel outside of the county. Regarding occupational exposures, he denied ever working in a shipyard, with industrial chemicals, in a factory, with jet fuel, or on a farm. He also denied having pets or exploring caves. Sexual history was notable for multiple male sexual partners while living in Michoacan, Mexico, where he was born and raised. The patient’s initial vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 38.3 °C, pulse rate of 124, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure of 111/62 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ambient air. Physical exam revealed an ill-appearing, fatigued young male with mild, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy and diffuse abdominal tenderness to deep palpation. He did not have any rashes or skin lesions, and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without increased work of breathing.\n\n【9】**Diagnosis**\n\n【10】His initial blood counts and metabolic panel were notable for a normocytic anemia, mild bandemia, moderate hyponatremia, mild hypokalemia, and mild hypochloremia ( Table 1 ). Serology was positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening. Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative. Blood, sputum, and stool cultures were also obtained at this time. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous (IV) contrast was unremarkable, except for mild splenomegaly.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Initial Laboratory Findings, Demonstrating Anemia, Hyponatremia, Hypokalemia, and Hypochloremia_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole therapy for sepsis due to a likely intra-abdominal source. Over the course of the next 24 - 48 h, the patient began complaining of worsening shortness of breath requiring supplemental low flow oxygen. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities ( Fig. 1 ). Due to a concern for atypical pneumonia, IV azithromycin was added to his antibiotic regimen. Shortly thereafter, he continued to desaturate on 5 L of nasal cannula supplemental oxygen, so he was placed on high flow nasal cannula with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 35% and flow rate of 60 L/min. Due to a concern for pulmonary embolism, CT angiogram of his chest was obtained, demonstrating patent pulmonary arteries; however, diffuse ground glass opacifications, mediastinal adenopathy, and hilar adenopathy were noted ( Fig. 2 ). All the while, the patient continued to have a productive cough and low-grade fevers. The diagnostic workup is detailed in Figure 3 .\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Posterior-anterior chest radiograph demonstrating diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacifications (red arrows) and elevated left hemidiaphragm (blue arrow)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Axial view of a computed tomography of the chest with intravenous contrast demonstrating diffuse reticulonodular opacities (red arrows), ground glass opacities, and air bronchograms (blue arrows)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Flow diagram of diagnostic workup for disseminated histoplasmosis._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】The next day, the patient’s absolute CD4 cell count was noted to be severely low at < 20 (n = 490 - 1,740 cells/µL) and serum 1,3-beta-D-glucan was positive. With the input of the Infectious Disease specialist, he was started on IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 600 mg every 6 h and oral prednisone 40 mg daily due to concern for _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia (PJP) in the setting of an AIDS diagnosis. Regarding cultures, blood and stool cultures did not demonstrate growth; however, sputum cultures demonstrated growth of methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Enterobacter cloacae_ . Three separate sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears were negative, ruling out active tuberculosis. _Clostridium difficile_ toxin PCR, Epstein-Barr virus quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and cytomegalovirus RT-PCR, _Toxoplasma_ immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG, urine _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ antigen, urine _Legionella_ antigen, serum _Coccidioides_ antibody, and serum cryptococcal antigen testing were all negative. Celiac disease was also ruled out based on serologic testing. Interestingly, the patient was noted to have serum _Histoplasma_ antibody complement fixation titers of 1:32 (n ≤ 1:8) and positive results for urine _Histoplasma_ galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (MiraVista Diagnostics), suggesting a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.\n\n【20】The patient subsequently underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for further characterization of pulmonary findings. During the procedure, the vocal cords, trachea, and upper airways were within normal limits; however, thin, frothy, white secretions were appreciated in the right and left lungs, which were sent for fluid studies. Results were negative for AFB smear, AFB culture, and _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ direct fluorescent assay. Respiratory cultures from the bronchoscopy yielded rare yeast, and cytology from the BAL revealed scattered foamy macrophages containing clusters of tiny intracytoplasmic yeasts, suggesting pulmonary histoplasmosis. Left lower lobe lingular washings also revealed intracytoplasmic organisms which may have represented _Histoplasma_ as well.\n\n【21】**Treatment**\n\n【22】In the setting of this patient’s disseminated histoplasmosis, the Infectious Disease and Pulmonary specialists recommended starting treatment with IV liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks in addition to adjunctive treatment with IV methylprednisolone 60 mg daily. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated with daily oral bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Treatment for PJP was discontinued, and prophylaxis for PJP and toxoplasmosis was initiated with oral atovaquone 1,500 mg daily. Additionally, due to positive sputum cultures suggesting a superimposed bacterial infection, as mentioned above, IV cefepime 2 g every 8 h was administered for a 7-day course.\n\n【23】Our patient’s symptoms slowly began to improve over the course of the hospital stay with targeted therapy for disseminated histoplasmosis, AIDS, and a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. After 1 week of this targeted therapy, the patient’s supplemental oxygen requirements decreased, and he was eventually completely weaned off oxygen support. After 2 weeks of amphotericin B, the patient was transitioned to oral itraconazole 300 mg (three times a day for 3 total days), followed by oral itraconazole 200 mg two times a day until outpatient follow-up in the Infectious Disease clinic. The patient was also transitioned to oral steroids with a tapering schedule set in place.\n\n【24】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【25】At the time of discharge, 3 weeks after presentation to the hospital, the patient’s symptoms had all resolved and he felt that he was back to his baseline. He was scheduled for strict outpatient follow-up in our institution’s Primary Care clinic, Infectious Disease clinic, and Pulmonology clinic. He has followed up in the aforementioned clinics and tolerated his treatment well, without any adverse events.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】Though histoplasmosis is endemic to the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, it may also present in non-endemic regions due to a variety of patient factors. Benedict et al (2016) identified 105 outbreaks of histoplasmosis, defined by at least two cases of histoplasmosis associated with a common environmental source, in the United States between 1938 and 2013, none of which occurred in California \\[ 4 \\]. Further, in the last decade, only one case report has described histoplasmosis in California \\[ 5 \\]. Thus, a diagnosis of histoplasmosis in California is exceedingly rare. Through a detailed travel history, we identified that the likely source of initial infection for our patient occurred while living in Michoacan, Mexico, where the patient was born and grew up. The patient immigrated to the United States 7 months prior to presentation. Thus, reactivation of _H. capsulatum_ is the likely reason for his current disseminated infection, consistent with the mechanism for non-endemic disease manifestation in AIDS patients described by Wheat (2006) \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【29】The diagnosis of histoplasmosis is typically multifaceted, including histopathological examination, culture, antigen detection, and antibody detection \\[ 5 \\]. In a large multicenter study, urine _Histoplasma_ antigen testing had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 99% \\[ 6 \\]. They also demonstrated that, in cases of proven PDH, cultures were positive 91.6% of the time, pathology was positive 85.3% of the time, and anti- _Histoplasma_ antibodies were positive 73.6% of the time \\[ 6 \\]. Based on these results, a broad approach to diagnosing histoplasmosis is supported \\[ 6 \\]. In our case, the patient’s laboratory testing was significant for positive urine antigen testing and serum antibody testing, suggesting a diagnosis of PDH, as evidence of _Histoplasma_ was found separately in the blood and urine. Additionally, diffuse pulmonary reticulonodular opacifications noted on thoracic imaging, typical of PDH, and a history of untreated AIDS further corroborates this diagnosis \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【30】Based on the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, the treatment of moderately severe and severe PDH typically includes daily IV liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg) for 1 - 2 weeks followed by oral itraconazole (200 mg three times daily, followed by 200 mg twice daily) for at least 12 months \\[ 1 \\- 3 , 7 \\]. Mild-to-moderate PDH may be treated with oral itraconazole monotherapy for at least 12 months \\[ 7 \\]. Additionally, for patients who are unable to reverse immunosuppression, lifelong itraconazole therapy may be warranted \\[ 7 \\]. Our patient received 2 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole therapy, which is consistent with the current IDSA guidelines. He did not experience any adverse effects from medical therapy and was discharged with close follow-up to ensure compliance with histoplasmosis treatment and antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【31】This case report’s strength lies in the fact that the patient underwent a thorough pulmonary and overall infectious disease workup. The case is limited in that there are such few cases of PDH in California; however, we believe that this limitation allows us to contribute to the limited current body of literature citing cases of PDH in California.\n\n【32】**Conclusions**\n\n【33】PDH is a rare diagnosis in non-endemic regions of the United States such as California. AIDS patients with histoplasmosis present with a myriad of nonspecific infectious symptoms, and failure to consider histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis may lead to delays in care for this vulnerable population. Consequently, it is important for clinicians to recognize manifestations of non-endemic mycoses and obtain a full infectious workup in immunocompromised patients, as histoplasmosis is a treatable condition.\n\n【34】**Learning points**\n\n【35】Physicians in areas not endemic to histoplasmosis may not consider this at the top of their differential diagnoses, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. As global travel is easily accessible to many, physicians should treat all immunocompromised patients with a broad scope of infectious diseases, including non-endemic mycoses. It is important for all healthcare providers to become familiar with the manifestations and diagnosis of histoplasmosis to promote prompt treatment of a potentially life-threatening disease.\n\n【36】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【37】The authors would like to thank and express their gratitude to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center’s exceptional nursing staff and unit managers for their expert clinical support.\n\n【38】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【39】The authors have no financial or funding disclosures.\n\n【40】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【41】The authors declare there is no conflict of interest.\n\n【42】**Informed Consent**\n\n【43】Informed consent was obtained from the family of the patient.

The most common sources of metastases to the thyroid are kidney, skin, breast and lung. Clear cell carcinoma is the most common histologic type of RCC. In one-third of cases, the metastasis occurs many years after diagnosing the primary RCC. The most common manifestation of thyroid metastasis is an enlarged thyroid gland or a palpable neck mass.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 53-year-old female presented to the ENT outpatient department with a history of sensation of something in her neck for almost 6 months. Examination revealed evidence of a 2 cm nodule in the right thyroid lobe. This was confirmed by an ultrasound scan. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration cytology which showed suspicious cells but was not diagnostic. A right hemi-thyroidectomy was therefore carried out. Frozen section also failed to give a definitive diagnosis. The histopathological examination showed metastatic RCC of clear cell type ( Fig. 1 ). Immunohistochemical staining showed CD10 positivity ( Fig. 2 ) in the RCC areas and thyroglobulin positivity ( Fig. 3 ) in the normal thyroid tissue areas of the specimen.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** This slide shows both RCC and adjacent benign thyroid tissue.

At that time she had undergone right radical nephrectomy. The histology at that time showed clear cell RCC. She was followed up by the nephrologists for almost 10 years and no evidence of recurrence noted. Tumor was not infiltrating through the capsule. Surgical margins and bladder cuff were free of tumor. TNM staging was that of T2N0M0.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Incidence of RCC has been rising in the last few decades and accounts for 3% of adult malignancies \\[ 1 \\]. RCC is the most common malignant epithelial tumor of the kidney, accounting for 85-90% of all solid renal tumors in adults \\[ 2 \\]. In almost half of the patients with RCC, metastasis was noted at the time of presentation \\[ 3 \\]. There are three major types of RCC. These are papillary, clear cell and chromophobe. Clear cell carcinoma is the most common type accounting for 75% of all RCCs. Clear cell RCC has an unfavorable diagnosis compared to the other subtypes \\[ 4 \\]. It is documented that recurrence and distant metastasis may occur many years following radical nephrectomy for RCC. Such a late occurrence of metastasis necessitates the need for long-term follow-up of these patients \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【15】Metastatic tumors in the thyroid gland are rare compared to primary tumors \\[ 6 \\]. The spread of non-thyroid malignancies in the thyroid has been reported in 1.4-3% of patients with thyroid malignancies undergoing thyroid surgery \\[ 7 \\]. The thyroid gland is among the most vascularized organs in the body and hence is vulnerable to metastatic disease \\[ 3 \\]. The most common sources of metastases to the thyroid include kidney, skin, breast, and lung, and head and neck, but more than 50% of the time the source is RCC in clinically recognized metastasis to the thyroid \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【16】RCC of the thyroid has been documented in the past. Based on autopsy findings, Chung et al detected thyroid metastasis from RCC in 5% of the cases \\[ 10 \\]. A 20-year retrospective review of surgical pathology and autopsy pathology database for patients with metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid identified a total of 10 patients with metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid; six were in surgical pathology specimens out of a total of 1,295 thyroid carcinomas (0.46%) and four were diagnosed at autopsy out of a total of 2,117 (0.19%) autopsy cases during this period \\[ 11 \\]. The primary tumor was RCC only in one of these 10 cases.\n\n【17】Metastatic deposits in the thyroid may be asymptomatic or present with few symptoms. The usual symptoms of metastatic RCC to the thyroid gland are enlarged solitary or multiple neck swellings, painless palpable thyroid nodules, shortness of breath, vocal changes, wheezing and difficulty in swallowing, but most secondary metastases of the thyroid are asymptomatic. However, because both RCC and clear cell thyroid follicular tumors contain clear cytoplasmic characteristics, using fine needle aspiration cytology alone creates an increased chance of misdiagnosis \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【18】Fine needle aspiration cytology is a useful diagnostic test in detecting renal cell metastasis in thyroid. However, when FNA findings are inconclusive, hemi- or total thyroidectomy needs to be done to confirm the diagnosis. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy are also useful tools to make the distinction between primary and metastatic tumors. RCC has a slow growth rate with low glucose metabolism, and therefore the PET scan may fail to detect the cancer \\[ 1 \\]. Thyroid nodule in any patient with a past history of renal cell malignancy should be considered as potentially metastatic.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Recent research indicates that 42.5 percent of women have genital HPV infections, whereas less than 7 percent of adults have oral HPV infections \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Potentially, all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, with just two HPV types, 16 and 18, responsible for about 70 percent of all cases \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In 2006 a tetravalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was licensed for use in women, aged 9 - 26 years \\[ 6 \\]. The L1 major capsid protein of HPV is the antigen used for HPV vaccination \\[ 7 \\]. Recombinant DNA technology allows the production of the L1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae so that protein can self-assemble into not infective virus-like particles (VLP). VLP was adsorbed on an aluminum-coating adjuvant \\[ 2 \\]. Adverse events associated to the administration of the HPV tetravalent vaccine include pain, swelling and erythema, whereas hives, gastroenteritis, headache/hypertension, vaginal hemorrhage and broncospasm are rare \\[ 8 \\]. Among the reported side effects there is no reference about the possibility of the development of a granulomatous reaction.\n\n【3】In this report, we describe the study of a granuloma arisen in a patient after the administration of the HPV tetravalent vaccine. The granuloma has been evaluated by histology, electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis. In particular, EDX microanalysis, used to investigate the elemental composition of the histiocytes’s granules within the analyzed granuloma, allowed us to demonstrate the presence of aluminum inside hystiocytes present in the lesion.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】We report the case of an eighteen years old girl who developed a subcutaneous nodular lesion localized on her right upper arm. The lesion was excised by surgical resection and submitted to histological analysis. Macroscopic examination revealed a soft subcutaneous nodule, whitish-gray, well circumscribed, measuring 1 × 2 cm. A thin slice of the lesion was fixed in Karnowsky solution and embedded in resin for ultrastructural analysis and investigations by microanalysis technique.\n\n【7】Conventional histological examination revealed a lesion characterized by a necrotic center surrounded by palisading epithelioid histiocytes embedded into the fibroadipous and skeletal muscle tissue ( Fig.1 panel A, B and C). This granulomatous lesion closely resembled a deep granuloma annulare or rheumatoid nodule. The histiocytes contained abundant intracytoplasmic violaceous/gray granular material PAS and Ziehl-Nielsen negative, excluding the presence of fungi and of alcohol acid resistant microorganisms.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Panel A to C: hematoxylin eosin section of the lesion showing a granulomatous reaction with lymphatic follicle formation (panel A magnification 4 ×), macrophages and lymphoplasmacellular infiltrate (panel B, MAGNIFICATION 10 ×).The lesion is characterized by a necrotic center (asterisk in panel C) surrounded by palisading epithelioid histiocytes (arrow in panel C). PANEL D to F: conventional transmission electron microscopy characterization of the lesion. PANEL D shows a big histiocyte’s granule (arrow) containing fibrillar electron dense material (MAGNIFICATION 3,500 ×). The ultrastructural study demonstrated the presence of needle-shaped crystalline material with variable thickness (PANEL E 10,000 × -arrow-; PANEL F 50,000 ×). EDX microanalysis spectrum (PANEL G) reveals the presence of large amounts of aluminum (circle) and of elements referable to the nickel support (Ni) and to biological compounds (P, CL, C and O)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】The inflammatory cells of the granuloma were CD 20 and CD 3 positive, CD 15 and CD 30 negative; a mild positivity for CD 68 could be detected. These data and the follicles-like organization of the lesion, pointing out an inflammatory infiltrate, rich in B and T lymphocytes, excluded the diagnosis of lymphoma.\n\n【10】Transmission electron microscopy analysis ( Fig.1 panel D, E and F) confirmed the histological observations in terms of cellular composition of the granuloma. Higher magnifications revealed the presence of abundant histyocites’s granules containing a needle-shaped, crystalline material with variable thickness.\n\n【11】The ultrastructural microanalysis shed light on the elemental composition of the examined granulomatous formation since it clearly detected metallic deposits with an emission pick at EDX for aluminum within the hystocites’s granules. The obtained spectrums revealed the presence of large amounts of aluminum, elements referable to the nickel support (Ni) and to biological compounds (C, Cl, P and O) ( Fig.1 panel G).\n\n【12】Anamnestic data revealed that the patient was negative for nodal and spleen enlargement and for any recent infectious disease or beetle bite near the site of the lesion. The only relevant data were that she approximately one year before the onset of the granuloma was submitted to tetravalent HPV-vaccine inoculums at the site of the granulomatous lesion.\n\n【13】It is interesting to note that the adjuvant system of the tetravalent HPV is made of aluminum salts. Other anamnestic data were not contributory. Therefore the histological and ultrastructural reported data were consistent with the diagnosis of subcutaneous granuloma related to the aluminum present in the vaccine inoculum. The patient recovered well from her procedure and had no further complications (two years followup).\n\n【14】**Histological analysis**\n\n【15】After fixation in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, the tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【16】For immunohistochemistry, 4 µm paraffin sections have been processed by the automatized system Bench Mark Ventana (F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Konzern-Hauptsitz Grenzacherstrasse 124 CH-4070 Basel, Schweiz). Sections, after pretreatment, were incubated with mouse anti-CD20 (clone L26, Roche) rabbit anti-CD3 (clone 2GV6, Roche), rabbit anti-CD15 (clone MMA, Roche) and mouse anti-CD68 (clone HP-1, Roche). The reactions were revealed by nonbiotin peroxidase detection system Ventana (F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Konzern-Hauptsitz Grenzacherstrasse 124 CH-4070 Basel, Schweiz).\n\n【17】PAS and Ziehl-Nielsen stainings have been performed by Artisan automatized system (Dako Denmark A/S Produktionsvej 42 Glostrup Denmark).\n\n【18】**Transmission electron microscopy and microanalysis**\n\n【19】A section of the sample was immediately fixed by immersion in Karnovsky solution \\[ 10 \\] and then post-fixed in Osmium Tetroxide 2% \\[ 11 \\]. After washing with phosphate buffer 0.1 M, the sample was dehydrated by a series of incubations in 30%, 50%, 70%, 95% ethanol. Dehydration has been continued by incubations in absolute ethanol and propylene oxide. The sample was then embedded in Epon 812 \\[ 12 \\] (Agar Scientific Elektron Technology UK Ltd Unit 7, Stansted, Essex CM24 8GF United Kingdom).\n\n【20】After inclusion the tissue was cut \\[ 13 , 14 \\] and stained with heavy metals solutions (uranium acetate and lead citrate) as described by Reynolds \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【21】Ultrathin-sections, approximately 100 nm thick, were mounted on aluminum grids for microanalysis. EDX spectra of hystocites’s granules in non-stained sections were acquired on a Hitachi 7100FA transmission Electron Microscope (AEM) equipped with a Gatan BioScan Camera model 820 and a Thermo Scientific EDX detector at an acceleration voltage of 75 KeV and magnification of 12000. Spectra were semi-quantitatively analyzed by the Noram System Six software using the standardless Cliff-Lorimer k-factor method \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【22】To calibrate the EDX apparatus reference standard for x-ray microanalysis of MAC industry (Micro-Analysis Consultants Ltd, 19 Edison Road, St.Ives Industrial Estate, St.Ives, Cambridgeshire PE27 3LF UK) has been used.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】* * *\n\n【25】In this paper we report, for the first time, a transmission electron microscopy analysis associated to the elemental composition study in order to demonstrate the presence of aluminum inside the cells of a granulomatous reaction at the inoculum site of HPV vaccine.\n\n【26】Recently, a granulomatous reaction related to aluminum HPV vaccine has been described by Marsee DK. et al. \\[ 17 \\]. This evidence was demonstrated through the histochemical staining “alluminon” (aurintricarboxylate aluminum).\n\n【27】Our data confirm and give strength to this observation since the “alluminon” method used by Marsee resulted to be not so specific, due to the simultaneous reaction with aluminum and other elements, such as iron and beryllium. The intensity of the staining obtained by “alluminon” method is subjected to the presence of interfering ions. Stain formation, which occurs only over a limited range of Al concentrations, is prevented by the presence of some chemical agents \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【28】Ultrastructural microanalysis provided a punctual analysis of the tissue with a high specificity, distinguishing among the different chemical elemental forms and associating the microanalitical data to the ultrastuctural morphology.\n\n【29】This advantageous technique allows us to exclusively analyze the inside of the hystiocites’s granules, determining the elemental composition of the resident crystals. The specificity of the analysis is evaluated through the parallel analysis of the MAC’s sample standards.\n\n【30】A wider case study about the formation of persistent nodules at the injection sites of not HPV vaccines has been reported. Bergfors et al. \\[ 19 \\] described the formation, in 19 children, of persistent pruritic nodules at the injection sites of vaccines adsorbed with aluminum’s salts, most commonly reported after diphtheria-tethanus, pertussis and B-hepatitis vaccines.\n\n【31】Epicutaneous testing for delayed hypersensitivity to aluminum had been used to demonstrate the immune reaction against this metal. Any histological study was added to this test.\n\n【32】Choget et al. \\[ 20 \\] described 14 cases of patients different for sex and age who developed aluminum granulomas at the vaccine injection sites, correlated to histological data. The morphological analysis of these samples revealed different histological patterns such as panniculitis reaction with or without foreign body-type giant cells, pseudo-lymphoma and necrotizing granuloma. Many times the characterization of histiocyte’s granules becomes essential for the differential diagnosis. Exclusion of malignant pathology (i.e. lymphoma) in the differential diagnosis underlies the importance of a fine morphological characterization of the lesion.\n\n【33】To this end, we consider notable the work of Morroni et al. \\[ 21 \\], that in 1995 studied a subcutaneous granuloma through EDX microanalysis associated to the scanning electron microscopy and the ESI (electron spectroscopic imaging) technology.\n\n【34】In our study, thanks to the EDX apparatus, directly associated to the electron transmission microscope, we could find a fine correspondence between the ultrastuctural datum and the microanalitical one.\n\n【35】In conclusion, our results support previous published data about the reactive nature of granulomas at the site of vaccine. The presence of aluminum inside the cytoplasm of macrophages, proved by microanalysis, gives strength to the etiopathogenic hypothesis of the granuloma formation. Moreover these data suggest a specific role of the ultrastructural and microanalitical analysis in the clinical practice with regard to the differential diagnosis of metal/pollutant related pathology.\n\n【36】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In the adolescent population, it is recognized that one cause of such issues is the introduction of electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes were patented in China in 2003 and subsequently released in the United States in 2007 \\[ 2 \\]. Although electronic cigarettes have many names, designs and a variety of different features, their basic components include a battery, electronic heater and liquid solution \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. In most cases, the electronic cigarette is used to deliver the addictive chemical, nicotine, through inhalation by aerosolization. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the popularity and use of electronic cigarettes. The expansion of these products and their popularity has resulted in a multi-billion-dollar industry \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. While electronic cigarettes were initially thought to be a mechanism for smoking cessation with elimination of some of the safety issues related to the inhalation of tobacco smoke, the long-term safety and health effects of these devices and the chemicals delivered require more research \\[ 6 \\]. Electronic cigarettes and the chemicals in the solutions delivered may have widespread effects on the respiratory, immunologic and cardiovascular systems \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]. Another concern is the significant rate of use of these products by the adolescent population, which has been highly influenced by successful targeted marketing and the availability of a variety of flavored vaporization solutions. The use of electronic cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations by youths may increase dependence and the subsequent frequency and intensity of smoking and vaping \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【3】Recent concerns have been raised regarding the potential for significant acute and chronic health care risks of these devices including pneumonitis, airway reactivity and respiratory failure from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \\[ 8 \\]. These effects may be related to nicotine or to the diluent used for aerosolization. Given that many of the acute effects are related to the respiratory system, invasive procedures including bronchoscopy may be required when investigating the etiology of acute respiratory symptomatology. While these procedures frequently require anesthetic care, there is limited information on the perioperative implications of vaping. We present an adolescent who presented to the operating room for bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to investigate the etiology of respiratory involvement following an episode of vaping. The healthcare and end-organ effects of nicotine, tobacco smoke and vaping are discussed, and potential anesthetic implications are presented.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 16-year-old, 59-kg female adolescent presented for anesthetic care during bronchoscopy and BAL. Past medical history included familial porphyria cutanea tarda, protein S deficiency and environmental allergies for which she took levocetirizine, 5 mg daily. Past social history included living on a farm with multiple farm animals and hay, vaping, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) inhalation and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure at home. Her past family history was positive for asthma, hematological disorders and polycystic ovary syndrome. She had originally presented to the emergency department (ED) with cough and difficulty breathing for 4 days and a 1-week history of chest pain. Prior to her ED admission, she was diagnosed with left lower lobe pneumonia and started on azithromycin by a physician at an urgent care clinic. She also had increased albuterol inhaler use (approximately 4 - 5 daily uses) without symptomatic relief. The respiratory symptoms worsened with exertion, heat exposure and lying supine. She also reported decreased oral intake and energy but denied fevers or rashes. Physical examination in the ED revealed tachypnea, diminished air entry bilaterally, inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, rales and labored breathing. Her vital signs were notable for a pulse of 111 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, blood pressure of 122/82 mm Hg, temperature of 36.7 °C and oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 91% on room air. A chest radiograph demonstrated multi-focal airspace disease suggestive of pneumonia with hilar lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out by computed tomography angiography (CTA) which showed normal main, branch, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries with normal enhancement. However, the CTA did show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, the largest of which was 2.3 cm in dimension, and multi-focal airspace opacities in all lobes. The electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QTc of 531 ms with T-wave abnormalities, so pediatric cardiology was consulted. A complete blood count was negative for leukocytosis but did show a left shift. Procalcitonin, hepatic function tests and urinalysis were unremarkable. Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal except for mild hypokalemia (3 mEq/L). C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate were elevated on multiple tests. Treatment in the ED included inhaled albuterol-ipratropium, oral prednisone (60 mg) and ceftriaxone. Three months prior to this acute presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia and multi-focal small airways disease, and at that time, the differential diagnosis included environmental exposure causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis as she had a history of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) use by vaping, farm environment exposure and other infectious causes. During the previous visit, a complete blood count showed eosinophilia of 33% (reference range 1-4%) and a respiratory infection antigen array was negative. Sputum cultures showed mixed bacteria with purulent secretions. Fungal antibody panel showed rare _Candida albicans_ . HIV 1 and 2 serology results were negative. Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Aspergillus antigens and antibodies were all negative. Legionella serology was negative, and a TB test was negative. Given the uncertain etiology of her recurrent lung disease, she was scheduled for bronchoscopy and BAL in the operating room. She was held _nil per os_ for 6 h and transferred to the operating room where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and endotracheal intubation facilitated by the administration of rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in air and oxygen. Bronchoscopic findings included profuse edema throughout the right and left tracheobronchial tree, mucopurulent mucus plugs in the left lower lobe and throughout the right tracheobronchial tree. She tolerated the procedure well with no intraoperative complications. After recovery in the post-anesthesia care unit, she was discharged to the inpatient ward without postoperative complications. BAL showed 61% eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals without signs of parasitic larvae or eggs, consistent with the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis or acute eosinophilic pneumonia. All subsequent cultures and the infectious disease work-up were negative. The patient’s oxygen requirement postoperatively was stable at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. Following the procedure, the patient was started on systemic corticosteroids. Her oxygen requirement decreased, and she was weaned to room air over the next 48 - 72 h. She was later discharged home on postoperative day 4 on a prolonged corticosteroid course. After discharge, she remained compliant with the treatment plan. Her symptoms slowly resolved, and follow-up chest radiograph showed clearing of the pulmonary involvement. Spirometry conducted 2 months after the start of the corticosteroid regimen revealed a mild obstructive pattern that resolved with albuterol. A repeat complete blood count showed a normal white blood count of 7.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and decreased peripheral eosinophilia of 10.7% (reference range 1.0-4.0%). The patient reported a good state of health with no further symptoms after finishing the corticosteroid treatment regimen and continued cessation of vaping and THC use.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Although the detrimental and addictive effects of tobacco (nicotine) use have been clearly demonstrated over the last few decades, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death globally \\[ 9 \\]. There has been a gradual decline in global tobacco use due to preventive measures such as reduced access to cigarettes and increased public awareness on its risks including lung and other malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel disease, acute kidney injury, osteoporosis and bone fractures, stroke and coronary artery disease \\[ 9 \\- 11 \\]. Another reason for the decline in tobacco use has been a shift towards the use of other nicotine products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes) \\[ 12 \\]. This shift has been encouraged and aided by aggressive promotion of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids; however, evidence-based medicine has not been able to provide adequate data to document their efficacy in this regard. Moreover, current research even suggests that the use of e-cigarettes may encourage the use of conventional cigarettes \\[ 13 \\- 15 \\].\n\n【10】E-cigarettes use has increased for several reasons including reduced costs, perceived reduced toxicity, more freedom of use in smoke-free places, and to allow for smoking cessation. An especially important population within this shift from tobacco use to electronic nicotine systems (e-cigarettes) are adolescents. E-cigarette use among adolescents and high school students has increased significantly in the last decade to rates as high as 25% among high school students. Measurement of serum cotinine, a marker for tobacco use, has shown that there are significant similarities between the effects of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes \\[ 16 \\]. Although e-cigarettes reduce exposure to the harmful toxins in conventional tobacco and cigarette smoke, they introduce a new array of potential toxins in the diluents used to carry the nicotine \\[ 17 \\]. They also expose the smoker to potentially higher levels of nicotine and thereby elevate its addiction potential \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【11】The physiological effects from the use of e-cigarettes are numerous to both the users as well as non-users who are exposed to the vapor and the exhaled smoke. The aerosol from e-cigarettes may contain harmful substances and chemicals including ultrafine particles with flavoring such as diacetyl that cause serious lung disease, carcinogens, as well as heavy metals such as nickel, tin and lead. There are over 7,700 flavors available with more than 240 new flavors added every month \\[ 18 \\]. Toxic chemicals may be used to increase the e-cigarette solution’s colors, aromatic properties and scents in order to appeal to the adolescent population. Acute effects of e-cigarette use have been reported to involve the pulmonary, cardiovascular and immune systems.\n\n【12】Pulmonary effects of toxic chemicals within the solution include disturbances of the cough reflex, throat irritation, dry cough and increased chronic respiratory problems with an increased incidence of sinusitis and rhinitis. A recent study involving healthy smokers (n = 30, 14 men and 16 women with a mean age of 34.8 years) compared to a control group (n = 10) showed that a 5-min exposure to a e-cigarette cartridge led to immediate respiratory changes within the experimental group when comparing respiratory function tests before and after exposure including changes dynamic lung volume, exhaled nitric oxide levels and total respiratory resistance \\[ 19 , 20 \\]. The study cohort included patients ranging in age from 19 to 56 years with no history of lung disease, currently using no medications and no acute illnesses in the previous two weeks. Specific changes in the experimental group included a decreased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, increased respiratory impedance, increased inspiratory flow resistance and increased overall peripheral airway resistance \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【13】In addition to the respiratory effects related to diluent for e-cigarette use, the nicotine within the aerosol solution may cause vasoconstriction, decreased microvascular tissue perfusion and oxygenation, and increase the risk for cardiovascular disturbances. E-cigarette inhalation affects vascular function, specifically endothelial function and inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability leading to decreased vasodilation and increased platelet activation \\[ 15 , 21 , 22 \\]. The nicotine within e-cigarette aerosol may activate the sympathetic nervous system, thereby resulting in vasoconstriction of the coronary blood vessels as well as increases in heart rate and blood pressure \\[ 22 \\]. Animal studies have noted that nicotine increases the risk of arrhythmias by reducing the ventricular fibrillation threshold and promoting the development of ventricular fibrillation after experimental myocardial infarctions \\[ 22 \\]. These changes and others have showcased nicotine’s role in impaired heart remodeling, increased risk of heart failure, sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias, and progressive heart failure due to cardiovascular disease \\[ 22 , 23 \\]. Overall, nicotine leads to increased hemodynamic instability through the increased release of catecholamines under general anesthesia. E-cigarettes may also increase the risk of nicotine toxicity due to the increased availability of high concentrations of nicotine in the e-cigarette solutions \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【14】Nicotine toxicity during adolescence has recently been associated with significant neuronal deficits in auditory processing, working memory, attentiveness, with an increase in impulsivity \\[ 25 \\]. Other studies and human case reports have shown decreased density and viability of Kupffer cells, increases in complement protein activation and deposition onto hepatic Kupffer cells, enhanced hydrogen peroxide production due to increased xanthine oxidase and peroxidase activity and ultimately increased reactive oxygen species \\[ 15 , 26 \\]. The potential deleterious physiologic implications of e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) are significant with recent reports in the lay literature of death related to vaping and its associated lung injury.\n\n【15】During the perioperative period, e-cigarettes have recently been found to be associated with pro-inflammatory effects, increased cytotoxicity and decreased immune defenses, all leading to increased perioperative risk for patients undergoing surgical procedures \\[ 27 \\]. Due to the physiological similarities of the effects of tobacco use and e-cigarette use, perioperative and postoperative considerations between the two appear to be similar \\[ 15 \\]. For instance, heavy tobacco or e-cigarette uses are both associated with increased risk of systemic postoperative complications including wound dehiscence and surgical site infections \\[ 28 , 29 \\]. Additional postoperative complications of tobacco usage included venous thromboembolism, acute cardiac or cerebrovascular events, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infections and pneumonia \\[ 15 , 28 \\]. A recent analysis reported an increased postoperative complication rate (42.5% vs. 8.9%, P < 0.001) when comparing smokers to those who have never smoked, the majority of these being infection-related \\[ 29 , 30 \\]. Following spinal decompression and fusion, smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for infection \\[ 31 \\]. Other common postoperative complications reported in smokers include pulmonary and cardiac related morbidity such as postoperative pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Smoking has also been shown to have transient effects on local tissue microenvironments leading to prolonged inflammation and defective reparative cell functioning which may result in delayed healing \\[ 32 \\]. More superficially, a systematic review reported numerous perioperative changes result from smoking including an imbalance of proteolytic enzymes and their respective inhibitors, decreased tissue oxygenation and aerobic metabolism, reduced fibroblast proliferation and migration leading to the downregulation of collagen synthesis and deposition \\[ 32 \\].\n\n【16】As with all anesthetic care, preoperative preparation begins with a thorough preoperative evaluation and identification of acute issues as well as chronic comorbid conditions. Although asking patients regarding their cigarette/tobacco usage is normal practice, inquiring specifically about e-cigarette usage has also become important as the various health effects of e-cigarette use need to be considered for patients undergoing anesthesia. Patients may deny tobacco use and yet continue e-cigarette use without considering its impact. As noted above, many of the effects and concerns of e-cigarette parallel those related to tobacco use \\[ 33 \\]. Although abstinence from smoking is suggested prior to major surgical procedures, guidelines regarding e-cigarette use have not been universally defined. Cessation of smoking for 4 - 6 weeks prior to a procedure has been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications \\[ 34 \\- 37 \\]. However, cessation closer to the time of surgery may increase bronchorrhea and the incidence of perioperative respiratory complications.\n\n【17】When considering the end-organ effects of vaping and its potential perioperative implications, attention must be focused on both the chemical inhaled and the carrier solution. Nicotine affects hepatic microsomal enzymes and the activity of cytochrome P-450 mixed oxidase metabolic pathways, altering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many anesthetic agents \\[ 38 \\]. E-cigarette use results in the production of toluene and other volatile organic compounds that possess central nervous system depressant effects which may alter a patient’s anesthetic requirements \\[ 39 \\]. In addition to the hepatic effects, nicotine in e-cigarettes increases airway resistance and impedance through direct stimulation of afferent pathways in the bronchial mucosa, triggering the parasympathetic cholinergic pathways leading to bronchoconstriction \\[ 19 , 40 \\].\n\n【18】Managing the patient with suspected EVALI may include hospitalization, to treat decreased O <sub>2 </sub> saturation or respiratory insufficiency, the impact of which may be escalated in patients with comorbid respiratory conditions. Treatment plans may include corticosteroids to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis and early initiation of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. As noted in our patient, the most predominant acute effects related to the respiratory system and e-cigarette use were increased airway reactivity, presenting as bronchoconstriction, bronchospasm, and air-trapping, similar to obstructive airway with depressed pulmonary function \\[ 41 \\]. Regardless of the etiology, increased airway reactivity should be acutely treated with albuterol. Given involvement of the cholinergic pathway, the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents (ipratropium) may be useful \\[ 42 \\]. Additionally, prior to endotracheal intubation, topical or intravenous lidocaine may be administered to suppress laryngeal hyper-reactivity. Warming and humidifying the inspired gases may also be helpful in reducing airway reactivity \\[ 43 \\]. Acute treatment of intraoperative bronchospasm may respond to deepening the level of anesthesia or inhaled β-adrenergic agonists \\[ 44 \\]. Refractory cases may require intravenous epinephrine, ketamine or magnesium \\[ 42 \\]. In particular, the volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane produce significantly sustained bronchodilation \\[ 45 \\]. Patients should be counseled on the negative effects of e-cigarette use on recovery including the potential for increased postoperative respiratory issues, decreased wound healing and an increased incidence of postoperative infections. When considering the effects of e-cigarette use on the perioperative course, attention should be directed toward both the diluent and the chemical inhaled. These agents may have significant end-organ effects due to their direct irritant properties as well as the profound physiologic effects of the chemicals inhaled.\n\n【19】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【20】None to declare.\n\n【21】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【22】None to declare.\n\n【23】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【24】None to declare.\n\n【25】**Informed Consent**\n\n【26】In accordance with IRB of Nationwide Children’s Hospital, need for documentation of informed consent waved.\n\n【27】**Author Contributions**\n\n【28】Amogha Krishna contributed to incorporation of edits, preparation of secondary and final drafts.

Also she did not have similar symptoms previously.\n\n【6】Her blood pressure was in normal level and body temperature was 37.8 °C. She did not have tachypnea and tachycardia. In the lung exam, there was no rhonchi but there was crackles. Other system exams were normal. Lung graph findings were compatible with left unilateral hemothorax ( Fig. 1 ). In computerized tomography, it was found that there were obvious pleural liquids with the depth of 5.5 cm on the left hemothorax and there were atelectasis in some areas ( Fig. 2 , 3 ). Under the consideration of these circumstances, patient was treated to thoracic medicine services with catheter thoracostomy. With expansion deficiency and inappropriate drainage, the patient was implemented left VATS, pleural biopsy and pleural drainage. Her Hb levels declined from 11.2 g/dL to 10.1 g/dL. In her VATS report, there were pleural liquids, minimal parenchymal units were seperated, thorax was small and diaphragm was elevated and no substantial pleural and parancimal pathologies were not defined. The sample which was taken from the pleural biopsy was fibrinous ploritis and it was compatible with common fresh bleeding. Cytologic findings was compatible chronic inflammatory reaction.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Lung graph findings were compatible with left unilateral hemothorax._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** In computerized tomography of parenchymal window, there were obvious pleural liquids with the depth of 5.5 cm on the left hemothorax and atelectasis in some areas._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** In computerized tomography of bone window, there were pleural liquids with the depth of 5.5 cm on the left hemothorax._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Hemothorax is mostly seen after obtuse and penetrant traumas \\[ 5 , 10 \\]. Spontaneous hemothorax is defined as blood aggregation in pleural zone due to non-traumatic causes \\[ 1 \\]. Its symptoms and physical exam findings could be differed related with the reasons of spontaneous hemothorax \\[ 11 \\]. Spontaneous hemothorax is an extremely rare disease. It is understood that Sayir and his friends diagnosed five spontaneous hemothorax in 220 patients between 2005 and 2011 and four of these were males and just one of them was female. Also in four cases hemothorax were on the right side and last one was on the left side \\[ 12 \\]. As it could be observed from this analysis, spontaneous hemothorax is extremely and rarely seen on the females and left side. However, in this case, patient was female and hemothorax was on the left side. Comparative with frequency of spontaneous hemothorax, frequency of traumatic hemothorax is relatively high \\[ 12 \\]. Even though it is seldomly seen with chest pain and dyspnea, spontaneous hemothorax must be considered as an option. Usually there is another primary reason beneath it. There could be fatal risk \\[ 12 \\]. It is argued that Senturk and his friends treated for spontaneous hemothorax which are caused by various reasons, namely 17 malignant (8.9%), two bullous lung (1%), two tuberculosis (1%), one lung abscess (0.5%) in 192 cases \\[ 13 \\]. In the bleedings caused by intra-thoracic organs and aorta aneurism rupture, shock symptoms would be found accompanied with serious hemodynamic changes \\[ 14-19 \\]. In the spontaneous hemothorax cases which are correlated with metastatic diseases and anticoagulante medicines, there is no fast bleeding into intrapleural zone and hemodynamic changes would not almost be seen. If there is big amount of effusion, dyspnea is significant symptom. Sometimes anemia could be seen \\[ 20 \\]. Pneumothorax hemothorax mostly would be seen in the parietal pleura and vascularize visceral seperations which are cohesive pleuritis-pulmonary pathologies \\[ 21 \\]. In this case, firstly it was thought that hemothorax was developed due to the chronic fibrinosis pleuritis. However, pnomothorax could not be found in the case.\n\n【15】Treatment of spontaneous hemothorax differs because of the etiology and in most cases tube thoracostomy could not be enough. However thoracotomy must be deployed with more than 200 cc drainage in the situations such as hypovolemic shocks and lung expansions. Recently, VATS has become popular \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. In this case, VATS and tube thoracostomy were deployed.\n\n【16】In conclusion, hemothorax is an urgent situation which has to be diagnosed immediately. Awareness of causes is highly helpful to diagnose. Even though it is rarely seen in the patients with chest pain and dyspnea, spontaneous hemothorax has to be considered. Treatment methods have to be decided up to vital indications and tube thoracostomy has to be implemented. In the elective situations in which drainage could not be used, VATS would be thought as an alternative option.\n\n【17】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【18】No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Together with other ganglia-derived growths, all are known as paragangilioma tumors. The true incidence of CBTs is largely unknown and many such tumors or paragangiliomas may remain either not diagnosed during life or not reported in literature \\[ 2 \\]. Luckily, the majority of these tumors are benign. Nevertheless, malignant paragangiliomas in general are estimated with an incidence of 93 cases per 400 million persons in the United States \\[ 3 \\]. We report a case of CBT with metastatic and malignant behavior in an elderly patient in his eighth decade, raising the question whether these tumors are very slow-growing malignant lesions rather than benign in nature.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 75-year-old Caucasian male presented to our facility clinic for regular check-up. Past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease status post stent placement in 2011, mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He denied smoking, alcohol or recreational drugs. Family history was unremarkable for cancer or similar presentation. On physical examination, he was afebrile with blood pressure of 130/87 mm Hg, pulse rate of 90/min irregular, and respiratory rate of 18/min. His neck exam revealed a well-defined painless swelling along the anterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was measuring around 3 × 2 cm with no palpable pulse or thrill. His routine laboratory exam was unremarkable. Carotid Doppler ultrasound was performed which was concerned for carotid bulb tumor. Subsequently, patient had computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck. An enhancing mass was noted in the carotid artery bifurcation with mass effect on the adjacent vascular structures and airway ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Submandibular lymph nodes were seen. However, patient remained asymptomatic. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable. Patient was admitted and vascular surgery was consulted. Plasma and 24-h urine collection were negative for catecholamine-related compounds. After discussion and surgical consent, the tumor was explored ( Fig. 3 ). Laborious dissection around the common carotid artery was achieved with significant hemostasis. The external carotid artery had to be ligated because of significant bleeding from the branches of the artery, while the internal carotid artery was dissected and preserved. The tumor was then removed uneventfully. Patient recovered well and was discharged home in stable condition. Pathology report revealed a circumscribed tumor with fibrous bands and dilated vascular channels. The oval cells in the tumor formed nests (Zellballen structure) ( Fig. 4 ). These cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers, synaptophysin and CD58 and negative for epithelial markers AE1/AE3. The whole picture was consistent with paraganglioma tumor with malignant behavior. The patient was referred to a tertiary oncology center for further management.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the neck, coronal section, shows 4.9 × 3.4 × 4.5 cm enhancing mass at the carotid artery bifurcation (a) with mass effect on the right internal jugular vein and right airway (b).

They are usually sporadic with few cases associated with familial/genetic syndromes \\[ 5 \\]. The true incidence of these tumors remained largely unknown with some cases detected during autopsy examinations \\[ 6 \\]. The original cells are derived from the neural crest during early embryonic development. Therefore, these tumors are related closely to other neural crest derived lesions like pheocromocytoma, and remained indistinguishable at the cellular level \\[ 7 \\]. However, unlike other paragangilioma, CBTs are usually non-functional and may remain silent for years before clinical presentation similar to our case. Van Duinen et al and his colleagues conducted a prospective study where they found 23% of their patients with head and neck paragangilioma (31 out of 136) have biochemical active tumors \\[ 8 \\]. It is therefore recommended to obtain biochemical and hormonal tests even if there were no signs of hormonal excess. Most patients present with a firm painless swelling in the lateral aspect of the neck. Owing to the crowded vascular and neural structures located in this area, no wonder, mass effect ensures at late stages. Patients may present with dysphagia, hoarseness of the voice or even Horner’s syndrome secondary to compression of vagaus and/or sympathetic nerves, respectively \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Airways pressure may occur in large size tumors as described in our patient.\n\n【16】Imaging modalities remain the gold standard in identifying and differentiating these tumors from other similar lesions sharing the same presentation. Carotid ultrasound is widely accepted as a first non-invasive tool to establish the diagnosis of CBTs. However, CT of neck angiography adds more detailed information, and reveals the relationship between lesions and adjacent arteries, as well as the involvement of the skull base \\[ 11 \\]. In other words, it helps assess the tumor size and surgical (Shamblin) type more accurately ( Fig. 5 ). In our case, the Doppler ultrasound had a major role in recognizing the CBT and eliminated other differentials like lymphoma, brachial cyst, thyroid mass and carotid aneurysm. CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis and optimized the surgical plan approach. Moreover, CT imaging can help localize local and distant metastases, although very rare but have dismal prognosis once diagnosed \\[ 12 \\].\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Schematic diagram of the Shamblin grouping of CBTs into I, II, III and IIIb. It is basically based on the relationship between the tumor and the carotid arteries. The intersected lines are the X and XII nerves which are closely related to the tumor. This diagram was adopted from Reference \\[ 18 \\]._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】Surgery remained the preferred management especially for localized and/or symptomatic tumors in otherwise healthy and fit patients. Less invasive approaches such as radiotherapy (RT) can be offered if surgical intervention deemed risky and has detrimental outcome \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. This approach helps slow down the tumor growth and provides comfort care in symptomatic patients. Nonetheless, RT does not offer the same degree of symptom relief that is accomplished with surgical resection. Some authors suggested watchful approach (wait and scan) for small asymptomatic tumors (< 3 cm), given the slow growth rate and the benign nature of most of these lesions \\[ 15 \\]. Other interventions such as tumor embolization and radiosurgery have been advocated with controversial results in literature \\[ 16 \\- 18 \\]. A recent retrospective study investigated the impact of embolization on outcome before CBT resection and no benefit was demonstrated with similar mortality, cranial nerve injury and blood loss \\[ 17 \\], arguing against routine preoperative embolization approach.\n\n【19】Histologically, CBTs have distinct appearance described as Zellballen appearance where round epithelioid cells arranged in dense cell nests or trabecular patterns ( Fig. 4 ). However, this histological appearance is not pathognomonic and shared by variety of tumors. Immunohistochemical staining typically confirms the neuroendocrine nature of the cells which are positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin and/or neuron-specific enolase (NSE). In our patient, the tumor cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and CD56, negative for epithelial markers AE1/AE3, and surrounded by S100 positive spindle cells (sustentacular cells). Nonetheless, malignant potential is difficult to predict based on histological findings and therefore, patients should be closely observed for any local or distant metastasis or recurrences \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】CBTs remained rare neoplasms, often, non-secretory and may be overlooked till late stages and pressure effects with unfavorable outcomes. We believe, proper medical examination can help identify more of these tumors and hence, early and more aggressive approach can be applied before having malignant tendency and therefore poor prognosis.\n\n【22】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【23】None.\n\n【24】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Her medical history consisted of a postpartum phlebitis and a miscarriage (G5P3 patient). An abdomino-pelvic scan showed the uterus and bladder pushed horizontally to the right by a heterogeneous mass presenting both liquid and solid appearance with arch-like calcifications. The tumoral size is of 10 cm. The pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an egg-like shape taking up the right side of the pelvis, with polycyclic outlines and a very heterogeneous matrix. There was no modification with a gadolinium injection. A coelioscopy was performed to take histological material. The pathological diagnosis of PNETs was made based on the presence of a tumoral proliferation composed of small round or spindle-shaped cells with a small amount of cytoplasma. We observed also a fibro-vascular tumoral stroma and any tumoral necrosis. The immunohistochemical (all antibodies and revelation system were those of Dako <sup>® </sup> ) cell phenotype was positive for CD99 and vimentin and negative for CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, protein S100, desmin, CD3, CD20, estrogenic or progesterone receptors and alpha inhibin. The proliferation marker Ki-67 was very high at 80%.\n\n【10】Molecular biology using fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization was positive for translocation t(11;12)(q24;q12) (EWSR1 22q12 break (Kreatech <sup>® </sup> )).\n\n【11】Any metastasis was revealed by positron emission tomography (PET) or classical radiology (chest X-ray).\n\n【12】Biologically, the liver and renal functions were normal and NSE was elevated (96.3 ng/mL).\n\n【13】The patient was treated by a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE) protocol for six cycles. After two and four cycles, the PET scan showed a considerable reduction in size (4.8 cm) and in metabolic intensity of the tumoral mass. We saw stability after six cycles. The patient then had surgery (increased colpohysterectomy but incomplete resection due to the mass infiltrating the near totality of the psoas muscle). The tumor continued growing. The patient became symptomatic 2 months later with diffuse abdominal pains. Two adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatments by vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide (VAI) were then undertaken with worse clinical and hematological tolerances. After palliative care, the patient died 1 month later.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】PNETs are a group of rare tumors. Their annual incidence is 2.9 per million population \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【17】Stout first described PNET in 1918 \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【18】Their understanding has significantly advanced over the last 25 years. They have a wide distribution of primary tumors sites, related to their supposed neural origin \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【19】On microscopy, they appear as a monotonous collection of small round, darkly stained cells leading to the differential diagnosis with a rhabdomyosarcoma and a neuroblastoma. Fortunately, PNETs are characterized by a certain number of specific translocations of the EWS gene which is found on the chromosome 22 classifying these tumors in the PNET family/Ewing sarcoma. Over added molecular anomalies often occur during the progression of the illness such as the p53 or the p16 mutations \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【20】Because of their large size, their numerous distant metastases, their poor radiosensitivity and their incomplete surgical resection, pelvic PNETs often show a pejorative prognosis. Burgers et al described 35 cases (15 boys and 20 girls aged between 3 and 31 years). Twenty-four of these patients showed any metastasis in time of the primary diagnosis. All were treated by chemotherapy associated for 31 with radiotherapy. Moreover, four patients had surgery. Five patients developed metastasis (pulmonary and skeletal). The pulmonary metastases were operated on followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy. Patients treated only by radiotherapy showed intra-thoracic relapses. Skeletal metastases were developed in cases treated by radiotherapy first and chemotherapy.\n\n【21】The difference of the 5-year survival without progression between patients without and with metastasis was 19% and 40%, respectively \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【22】Polychemotherapy and surgery were the basis of the treatment of PNETs. Polychemotherapy uses five drug approaches: vincristine, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and doxorubicin. Complete surgical excision reduces drastically the risk of local relapse but does not prevent metastatic spread \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】Survival of patients with PNETs on a single location has considerably increased with the arrival of modern chemotherapies as the target therapy but also with new surgical techniques by coelioscopy. Prognosis for patients who already have a diffuse illness or who have no response of the initial treatment remains worse.\n\n【25】A better comprehension of signals may be a future path in the treatment of these rare tumors.\n\n【26】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Patient denied tobacco or alcohol habits. She presented to the emergency department with complaints of facial swelling and facial redness that was intermittent in nature for 1 year duration which was treated as an allergic reaction without improvement. Associated to original complaints, patient also reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 pounds during the previous 8 months, progressive shortness of breath and dry cough for the previous 2 months prior to arrival.\n\n【6】Physical examination findings were remarkable for bilateral jugular vein distention and facial swelling. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was remarkable for a normal sinus rhythm, and there was no evidence of ischemia with low voltage criteria ( Fig. 1 ). Chest X-ray was remarkable for a round opacity of 3.8 × 3.7 cm at the right hilar region ( Fig. 2 ). Further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a well-defined mass measuring 7 × 5.7 cm in the right atrium producing extrinsic compression and infiltration into the right atrioventricular valve and the proximal aspect of the right ventricle ( Fig. 3 ). The mass infiltrated the right hilar region invading the pericardial fat ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, the mass was producing a complete obliteration of the superior vena cava (SVC) ( Fig. 3 ). Laboratories were remarkable for mild leukocytosis and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Echocardiogram was remarkable for an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, mild enlargement of right and left ventricle, dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) and increased “echo signals” from the right atrium due to a mass effect. In view of previous findings, a myocardial biopsy was performed which yielded a positive result for a spindle cell sarcoma.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** EKG with normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, no ST or ischemic changes, low voltage criteria present._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Chest X-ray.

Those options were: 1) conventional resection under cardiopulmonary bypass that may include resection of the total right atrium with tissue homograft or prosthetic reconstruction; 2) excision of the heart under cardiopulmonary bypass, _ex vivo_ excision of the tumor and autotransplantation; and 3) total heart transplantation. These options, after a lengthy and detailed discussion with the patient, were all rejected for several anatomical and medical considerations. There are only very few reports in the literature that can sustain these approaches, all with dismay results. Moreover, on this patient, the tumor reaches beyond the confines of the SVC - in the case of the SVC, both the SVC and the innominate vein were thrombosed - and in relation to the IVC, the tumor reaches to the limit of the IVC - atrial junction. Due to the aggressive nature of these tumors, heart transplantation and immunosuppression were not considered feasible. Accordingly, the patient was referred to a specialized center where we believe a combined approach of chemoradiation may make the lesion surgically treatable but unfortunately, patient perished before starting therapy.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】The first case report of a cardiac tumor dated back to 1562, but Barnes et al described the first _ante mortem_ diagnosis in 1934 through a biopsy \\[ 9-11 \\]. The first successful surgery removing a primary cardiac tumor was reported in 1952 \\[ 12 \\]. Since then, there have been cases of malignant tumors but nevertheless the management of these patients is not well defined and there are no evidence-based guidelines. Most of the data come from experience with few cases reported. The most common malignant tumor is the angiosarcoma \\[ 13 \\]. The biopsy performed on our patient was positive for spindle cell sarcoma of the right atrium. This type of undifferentiated sarcoma is rare, with only four cases reported in the literature, which usually affects the left atrium, can infiltrate the pericardium and has a mesenchymal origin \\[ 3 \\]. The spindle cell sarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that metastized quickly and patients have a poor prognosis with a median survival of only 3 months to a year \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【16】Cardiac sarcomas have symptoms by different mechanisms including obstruction, local invasion, and embolisms and in some cases the first manifestation could be a sudden cardiac death \\[ 1 , 14 \\]. Tumors located in the atrium or in the atrioventricular valves restrict blood and present with symptoms of cardiac failure \\[ 1 \\]. Also if there is extension into the vena cava, an SVC syndrome can occur as in our patient \\[ 1 \\]. Infiltration of the heart wall may occur as a restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \\[ 1 \\]. Thirty to 40% of patients may present an embolic event \\[ 15 \\]. Up to 20% can cause cerebral ischemic stroke by cardiogenic embolism \\[ 15 \\]. Other less specific symptoms are weight loss, fever, chest discomfort and syncope \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【17】The diagnosis of primary cardiac tumors depends on the use of multiple modes of imaging techniques, including 2D echocardiogram, cardiac CT and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【18】2D transthoracic echocardiography is the first modality for the screening and diagnosis of a cardiac tumor \\[ 14 \\]. The sensitivity of 2D transthoracic echocardiogram is 93.3% \\[ 14 \\]. Unlike echocardiogram, cardiac CT and cardiac MRI (CMRI) allow evaluation of additional major cardiac involvement and identify the presence of metastasis and infiltration \\[ 3 \\]. MRI has the advantage over CT to evaluate the myocardium and pericardial involvement \\[ 14 \\]. It also surpasses CT in the evaluation of tumor mass volume and tumor response to chemotherapy or surgery \\[ 3 \\]. Despite the imaging technology available, definitive diagnosis of cardiac tumor is made through a tissue biopsy \\[ 2 \\]. The biopsy may be percutaneous or transvenous, through endoscopy, mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy \\[ 2 \\]. This allows us to evaluate the histology and malignant potential, which is important to establish a proper treatment and prognosis.\n\n【19】Whenever possible, a complete surgical resection in combination with chemotherapy is still the best treatment for primary cardiac tumors because the survival rate of these patients doubles \\[ 4 \\]. However, both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been very effective in the treatment of cardiac sarcomas \\[ 3 \\]. Although it is known that the resection with negative borders is the best option, it is unfortunately plausible in less than 50% of cases \\[ 4 \\]. Incomplete resection of the tumor in most cases results in recurrence \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【20】There are different types of surgery in terms of primary cardiac tumors. Regarding malignant tumors, complex resection can be performed when the tumor is confined to heart and has not infiltrated other adjacent tissues \\[ 1 \\]. Other techniques are “ _Ex situ_ resection” or “auto-transplantation” when the tumor involves the posterior wall of the left atrium or dorsal great vessels \\[ 1 , 14 \\]. With this surgical method, the heart is extracted outside the body for better anatomical visualization and re-implanted after tumor resection in the heart is repaired \\[ 1 , 14 \\]. Heart transplantation is an option for patients with inoperable sarcomas as an alternative therapy in case of no evidence of metastasis \\[ 2 \\]. However, it is associated with recurrence of malignancy and new tumors stimulated by immunosuppression \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【21】The prognosis of cardiac primary tumors, especially spindle cell sarcoma, is poor \\[ 4 \\]. At the time of diagnosis, up to 80% of spindle cell sarcomas have evidence of metastasis, which worsens their prognosis \\[ 3 \\]. These tumors may have few symptoms and remain silent until they reach an advanced stage, thus limiting the therapeutic options available. To the best of our knowledge, only four reported cases exist in the literature and there are no guidelines for treating this condition. It is recommended that once the diagnosis is made, these patients should be transferred to a specialized center for an early and aggressive treatment.\n\n【22】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【23】The authors would like to express their gratitude to Patricia Gonzalez BS, MBA, for the time and effort it took to correct and edit our work.

EPN is a rare but severe disease with a morality rate that can be as high as 70% \\[ 1 \\]. EPN occurs invariably in diabetic patients \\[ 1 \\]. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are crucial for the recovery from EPN, as this disease progresses quickly. However, the diagnosis is sometimes made after poor response to conventional antibiotic treatment \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【3】We report a case with diabetic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) complicated with EPN, who was successfully treated by early diagnosis and early intensive therapy using insulin, antibiotics, and nephrectomy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 61-year-old woman was referred for hyperglycemia. She discontinued to receive the treatment for diabetes mellitus 3 years ago. She presented with abdominal and back pain for the previous 6 days, and her consciousness was disturbed. Her body temperature was 36.3 °C and blood pressure was 82/42 mmHg. Plasma glucose level (448 mg/dl) and hemoglobin A <sub>1C </sub> level (13%; normal range, 4.3 - 5.8%) were elevated. Laboratory data showed increased leukocyte counts (25,000/µl) and decreased platelet counts (72,000/µl). Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (78 mg/dl; normal range, 8 - 22 mg/dl), creatinine (2.2 mg/dl; normal range, 0.4 - 0.7 mg/dl) and C-reactive protein (38.9 mg/dl; normal range, 0 - 0.3 mg/dl) were remarkably elevated. Urinalysis revealed no ketone bodies, and numerous bacteria and leukocytes. These symptoms and data suggested the presence of HHS and urinary tract infection (UTI). Axial section ( Fig. 1a ) and coronal section ( Fig. 1b ) of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed the presence of gas in the renal area with extensive renal parenchymal destruction, indicating the diagnosis of EPN. Cultures of blood and urine grew _Escherichia coli_ . She was successfully treated by intensive insulin therapy, antibiotics and left nephrectomy.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Axial (a) and coronal (b) section of computed tomographic image of emphysematous pyelonephritis (arrows)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】EPN has been defined as an acute, severe, necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissue, which results in the appearance of gas within the renal parenchyma, and EPN particularly occurs in diabetes \\[ 1 \\]. The clinical features of EPN are indistinguishable from those of UTI. In this patient, the overwhelming hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state makes the diagnosis for EPN difficult. A high index of suspicion, especially in susceptible populations such as diabetic patients, is needed for early diagnosis. A delay in diagnosis leads to increased morbidity and mortality \\[ 1 \\]. The best diagnostic modality has been reported to be CT \\[ 2 , 3 \\], which can also be used in patients who are suitable for CT-guided drainage. In fact, abdominal CT was very useful for the diagnosis of EPN in our patient. High-risk patients with EPN have been considered to be patients with shock, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure and disturbed consciousness, all of which were observed in our patient \\[ 4 \\]. Furthermore, HHS has also been identified as a disease with a high mortality rate \\[ 5 \\]. We believe that early diagnosis by abdominal CT and early intensive therapy using insulin, antibiotics, and selective nephrectomy saved her life.\n\n【11】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In 1995 a new genus, Abiotrophia, belonging to NVS was discovered. “Abiotrophia” means life nutrition deficiency because it requires supplemented media for growth and survival \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【3】Abiotrophia species form part of the normal flora of the oral cavity, the genitourinary tract, and the intestinal tract \\[ 3 \\]. Bacteraemia and endocarditis (5% of cases) are the more frequently reported clinical infections due to Abiotrophia. Isolated cases of keratitis, endophthalmitis, central nervous system infections, sinusitis, otitis media, prostatitis, cholangitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis have also been reported \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【4】Spinal involvement with osteomyelitis due to Abiotrophia is extremely rare. We report a case of bacteremia and vertebral osteomyelitis associated with _Abiotrophia adiacens_ .\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】A 62-year-old male patient presented with a history of few weeks of constant mid back pain after an accidental fall. He had noticed several episodes of fever and chills associated with the pain. He had no bowel, urinary complaint or other symptoms. He was on medications for his hypertension. The patient did not have any predisposing factors including diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, immune suppression or malignancy. The patient denied any dental procedure or any other surgery done recently. He does not smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. The patient is retired and lives with his wife. On examination, the lower thoracic spine was tender to firm palpation. The patient did not have any dental caries. Sensory and motor examination was intact in all extremities. The remainder of the clinical examination was grossly unremarkable with no possible source of infection.\n\n【8】The culture from blood was taken, which later grew _A. adiacens_ (two out of two bottles). Susceptibility testing later revealed that the bacterium was sensitive to penicillin, oxacillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, clindamycin, linezolid and levofloxacin but resistant to gentamicin. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) however ruled out vegetation on the heart valves. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed phlegmonous changes at T10-T12 in the epidural space and paravertebral regions consistent with osteomyelitis and compression fracture at T11.\n\n【9】A diagnosis of diskitis/osteomyelitis was made based on the imaging results. Laminectomy with fusion surgery of T9-L2 vertebrae was done followed by complex wound closure. Bone culture from the T11 vertebral body was sent which revealed no organism. Patient was initially started on ampicillin and later changed to vancomycin as patient developed interstitial nephritis. The patient was treated with 6 weeks of intravenous vancomycin. Patient was transferred to acute rehabilitation unit for restoring baseline functional capacity. His symptoms resolved during his stay in the hospital. The repeat blood culture indicated no bacterial growth. The MRI result after completion of treatment showed fragmented T11 vertebral body and hyperintensity with in the T11 vertebral body.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】Abiotrophia species have formerly been referred to as NVS because of their particular nutritional growth requirements \\[ 3 \\]. This species should be suspected when Gram stains of specimens reveal microbial cells but cultures are negative. Supplementation of laboratory media is desirable and often necessary to encourage the growth of these organisms \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【13】Bacterial pathogens can reach the spine by different routes and hematogenous spread is the most common route. The organisms reach the vertebral body first and then spread to the disk space \\[ 5 \\]. At times the presentation could be misleading, as in our patient who came after the fall accident, and one would think fracture as the main differential diagnosis. Therefore obtaining a microbiological diagnosis is mandatory in vertebral osteomyelitis \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【14】Spinal infections are commonly caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ and Streptococcus species, and in approximately one-third of patients the infective organisms cannot be identified \\[ 5 \\]. Cases of Abiotrophia infection may be misdiagnosed as culture-negative infections due to its fastidious nature \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, two out of two bottles from peripheral blood grew the bacteria, thus laboratory contamination was unlikely.\n\n【15】Literature review indicated that there are extremely few cases that have been reported to date with spinal infection due to Abiotrophia species \\[ 6 , 8-10 \\]. The organism was identified only from blood culture for almost all cases. In one case, diagnosis was confirmed by identification of _A. adiacens_ from infected disk \\[ 10 \\]. In our patient, Abiotrophia vertebral osteomyelitis was documented by the growth and culture of the organism from blood.\n\n【16】Different data suggest that NVS account for 5-6% of microbial endocarditis cases and may be an essential cause of culture-negative endocarditis \\[ 3 \\]. Abiotrophia endocarditis carries higher morbidity and mortality than endocarditis caused by other streptococci \\[ 3 \\]. Although vegetations seemed to be comparatively small, embolization was common. These infections proved difficult to treat with a relapse rate of 17% and a bacteriologic failure rate of 41% \\[ 3 \\]. Abiotrophia bacteremia has been reported along with endocarditis in most cases, but in our patient TEE has revealed normal study with no vegetation.\n\n【17】Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates should be done for detecting drug resistance and selecting appropriate therapy. In those patients with suboptimal response to initial therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics, treatment with vancomycin should be considered \\[ 4 \\]. Our patient was treated with 6 weeks of vancomycin. The post-treatment MRI of spine showed signs of osteomyelitis; however, the patient’s symptoms improved with antibiotic and rehab services.\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Although infection with Abiotrophia species is rare, clinicians should be aware of this highly aggressive organism. We understand that diagnosing infection with this fastidious microorganism might be challenging, therefore high index of suspicion is essential for adequate diagnosis and treatment. We believe reporting this case would contribute to increasing awareness about this organism among health care professionals.\n\n【20】**Conflict of Interests**\n\n【21】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It macroscopically shows papillary or polypoid lesions. We encountered a case diagnosed as a cervical polyp because of a negative Pap smear without abnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\n【3】Cervical polypectomy and histopathological examination revealed that VGA coexisted with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3.

She had no history of using oral contraceptives. A pelvic examination revealed a cervical polyp with a diameter of 5 mm, which had a negative Pap smear. She was referred to our hospital for follow-up of a cervical polyp. In our hospital, cervical polypectomy was performed after the Pap smear.\n\n【7】The results of the Pap smear were also negative, but the pathological result of the polypectomy was VGA with CIN3 ( Fig. 1a ). VGA’s papillae were thin and short ( Fig. 1b ), and the CIN3 lesion existed with adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 2a ). The CIN3 lesion showed that neoplastic cells replaced the upper third of the squamous epithelium ( Fig. 2b ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** VGA obtained by polypectomy.

She worried about the recurrence of cervical adenocarcinoma and requested a hysterectomy. We performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and confirmed that there were no residual tumors in the uterus.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Residual AIS lesion.

Since it has macroscopic lesions, it shows abnormal genital bleeding and abnormal cytology \\[ 1 \\]. A cone biopsy is required to diagnose VGA. Since VGA has an infiltrating shallow lesion, it is possible to preserve fertility by performing a cone biopsy \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Moreover, VGA has been pointed out to be related to a history of taking oral contraceptives \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【17】We describe our experience with a 63-year-old woman who had VGA without a history of using oral contraceptives. Our case showed the following three characteristics. First, VGA may show negative cytology. Second, VGA may coexist with CIN. Third, asymptomatic VGA may show the same macroscopic findings as an asymptomatic cervical polyp.\n\n【18】Our patient with VGA was clinically considered a cervical polyp with a negative Pap smear. Many cervical polyps are asymptomatic and are usually found by chance on pelvic examination. Galon et al analyzed 362 women with macroscopically diagnosed cervical polyps in the 1900s, and divided them into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups \\[ 4 \\]. No malignant tumors were detected in the asymptomatic group. MacKenzie et al also reviewed the pathological reports of 1,366 specimens resected as cervical polyps \\[ 5 \\]. Four hundred five cases (33%) with genital bleeding or abnormal cytology were considered the symptomatic group, and 919 cases (67%) were designated as the asymptomatic group. The two groups were analyzed together with the cost of the test. No malignant tumor was found in any of the asymptomatic group.\n\n【19】These results show that there is no reason to aggressively remove asymptomatic polyps, and if not removed, asymptomatic cervical polyps would result in significant medical cost savings. Nelson et al concluded in their paper that regular removal of cervical polyps in asymptomatic women with normal cervical cytology had little impact on management and might be detrimental \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【20】However, the accuracy rate of adenocarcinoma is known to be significantly lower than that of squamous cell carcinoma. Srisomboon et al examined the preoperative cytological characteristics of 75 patients with AIS diagnosed by conization. They showed that glandular abnormalities were found in only 37.3% of the patients \\[ 7 \\]. Krane et al also showed that the sensitivity of cytology for glandular diseases was 45% \\[ 8 \\]. Furthermore, squamous cell abnormalities can be detected with a high frequency by cytology. Krane et al reported that adenocarcinoma cells potentially mistaken for intimal cells in the lower uterus or cervical cells with tubo-endometrioid metaplasia were reasons for the lower detection rate of glandular cell abnormalities as compared with squamous epithelium abnormalities. Another reason is that squamous epithelial cells have lesions on the epithelial surface, whereas glandular epithelial cells may have lesions in crypts \\[ 9 \\]. Therefore, atypical glandular cells in Pap smears may be diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Moreover, it is said that VGA is a well-differentiated cancer, which may lead to minimal atypia on cytodiagnosis and not lead to the diagnosis of VGA \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【21】In our patient, Pap smear was performed twice by her family clinic and our hospital, and the cytological results were all diagnosed as negative intraepithelial lesions for malignancy (NILM). It was speculated that the reason why CIN was not detected by Pap smear was that CIN existed between the villoglandular lesions. When a lesion considered to be a cervical polyp is found macroscopically, cervical polypectomy should be performed even if there is no abnormality in the Pap smear. It is necessary to rule out malignancy by pathological examination.\n\n【22】Multiple biopsies of polypoid lesions are required because VGA can coexist with CIN. Our patient had CIN3 in VGA. Depending on the biopsy site, the preoperative diagnosis may be mistaken if there is a concomitant lesion. Korach reported nine patients in whom VGA was confirmed in final pathology findings \\[ 11 \\]. Only two of these nine patients had a correct preoperative diagnosis. The preoperative diagnosis in three of the nine patients was cervical polyps, cervical dysplasia, and CIN3, but not VGA. The preoperative diagnosis in the remaining four patients was cervical adenocarcinoma in three patients and endometrial cancer in one patient. Zhou et al reported three cases of VGA, and one case had a preoperative diagnosis of CIN1 \\[ 12 \\]. Among the cases reported by Korach and Zhou et al, there were cases in which CIN was initially diagnosed. This was considered a misdiagnosis because CIN was present in VGA, and only CIN was biopsied. If cancer is diagnosed as benign such as CIN, the start of treatment is delayed. Multiple biopsies are needed for large lesions that cannot undergo polypectomy to prevent a delay in diagnosis.\n\n【23】Asymptomatic VGA may show macroscopic findings similar to asymptomatic cervical polyps. In our patient, the lesion size was as small as 5 mm, and the microscopic structure of the villoglandular lesion was short and not long. These two findings may not have led to the vaginal bleeding symptoms. As in this case, VGA of a polypoid lesion clinically diagnosed as a cervical polyp may be asymptomatic despite being malignant. When an asymptomatic cervical polyp is encountered, examination should proceed, bearing the possibility of malignancy in mind.\n\n【24】In summary, we described our experience with VGA, which was clinically considered a cervical polyp with a negative Pap smear. Even if a cervical polyp-like lesion has no clinical symptoms with a negative Pap smear, immediately designating it as a cervical polyp has the risk of missing cancer. VGA has few malignant findings on a Pap smear. Since there was a VGA showing a polyp lesion like this case, it is necessary to confirm the pathological diagnosis by performing a biopsy even with negative PAP smears. VGA may also be associated with CIN, so if all lesions cannot be resected by polypectomy, one biopsy may collect only CIN lesions, even with VGA. Therefore, multiple biopsies are often required.\n\n【25】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【26】None to declare.\n\n【27】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【28】None to declare.\n\n【29】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【30】None to declare.\n\n【31】**Informed Consent**\n\n【32】Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to completing the case report.\n\n【33】**Author Contributions**\n\n【34】RHN and SiI contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

Less than 350 cases of gallbladder torsion have been reported, with the diagnosis of many of these cases only occurring at the time of operation \\[ 1 \\]. Anatomical variation is thought to play a role in its pathogenesis, with an abnormally long mesentery joining the gallbladder to the liver, resulting in a free-hanging or “floating gallbladder”, which was first described by Wendel in 1898 \\[ 2 \\]. This gives the gallbladder the mobility required to twist, resulting in torsion \\[ 3 \\]. It is theorized that loss of visceral fat and associated shrinkage of the liver result in a gallbladder that hangs free by its mesentery \\[ 4 \\]. It is then not suprising that gallbladder torsion has been most frequently observed in elderly thin females \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【3】Whilst the vast majority of cases of gallbladder torsion are diagnosed intra-operatively, there are a small number of case reports which report on pre-operative diagnosis via the use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography (CT) \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【4】Whilst other causes of cholecystitis can be treated non-operatively, gallbladder torsion requires urgent surgical intervention, because of the risk of ischemia and gangrene leading to perforation, and as such there is a need to increase its pre-operative diagnosis.\n\n| **Case Reports** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】**Case 1**\n\n【8】An 84-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had a background of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her abdominal examination revealed a tender right upper quadrant with a positive Murphy’s sign. Her laboratory results were largely unremarkable with a non-elevated white cell count, a normal bilirubin and liver function tests, excepting a mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (60 U/L (reference (ref) 5 - 50 U/L) and 133 U/L (ref 30 - 110 U/L)). An abdominal CT showed a markedly distended gallbladder extending to the right iliac fossa and mild thickening of the gallbladder wall. An ultrasound revealed gallbladder distension with heterogeneous gallbladder wall thickening up to 15 mm without evidence of gallstones. A diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis was made, and the patient proceeded to have percutaneous cholecystostomy in light of the gallbladder distension and the patient’s comorbidities. The patient failed to improve symptomatically and 8 days later underwent laparoscopy which identified a torsion of the gallbladder. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and recovered well and was discharged on day 4 post-operatively.\n\n【9】**Case 2**\n\n【10】The second case is an 81-year-old female, who presented to the emergency department after a 1-day history of right upper quadrant pain. She also had right upper quadrant tenderness with a positive Murphy’s sign. She had a markedly elevated neutrophilia at 26.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Her liver function tests were largely unremarkable (bilirubin 12 µmol/L (normal < 20 µmol/L), GGT 93 U/L (ref 5 - 50 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 105 U/L (ref 30 - 110 U/L), alamine aminotransferase (ALT) 30 U/L (ref 10 - 50 U/L) and AST 37 U/L (ref 10 - 35 U/L)). An ultrasound revealed a thickened gallbladder wall up to 9 mm, direct tenderness with probe pressure and no evidence of gallstones. The patient was diagnosed with acalculous cholecystitis. This patient was taken to theater for laparoscopy with intra-operative findings of a gallbladder torsion. The gallbladder was dark and congested without evidence of perforation. The gallbladder was distorted and routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Histopathological examination of the gallbladder showed a necrotic wall and features suggestive of acute-on-chronic cholecystitis. She recovered well and was discharged on day 3 after the procedure.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】The most common cause of cholecystitis is gallstone disease, caused by transient or permanent obstruction of the cystic duct \\[ 7 \\]. Acalculous cholecystitis on the other hand is most often seen in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit and represents somewhere in the vicinity of 2-15% of cases of cholecystitis \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Gallbladder torsion is a separate entity which can mimic other causes of cholecystitis. Pre-operative diagnosis is important as it requires urgent surgical management. The potential consequence of delaying intervention is ischemia with necrosis and perforation.\n\n【14】Whilst early cholecystectomy is recommended for the treatment of acute calculous cholecsytitis, initial non-operative treatment with delayed cholecystectomy has an adequate success rate, with this path more appropriate for some patient populations, dependent on their risk profile \\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]. In addition, acalculous cholecystitis is often managed non-operatively with a growing trend towards percutaneous cholecystostomy as the initial and sometimes definitive management \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. In contrast, non-operative management with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy, as evidenced by this case study, are not viable management options in the treatment of gallbladder torsion, as it is not primarily an infective process and a percutaneous cholecystostomy does not correct the underlying pathology.\n\n【15】Pre-operative diagnosis remains difficult with presenting symptomatology and pre-operative investigation is similar to alternative causes of cholecystitis.\n\n【16】One case report reports a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing an abnormal gallbladder position, with the fundus lying inferomedial to Hartmann’s pouch; however, this finding is not elsewhere reported in the literature \\[ 15 \\]. Other studies report a “cystic duct knot sign” on ultrasonography and a CT finding of a “whirl sign” in cases of reported cases of gallbladder torsion \\[ 16 , 17 \\].\n\n【17】Whilst causes of cholecystitis can be managed non-operatively, gallbladder torsion requires emergency surgery and as such requires prompt recognition. Perforation and peritonitis secondary to biliary contamination are known as complications of gallbladder torsion.\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】In conclusion, gallbladder torsion should be considered in all cases of acalculus cholecystitis, particularly in elderly thin females.

Overall, the chance of developing lung cancer during lifetime is as high as one in 15 males and one in 17 females with a higher incidence in smokers compared to non-smokers. Lebanon has the highest incidence of lung cancer among females and is the third highest among males in the Arab region \\[ 2 \\]. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all cases. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is the treatment of choice for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC).\n\n【3】Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a protein of the immunoglobulins family, present on the surface of T cells, B cells and macrophages \\[ 3 \\]. It has a downregulating role in the immune response; when expressed by tumor cells, the PD-1 ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 exert an inhibitory effect on T cells \\[ 4 \\]. PD-1 and PD-L1 belong to the immune checkpoint pathway. In tumor environment, PD-L1/PD-1 interaction promotes tumor progression \\[ 5 \\]. PD-L1 expression is upregulated in many tumors. PD-1 ligand on the surface of the T-cells interacts with its receptor PD-L1 on the tumor cell, thus inhibiting the anti-tumor activity of the immune system \\[ 6 \\]. Nowadays, it is recently found that immune checkpoint inhibitors regulate this mechanism by releasing the block and reactivating the immune system against cancer cells \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\], thus leading to tumor control by using self-immunity instead of using cytotoxic agents.\n\n【4】With the advances in lung cancer treatment, especially with the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to the therapeutic arsenal thus changing treatment strategies \\[ 9 \\] and leading to improved survival in this population \\[ 10 \\], checking the PD-L1 status on tumor tissue is being used on regular basis either in the locally advanced or metastatic disease.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】Hereby we present a case of a 63-year-old, asymptomatic male patient with coronary artery disease post-angioplasty. A 7-cm necrotic mass was found in March 2018 on injected computed tomography (CT) chest done for suspicious lesion incidentally found on chest X-ray. Bronchoscopy was inconclusive and CT-guided tumor biopsy in April 2018 showed a poorly differentiated squamous lung carcinoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan confirmed a Stage IIIC (T3N3M0) disease with left apical mass of 7 cm with standardized uptake value (SUV) of 25.21 and bilateral hilar and subcarinal adenopathies, the largest measuring 13 mm with SUV 6.44. Treatment was started and patient was given three cycles of gemcitabine with carboplatin as induction chemotherapy with the aim to render the tumor operable or to continue with definitive radiotherapy according to response. PET-CT scan was done in July 2018 and showed a good response with an irregular spiculated mass of 4.3 cm. Hilar adenopathy decreased to 10.3 mm with SUV dropping to 2.71 with no new findings seen. Following these results, left upper lobectomy with lymph node dissection was done in August 2018. We were left, on the postoperative tissue, with a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a tumor of 4.5 cm associated with parietal pleura invasion and presence of vascular emboli. Twenty eight lymph nodes were removed from hilum and subarctic region, anterior mediastinum, and para-esophagus and all were negative for malignancy. PD-L1 before chemotherapy on the initial biopsy was 60% versus 5% on the post-operative tissue, using the same Clone Dako 22C3 autostainer for evaluation.\n\n【8】Research involving non-routine analyses was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Mount Lebanon Hospital and written informed consent obtained from the patient described herein, in accordance with applicable local and international legal and ethical standards, including the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】The case described in this report adds to the increasingly being of change in PD-L1 expression during therapy with either chemotherapy, targeted or immunotherapy \\[ 11 \\- 14 \\]. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may up-regulate the expression of PD-L1 in lung squamous cell carcinoma as was recently published \\[ 15 \\]. A recently published study showed increased PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with TPF induction chemotherapy \\[ 16 \\]. Another case report showed a decrease in PD-L1 level in NSCLC after chemotherapy including gemcitabine and platinum \\[ 17 \\]. A paper published in Translational Oncology also showed significant induction of PD-L1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after standard chemotherapy treatments including paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil and platinum agents \\[ 18 \\]. And even more, in ovarian cancer, it has been reported that chemotherapy induces PD-L1 overexpression via the nuclear factor-κB \\[ 19 \\]. The value of this change in expression may be a prognostic marker that can be used in such cancer cases. Two recent studies have been published and reported an alteration of PD-L1 level (upregulation and downregulation) after using either chemotherapy alone or concomitantly with immunotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC \\[ 20 \\], \\[ 21 \\]. Therefore, the results are a little bit contradictory regarding the effect of oncologic therapy on PD-L1 expression level. This controversy is to be more investigated in order to define and explain the exact effect of immunotherapy on treated cases according to PD-L1 on tumor cells and to tumor subtype and stage of the disease.\n\n【12】A study evaluating PD-L1 in epidermal growth factor receptor ( _EGFR)_ mutant patients showed an increased level of receptors post resistance to gefitinib used in the metastatic setting, thus suggesting the need to rebiopsy after progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitors \\[ 22 \\]. The second biopsy is not to only check if T790m mutation is present and probably use osimertinib \\[ 23 \\], but also to check the PD-L1 status in order to define the possible benefit from immunotherapy according to expression level. The change in the PD-L1 level with therapy is neither cancer-type dependent nor treatment-dependent.\n\n【13】**Conclusions**\n\n【14】In front of available data and the increasing number of cases being reported about such change in PD-L1 level with multiple types of treatment and in different malignancies and stages, we may need to rebiopsy every case on progression and to recheck to PD-L1 expression level and maybe other tumor markers in order to define the best treatment approach especially with the implication of immunotherapy in almost every single step of management regardless of the therapeutic approach used. This change in PD-L1 expression could have an impact on the survival of locally advanced and metastatic cases, either in lung cancer or maybe other solid tumors.\n\n【15】In front of these changes in PD-L1 expression that is being increasingly reported with different treatment modalities and several cancer types, we may need to consider biopsy after failure of each line of therapy and in the transition from neoadjuvant to adjuvant therapy in order to try to define the correct approach for the new line of treatment being considered. Furthermore, since PD-L1 is changing, we may think about retesting for microsatellite instability (MSI) for example on therapy change, among other possible tumor markers that might be interesting. The change in the expression was not limited to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in any tumor stage. And this may lead us to new prognostic scores and will change survival data according to the expression pre and post intervention in locally advanced and metastatic cases not limited to lung cancer. These findings together may change our vision in treating new cancer cases. This needs further investigations and reports.\n\n【16】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【17】We would like to thank the patient for his cooperation in this study.\n\n【18】**Funding Disclosure**\n\n【19】None.\n\n【20】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【21】The authors have nothing to declare.\n\n【22】**Informed Consent**\n\n【23】Written informed consents were obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\n\n【24】**Author’s Contribution**\n\n【25】AG, SD, SH collected data, designed and wrote the manuscript.

When ascites is first identified, it is important to determine whether it is isolated or whether other signs of hydrops are present, including skin oedema, scalp oedema, pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation. The prognosis and therapy for a foetus with hydrops depends on the aetiology. However, when foetal ascites is seen alone (i.e., without other signs of hydrops), it may represent a separate problem requiring a different management strategy, leading to a different outcome \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【3】A careful search for underlying causes should be undertaken in all cases of apparently isolated ascites. A systematic protocol for the diagnostic work up of foetal ascites should be followed, as an aetiology or associated disorder can be identified in 92% of cases \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【4】Numerous mechanisms have been implicated in the generation of ascites, including abnormal lymphatic drainage; obstruction of venous return, as observed for any space-occupying lesion in the thorax; cardiac failure; decreased plasma oncotic pressure, as in foetal anaemia; hepatic insufficiency (storage disease) or congenital nephrosis; increased capillary permeability; urinary tract obstruction; or meconial peritonitis \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【5】Infections such as congenital syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella, toxoplasmosis, and hepatitis A can uncommonly cause foetal ascites \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【6】Here, we present a case of prenatally diagnosed isolated foetal ascites secondary to perforation of the extra-hepatic bile duct.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】A 24-year-old primigravida was referred to our institution at 27 weeks gestation with a diagnosis of isolated foetal ascites. Further work-up revealed a normal foetal echocardiogram scan and a normal karyotype on amniocentesis. The patient has an A-Rh positive blood type and was rubella immune. Tests for hepatitis B and C, CMV, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, and syphilis were all negative.\n\n【10】Our initial ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation showed severe isolated foetal ascites and peritoneal calcification ( Fig. 1 ) without any other structural anomalies. Two weeks later, we performed a foetal paracentesis, and a laboratory work-up revealed sterile peritonitis. Cultures of the ascitic fluid for TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex) infections were all negative. The foetal ascites disappeared on a subsequent ultrasound examination performed at 33 weeks of gestation ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Severe isolated foetal ascites._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Disappearance of foetal ascites._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】The patient presented to labour and delivery at 38 weeks of gestation with premature rupture of the membranes and subsequently delivered a male infant weighing 3020 g with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The indication for caesarean delivery was a foetal breech malpresentation.\n\n【15】Subsequently, the newborn was operated on by a paediatric surgeon with the indication of an intrauterine extra-hepatic bile duct perforation in the first post-partum week and was discharged from the hospital without any problems.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】* * *\n\n【18】Isolated ascites is diagnosed by demonstrating fluid surrounding the liver, spleen, bowel, extra-hepatic portion of the umbilical vein, falciform ligament, or greater omentum. When discovered on an initial sonogram, ascites should be followed by an ultrasound approximately 1 week later to determine whether progression to foetal hydrops has occurred. If the ascites remains isolated to the foetal abdomen, then progression to hydrops is much less likely \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【19】Isolated ascites is most often secondary to an intra-abdominal disorder, rather than a generalized condition. It is most often secondary to obstructed uropathy; however, 20% of cases are due to gastrointestinal disorders \\[ 4 \\- 8 \\]. Of these, meconium peritonitis is the most common cause, which results from a bowel obstruction \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【20】The work-up for any case of ascites should include a detailed ultrasound examination to exclude the presence of any associated foetal abnormalities. The mother should be screened for the presence of viral infections such as parvovirus, CMV, hepatitis, varicella, herpes simplex, rubella, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Additionally, the blood rhesus factor and blood antibody titres of the mother should be identified.\n\n【21】An amniocentesis for foetal karyotyping should be considered, as the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities could be up to 15% \\[ 9 \\]. Other than a cytogenetic analysis, evaluating for a possible foetal infection (TORCH titres, antigen-specific IgM/IgG) and a prenatal diagnosis of inherited metabolic diseases are helpful \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. These data could also be obtained from foetal blood sampling.\n\n【22】A foetal paracentesis can be performed to evaluate the meconium, protein/lymphocyte counts, TORCH titres, and the foetal karyotype \\[ 1 \\]. Massive compression of the chest caused by intra-abdominal ascites before 24 weeks of gestation may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia, but it is uncertain whether foetal paracentesis is helpful in this situation \\[ 1 , 10 \\]. A foetal echocardiogram is also warranted to rule out a cardiac anomaly or arrhythmia \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【23】Bishry reported a series of twelve cases with isolated foetal ascites without any other anomalies detected antenatally, and ten survived postnatally. Only one of the ten cases had ileal atresia detected postpartum, which was repaired. The other nine cases had no abnormalities that could be detected either antenatally or postnatally. The two cases of foetal loss were diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation and one had laryngeal atresia, which was terminal \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【24】A larger series reported by Favre et al. detected approximately the same survival rate (8/8) for idiopathic isolated foetal ascites, in which no cause could be demonstrated during the foetal and neonatal periods \\[ 4 \\]. They documented a significant relationship between survival rate and gestational age at diagnosis.\n\n【25】Furthermore, Bishry could detect the cause of isolated foetal ascites in 26 of 28 cases antenatally \\[ 2 \\], whereas Favre et al. could detect the cause in only 8 of 25 cases \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【26】In our case, we could not identify any cause using data from the work-up we performed antenatally.\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】Isolated foetal ascites is a rare and separate condition from foetal hydrops. The perinatal outcome for isolated ascites is much better than that for hydrops foetalis. An extensive work-up should be conducted to demonstrate the cause, since most cases are associated with other abnormalities.\n\n【29】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are initially reported by Klemperer et al \\[ 1 \\]. It is a mesenchymal tumor that appears to exhibit fibroblastic differentiation, classically described in the pleura, but extrathoracic SFT has also been reported \\[ 2 \\]. Although sciatic pain is very common, extraspinal compression of the nerve is extremely rare. SFT can be diagnosed preoperatively only by needle biopsy \\[ 3 \\] because it is a rare lesion and not easily recognizable. In addition, no specific tumor markers have been identified or images published for this tumor type. They have a generally benign course, being classified as having intermediate biological potential (rarely metastasizing) \\[ 4 \\]. However, in rare cases, they may recur locally or at a distance. When surgery is not possible or in the presence of metastasis, chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy may be therapeutic options.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】The patient was a 44-year-old man, a construction worker, healthy apart from a totally resected left pelvic SFT 3 years before. The patient presented at the emergency department with bilateral sciatic pain and gait disorder. He had progressive sciatic pain at the right for 11 months and on the left for 1 month that aggravated walking and sitting. He reported numbing and tingling of the right foot for 6 months. One month before, he developed constipation and effortful micturition, after a week, paresis of the right foot and leg, and later also his left foot. There is no history of trauma. Physical examination showed _cafe-au-lait_ spots in the trunk ( Fig. 1a ), limbs ( Fig. 1b ) and axillary ephelides ( Fig. 1c ). There was also a palpable rounded swelling on the posterior aspect of the right thigh (5 × 8 cm), with an elastic and non-painful consistency at palpation. Neurological examination disclosed an asymmetric paraparesis (right leg grade 2, left leg grade 4 MRC), normal deep tendon reflexes apart from abolished right aquilian reflex and indifferent right plantar response. He also showed reduced tactile and algic sensation distally in both legs. At this point, cauda equina syndrome due to compressive lesion was suspected, and spinal MRI was performed. With a normal MRI, an extraspinal cause was pursued. Pelvic CT scan was done that revealed a mass, which invaded the iliac bilaterally and right sacroiliac joint, with lithic alteration ( Fig. 2a ). The histology of the pelvic lesion and thigh lesion was compatible with bilateral SFT. The histological study revealed a cytological atypia and a high numerous of mitoses. Although the patient had no pulmonary symptoms, after the SFT diagnosis of the pelvic mass, a thoracic CT scan was also performed that showed a small peripheral nodule in the left upper lobe ( Fig. 2b ) and nodular densification area in the periphery posterior region of the apical region of the right lower lobe ( Fig. 2c ). After needle biopsy of the peripheral nodule in the left upper lobe histology, it was, indeed, compatible with SFT, with pleural involvement. As it was not possible to approach the pelvic mass surgically, due to vascular involvement, the patient initially received radiotherapy. Although the tumor did not respond, and after several sessions of radiotherapy, a therapeutic trial with chemotherapy was performed. No response had been seen and pelvic CTs and PET performed revealed growth of bilateral mass with invasion of adjacent organs: mesentery, sigmoid colon, intestinal adhesion and invasion of the bladder. The patient died 1 year after the diagnosis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) _Cafe-au-lait_ spots in the trunk. (b) _Cafe-au-lait_ spots in the limbs.

Although most cases are benign, the behavior of SFTs is unpredictable. Because of the overlapping of the histological diagnosis of SFT with other soft tissue tumors, its correct and precise pathological characterization necessitates experienced soft tissue pathologists to evaluate the specimen both for a proper diagnosis and for the detection of malignant features \\[ 6 \\]. The malignant form causes an aggressive course of the disease, with local invasion, recurrence of disease and metastasis \\[ 7 \\]. Pathological characteristics of malignant SFT include hypercellular lesions, cytological atypia, numerous mitoses (four or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields), tumor necrosis, and/or infiltrating margins \\[ 8 \\]. Vallat-Decouvelaere et al reported malignancy in eight of 92 cases of extrathoracic SFT, including local recurrence or distal metastasis, in seven of which at least one of the typical pathological characteristics was observed in the primary tumor \\[ 9 \\]. Various benign or malignant soft tissue tumors emerging from fat, muscle, and nerve may develop in the retroperitoneal region. Some retroperitoneal tumors are diagnosed because of clinical symptoms or image inspections. From the data collected we found no association between neurofibromatosis and SFT. In our case, progressive compression of the sacral plexus and sciatic nerve in the thigh was responsible for the symptoms and its appropriate investigation allowed the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of sciatic pain as manifestation of SFT. However, little is still known about the genetic and molecular events responsible for the pathogenesis of SFT and how these may relate to clinically determined risk factors. A few immunohistochemically or molecular biomarkers, including p53, telomerase activity, cyclin expression, and Ki67, have been suggested to have prognostic significance \\[ 10 \\]. Larger SFTs have been associated with more genomic copy number alterations than small tumors, suggesting a possible link to aggressive behavior. Future investigations to characterize potential biomarkers of SFT are needed \\[ 4 \\]. As we said, SFT are rare tumors, especially in the advanced phase, as only a minority of patients will eventually recur after primary surgical management \\[ 11 \\]. As far as we know it is also the only report with such a malignant evolution, with disease progression, involving several organs, despite the treatments that were performed. Therefore, data regarding the actual effectiveness of systemic therapy in this setting are limited and stem from small retrospective studies. However, because the efficacy of standard chemotherapy is limited in STS, much hope has grown around the development of targeted therapies \\[ 11 \\]. Furthermore, although anti-angiogenic agents have interesting activity in SFT, our data and those reported by others suggest that this subtype is only modestly more sensitive than other subtypes of sarcoma. This however would need to be assessed in a prospective trial which is greatly needed in these rare tumors. We underline the fact that the patient had no response either to radiotherapy or to chemotherapy.\n\n【12】**Author Contributions**\n\n【13】Ana Vilaca: substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article, critical revision of the article, and final approval of the version to be published.

In the present study, we report a case of multiple hospital admissions on account of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and angina-like symptoms. Following an extensive workup, the patient was found to have multiple coronary artery ectasias (CAE) and aneurysms together with multiple intracranial arterial dolichoectasias (IADEs) and aneurysms.

The pain was non-exertional, had been present for a while (not specific), and was mild and intermittent but suddenly grew worse that afternoon. At presentation, she claimed that the pain was no longer present. A review of the systems was negative for any related symptoms. The physical exam was unremarkable, and the vital signs were within the normal range. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute (bpm) and T-wave inversion in V4 and V5. The troponin level was mildly elevated (0.082, 0.084, 0.089, 0.083 ng/mL). Echocardiology showed no left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities and normal overall LV systolic function; the LV ejection fraction was 60%, and the LV diastolic function was indeterminate. The nuclear stress test showed abnormal dipyridamole stress myocardial perfusion imaging, representing moderate inferior and inferolateral ischemia with partial scarring, borderline LV size, and mild LV dysfunction. The patient was a poor candidate for invasive cardiac workup in terms of an angiogram due to severe anemia and was treated medically with aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, nifedipine, and atorvastatin. The patient’s symptoms disappeared during her stay in the hospital, and she was discharged with a plan to repeat the ECG in 6 - 8 weeks and follow-up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. One month later, the patient was brought to the hospital for evaluation of further chest pain with the same physical and ECG characteristics as the previous episode and minimal elevation of troponin (0.075 - 0.052). Echocardiology showed no differences from the previous. The general condition of the patient was more stable, and the anemia had improved; therefore coronary angiography was performed, the findings of which were: right-side dominance; severe ectasia of the left main coronary artery (LMCA); extreme ectasia of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), with multiple areas of moderate-to-severe distal and apical stenosis; multiple areas of stenosis including the first obtuse marginal artery (OM1), and distal left circumflex artery (LCX); ectopic origin from the left cusp of the right coronary artery (RCA); and total proximal occlusion with the distal vessel receiving collaterals from the left system ( Figs. 1 , 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Coronary artery angiogram revealing a severely ectatic left main coronary artery (LMCA); an extremely ectatic left anterior descending (LAD) artery with multiple areas of moderate-to-severe distal and apical stenosis; severely ectatic and stenotic areas of diagonal 1 artery (D1); and multiple areas of stenosis including the first obtuse marginal (OM1) and distal left circumflex (LCX) arteries._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Peripheral coronary angiogram revealing severe ectasia of the left subclavian arteries, with multiple areas of moderate stenosis._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Moreover, peripheral coronary angiography showed bilateral ectasia of the subclavian arteries, with multiple areas of moderate stenosis. Due to the involvement of numerous arteries, no stent or angioplasty was performed. Ranolazine was started, and the other medications were continued, and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\n\n【11】Two weeks later, the patient was brought to the hospital on account of dizziness that occurred while doing physical therapy for leg pain. The patient had had multiple episodes of dizziness, but this time she sought medical attention. The patient was alert, oriented for place, person, and times. The neurological exam showed: normal muscle tone; power 5/5; bilateral deep tendon reflex 2+ in the upper and lower limbs; bilateral plantar response; sensory intactness to a light touch; and normal bilateral finger to nose. Orthostatic vitals were negative for orthostatic hypotension. Head computerized tomography (CT) angiography showed: severe IADE involving the vertebrobasilar system, bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, and bilateral middle cerebral arteries. There were multiple aneurysms in the left supraclinoid internal carotid artery and bilateral cavernous internal carotid arteries. The sagittal 2D reconstructed images demonstrated a moderate mass effect on the ventral medulla. Considering the severe nature of the IADE and the tortuosity of the vertebrobasilar system, this appearance was likely due to a mass effect on the medulla by the dolichoectatic vertebral-basilar arteries ( Fig. 3a-d ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** (a) Sagittal image of a computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of the head, revealing ectasia of the vertebrobasilar artery (red arrow) and calcification, dilatation, and ectasia of the intracavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery (blue arrow).

In one study of more 380 autopsy patients who died of a fatal stroke, 16 had IADE, of which eight had coexistence of CAE \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【19】Both conditions are abnormal dilatation of arteries; while CAE affects a coronary arterial segment and leads to a dilatation of at least 1.5 times that of a normal coronary artery \\[ 3 \\], IADE affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation, but more frequently involves the intracranial vertebral-basilar arteries \\[ 4 \\]. An increased diameter of just one cerebral artery is sufficient to make a diagnosis of IADE \\[ 5 \\]. Approximately 20-30% of CAE presentations are congenital, 50% are attributable to atherosclerosis, and 10-20% are associated with inflammatory or connective tissue disease. CAE is diagnosed in approximately 3-8% of patients undergoing coronary angiography, and these patients sometimes present with acute coronary syndrome \\[ 3 , 6 \\].\n\n【20】On the other hand, IADE is typically found accidentally or when related complications arise. The prevalence is estimated at 0.08-6.5% in the general population; however, patients who have had a cerebrovascular accident have a higher occurrence in the range of 3-17% \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Complications of IADE may include ischemic stroke and brain stem compression, which are most commonly seen in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia with a high 5-year risk. Less frequent complications include subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral bleeding \\[ 5 , 7 \\- 8 \\].\n\n【21】Moreover, risk factors of CAE and IADE have concurrent risk factors including advanced age, male gender, hypertension, and smoking \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. A history of myocardial infarction has also been documented as a risk factor for vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia \\[ 7 \\]. Of note, patients with diabetes mellitus have a low incidence of CAE, which may be due to the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with a negative remodeling in response to atherosclerosis. Smoking also appears to be a more common risk factor in patients with CAE than in those with coronary artery disease (CAD), and cocaine use is an independent predictor of CAE, irrespective of smoking \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【22】A common pathogenesis has been suggested for CAE and IADE, which implies that dilative arteriopathy may be a systemic process involving several arterial beds simultaneously \\[ 2 \\]. This establishes that CAE and IADE are part of a generalized arterial ectasia that is seen in other arteries such as the thoracic and abdominal aorta and the internal carotid arteries \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. Another pathological pattern of affected muscular arteries has been reported, including rarefaction of the elastic tissue of the media with degeneration of the internal elastic lamina, in addition to MMP-3 dysfunction with the same genotype involvement (5A/5A in the promoter region) \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【23】The management of CAE includes drug treatment, angioplasty with a shunt, and surgery. The medical management is contentious, since there is still no sufficient evidence-based approach. Some authors recommend long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin based on the significant flow disturbances within ectatic segments \\[ 3 , 10 \\]; however, this could not be used with our patient, since she had had multiple falls in the past, secondary to dizziness. This therapy has not been tested prospectively and should only be used as a risk vs. benefit approach \\[ 3 \\]. It is also suggested that patients (including asymptomatic individuals) be placed on antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitors; however, again, this has not yet been evaluated in prospective randomized studies \\[ 3 \\]. The role of nitrates or calcium channel blockers for angina remains controversial \\[ 11 \\]. With the strong association between CAE and atherosclerosis, guideline-directed medical therapy for risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia should be considered \\[ 6 \\]; medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins may be useful in disrupting disease progression \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【24】In patients with coexisting obstructive lesions and symptoms or signs of significant ischemia despite medical therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) could be attempted \\[ 3 \\]. This technique is relatively challenging, especially with the existence of a large vessel caliber, thrombus burden within the aneurysm, and the potential requirement for a covered stent. Thrombus aspiration can be attempted if identified within the aneurysm. In cases where residual thrombus remains in the artery despite aspiration, some authors advocate for triple therapy (dual antiplatelet treatment and an anticoagulant). Low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) has been suggested \\[ 12 \\]. There are insufficient data regarding the revascularization of stenotic ectatic coronary arteries. Drug-eluting balloon-expandable stents are used wherever possible. Self-expanding stents (SESs) are advantageous in that they achieve a complete apposition of stent struts as a result of their constant gentle outward force. The newer generation SES STENTYS stent, made from nitinol with nickel-titanium alloy, self-expands, and is confined to the vessel lumen over time \\[ 13 \\]. The covered balloon-expandable Jostent has been shown to be capable of treating some coronary aneurysms \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【25】In the symptomatic patient who is not suitable for stent insertion, surgical excision, or ligation of the aneurysm with bypass graft of the affected coronary arteries may be the procedure of choice. Coronary artery aneurysm of at least 3 - 4 times the size of the original vessel diameter is considered an absolute indication for surgical intervention by many due to the propensity for complications such as compression, rupture, or thrombosis. Solitary bypass grafting is suggested by some authors as the intervention of choice for non-giant aneurysms \\[ 7 \\]. Other surgical options include aneurysm ligation, resection, or marsupialization with interposition grafting \\[ 8 , 15 \\].\n\n【26】On the other hand, the best protocol for the management of IADE is uncertain. To prevent cerebrovascular accidents, blood pressure control should be prioritized. Antiplatelet therapy may also be indicated for the prevention of recurrent stroke \\[ 4 \\]. Patients presenting with compressive neurological manifestations should likely undergo a surgical evaluation \\[ 5 \\]. Standard surgical procedures that may be indicated include ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion for hydrocephalus, microsurgery for trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasms, superficial temporal artery-superior cerebellar artery (STA-SCA) bypass, proximal balloon occlusion, and thrombectomy \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】**Conclusions**\n\n【28】CAE and IADE may occur concurrently in a patient since they have similar risk factors and pathogenesis. These are also thought to arise as part of a generalized arterial ectasia, as noticed in our patient; she had ectasia that involved multiple arteries. The management protocol for such a patient is complicated and requires a multidisciplinary team to optimize the patient’s condition. Moreover, there is a need for a more prospective study to identify the best way to treat such a patient.\n\n【29】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【30】We would like to thank Dr. Richard Grodman in the Cardiology Department and Dr. Joseph Bibawy in the Department of Radiology of our institute for providing us with the test images.\n\n【31】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【32】None to declare.\n\n【33】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【34】The authors report no conflict of interest.\n\n【35】**Informed Consent**\n\n【36】Not applicable.\n\n【37】**Author Contributions**\n\n【38】H.

The operation is implantation of seconder scleral-fixed intraocular lens.

He does not have any disease such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Two years ago the patient had an accident by cow horn backlash and underwent limbocorneal suturation and anterior vitrectomy in the primer surgery and the surgery resulted in aphakia. The eye was not vitrectomised but the patient lost a large amount of vitreus during perforation. Fundoscopic examination showed normal retina and pre-operative visual acuity of the patient in the operated eye with pinholl was 0.6.\n\n【7】The anesthesia was applied topically with subtenon enjection and intracameral plain lidocaine was given towards the end of surgery. Two percent sodium hyaluronate was used as viscoelastic and sefuroksim aksetil was injected to anterior chamber for endophthalmitis prophylaxis. Intraocular pressure rose up to about 50 mmHg, 8 hours after operation antiglaucomatous drugs were given. Corneal edema was cleared in two weeks but the patient complained from blindness and defined only light perception. Central retinal artery obstruction, central retinal vein occlusion, peripapiller and macular hemorrhage and optic atrophy were observed in the fundus examination. This complication was not an intraocular infection because the media was clear and there was not redness or pain. After 6 months, corneal haze, especially on the upper side, occurred and the retina has become invisible. Thus, further examination such as fluorescein angiography failed due to corneal haze ( Fig. 1h ). This complication is similar to hemorrhagic infarction of the retina.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】The cause of this complication may be viscoelastic agents, due to the injection of lidocaine into the anterior chamber or cefuroxime. The most important postoperative complication of viscoelastic agents is elevation of intraocular pressure. Increase in intraocular pressure is dose-related and of a transient nature, generally within the first 6 - 24 hours after surgery and typically resolved within 72 hours. Increased intraocular pressure may cause central retinal vein occlusion or central retinal artery obstruction \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. But the complication occurring in this patient was more serious than complications due to elevated intraocular pressure.\n\n【11】One of the other suspected substances is lidocaine. Hoffman and Fine reported transient amaurosis cases due to intracameral lidocaine \\[ 3 \\]. Lincoff H and others reported retinal toxicity after injection of lidocain intraocularly \\[ 4 \\]. Liang C reported electroretinogram changes in the rabbit retina but he did not observe any histologic abnormalities after injection of lidocaine hydrochloride intravitreally \\[ 5 \\]. All the reported toxicities related to lidocaine do not cause permanent blindness whereas retinal toxicity in this case caused permanent blindness.\n\n【12】The most suspected substance is cefuroxime but there was not major evidence in the literature to prove so. Delyfer MN noted intracameral injection of high doses induced anterior and posterior inflammation \\[ 6 \\]. Conversely, Sakarya Y and Sakarya R reported inadvertent intracameral (3 mg in 0.1 ml) cefuroxime injection did not cause any detectable adverse effect on ocular tissues \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【13】Research for possible side effects of intracameral lidocaine, viscoelastic agents and intracameral cefuroxime were made in Medline and a few side effects were found. But these complications are not similar by the complication that we reported. Two percent sodium hyaluronate, intracameral lidocaine and cefuroxime have been used for many years and are unlikely to be the cause of the findings. The retinal hemorrages may be related to a vascular event or other pathology anytime from surgery to two weeks post-op, but this patient complained of blindness immediately after surgery and a rapidly atrophy of optic disc is not a usual presentation of vascular event. Retinal hemorrhage in this patient confined in the central, but central retinal vein, occlusion makes widespread retinal hemorrhage and visual deterioration at the level of light perception is required a much more intense bleeding.\n\n【14】We cannot find any related results between the above-mentioned substance and the complication, however and without any doubt it developed as a whole as a result of the surgery. Overall it is clear this complication is a toxic retinopathy and a result of sequence of events resulted by hemorrhagic retinal infarct. The development of corneal haze after hemorrhagic retinal infarct reinforces the idea that these complications are as result of toxicity. We think this toxicity was caused from an ingredient of the drugs or using of excess dose than the recommended dose of any drug during the operation accidentally. After all, a case which has resulted to such a complication in a surgery has never been reported previously, thus we wanted to point it out.\n\n【15】**Grant**\n\n【16】None\n\n【17】**Competing Interests**\n\n【18】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It may involve the patellar tendon, patella or quadriceps tendon. Quadriceps tendon ruptures are less common and relatively few reports in the literature have addressed this complication. The prevalence has been reported to range from 0.1% to 1.1% \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Dobbs et al reported 24 (0.1%) postoperative partial or complete quadriceps ruptures in a large cohort of 23,800 primary TKAs. Different surgical techniques have been described for repair of this challenging problem, however complications rates were high and outcomes were poor in many of these patients \\[ 1 \\]. Singh et al described a technique using a double figure of eight Dacron tape for chronic rupture of the quadriceps tendon after TKA with an excellent outcome. He also advocated that with this technique early rehabilitation can be utilized \\[ 3 \\]. Herein, we present the surgical technique and outcome of a patient with traumatic partial quadriceps tendon rupture after TKA, using FiberTape and similar double figure of eight technique plus augmentation with TissueMend.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 68-year-old woman with long-standing right knee pain due to osteoarthrosis underwent a primary TKA. Her previous medical history was significant for coronary artery disease and triple bypass surgery. She had an uneventful surgery and immediate postoperative period. She was discharged home on postoperative day six with home therapy. Ten days after the surgery she was seen in the office because she fell while walking outside of her home. She described that her knee was hyperflexed and abducted during the fall. When examined, she was not able to perform a straight leg raise test or active extension of the knee against gravity from sitting position, although minimal muscle movement was appreciated. X-ray of the knee showed the prosthesis and patella were both in good position; however damage to the extensor mechanism was suspected. Therefore, the patient was immobilized in full extension and an ultrasound of the knee was performed next day. The ultrasound revealed disruption of the extensor mechanism with a hematoma over the anterior medial side of the knee at the level of the musculotendinous junction, confirming a partial rupture of the quadriceps muscle tendon. Initially, the patient was treated conservatively and instructed to wear a knee immobilizer in full extension. However, the patient was not compliant with the immobilization and five weeks later she continued to have weakness, and was only able to actively extend the knee 25-30 ° from a seated position. The decision was made to proceed with a surgical repair of the quadriceps tendon. The patient was prepped in the usual sterile fashion. Following the previous incision, the dissection was carried down to the extensor mechanism. The defective area filled with scar tissue was identified on the anteromedial aspect of the extensor tendon and retinaculum at the level of the musculotendinous junction. Therefore, the joint was entered through the scar tissue and irrigated. The edges were debrided and using #2 FiberWire (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL, USA) an interrupted suture was performed. Additionally, 2 mm FiberTape (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL, USA) was doubled and passed through the proximal patellar tendon, then above the patella in figure of eight, and subsequently through the quadriceps tendon. Maintaining the knee in full extension the fiber tape was tightened. TissueMend (Sryker, Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA) was sutured directly over the approximated area ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Intraoperative photograph of repaired partial quadriceps tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】The patient started isometric quadriceps muscle strengthening a few days after surgery. She was also given a knee immobilizer and instructed to use it for protected ambulation over the next few weeks. Six weeks after the surgery she had progressed to more aggressive physical therapy targeted at improving active knee range of motion (ROM) and strength. Seven months after the surgery the patient had quadriceps strength comparable to the contralateral side and full active ROM in extension.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】Rupture of the quadriceps tendon after TKA is an uncommon and serious complication; it may put significant technical challenges to the surgeon and be very demanding to the rehabilitation team and the patient. While primary quadriceps tendon repair in native knees has shown high success rates, repairs performed after TKA have not been as successful \\[ 1 \\]. The literature is very limited regarding this uncommon but serious complication and consists only of case reports and case series. Different local and systemic factors such as previous knee surgery, lateral release, multiple steroid injections, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus have been suggested to play a role in the development of this complication.\n\n【11】As primary repair of the quadriceps tendon after TKA has not shown adequate results, different techniques using anchor sutures, auto and allografts, and synthetic materials augmentation have been described \\[ 3 \\- 7 \\]. Furthermore, information regarding the treatment of partial ruptures is very limited with no clear guidelines of how to treat them. Although according to Dobbs et al non operative treatment of partial quadriceps tendon rupture has shown satisfactory results and fewer complications, it is not clear if more extensive ruptures have the same satisfactory rates.\n\n【12】We elected to perform the double figure of eight technique using FiberTape described above because it was technically easier and did not involve further disruption of the patella. Braided polyblend suture (FiberTape) is readily available in USA and is intended for use in soft tissue approximation. We used it to provide better approximation and strength instead of the Dacron tape described by Singh et al. In addition, we also opted to use soft tissue repair matrix (TissueMend). Soft tissue repair matrix is an acellular, collagen membrane used to reinforce soft tissues where weakness exists. It is specifically designed to serve as a scaffold for cellular and vascular ingrowth that is gradually remodeled into new tissue. It creates not only mechanical but also biological augmentation.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we believe that significant extent and near complete partial quadriceps tendon ruptures after TKA should be treated surgically similar to complete tears. One such technique is described above. As with complete ruptures, augmentation is necessary to prevent failure of the sutures. Soft tissue repair matrix may further augment the frail tissue area and possibly prevent re-ruptures.\n\n【14】**Conflicts of Interests**\n\n【15】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【16】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The treatment of cervical artery dissection remains highly controversal. The diversity of treatment options reflects the huge heterogenity of spontaneous cervical artery dissections, linked to the association of several factors \\[ 3 \\]. We present a case of a spontaneous vertebral artery (VA) dissection in a middle-aged patient treated by stent placement.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 59-year-old female patient with a history of one episode of syncope (10 days before the first visit to our department) was referred to color coded duplex sonography (CCDS) for a diagnostic work-up. Her medical history included arterial hypertension, diabetes and dislipidemia. Two years before she had coronary and iliac artery stenting and balloon angioplasty of the right subclavian artery. The patient was without neurological deficit. Brain computed tomography was without data for brain infarction.\n\n【6】CCDS revealed non-stenotic atherosclerotic plaques of both internal carotid arteries and thrombosis of the right VA. On her left VA two stenotic lesions were detected. The first was high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis in the origin of VA ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** CCDS of the left VA, high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis in the origin of VA._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】The second lesion was at the distal part of V1 segment ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** CCDS of the left VA, hypodense intramural hematoma, causing eccentric stenosis and segmental arterial dilatation consistent with VA dissection in V1 segment._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】The ultrasound findings of the second vertebral lesion were highly characteristic for VA dissection, hypodense intramural hematoma, causing eccentric stenosis and segmental arterial dilatation. The patient was referred for digital subtraction angiography and two stenotic lesions were revealed: left high-grade VA atherosclerotic stenosis and left VA dissection ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Digital subtraction angiography, high-grade VA atherosclerotic stenosis and VA dissection in V1 segment._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】The patient underwent endovascular stenting of extracranial VA.

Severe atherosclerosis of both VA (thrombosis of the right and high-grade stenosis of the left VA) as well as non-stenotic plaques of the carotid arteries was detected by CCDS.\n\n【18】Cervical artery dissection is considered as non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies causing cerebral ischemia, affecting mainly young individuals. Although the etiology of the spontaneous cervical artery dissection remains incompletely understood, an underlying structural defect of the extracellular matrix, resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, is generally suspected \\[ 4 \\]. Atherosclerosis appears to be rare in patients affected by cervical artery dissection \\[ 5 \\]. Several studies investigated the potential link of cervical artery dissection with common risk factors for atherosclerosis \\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]. In the largest study Debette et al \\[ 6 \\] reported that hypertension was associated with an increased risk of cervical artery dissection, whereas an inverse association with hypercholesterolemia, obesity and overweight was observed. Vascular risk factor profile of patients suggests that atherosclerosis is probably not a predisposing condition to cervical artery dissection \\[ 6 \\]. But the relationship between the atherosclerosis and the dissections of the cervical arteries is not examined up to now.\n\n【19】The clinical presentation of the spontaneous VA dissection is highly variable. Patients with spontaneous extracranial VA dissection may present with ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, sensorimotor cervical radiculopathy C5/C6, pulsatile tinnitus or occipital head and neck pain alone \\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]. Arnold et al reported asymptomatic VA dissections in 8% of 169 patients with VA dissection \\[ 8 \\]. It is interesting that in our case asymptomatic VA dissection developed in patient with asymptomatic atherosclerotic bilateral high-grade VA obstructions. The absolute risk of posterior circulation stroke in patients with atherosclerotic arterial disease and asymptomatic VA origin stenosis is low \\[ 11 \\]. The absence of neurologic deficits in our case could be attributed to the developed collateral pathways during the slowly progressive atherosclerotic process and the adequate intracranial collateral flow.\n\n【20】We emphasize on the highly diagnostic ultrasound possibilities to distinguish between the two types of VA stenotic lesions. Vertebral origin and near the origin is the most affected by atherosclerotic stenosis VA segment \\[ 1 \\], while the entrance of the artery into the transverse foramen of the C6 vertebra is the most typical dissection site in V1 segment \\[ 12 \\]. The first lesion is concentric and high-graded, while the second lesion is intramural hypoechogenic hematoma, causing eccentric moderate grade stenosis and local dilatation of arterial diameter.\n\n【21】In the recent years, treatment of VA stenosis by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been introduced \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. There were much less cases of application of this treatment in patients with VA dissection. The safety and benefit of stenting of the VA dissection as compared with the medical therapy are unclear. For VA dissection, the review of Pham et al \\[ 15 \\] concerning all cases with VA dissection treated by stenting reported a 100% technical success rate and no neurological complication during the follow-up. The CCDS follow-up period of our patient was 3 years. No new neurological events during the follow-up period were observed.\n\n【22】**Conclusion**\n\n【23】VA dissection could be found in patient with cervical artery atherosclerosis. VA stenting could be presumed in such cases.\n\n【24】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Elevation of leukocyte counts (10,500/mL) and CRP (8.02 mg/dL) was observed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a large intra-abdominal abscess and extra-abdominal abscess ( Fig. 1 ). Three slices of CT (cross-section) showed small round high-density area and coronal section CT showed linear high-density area ( Fig. 2 ), suggesting the existence of a linear sharp foreign body. We asked the patient the possibility that she ingested a foreign body, and she remembered that she might ingest the bone of sea bream. We aspirated abscess and cultured the abscess content, and _Streptococcus intermedius_ was isolated. We had started the treatment using tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) (18 mg/day) empirically, and after the detection of _Streptococcus intermedius_ , we changed the treatment from TAZ/PIPC to the combination of penicillin G (PCG) (18 million units) and clindamycin (CLDM) (2,400 mg/day) ( Fig. 3 ). We considered the indication of operation, and the absence of fistula between intestinal tract and abscess and a remarkable improvement of CRP and symptoms by using antibiotics made us select the conservative treatment using antibiotics ( Fig. 3 ).

In adults, rapid eating, poor vision, mental disorders, and drug intoxication or alcoholism may be risk factors for accidental ingestion of the foreign bodies \\[ 2 \\]. Our patient has risk factors for accidental ingestion of the foreign bodies such as schizophrenia and rapid eating. The most common perforation site is the terminal ileum as our patient did, due to its narrow and angulating anatomical nature \\[ 4 \\]. Fish bones are the most commonly observed objects that result in bowel perforation \\[ 5 \\], which may result in the development of abscess, enteric fistula, or intestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. It is very difficult to make the diagnosis of bowel perforation due to the ingestion of fish bones \\[ 6 \\], because fish bones are invisible on X-ray.

The standard treatment for bowel perforation due to the foreign bodies is emergency surgery \\[ 3 \\]. In this case, the absence of fistula between intestinal tract and abscess and a remarkable improvement of CRP and symptoms by using antibiotics made us lead to the conservative treatment using antibiotics.\n\n【16】_Streptococcus intermedius_ was detected from abdominal abscess of our patient. _Streptococcus intermedius_ , a member of the _Streptococcus anginosus_ group, is considered to be part of the normal microbial flora of the oral cavity \\[ 8 \\], and rarely causes abdominal abscess. Aspiration of commensal oropharyngeal _Streptococcus anginosus_ can lead to pneumonia, lung abscess, and pleural empyema \\[ 9 \\- 13 \\].

In 1948, Stewart and Treves first described the development of angiosarcoma in women following radical mastectomy for breast cancer complicated by edema \\[ 1 \\]. STS is typically found in an ipsilateral upper extremity post radical mastectomy complicated by lymphedema. In this case report, our patient who had STS in the right lower extremity in the presence of obesity-associated lymphedema is atypical. The average life expectancy of cutaneous angiosarcoma is 2.5 years with most patients dying within the first 2 years from metastatic disease \\[ 2 \\]. Untreated patients, on average, live 5 - 8 months \\[ 3 \\]. These factors make early detection of STS paramount as the treatment before metastasis via wide excision tissue removal is the best option in improving outcomes.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Investigations**\n\n【6】The patient was a 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of lymphedema of the right lower extremity for the past 2 years and diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity status post right above knee amputation. The patient also had surgical re-vision of the right knee stump due to recurrent disease. Ultimately there was metastasis to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands status post radiation and chemotherapy. Other history included recent right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis treated with rivaroxaban, recent resolution of a large right-sided pneumothorax, morbid obesity for her entire recorded adult life with body mass index (BMI) of 41.6, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and no other surgical history. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from an inpatient rehabilitation facility for worsening shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and respiratory distress. A review of systems was unable to be obtained due to the patient’s mental status.\n\n【7】Of note, the patient had an extensive history of radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity and was being followed by a vascular surgeon for lymphedema for the last 10 years. She could not tolerate paclitaxel or doxorubicin due to acute hypersensitivity reaction. She was initiated on monotherapy treatment with gemcitabine approximately 4 months before the presentation and completed six rounds of treatment. The patient remained on monthly denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, for osseous metastasis. The histomorphologic features and immunohistochemistry profile of the right anterior leg soft tissue were consistent with the diagnosis of angiosarcoma with a high Ki-67 mitotic index (45%) and with cells positive for CD34, CD31, and factor VIII (pictures not shown). The positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed metastatic disease to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Whole-body positron emission tomography and computer tomography imaging were performed with multi-planar imaging without oral or intravenous contrast material, revealing metastatic disease to lymph node (right external iliac lymph node measuring 2.5 × 4.2 cm), bone (medial aspect of the left clavicle, the posterior lateral aspect of the head of the left humerus, the posterior aspect of the T2 vertebral body, and the right iliac wing), lung (there are approximately 15 solid noncalcified pulmonary nodules in each lung, ranging between 2 and 10 mm), and bilateral adrenal glands._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 86/53 mm Hg, a pulse of 132 beats/min, temperature of 36.6 °C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98% on bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) with FiO <sub>2 </sub> of 60%, and BMI of 41.6. On the physical exam, she was non-alert and lethargic. Rhonchi were auscultated over the lung fields bilaterally. There was minimal +1 left lower limb edema in contrast to the worse 3+ edema of the right lower stump with serous discharge from the surgical incision consistent with wound dehiscence. There were no signs of purulence, erythema, or cellulitis associated with the wound. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【10】**Diagnosis**\n\n【11】The complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 16.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and low hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL ( Table 1 ). Chest X-ray showed bilateral effusions, for which she underwent thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis showing groups of malignant cells with positive CD34 and partial CD31 and epithelial membrane antigen positivity supporting the diagnosis of metastatic angiosarcoma ( Figs. 2 \\- 5 ).\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Laboratory Values During Admission_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Pleural fluid, cell block, H&E stain (× 600)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Pleural fluid, cell block, immunohistochemical stain for CD34 (× 600)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Pleural fluid, cell block, immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 (× 600)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Pleural fluid, immunohistochemical for epithelial membrane antigen (× 600)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】**Treatment**\n\n【22】The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath, primarily consistent with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of underlying metastatic pulmonary disease and malignant pleural effusion. She was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was subsequently given cardizem bolus and infusion and was intubated due to persistent respiratory distress. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. She continued to require ventilation support for oxygenation.\n\n【23】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【24】The hematology-oncology service was consulted, and the patient was found to have significant progressive decompensation of underlying metastatic pulmonary disease from angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity, likely causing respiratory failure and cardiac instability. She was not a candidate for any additional therapy options for the underlying metastatic disease. The prognosis and goals of care were discussed with the patient’s family and the decision was made to transition to hospice care. The patient was made comfortable and ultimately passed away in the ICU.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】Classically, STS presents after radical mastectomy in the upper extremities but can present in other areas like the lower extremities about 10% of the time \\[ 4 \\]. The lesions are small and typically purple at onset and then develop into a nodule. Due to these lesions’ innocuous appearance, the diagnosis and treatment can be delayed \\[ 5 \\]. Approximately 90% of angiosarcomas associated with lymphedema occur following mastectomy. Lymphedema is a chronic, incurable condition. It is classified as primary lymphedema resulting from anomalous development of the lymphatic system or secondary lymphedema resulting from injury to the lymphatic vasculature \\[ 6 \\]. Distant metastasis is seen in 27-42% of patients with angiosarcoma. Metastasis occurs hematogenously, most commonly to the liver, bones, soft tissues, and lymph nodes \\[ 7 \\]. STS development in patients following radical mastectomy that survived at least 5 years is 0.07-0.45%. The mechanism to which STS occurs is unknown, but it is theorized that angiogenesis in edematous regions could lead to neoplasm as collateral circulation becomes established \\[ 8 \\]. Another theory is that chronic edema leads to localized immunodeficiency, permitting oncogenesis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【28】The incidence of chronic edema associated with obesity, called massive localized lymphedema, as seen in this patient, is trending upward with the increase in obesity in westernized societies \\[ 9 \\]. This being said, there is a logical concern for a rise in STS incidence in these populations. Obesity-associated lymphedema in the lower extremities typically occurs once a patient’s BMI reaches 50 \\[ 10 \\]. Obesity-associated lymphedema results from the proliferation and hypertrophy of adipocytes. This hypertrophy causes lymphatic fibrosis and stasis, allowing for the accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes \\[ 11 \\]. Macrophages, in particular, are known to be involved in lymphangiogenesis, producing lymphangiogenic cytokines and differentiating into lymphatic endothelial cells \\[ 12 \\]. These macrophages encircle dead adipocytes in crown-like inflammatory foci, which release inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are associated with increased risk for, and more aggressive behavior of, various malignancies in obese patients \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【29】The overall incidence of STS has decreased with the introduction of breast-conserving therapy that removes less of the lymphatic drainage structure than radical mastectomy. Due to its rarity, the exact decrease in incidence is difficult to approximate, but since the introduction of breast-conserving therapy, the incidence of chronic lymphedema after breast cancer treatment has decreased from 40% to 4% \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【30】Before starting treatment, a biopsy is required for the diagnosis of STS. On histology, angiosarcoma of STS shows a proliferation of anastomotic vascular channels that dissect collagen within the dermis. The malignant endothelial cells are commonly hyperchromatic, pleomorphic with macronuclei, and show signs of frequent mitosis. Another common feature is the presence of “hobnailing”, where the endothelial cells project into the vessel lumen \\[ 14 \\]. Staining for common endothelial cell markers such as factor VIII, anti-CD31, and anti-CD34 antibodies can be useful in identifying angiosarcoma as well, with anti-CD31 being the most sensitive and specific of the three \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【31】After biopsy and identification, the first-line treatment is wide tissue excision and removal of the mass. Standard adjuvant therapy is local radiation of the excision site or medical management with chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drugs used as the standard of care are methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, or a combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D \\[ 2 \\]. There is no significant difference in survival between chemotherapy and radiation \\[ 16 \\]. Following treatment, recurrence and metastasis are common. On initial presentation, it is thought that metastatic disease is present 16-44% of the time, and the 5-year average survival is 40% \\[ 17 \\]. Therefore, it is crucial to have a low biopsy threshold in patients with a newly developed skin lesion in a limb with chronic lymphedema due to the poor prognosis of STS and the benefits of early detection and treatment.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】STS is a rare syndrome in which angiosarcoma develops on the skin in the presence of long-standing lymphedema. Although uncommon, the danger angiosarcoma poses is significant and warrants knowledge of the disease and screening in patients with chronic edema. In addition, early detection should be seen as the best way to optimize outcomes for these patients as the prognosis for metastatic angiosarcoma is poor.\n\n【34】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【35】We acknowledge Dr. Ward Wendy MD, Pathologist at Northwestern Hospital McHenry for the help with providing histopathology slides for the case and associated detailed description.\n\n【36】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【37】None to declare.\n\n【38】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【39】None to declare.\n\n【40】**Informed Consent**\n\n【41】Informed consent has been obtained from the patient’s family.\n\n【42】**Author Contributions**\n\n【43】MC wrote the majority of the manuscript.

The value of this case presentation is that it is extremely rare for an adult with aortopulmonary window not to develop heart failure or pulmonary vasculature disease; and in this presentation we strive to explain the mechanism responsible for this positive outcome. To our best knowledge this is the oldest asymptomatic patient with aortopulmonary window reported in the medical literature.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】We report here a case of a 27-year-old male patient who was admitted to our Cardiology Clinic due to palpitations and fatigue. He reported that he was active without major complaints until the palpitations began. He possessed medical documentation of early childhood from a different medical center that described a systolic murmur as a result of ventricular septal defect (VSD), which was not treated. The size and site of VSD were not described. Patient has not been visited by cardiologist since then. He has family history of congenital heart disease, as his mother was diagnosed with atrial septal defect and has been operated recently.\n\n【7】Physical examination of the heart revealed a harsh systolic murmur VI/VI, with punctum maximum at the left sternal border, at the third intercostal space. Patient was not cyanotic, and clubbing was not present. He had a baseline saturation of 98%, and his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. Patient was 178 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Laboratory results were within reference range.\n\n【8】ECG at admission showed right ventricular outflow tract sustained ventricular tachycardia ( Fig. 1 ). Following ventricular tachycardia resolution, ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm, heart rate of 85 per minute, normal heart axis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** ECG at admission demonstrating right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an aortopulmonary septal defect type 1, visualized in both long axis and short axis parasternal views by 2D, Doppler and color-Doppler ( Fig. 2a-c ). The aortopulmonary window was 9 mm in diameter, with 7 m/s velocity across the defect and this is strongly believed to be the cause of the loud systolic murmur ( Fig. 3 ). Moderate pulmonary artery regurgitation was also detected ( Fig. 2c ). Heart chambers were not dilated and left and right ventricular function was within normal reference range. Tricuspid regurgitation was not seen, whereas pulmonary artery acceleration time was 105 ms. Pulmonary trunk diameter, measured at short axis parasternal view was 22 mm. Mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse with trivial mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation were also seen. Ventricular septal defect was not detected.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** (a) Color-Doppler at parasternal long axis view showing blood flow through the aortic window, however there is no evidence of color flow through ventricular septum.

At hospital discharge, he no longer had palpitations nor there were changes on ECG consistent with arrhythmias and he was feeling better.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】* * *\n\n【19】Aortopulmonary window, a communication between ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk in the presence of two separate semilunar valves, causes a left to right shunt which leads to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that usually evolves rapidly to pulmonary vascular disease. Surgical correction is indicated in all cases as soon as this disorder is diagnosed. If not surgically corrected, mortality is around 40% in the first year of life \\[ 2 \\]. Thus, there are limited reports in medical literature of adults with aortopulmonary window \\[ 1 , 3 \\- 6 \\]. It is exceptionally rare for heart failure or pulmonary vascular disease not to develop in an adult with aortopulmonary window, as it is the case with our patient. We believe that two factors may have contributed to our patient’s condition. Firstly, the defect size was not very large, although it is not a size to be underestimated. Secondly but more importantly, we believe that the main saviour for our patient was the moderate pulmonary artery regurgitation, as a large amount of the blood that enters the pulmonary artery trunk from aorta redirects to the right ventricle, thus not overloading the pulmonary vasculature. On the other hand, pulmonary regurgitation is well tolerated as it is a slow developing process, presenting with symptoms in 6% at 20 years of age and 20% by 40 years \\[ 7 \\]. Pulmonary regurgitation is frequently manifested with ventricular tachycardia \\[ 8 \\], which may be the reason of ventricular tachycardia in our patient. Right ventricular dilatation due to pulmonary regurgitation is believed to be responsible for rhythm disturbances. In our case right ventricle size and function were still within normal reference range; however, pulmonary regurgitation jet, redirecting to the right ventricle a considerable amount of the high velocity flow arriving from aorta, may have been hitting the right ventricular outflow tract constantly thus provoking right ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【20】VSD diagnosed in childhood in our patient may have closed spontaneously, as it is not detected currently. However, the similarity of the murmur produced by VSD and aortopulmonary window may have satisfied, at that time, the physician with the diagnosis of VSD thus failing to notice the aortopulmonary window. Aortopulmonary windows are often misdiagnosed or overlooked, although as long as this very rare malformation it is kept in mind it can be easily diagnosed by echocardiography \\[ 9 \\]. Furthermore, aortopulmonary window is known to be associated with other congenital cardiac disorders such as coarctation of aorta, tetralogy Fallot, transposition of the great arteries and so forth \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【21】Limitation of this case presentation is that cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not been performed to confirm the diagnosis, although echocardiography is a reliable tool for diagnosing aortopulmonary window.\n\n【22】**Conclusions**\n\n【23】This is an exceptional rare case of an adult with aortopulmonary window without symptoms or signs of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery regurgitation may serve as a saviour in this rare asymptomatic adult patient with aortopulmonary window, since a large amount of blood that enters the pulmonary trunk from the aorta redirects toward the right ventricle thus not overloading the pulmonary vasculature. Ventricular tachycardia may be the sole clinical presentation in an adult patient with aortopulmonary window and moderate pulmonary window.\n\n【24】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【25】We would like to thank all the medical personnel of Cardiology Clinic that were involved in diagnosing and treating this patient.\n\n【26】**Financial Support**\n\n【27】None.\n\n【28】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【29】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【30】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient’s condition did not improve significantly. Pro-calcitonin was measured and levels were normal, and workup for fungal infection was negative. She underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast that revealed extensive multifocal bilateral airspace opacities with significant hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ( Figs. 2 , 3 ). Given the lack of improvement in clinical picture, the decision was made to obtain a lung biopsy. Cultures of the biopsy were negative. Histopathology of the lung biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were elevated.

Ungprasert et al showed equal involvement for men and women with a median age at diagnosis of 42 and 48 years, respectively. Intrathoracic involvement was demonstrated in 97% of patients affected with sarcoidosis \\[ 1 \\]. Pulmonary involvement can be in forms of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, ground glass opacities, bronchial wall thickening, lung fibrosis, or nodular masses.

These nodules form as a result of coalescence of multiple granulomas to form masses up to 5 cm in size \\[ 5 \\]. In our case report, the chest CT scan revealed multiple nodules measuring up to 7.5 cm. Patients with nodular sarcoidosis can present with fever, fatigue, weight loss and chronic cough.

The patient requested crizotinib treatment, and we therefore assessed the presence of the _EML4-ALK_ fusion gene using the same FFPE tissue block. Fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) for _ALK_ rearrangements and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for _ALK_ expression were both negative, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing identified variant 1 of the _EML4-ALK_ fusion gene ( Fig. 2 ).

The presence of the _EML4-ALK_ fusion gene in lung cancer is mutually exclusive with _EGFR_ and _KRAS_ mutations \\[ 1 \\], and patients with _EGFR_ or _KRAS_ gene mutations are unlikely to also harbor the _EML4-ALK_ fusion gene.

It has been suggested that, in cases with concomitant presence of the _EML4-ALK_ fusion gene and the _KRAS_ mutation prior to crizotinib administration, the _KRAS_ mutation might serve as a driver of crizotinib resistance \\[ 4 \\], and cytotoxic chemotherapies may be more effective in such cases \\[ 4 \\]. Indeed, the current patient experienced longer progression-free survival times with chemotherapies such as S-1 and pemetrexed, compared with crizotinib. This study suggests that the detection of a single driver gene mutation is inadequate for patient selection, and comprehensive examination of driver gene mutations may be needed to allow personalized cancer treatment.\n\n【16】**Sources of Support**\n\n【17】The authors report no sources of funding for this work.\n\n【18】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【19】The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.\n\n【20】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Typically, they occur in the distal extremities but rare tumors have been reported in internal organs including the female genital tract. Glomus tumors are exceedingly rare in the ovary. They have been reported in association with a teratoma \\[ 2 \\] and arising _de novo_ \\[ 3 \\]. A microscopic glomus tumor (1mm in size) has also been reported as an incidental finding by Maeda et al \\[ 4 \\]. Thus far, these tumors have ranged in size from 1mm to 4 cm in greatest dimension \\[ 5 \\]. In this report, we described the largest ovarian glomus tumor measuring 8 cm in greatest dimension in a 42 year old female to date.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 42-year-old Chinese female presented with postcoital bleeding for several weeks to our hospital for evaluation. Abdominal and vaginal examination was unremarkable. Vaginal examination was normal and her most recent pap smear was normal. A pelvis ultrasound performed revealed a complex heterogeneous structure in the left adnexal region measuring 7.6 × 6.2 × 5.4 cm with areas of vascularity on Doppler ( Fig. 1 ). Serum ovarian tumor markers showed a mildly elevated CA125 level at 41.8 U/mL (0.0 - 35.0 U/mL) while CEA 1.6 µg/L (≤ 5.0 µg/L), beta hCG < 1.2 (IU/L) and AFP levels 2 µg/L (≤ 8µg/L) were not elevated.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Pelvis ultrasound with left adnexal mass with echogenic solid component._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Subsequently, the patient underwent a laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy which revealed an 8 cm cystic mass arising from the left ovary with an associated small left fallopian tube hydrosalpinx ( Fig. 2 ). The uterus was mildly enlarged with small fibroids and the contra lateral ovary and fallopian tube were otherwise normal.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Diagnostic laparoscopy showing left 8 cm adnexal mass._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】The retrieved specimen was sent for histology where lesional cells showed positive immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) with membrane accentuation ( Fig. 3 ). Histology of the left ovary was consistent with a glomus tumor. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed post operatively showed no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Smooth muscle actin immunohistochemical staining._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Glomus tumors rarely arise in the female genital tract and have been reported in the vulva \\[ 6 , 7 \\], clitoris \\[ 7 , 8 \\], vagina \\[ 9 , 10 \\], cervix \\[ 11 \\] and ovaries \\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]. Most tumors were incidental findings after hysterectomy for benign gynecological disease. Of four reported cases, three were incidental findings in patients who presented with cervical cancer, pelvic mass or co-existing endometrial cancer \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]. The fourth was initially thought to be a granulosa cell tumor \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【16】Rarely do deep and large glomus tumors present with abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding unlike our case. Previous glomus tumors reported have ranged from 1mm to 4 cm in size. To our knowledge, our case is hitherto the largest reported glomus cell tumor of the ovary measuring 8 cm to date.\n\n【17】Surgical resection remains the treatment in choice described in other viscera and diagnosed by histopathology \\[ 12 , 13 \\].The top differential diagnoses in this case based on hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained slides included cell surface epithelial carcinoma, sex-cord stromal tumor, neuroendocrine tumor, hepatoid carcinoma or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Immunohistochemical staining using various markers such as pan-Cytokeratins alpha-inhibin, calretinin, synaptophysin, chromogranin, alpha fetoprotein, and c-Kit can be used to aid in the diagnosis.\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of ovarian glomus tumor remains unclear .The ovarian tumor was composed of epithelioid cells with a vague nested architecture which showed positive smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunohistochemical staining that was consistent with a glomus tumor, an extremely rare mesenchymal neoplasm arising in the ovary. On the contrary, the tumor was negative for pan-Cytokeratins AE 1/3 ruling out surface epithelial carcinoma while alpha-inhibin and calretinin were both negative ruling out a sex-cord stromal origin. Synaptophysin and chromogranin were negative for a well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and c-Kit staining were negative for hepatoid carcinoma and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor respectively.\n\n【19】Glomus tumors have been proposed to be classified into malignant, symplastic, glomangiomatosis or uncertain malignant potential which can aid in the diagnosis of rare neoplasms \\[ 14 \\]. Clinical and pathological features of tumors include size, location, presence of mitotic figures and nuclear atypia. Malignant glomus tumors fulfill the criteria which include size greater than 2 cm, or atypical mitotic figures or deep location or high nuclear grade \\[ 14 \\]. However this classification was described in glomus tumors of other organs except the female genital tract due to its rarity.\n\n【20】In our case, no atypical mitotic figures or marked nuclear atypia was discerned which would justify a diagnosis of a malignant glomus tumor. However, in view of the large size of the lesion, we feel that the tumor has uncertain malignant potential that would require close surveillance with repeat imaging. Our patient had subsequent baseline postoperative CT scan which did not show any evidence of residual disease or metastasis. She is currently on close gynecological follow-up in our hospital 1 year later disease free.\n\n【21】In conclusion, a large glomus tumor of the ovary with typical immunohistochemical findings which although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian lesions and followed up for its uncertain malignant potential.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These children can often prove very challenging for emergency physicians, as although the majority of these events are benign, there is always the possibility that these events are the sole sign of a significant vascular, cardiac or metabolic pathology. This case presentation highlights the difficulties and the serious consequences that surround managing paediatric syncope in the ED.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 7-year old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) following cardiac arrest. He had collapsed at school and was seen to have seizure like activity. He rapidly developed cardiorespiratory arrest. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced immediately by school staff. Resuscitative effort continued with the arrival of paramedics when he was noted to have pulseless electrical activity. When the patient arrived in the emergency department he continued to have pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitative efforts continued for 45 minutes unsuccessfully.\n\n【6】On review of the boys history he had previously attended the ED aged 4 after vomiting and collapsing at a friend’s birthday party. The episode lasted approximately 180 seconds. No seizure like activity or post-ictal period was reported. Physical examination on that occasion including neurological and CVS were normal, as was the child’s ECG. A diagnosis of vaso-vagal syncope secondary to vomiting was made.\n\n【7】The patient was subsequently followed up an outpatient by his paediatrician. He had complained of further episodes of breathlessness and tachycardia during exertion, associated with seizure like activity. The patient had been referred for further investigation to a paediatric cardiologist but was found to have no significant abnormalities noted on further ECGs and echocardiography with the exception of minor mitral regurgitation. He had also seen by a paediatric neurologist who could find no evidence of a seizure disorder.\n\n【8】**Post mortem examination**\n\n【9】The coroner performed an autopsy which demonstrated a number of anomalies; the patient's coronary sinus gave rise to only a single right coronary artery from which the left coronary artery branched. The proximal left coronary artery showed a stenotic thick walled vessel with a small narrow lumen, which did not continue distally. Microscopically the thickening of the vessel walled was due to fibrointimal hyperplasia. The left ventricular myocardium showed foci of ischemic fibrosis, likely representing past micro-infarcts. The coroner concluded that death was likely to due to arrhythmia triggered by an additional ischaemic event.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】Paediatric syncope is extremely common and most have benign aetiology \\[ 1 \\]. Sinister aetiology is mostly cardiac in origin and these are in the form of structural or cardiac rhythm abnormalities.\n\n【13】Coronary artery of abnormal aortic origin occurs in 0.64% of births. Most of these children and adolescents are asymptomatic \\[ 2 \\]. However, syncope and sudden death may be the presenting symptoms. The most common abnormality is the left circumflex originating from the right sinus of Valsalva. Physical examination and diagnostic studies are usually unrevealing in the absence of myocardial infarction or symptoms of ongoing ischaemia \\[ 3 \\]. If coronary artery anomaly is suspected, echocardiography may establish the diagnosis \\[ 4 \\]. CT angiography is the historical gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery abnormality \\[ 5 \\]. Non-invasive coronary magnetic resonance angiography may also be used.\n\n【14】Our patient had a rare and serious cause of paediatric syncope which was not detected until after death. It illustrates the difficulties that exist when trying to determine whether a serious aetiology underlies the presentation of paediatric syncope not just to the ED, but to paediatric specialist services.\n\n【15】**Bottom line**\n\n【16】A high index of suspicion for a cardiac cause must be present when evaluating any patient presenting with the following symptoms; syncope due to fright or emotional stress, exercise induced syncope, syncope while in the supine position or a family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmia.\n\n【17】With repeated presentation, deliberate investigation to rule out rare causes of syncope should be undertaken.\n\n【18】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The nonspecific presentation and a lack of suspicion among clinicians often delay the diagnosis of PHI.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】In June 2009, a 25-year-old white male presented to the emergency department of the Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with 4 days of headache, fever and vomiting. He also complained of malaise for 10 days. The patient had taken two days before admission levofloxacin under medical supervision, without improvement. He denied cough, diarrhea or rash. On the morning of presentation, he had presented one episode of vomiting blood. The patient had no significant medical history, including sexually transmitted diseases, and denied tobacco or intravenous drug abuse. He had no drug allergies and reported social drinking. The patient was sexually active with men (MSM), and experienced unprotect contact with multiple partners. He also reported business trip to the Caribbean three weeks before the onset of symptoms. Currently living in Sao Paulo and works as a dancer.\n\n【6】On examination, he was afebrile with a temperature of 36.2 °C, the weight was 59 kg, heart rate of 78 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, blood pressure of 120/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% in room air. The most significant findings on physical examination included conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema and palpable lymph nodes, about 1 cm in diameter, in submandibular region bilaterally. There was also diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation without peritoneal signs. No rash was present. No other abnormalities were observed at the physical examination.\n\n【7】Admission labs were significant for a platelet count of 64 ×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, otherwise normal, with a hemoglobin level of 15.7 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 5.2 ×10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/µL (neutrophils were 70%). Coagulation parameters revealed international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.18 and partial thromboplastim time (PTT) of 54.9 sec (normal range 25 - 37 sec). C-reactive protein was 2.6 mg/dL (normal range < 0.5 mg/dL).\n\n【8】Biochemical tests revealed the following: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 4,410 U/L (normal range < 37 U/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 4,450 U/L (normal range < 41 U/L); lactic dehydrogenase was 2,406 U/L (normal range 240 - 480 U/L); alkaline phosphatase was 182 U/L (normal range 40-129 U/L); gamma glutamyil transferase was 386 U/L (normal range 10 - 66 U/L); and total bilirubin was 1.43 mg/dL (normal range 0.20 -1.00 mg/dL).\n\n【9】Several serologic studies were performed to rule out infectious diseases from different etiologies. Quick test for dengue was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) for leptospirosis was negative. Acute hepatitis markers, including immunoglobulin M to hepatitis A virus (HAV-IgM), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgM and immunoglobulin M to cytomegalovirus (CMV-IgM) were also all negative. The patient’s epidemiological history suggested that he might have acquired the HIV infection recently. As part of an acute HIV infection study, our patient performed several HIV-1 screening tests with an interval of 1 week (one rapid test and two HIV enzyme immunoassay-EIA) with negative results, a negative HIV-1 Western blot analysis, and an indeterminate indirect immunofluorescence test. Primary infection was confirmed 8 days later from admission by a very high viremia (> 500,000 copies /mL HIV-1 RNA tested by b-DNA), which suggest that this patient was in the process of HIV seroconversion. Subsequently, a CD4 cell count was found to be 347 cells/µL and CD8 cell count was 2,165 cells/µL. The patient underwent endoscopy due to vomiting blood, which revealed esophageal candidiasis, which was treated with fluconazole 200 mg/day. A genotyping test for potential antiretroviral drug resistance mutations was conducted at this time using the Trugene HIV-1 assay, and showed a subtype B virus with the presence of polymorphisms in the protease region (L10I, I62V, L63P, A71T, V77I) and a principal RT mutation (K103N). While awaiting the results of resistance testing and after discussion with the patient about benefits (and disadvantages) of early antiretroviral treatment (ART), we initiated treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz on July 9, 2009. About a week later the patient was discharged from hospital, with progressive and rapid improvement of liver function: levels of ALT were 315 U/L and AST was 105 U/L. Adjustment was made to this initial regimen once resistance results were available (switch for IP/r). On follow-up six months later, patient’s clinical and laboratorial condition progressively improved, with his viral load decreasing to less than 50 copies/mL and his CD4 count increased to 953 cells/µL.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】PHI is a critical phase of infection when irreparable damage to the immune system occurs and individuals are highly infectious \\[ 3 \\]. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection are often not recognized. It has been previously published that 21% of patients with PHI presented abnormal liver function tests \\[ 1 , 4 \\].\n\n【13】We described the case of a young man who had sex with men and presented acute hepatitis in the setting of confirmed acute HIV infection. The most common infectious causes of hepatitis were negative: hepatitis A, B, C, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. There are reports describing the association between elevated aminotransferases and PHI. However, there was previously only one retrospective case report of acute hepatitis associated with acute HIV infection \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【14】It has been clearly established that individuals with PHI have an increase in activated CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, which could result in a state of immune activation as seen in this patient. Clonal expansions of T cells have been reported in the early phase of HIV infection \\[ 6 \\], and can be attributed to massive response of the patient’s immune system against the virus. On the other hand, acute HIV infection can occasionally result in a rapid and extensive loss of intestinal mucosal CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells associated with the increase of cytotoxic CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells. Treatment of the patient’s recently infected is controversial and still under discussion, particularly with regard to long-term benefits of ART. Clinicians must be aware that opportinistic infections can occur during this early phase of infection, and early ART has benefits for both public health reasons (reducing the transmission of the virus) and for individual reasons (improving prognosis by slowing the rate of disease progression). This case also raises questions about whether acute HIV infection can be considered as a possible etiology of hepatitis in patient with HIV risk factors. In these cases, HIV viral load should be performed in addition to HIV antibody testing.\n\n【15】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【16】The authors thank the residents of the outpatient clinic of the Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas.\n\n【17】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【18】All authors report no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【19】**Grant Support**\n\n【20】No financial support was received for this research.\n\n【21】**Ethical Approval**\n\n【22】This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n【23】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The most common sites of EMP are the head, neck, lymph nodes and skin, but it can also be found at various other sites such as bone, nasal cavities, oral cavity, breast, soft tissue, testis and thyroid \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\- 8 \\]. This is a rare plasma cell neoplasm, constituting approximately 3-6% of all plasma cell neoplasms \\[ 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 \\- 12 \\].\n\n【3】EMPs are rare tumors and can be mistaken for lymphomas or carcinomas depending on the location \\[ 2 , 13 \\]. This malady affects most patients in the sixth decade of life. These are typically discovered when they cause compressive symptoms such as dysphagia \\[ 12 \\]. Very few reports about EMP of the mediastinum are available in the literature. These disorders represent a spectrum of tumor aggressiveness, from the rather indolent primary extramedullary plasmacytoma to rapidly progressive multiple myeloma \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【4】Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a simple, rapid and inexpensive procedure widely used in the assessment of a variety of lesions involving the breast, lymph nodes, thyroid, salivary glands, and skin with a high sensitivity and specificity \\[ 14 \\]. However, there is a dearth of information concerning the use of FNA in the diagnosis of extra-nodal and extramedullary hematopoietic malignancies \\[ 14 \\]. Here, we discuss the case of our patient who was diagnosed with extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the posterior mediastinum by FNA. Through this case report we attempt to highlight the utility of FNA in extramedullary hematopoietic neoplasms.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】A 55-year-old male patient with a previous history of cardiac catheterization, hypertension, and vitamin D deficiency was admitted to the University Hospital Emergency Department for chest pain. Imaging ( Fig.1 ) for possible pulmonary embolism demonstrated right apical and medial lung mass extending just posterior to the trachea with invasion and destruction of the anterolateral T3 vertebral body. Multiple smaller hypodensities were also noted in the thoracic vertebral bodies, ribs, and sternum. Multiple lytic lesions were present along the spine ( Fig. 2 ). The differential diagnosis at the time was multiple myeloma versus metastatic disease versus posterior mediastinal tumors of ganglioma, neuroma, and lymphoma.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** A large mediastinal mass with multiple hypodensities._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Multiple lytic bone lesions along the spine._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】Other investigations included IgG serum, total protein-electrophoresis, alpha-1, alpha-2, IFE beta, IFE gamma, and serum immunoglobulin A levels which were all within normal limits. Serum immunoglobulin M was low. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), lactate dehydrogenase LDH, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were all negative. The patient likewise had negative antibodies for Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Aspergillus, or Coccidoides. Since the above serum markers had failed to provide a definitive diagnosis, the patient underwent biopsy with endoscopic ultrasound. It was determined that the mediastinal mass and adjacent lymph nodes, rather than the bony lesions, would be easier to biopsy. The mass and lymph node were sampled in the usual manner. The aspirated lymph node sample was negative for malignancy.\n\n【12】Approval was obtained from the institutional IRB at the University of Missouri Hospitals and Clinics, Columbia, Missouri. Fine needle aspiration was prepared by standard methods of thin preps and cell blocks. Immunostaining was performed following the standard protocol on a Dako Immunostainer (Dako, Carpinteria CA). Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed on a FacsCanto II flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using in-house 8-color protocols. The sample was tested against the following antibodies: CD15, CD34, CD33, CD13, CD11B, HLADR, CD16, CD45, Kappa, Lambda, CD5, CD19, CD23, CD20, CD10, CD4, CD8, CD2, CD56, CD3, CD7, cKappa, cLambda, CD38, and CD138.\n\n| **Results** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】IgG serum, total protein electrophoresis, alpha-1; alpha-2, IFE beta, IFE gamma, and serum immunoglobulin A were all within normal limits.

However, it was not until 1873 that Rustizky et al successfully recognized this condition as a distinct histopathologic entity: multiple myeloma \\[ 11 \\]. The first report of EMP was published in 1905. Since then 869 cases of EMPs have been described in the literature. However, only a few cases of EMP diagnosed by FNA have been reported \\[ 1 , 7 \\]. Majority of the EMPs, over 80% were located in the aerodigestive tract \\[ 3 , 7 , 10 \\]. Pulmonary or pleural EMPs were only seen in 12 of those cases \\[ 7 , 10 \\]. EMP arising in the posterior mediastinum is an extremely rare event and very few case reports are available in the literature \\[ 3 , 11 \\]. There are other case reports of EMP arising in the tonsils, larynx, trachea, thyroid and breast, liver and gall bladder ( Table 1 , \\[ 1 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 \\]).\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Locations of Extramedullary Plasmacytomas Diagnosed by FNAs_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【28】After the diagnosis of EMP, the patient underwent a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure which confirmed the presence of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and a diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasm consistent with multiple myeloma was made. While the prognosis of EMP is excellent, multiple myeloma carries a grim prognosis. However, even if the prognosis of EMP is relatively favorable, a local recurrence or a progression to multiple myeloma has been described in up to 20% of the cases \\[ 5 , 8 \\].\n\n【29】There is often a lack of distinguishing clinical and radiological features of EMP. Thus the final impression is based on a pathological diagnosis. Usually plasma cell neoplasms demonstrate neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells in varying stages of maturation \\[ 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]. They also demonstrate light chain restriction which can be kappa or lambda. In the case of our patient there was kappa light chain restriction. In addition, EMP should be differentiated from other types of lymphoma (marginal zone, immunoblastic and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma) \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【30】The success of a FNA diagnosis is dependent on an adequate yield of material for evaluation that is usually provided by the clinician or radiologist. It also involves a multidisciplinary approach including collaboration and communication between pathologists to reach a consensus diagnosis that is firmly supported by diagnostic information. This approach requires understanding of the limitations of immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, and understanding of the differential diagnosis of lymphoma. The ancillary studies including molecular studies may further improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of FNA when needed \\[ 14 \\]. The correct diagnosis can be made by FNA expeditiously, and staging procedures and treatment modalities can be instituted right away \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【31】**Conclusions**\n\n【32】EMPs are very rare entities. These neoplasms are seldom diagnosed by FNAs. All the more, the location of EMP in posterior mediastinum makes it a rather unique case as very few case reports of EMPs arising in posterior mediastinum exist. However, FNA diagnosis of hematopoietic neoplasms is of value not only for the initial diagnosis, but also for the staging of the disease, documentation of recurrence, and identification of tumor transformation \\[ 14 \\]. We believe, diagnosis of a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma by FNA is exceptionally rare and this report could well be the first of its kind.\n\n【33】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【34】We would like to thank the cytotechnologists in the Department of Cytopathology at University of Missouri School of Medicine.\n\n【35】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【36】The authors have no conflict of interest related to this manuscript or in its publication.\n\n【37】**Financial Disclosures**\n\n【38】There are no financial disclosures to be made by any of the authors.\n\n【39】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We hope this case report will aid clinicians in the management for such a patient.\n\n| **Case report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 73-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining of rapidly growing mass in the anterior neck and progressive dyspnea of one month duration. He had no systemic symptoms, including fever, night sweats and weight loss. He had a 6-year history of hypothyroidism-associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and maintained L-thyroxine replacement. On physical examination, a large mass was evident in the anterior neck ( Fig.1 ). On palpation, it was an elastic hard, immobile, and nontender mass and the exact border was ill-defined. No superficial lymph node was palpable. The respiratory sound slightly decreased with prolonged expiration bilaterally. On the laboratory, a leucocyte count of 6.1 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelet count 26.4 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL, lactate dehydrogenase 289 IU/L (110 - 220), soluble IL-2 receptor 2040 U/mL (145 - 519). The thyroid function was as followed: thyroid-stimulating hormone 11.0 mIU/L (0.46 - 3.7), free T <sub>3 </sub> 2.15 pg/mL (1.45 - 3.48), free T <sub>4 </sub> 1.51 ng/mL (0.71 - 1.85). CT scan with enhancement revealed a large cervical mass arising from thyroid which completely encircled the narrowed trachea ( Fig. 2A, B ). He was immediately referred to the department of endocrine surgery and under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, an incisional biopsy was performed for combined pathology and immunohistochemistry, that led to the diagnosis of DLBCL, with a positive immunostaining for CD10, CD20, bcl-6, but negative for MUM-1. The initial staging work-up including CT of the chest and abdomen and a bone marrow examination classified the patient as stage IIE based on the Ann Arbor staging classification \\[ 5 \\] A combined chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone plus rituximab (R-CHOP) was initiated, which dramatically shrunk the tumor ( Fig. 3 ) and completely resolved the compression symptoms within a few days. After three courses of R-CHOP regimen followed by involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT), the patient is doing well with no recurrence.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** A large mass was evident in the anterior neck._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** CT scan of the neck with enhancement revealed a large cervical mass arising from thyroid which completely encircled the narrowed trachea (A: coronal section; B: transverse section)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** CT scan of the neck 3 weeks after the initiation of combination chemotherapy revealed the mass dramatically decreased in size._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】**The association between chronic inflammatory diseases and lymphoid malignancy**\n\n【14】Certain chronic diseases are associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy. Sjogren’s syndrome (SS) has known for an established predisposing factor of the development of lymphoid malignancy. According to retrospective cohort studies, 9% of patients with primary SS developed malignant lymphoma \\[ 6 \\] and about 40 times higher than that of the general population \\[ 7 \\]. In rheumatologic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in patients with aggressive disease, is also at increased risk of developing lymphoid malignancy \\[ 8 \\]. In addition to rheumatologic diseases, pyothorax-associated lymphoma can develop in patients with chronic pyothorax due to lung tuberculosis or tuberculous pleuritis \\[ 9 \\] and _helicobacter pylori_ infection is implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) gastric lymphoma \\[ 10 \\]. Characteristically, lymphomas associated with these chronic inflammatory conditions are predominantly B-cell origin.\n\n【15】**Epidemiology of primary thyroid lymphoma**\n\n【16】Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is a heterogeneous disease, but the almost all cases of PTL are NHL with B-cell origin \\[ 4 \\]. DLBCL and extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of MALT lymphoma and coexisting both diseases are the common histologic subtypes \\[ 4 , 11 \\]. Other less common histologic subtypes include follicular lymphoma \\[ 4 , 11 \\], Hodgkin lymphoma \\[ 4 , 11 \\], small lymphocytic lymphoma \\[ 11 \\], T-cell lymphoma \\[ 11 \\]. There is a 4 to 1 female predominance \\[ 11 \\] and the median age at diagnosis is around 60 year-old \\[ 4 , 11 \\].\n\n【17】**The possible pathogenetic mechanism of developing PTL**\n\n【18】The normal thyroid gland originally has no native lymphoid tissue. Thus, PTL is considered to arise from intrathyroid lymphoid tissue acquired during the course of chronic inflammation or an autoimmune process \\[ 11 \\]. Pre-existing HT is known for a significant predisposing factor for PTL with an estimated relative risk of 67 \\[ 12 \\]. Up to one-half of PTL patients have a clinical history HT, and an even more patients had pathologically diagnosed with HT \\[ 11 \\]. PTL usually develops after a long period of HT evolution as long as 20 - 30 years \\[ 13 \\]. It has been postulated that in HT, lymphomatous change susceptible to neoplastic transformation may be due to chronic antigenic stimulation and proliferation of lymphoid tissue \\[ 14 \\]. Recent report supports this theory by showing sequence similarity in immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement between the clonal bands of HT and that of subsequently developed PTL \\[ 15 \\]. In addition, aberrant somatic hypermutation, previously attributed to the development of multiple proto-oncogenesis in other types of DLBCL, may constitute a pathogenetic mechanism of developing PTL by representing an early step in the process of B-cell clonal transformation in patients with HT \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【19】**Diagnostic procedure of PTL**\n\n【20】PTL presents with rapidly growing mass, which can be lethal due to progressive symptoms of tracheal, laryngeal or esophageal compression \\[ 17 \\]. Thus, early diagnosis is essential to save the patients. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of thyroid mass and can be the first test to diagnose PTL as it is less invasive. But, FNA accurately diagnosed PTL in only 60% of patients due to histopathological similarities between PLT and HT \\[ 11 \\]. Thus, confirmatory procedures such as incisional biopsy are highly recommended to obtain sufficient material.\n\n【21】**The therapeutic options of PTL**\n\n【22】Appropriate treatment for PTL depends on histologic subtype or extent of disease. The therapeutic approach for patients with PTL has been revised over the last a few decades. Conservative treatment mainly with combination chemotherapy has replaced thyroidectomy as mainstay of therapy because effective chemotherapeutic regimens have been introduced. Nowadays, surgery is usually utilized to obtain sufficient tissue for diagnosis, not for radical therapy. For DLBCL of the thyroid, basically, treatment should be the same as DLBCL of any other site or extent. In limited DLBCL, three cycles of CHOP plus IFRT had been considered as standard treatment \\[ 18 \\]. Recently, R-CHOP chemotherapy is the gold standard for this type of lymphoma. The addition of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the membrane antigen CD-20 found on pre-B and matured B lymphocytes, led to significant improvement in event-free and overall survival (OS) when compared with CHOP alone \\[ 19 \\]. Even in patients with severe airway compromise, the tumor can be expected to shrink, which provides symptomatic relief, briefly after initiation of combination chemotherapy \\[ 20 \\]. In limited DLBCL, there are no large randomized trials of R-CHOP plus radiation therapy, while, in phase II study of limited DLBCL, three cycles of R-CHOP plus IFRT led to better outcome of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS at 2 and 4 years when compared with three cycles of CHOP plus IFRT \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【23】**Our comments of the present case**\n\n【24】The prognosis of patients with DLBCL has been estimated using the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (age > 60, stage III/IV disease, elevated LDH level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥ 2, more than one extranodal site of disease) \\[ 22 \\]. As the present case had an IPI score of 2, he was assigned into ‘low-intermediate’ group, indicating his 4-year OS of 81% with R-CHOP therapy \\[ 23 \\]. According to revised IPI (R-IPI) which is on the basis of the same parameters but grouped differently as conventional IPI, the present case was assigned into ‘good’ group, indicating his 4-year OS of 79% with R-CHOP therapy \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【25】Recently, immunohistochemical expression of CD10, bcl-6, or MUM1 could classify DLBCL into prognostically significant subgroup with germinal center B-cell(GCB) and non-GCB, and 5-year OS with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen are 92% in GCB, and 44% in non-GCB, respectively \\[ 24 \\]. In this patient, CD10 and bcl-6, both are GCB markers, were positive results predictive of better OS.\n\n【26】Through our experience obtained from the present case, it should be emphasized that PTL is entirely different from follicular epithelial-derived thyroid malignancy in disease management, and if PTL is clinically suspected, an incisional biopsy of the thyroid grand is highly recommended because combined pathology and immunohistochemistry can aid in confirmation of histopathology or histologic subtypes, making therapeutic planning, and predicting prognosis of the patients.\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】In patients with rapidly growing thyroid causing progressive compression symptoms, PTL with B-cell origin should be highly suspected. HT is a significant predisposing factor for PTL. An incisional biopsy of the thyroid grand is highly recommended for combined pathology and immunohistochemistry, which can aid in confirmation of histopathology or histologic subtypes, making therapeutic planning, and predicting prognosis of the patients. In DLBCL of the thyroid, basically, treatment is the same manner as DLBCL of any other site or extent. R-CHOP chemotherapy is a therapeutic mainstay and can dramatically shrink the tumor and briefly resolve the compression symptoms.\n\n【29】**Grant Support**\n\n【30】None.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is favored because the procedure is performed quickly and easily. PEG is generally associated with infrequent mortality and morbidity as compared to conventional operative gastrostomy \\[ 1 \\]. We present a rare case of internal gastrostomy tube migration leading to gastric outlet obstruction which was successfully managed endoscopically.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 72-year-old female with past medical history of congenital ataxia and intellectual disability with persistent oropharyngeal dysphagia and PEG placement for nutritional support for the last two decades presented to the emergency room with complaints of a misplaced feeding tube. Over the last 3 weeks, the patient would get agitated and would pull the PEG tube out which led to multiple bedside and/or endoscopic PEG replacements. Thereafter, the 28 Fr PEG tube was changed to a Mickey. It is shorter in length, and thus less prone to dislodgement. Specifically, a 24 Fr Mickey was selected as it is the largest diameter Mickey available.\n\n【6】After 28 days of Mickey placement without any issues, the patient presented again to our emergency room with misplaced Mickey tube. On physical examination, the extension tubing was observed coming out of the gastro-cutaneous fistula tract. The diagnosis of internal tube migration into the stomach was considered as the Mickey tube along with the external bumper was not visualized. The abdominal X-ray performed revealed that the contrast filled Mickey balloon was noticed in the stomach ( Fig. 1 ). At bedside, an attempt was made to pull the Mickey through the formed fistula tract, but the effort was unsuccessful. Thus, a decision was made to undergo a concomitant esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed that the Mickey tube had migrated entirely into the stomach with the inflated Mickey balloon obstructing the pylorus ( Fig. 2 ). The balloon was then successfully deflated with an endoscopic injection needle ( Fig. 3 ). The extension tubing on the external surface of the body was then cut, and the Mickey tube was removed completely with the use of an endosnare without any complications through the oral cavity. Subsequently, a new 28 Fr PEG tube was placed and secured in appropriate fashion.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Contrast filled balloon in the stomach._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Balloon obstructing the pyloric channel._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Deflated balloon prior to removal._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】PEG placement is a well-established technique for administering long-term enteral nutrition. Gastric outlet obstruction is a rare complication of gastrostomy tube placement caused by migration of the tube into pyloric channel or duodenal bulb \\[ 2 \\- 5 \\].\n\n【15】Internal tube migration presents with obstructive symptoms of nausea, vomiting and crampy abdominal pain \\[ 4 \\]. The absence of external bolster (such as in Foley Catheter) and placement of gastrostomy tube in pylorus are risk factors leading to gastric outlet obstruction. An abdominal X-ray or endoscopy usually confirms the diagnosis. It is extremely important to recognize the possibility of tube migration in appropriate clinical settings as delay in recognition may lead to necrosis or ulceration of the tissue. Careful retraction of the tube through the fistula tract, or endoscopic extraction, would solve the problem in majority of the cases.\n\n【16】In summary, if a patient with ballooned feeding tube develops obstructive intestinal symptoms, internal migration should be considered. Early recognition aids in prevention of morbidity in terms of small bowel obstruction, ulceration and avoids surgical intervention.\n\n【17】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

When polyarthritis is also present, this represents a rare disease known as pancreatitis panniculitis polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome. Due to the absence of abdominal symptoms in most cases of PPP syndrome, a delay in diagnosis is not unusual \\[ 1 \\]. Alcoholism is one of the most common causes of chronic pancreatitis, and alcoholics often present with gouty arthritis. PPP syndrome in these patients may therefore be misdiagnosed. We report a case of arthritis being initially treated as gouty arthritis before the correct diagnosis of PPP syndrome was established.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse for at least 20 years, chronic pancreatitis with many acute episodes over 5 years, and gouty arthritis, presented with pain, swelling, and erythema involving the right thumb, right 4th metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and left heel ( Fig. 1 ) for 1 week.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Swelling and erythema of the left heel with pus formation._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were administered initially for presumed gouty arthritis; unfortunately, the symptoms progressed. The right knee, right heel, and left 3rd and 5th MTP joints became painful, swollen, and erythematous. The right knee joint was aspirated, and examination of the synovial fluid was positive for monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were continued; however, purulent fluid developed over the right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel, and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Aspiration was performed from left heel, followed by administration of oxacillin 2,000 mg IV every 6 hours. The fluid culture grew _Escherichia coli_ , so the antibiotics were changed to gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and cefazolin 1 g IV every 8 hours; methylprednisolone was tapered to 40 mg IV once a day. However, the patient developed a fever, and purulent fluid continued to accumulate in bilateral knees, right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Arthrocentesis was again performed from right knee, and synovial fluid examination this time failed to show MSU or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The synovial fluid culture was negative. Due to an elevated white blood cell count (WBC 22,500/µL) with a left shift (neutrophils 90.1%) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 15.4 mg/dL, cefazolin was changed to ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g IV every 6 hours. Methylprednisolone was tapered and switched to oral prednisolone 5 mg twice a day. Gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day were continued. Fever persisted, and new erythematous nodules formed on the thighs and upper arms bilaterally ( Fig. 2 ). A skin biopsy was then performed. While awaiting the pathology report, the antibiotics were changed to cefpirome, and prednisolone and colchicine were continued. The right thumb required debridement due to the persistence of purulent fluid, and vancomycin was prescribed. The skin biopsy pathology report showed fat necrosis as well as ghost cells, which suggested pancreatic panniculitis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Erythematous nodules over the posterior thighs bilaterally._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】After the pathology report, serum amylase and lipase levels were 4,840 U/L and 7,200 U/L, respectively. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan identified edema involving the pancreas with peripancreatic fat infiltrations. Interestingly, the patient denied abdominal pain throughout the entire hospitalization. The amylase and lipase continued to increase (7,520 U/L and 12,200 U/L, respectively). A third arthrocentesis was performed on the right knee. Synovial fluid showed amylase 1,970 U/L, lipase 1,260 U/L, cholesterol 79 mg/dL, and triglycerides 78 mg/dL. A Sudan stain performed on aspirate from the left heel lesion was negative. All antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient received nothing by mouth for 48 hours. He was then started on a low-fat diet; however, the serum amylase and lipase remained significantly elevated (13,180 U/L and 21,900 U/L, respectively). The erythematous nodules over the thighs and upper arms subsided gradually, and the purulent fluid accumulated over the dorsum of the feet also decreased. The patient was discharged on December 21, 2009.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】Many cases of PPP syndrome have been reported. Although there are some patients with panniculitis and elevated serum lipase levels without pancreatic disease \\[ 1 \\], most patients with PPP syndrome have acute or chronic pancreatitis \\[ 2 \\], and some have pancreatic tumors or ischemic disease \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The patient discussed in the case report had a history of chronic pancreatitis with many acute flare-ups over a 5-year period.\n\n【14】The typical patient with PPP syndrome is a middle-aged male with heavy alcohol use. Approximately two-thirds of patients present either without abdominal symptoms or with only mild symptoms, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and a poorer prognosis \\[ 3 \\]. Our 49-year-old male patient with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol use matches the aforementioned criteria for PPP syndrome. The lack of abdominal symptoms combined with his history of gouty arthritis and presence of MSU crystals in his right knee synovial fluid led to an initial diagnosis of gouty arthritis. Without the presence of erythematous nodules in the first few days after admission, pancreatic polyarthritis was not included in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【15】A symmetric or an asymmetric polyarthritis that includes both the small and large joints is typical for PPP syndrome; however, a few cases of oligoarthritis or monoarthritis have also been reported \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Although there is no case report of coexisting gouty arthritis, septic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis with PPP syndrome, these diseases should all be considered in the differential diagnosis because their initial presentations may be similar.\n\n【16】Elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes can induce fat necrosis in the joint and adjacent periarticular tissues and lead to arthritis \\[ 6 \\]. Thick creamy synovial fluid with a high viscosity is typical for PPP syndrome ( Fig. 3 ). Microscopic examination can reveal birefringent crystal-like structures, which are due to the presence of lipid crystals \\[ 7 \\]. We identified elevated pancreatic enzyme levels in synovial fluid aspirated from the knee joint and checked the cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well. However, the Sudan stain of the aspirate was negative, and microscopic examination failed to reveal evidence of lipid crystals.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Right knee synovial fluid._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】The serum pancreatic enzyme level does not always correlate with the severity of the arthritis, but it does correlate with the progression of the fat necrosis \\[ 3 \\]. However, in our case, the serum amylase and lipase levels increased gradually after PPP syndrome was diagnosed, and the arthritis and erythematous nodules slowly improved. Based on this case, amylase and lipase may not be suitable markers for the progression or improvement of PPP syndrome.\n\n【19】There is currently no case report with PPP syndrome coexistent with gouty arthritis, in both multiple joint involved, and we reported the case to illustrate the difficulty associated with establishing the correct diagnosis prior to the appearance of erythematous nodules. Physicians should consider PPP syndrome in a patient with polyarthritis and a history of pancreatitis.\n\n【20】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This variability has formed the base for many medical literatures. Although the PL muscle of little functional importance, it assumes great surgical importance since it is the first option in tendon graft procedures, for it is readily detected in vitro and easy surgical accessibility as well, which make harvesting its tendon much easier than its counterpart, the Plantaris muscle in the leg \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The awareness of PL absence and the anomalous presentation is highly warranted. Reimann et al examined 1,600 extremities and found incidence rate of other anomalies apart from absence was 9% \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore concomitant anomalies in the soft tissue of the upper limb which share same embryonic origin (mesoderm) have been recorded as well \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]; these include nerves, arteries and other muscles.

Two asymptomatic cases were incidentally found during in vitro clinical examination by Schaeffer’s test ( Fig. 1 ), while Thompson’s and Mishra’s test failed to demonstrate the anomalous tendon. The morphologic feature of the anomalous tendon was V-shape bifid distal part of PL tendon. Both slips run superficially crossing the wrist creases to be inserted into the palm onto palmer aponeurosis, the central tendoneus slip runs towards a groove created by the two eminences, in the mid-palm while the other lateral slip was radial directed towards the thenar eminence. This bifidity of the PL tendon was confirmed by wrist ultrasonography.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Anomalous V-shaped PL identified in Schaeffer’s and not in Thompson’s or Mishra’s._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Palmaris Longus is often described as one of the most variable muscles in the human body and is classified as a phylogenetically retrogressive muscle, in other words, a short belly with a long tendon \\[ 9 \\].

It’s the first option in tendon grafts procedure of the long flexors, extensor tendons of the fingers, flexor pollicis longus tendon and extensor tendon defects as well.

It is also utilized as a simple static support in the treatment of facial paralysis, and some surgeon utilize the tendon in digital pulley reconstruction \\[ 21 \\], lip augmentation, and in various nerve palsies.\n\n【14】This unique V-shape arrangement of PL tendon makes it a potential source to provide V-shape splint in selected reconstructive procedures, oral and lid angle in facial palsy or any other reconstructive procedures where a V-shaped splint is required.

Isolated agenesis of pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly \\[ 6 , 7 \\], 108 cases were reported during the timeframe between 1974 and 2000 \\[ 8 \\]. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neuromusculoskeletal and genitourinary system anomalies may coexist in 50% of cases \\[ 6 \\]. Symptoms become evident at very early ages in cases in which other congenital anomalies associate. There wasn’t any additional system anomaly in our case. Since this anomaly progresses asymptomatically in adults, the cases are diagnosed by chest radiographs taken incidentally. Contrary to Komatsu, Walter and Gulhan’s cases, our case did not present with hemoptysis \\[ 5 , 7 , 9 \\]. Despite the other cases reported in literature, bronchectasis was not determined in our case although there was a volume loss at the right lung. The absence of coexisting bronchectasis and cardiac or another congenital anomaly is probably the reason for the negative findings in previous health screenings. The prognosis of isolated right pulmonary agenesis is better than the left one and it is less associated with other congenital anomalies \\[ 6 \\], 20% of cases of isolated right pulmonary agenesis is associated with pulmonary hypertension. Asymptomatic patients with pulmonary hypertension may become symptomatic at pregnancy or high altitudes \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Echocardiographic evaluation of our patient revealed pulmonary systolic hypertension. Since the effected side provides the blood from systemic circulation, the progression of left to right shunt may lead to heart failure in future. CT angiography of our case revealed that the right lung supplied blood from systemic circulation. Nevertheless he hadn’t symptoms of heart failure for the time being.\n\n【18】When asymptomatic, unilateral absence of pulmonary artery presents at incidental chest x-rays with small hilar shadow and hyperlucent lung tissue at the effected side. In our case, posterioanterior chest radiography taken for general examination revealed the absence of a pulmonary arterial veya hilar shadow which was suggestive of a vascular pathology in differential diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis in this type of cases is made by pulmonary arteriography. Eventually, we diagnosed our case by CT angiography. Hyperlucency was determined in most cases presented in literature \\[ 6 , 7 , 12 \\- 14 \\]. Unlike the cases with Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome, in our case, the right main pulmonary artery was not detected at pulmonary CT angiography \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. The upper right lung was fed by the branches of thyrocervical truncus while the medium and lower lung’s blood supply came from the branches of intercostal arteries. Asymptomatic cases do not require treatment while surgical treatment may be planned for coexisting cardiac anomalies in cases with absence of left pulmonary artery. Pneumonectomy of the affected side may be indicated in case hemoptysis becomes life-threatening or there are cystic bronchectasic formations.\n\n【19】Revascularisation is performed in selected cases \\[ 6 \\]. Surgical treatment was not an option in this present case since bronchectasis and cardiac or any other genetic vascular malformation was not determined at the hypoplastic pulmonary tissue \\[ 14 \\- 17 \\]. Isolated absence of pulmonary artery may not be diagnosed until they reach adulthood because of the asymptomatic benign course or misdiagnosis \\[ 8 , 18 , 19 \\]. The presence of any hilar pathological image at chest roentgenograms taken for any other purpose should suggest vasculary anomalies. In addition, unilateral atresia of pulmonary artery should be regularly followed up closely for progression of possible complications.\n\n【20】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【21】There was no conflict of interest among authors.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Iatrogenic displacememt of an impacted maxillary third molar into the infratemporal fossa (ITF) is a frequently mentioned extraction complication , but is a rarely reported occurrence \\[ 1 \\- 5 \\]. While some authors recommend urgeont hospitalization and immediate removal of the tooth under general anesthesia with the aid of image-intensifying cineradiography \\[ 6 \\] others have suggested late removal via transantral or coronal approach \\[ 1 , 7 , 8 \\]. The present report describes a case of a tooth displaced into the ITF, its diagnostic imaging and immediate surgical management.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A healthy 34-year-old man was referred for consultation from a community dental clinic, one hour after an attempt to extract the third molar of the left maxilla, however the tooth \"disappeared\"( Fig.1 ). Panoramic radiograph ( Fig. 2 ) demonstrated that the tooth is displaced superiorly toward the maxillary sinus. Axial computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the tooth is located in the ITF between the maxillary sinus and the zygomatic arch ( Fig. 3 ). Alternatives of treatment, either surgical or conservative were discussed with the patient, who prefered to go ahead with the surgical. Then, under local anesthesia, via the extended intraoral incision, the tooth was retrieved through the incision and the displacement tract, using a curved hemostate. Within two weeks postsurgically, the patient was fully recovered, without any adverse sequelae.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Preoperative panoramic radiograph.

Once it is suspected, the exact anatomic location is very important to be determined radiographically. The maxillary third molars may displace either palatally, into the antrum or buccaly into the ITF.\n\n【14】For the radiographic work-up, panoramic, occlusal, occipitomental radiographs can be used. However, CT-scan is the most useful technique, as it provides 3-D anatomical localization \\[ 9 \\]. Therapy attitute is based on clinical signs and symptoms, on surgeon skills and on patient decision. The complex anatomy of the ITF, the potential surgical morbidity, and the difficulty to obtain a good surgical exposure are among the limiting factors to initiate surgical treatment. However, as complications, such as infection, foreign body reaction or trismus \\[ 10 \\], may increase if the retrieval is delayed , speaks toward immediate surgery.\n\n【15】On the other hand it was claimed \\[ 3 , 6 \\] that the displaced tooth may migrate downward into the oral cavity vestibule, allowing an easy surgical removal, which argues toward the delayed surgical approach.\n\n【16】Regradless the timimg of the surgery, several surgical approaches have been used succsessfuly , such as; coronal, Gillies, Caldwell-Luc or resection of the coronoid proces \\[ 4 , 7 , 8 \\]. The morbidity associated with all of these approaches is high and should be taken into consideration.\n\n【17】The immediate intraoral approach, was chosen in the present case for the followig reasons: 1) it can be done under local anesthesia; 2) It allows the use of the displacement tract to retrive to tooth; 3) As time goes on fibrosis is developing along the displacement tract and the tooth, which makes the removal more difficult and possibly more complicated; 4) The associated morbidity is low; 5) It decreases the rate of complications.\n\n【18】The intraoral approach under local anesthesia allows removal of such a displaced tooth with minimal morbidity and is highly recommended. It should be used at least as the initial approach before going to other higher morbidity approach.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The purpose of this report is to show a case of such condition, and to show how to diagnose and treat it.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 13-year-old girl fell down on her left hand. Her general physician diagnosed her injury as left elbow dislocation with medial epicondyle fracture of the humerus ( Fig. 1 ). The physician casted her elbow after manual reduction, and referred her to us for surgical evaluation. Preoperative radiography showed successful elbow dislocation reduction; however, the medial epicondyle fragment was displaced by > 5 mm. We performed open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture under general anesthesia. Her bone fragment with flexors adapted well with the fractured site of her humerus, and was fixed by tension-band wiring. Passive motion of her elbow was smooth and full after fixation ( Fig. 2 ). However, her elbow motion was limited to 60° 5 weeks postoperatively. Adaptation of her elbow joint was poor on radiography, and computed tomography showed an interposed bone fragment within her elbow ( Fig. 3 ). The next week, an additional operation was performed to remove the interposed bone fragment ( Fig. 4 ) and wires. She had full elbow motion without pain 10 weeks after the primary operation.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Radiograph obtained soon after the patient’s visit to the general physician (Watson-Jones type 3).

However, to our knowledge, few reports of elbow dislocation and medial epicondyle fracture with an interposed small free bone fragment exist \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【16】The mechanism underlying small free bone fragment interposition is unclear. One of the possibilities in this case could be the following: the medial epicondyle fragment with flexors was impacted in her joint at the time of injury. This fragment contained the growth plate (Salter-Harris type 2). The interposed fragment with flexors was immediately pulled out from the joint by the power of the attached flexors. However, a small bony fragment proximal to the growth plate detached from the original fragment during this course, and remained within the joint. External force could also detach the fragment if the patient fell directly on her elbow.\n\n【17】We did not recognize the interposed free bone fragment, and simply fixed the fragment with flexors in the primary operation. To prevent such a case, we recommend the following. Surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of small free bony fragment interposition. Careful sequential evaluation of radiographs or computed tomography images could suggest the presence of an interposed fragment ( Fig. 4 ). Next, passive motion of the elbow joint under general anesthesia may not be of use to confirm good joint surface congruity. Direct observation of the joint space is necessary to confirm that nothing is interposed within the joint.\n\n【18】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【19】We thank Professor Y.

He reported to have been in general good condition except for a renal colic occurred seven months before. He presented with intense epigastralgia. Blood analysis revealed severe hypercalcaemia (14.8 mg/dl) and elevated parathyroid hormone levels (665 pg/ml). Renal and thyroid functions were normal.

Patient was addressed to diagnostic imaging to eventually localize hyper functional parathyroid tissue.\n\n【3】**Diagnostic imaging**\n\n【4】The patient was initially studied with ultrasonography ( Fig. 1 ) that demonstrated a large node contiguous to the left thyroid lobe. The patient was addressed to our nuclear medicine protocol that consists of a thyroid scintigraphy followed by a parathyroid one. Thyroid scintigraphy using Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-pertechnetate ( Fig. 2 ) showed a large intense uptake of tracer in the left lower pole of the thyroid and parathyroid scintigraphy using Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-sestaMIBI ( Fig. 3 ) revealed an intense and persistent uptake on the tracer in the same region.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Ultrasonography.

The excised node was identified by the histological frozen section as pathological parathyroid tissue (ptosic superior adenoma) ( Fig. 5 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Surgical procedure.

There is general consensus that the Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-sestaMIBI is the best way to localize preoperatively the hyper secreting parathyroid tissue. A meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of this technique in 6,331 cases gave values of 90.7% and 98.8%, respectively \\[ 4 \\]. The sensitivity of Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-sestaMIBI is limited in patients affected by parathyroid multiglandular disease and multinodular goiter.\n\n【27】As we demonstrated in this case, the parathyroid adenoma could present an intense uptake of pertechnetate, that is very unusual. Particularly in patients with multinodular goiter, the focal uptake of Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-perthecnetate and Tc <sup>99m </sup> \\-sestaMIBI could be therefore attributed to a hyper functioning thyroid node rather than, as we demonstrated to be the case, a parathyroid adenoma.\n\n【28】**Consent**\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

His medications included an antidepressive drug (venlafaxine) and benzodiazepines.\n\n【6】On admission the patient presented a temperature of 38.8 °C and complained colicky abdominal pain. A thorough physical examination was performed. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness without signs of peritoneal irritation; Murphy’s sign, renal and appendicular punches were negative. Heart, neurological, and thoracic examinations were unremarkable. On laboratory tests, the cell count demonstrated 12,470 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, with 70% neutrophils. C-reactive protein (PCR) was 21.6 mg/dL. Hepatic, renal, coagulative function, and urinalysis were within normal limits. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Abdominal X-ray, chest radiography, and abdominal ultrasounds showed no abnormalities. The abdominal CT scan demonstrated sub-acute appendicitis. Surgical treatment was not indicated and an empirical antibiotic therapy with I.V. levofloxacin and antipiretic drug (paracetamol) and was started. After 7 days, the patient presented a complete remission of the symptoms; a control TC scan of the abdomen showed the regression of appendicular inflammation; nevertheless, within a few days fever accompanied by shivering recurred. Because of the persistent febrile status of unknown origin, blood culture specimens were further collected and a 2-\\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was requested. Contrast tomography (CT) attenuation images were used for PET correction (PET/TC). PET/TC revealed an intense FDG uptake in the intervertebral disc between thoracic vertebra 6 and 7; no abnormal FDG uptake was recognized in other areas and diagnosis of discitis was made ( Fig. 1 ). T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense signal in T6 and T7 vertebral bodies and in the corresponding intervertebral disc ( Fig. 2 ), where post-gadolinium T1-weighted MRI demonstrated a strong enhancement associated with the presence of an extradural collection ( Fig. 3 ). These radiological findings were consistent with spondylodiscitis. Once blood cultures grow _Bacteroides fragilis_ , the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis caused by _Bacteroides fragilis_ was made. As expected on the basis of clinical course, _Bacteroides fragilis_ strain was resistant to quinolones, while it was sensitive to metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. A combined treatment with these drugs was started, while levoxacine was discontinued, with complete remission of fever.

More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. Elderly individuals may be easy to fall into a depressed state because of biological changes in the brain and body aging; experiences of loss of a spouse, friend, etc.; and need for stable biopsychosocial status in health and financial aspects. In fact, the rate of suicide is higher in older age groups than in the other generations. The incidence of dementia also increases with aging. Although depression and dementia are common in the elderly age group, recognition and diagnosis of such diseases in the clinical setting might be difficult.\n\n【3】Eating disorders occur most commonly in adolescents and are rarely newly diagnosed after the age of 40 years \\[ 1 \\]. However, anorexia is also one of the major symptoms of depression in the elderly. In addition to an impact on quality of life, significant morbidity and mortality are associated with anorexia. Individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder may suffer from osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, altered gastrointestinal motility, hormonal shifts, leukopenia, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia. Japan is currently an aging society with a huge proportion of elderly citizens. Consequently, the incidence and severity of anorexia and depression are predicted to increase in the future. In fact, at present, anorexia is common in the elderly. The social burdens, financial strain, and the high level of physical and cognitive intactness required for meal preparation all contribute to decreased appetite and food intake in older people \\[ 2 \\]. Anorexia can also be a symptom of physical illness or above-mentioned depression \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Anorexia tardive, a related disorder specific to the elderly, is marked by loss of appetite and significant weight loss, but has more depressive symptoms, less disturbed body image, and preoccupation with eating behavior compared with anorexia nervosa. This condition may be secondary to complicated bereavement as a variant of a geriatric depressive episode \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【4】In this report, we present a case of an elderly woman who visited a primary care physician first and was eventually diagnosed as anorexia due to depression.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】An 84-year-old woman started to gradually lose appetite. About a month later, she consulted her local doctor and was noted to have only superficial gastritis after a series of tests, including blood examinations, endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound. She was prescribed a lansoprazole 15 mg/day and regularly followed up at the hospital. She gained her appetite temporarily, but again lost her appetite and stopped having meals altogether after about a week. Because of this, she was advised admission by her local doctor.\n\n【8】Past medical history included total hysterectomy due to myoma at the age of 50 years. She was the oldest female of seven siblings, but was adopted and raised by her aunt since birth, with very little interaction with her biological parents and siblings. After graduating high school at the age of 21 years, she married an office worker. Moreover, she obtained a degree and managed a barbershop until the age of 74 years. Currently, she lives in a household of three with her son and his wife.\n\n【9】She was advised by her local doctor and visited our hospital at first on September 2. On physical examination, she was alert and conscious and had no apparent cognitive dysfunction. She was 150 cm tall, weighed 38 kg, and had a body mass index of 16.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Blood pressure was 102/64 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.5 °C, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The breasts and stomach area were unremarkable. Her hips were slightly bent and caused her to lean forward, but she could walk on her own. There was no anarthria or dysphagia. Mini-mental status examination score was 24/30 points. Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) \\[ 6 \\] was 17/50 points ( Fig. 1 ). There was no obvious suicidal ideation. Laboratory findings showed no abnormalities. Thyroid hormone levels were also normal. Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed no apparent abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed minimal diffuse white matter ischemic changes that were suggestive of atrophy in the frontal lobe, but this was expected of her age ( Fig. 2 ). She was subsequently discharged and was advised to follow-up as an outpatient. On her outpatient visit, the patient mentioned that she did have any internal need or desire to eat. Although she was drinking 500 mL of milk every day, she lost 5 kg within the past month. Upon assessment, we noted that her physical strength was gradually getting weaker and that her ability to walk was declining due to disuse. As an outpatient, there was not enough time for the staff to talk and communicate fully with the patient. In addition, we judged that it was difficult to continue following her progress with tests as an outpatient and admitted her to the hospital on September 26. Repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any anatomic abnormalities. We continued to track her progress along with administration of vitamin tablets, fluid replacement, and physical rehabilitation to prevent muscle disuse.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** The HAM-D is designed to rate the severity of depression in patients. Although it contains 21 areas, it calculates the patient’s score on the first 17 answers. The following severity ranges for the HAM-D are: no depression (0 - 7), mild depression (8 - 16), moderate depression (17 - 23), and severe depression (≥ 24) \\[6\\]. Her HAM-D score was 17 points on admission._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** MRI of the head (T2-weighted sequences) showed some light scattering of ischemic changes in the white matter of the deep parts of the frontal lobe, but the atrophy is expected of someone her age._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】During this admission, she started talking with us and we learned that the patient started to become emotionally unstable since the 2011 earthquake. She would get frightened of aftershocks during the night, became scared of being alone during the day, and would have sleepless nights because of persistent thoughts about the earthquake. She visited psychiatrists a few times and was prescribed sleep-inducing pills. About 2 years ago, she joined a senior club by a non-profit organization and started participating in activities, such as haiku, playing the harmonica, and using the computer, which were held four times a week. She recalled looking forward to each meeting until about 4 months before her hospitalization, when she was invited to attend a school reunion. Although she always looked forward to reunions, she did not think that it would be fun because only two of her best friends will be able to attend. She was unmotivated and decided not to attend. Later, at the senior club, she started feeling that her mind was not functioning as quickly as before and she grew impatient toward herself. Although her facial expressions were normal and conversations were smooth, it seemed as if she lacked the will to live and often blamed herself. After discussing with psychiatrists, we diagnosed her as having an eating disorder from geriatric depression.\n\n【14】We started administering the patient with 5 mg of mianserin, 20 mg of mirtazapine, and 25 mg of dogmatyl. Subsequently, she was discharged from the hospital and was asked to continue to visit as an outpatient. About a month after discharge from the hospital, her appetite improved gradually, she started enjoying rehabilitation, and even started snacking. She no longer lacked the ability to enjoy experiences. About a month after she left the hospital, she came to the hospital on a silver car, was walking on her own, smiled often, and became her healthy self. At this time, she claimed that meals tasted good and was even eating a little too much. Thereafter, she continued to visit the hospital on a regular basis for checkups. About half a year after discharge from the hospital, her weight returned to 50 kg.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】This was a case of an 84-year-old elderly woman who complained of loss of appetite and weight, but with no cognitive functional disorders and no apparent signs of emotional stress. The female presented in this report anorexia can be a symptom of depression and the treatment plan was devised accordingly. After multiple tests, it became apparent that she was suffering from an eating disorder. The biopsychosocial model has increased popularity not only in the medical and psychiatric fields but also in other various medical fields recently due to its consideration of multiple forms of etiological risks when determining how to most effectively understand and treat individuals for physical and mental illness. This model, in regard to depression, takes into account biological and psychological or cognitive, and social risk factors/contributors to depression when making diagnosis and treatment. The evidence regarding the cause of late life depression is addressed from a biopsychosocial perspective. Thorough understanding of the biopsychosocial model enabled diagnosis and appropriate treatment of early-onset geriatric depression. The individual-focalized and humanized approach, assisting the patient as singular being, was the best one achieving her biopsychosocial needs in this clinical practice. The successful outcome after a typical biopsychosocial model of psychotherapeutic intervention for eating disorders provided additional indirect evidence that she was indeed suffering from anorexia.\n\n【18】At an old age, there are various experiences of loss, including loss of health, social roles, and personal relationships. By listening carefully in this case study, it was apparent that the patient experienced much loss. Moreover, in geriatric depression, patients have few negative emotions, such as feeling depressed, sad, or any other subjective drops in mood; this implies that elderly individuals might find it difficult to explain their symptoms to others, and that the people around them might hardly notice any symptoms of depression. Moreover, patients with this condition might experience several physical malfunctions, such as pain, numbness, loss of appetite, etc. At an old age, many people experience loss of spouses, friends, status, health, and financial assets, in addition to biological changes in the brain and body. In other words, from the biopsychosocial perspective, elderly individuals might easily become depressed. Moreover, looking at the suicide rates by age group, older people have a higher tendency to commit suicide than people in the other age groups. In elderly individuals with depression, complaints about a depressed mood are often few, and the symptoms are atypical. Compared with young people, older people have few symptoms that are characteristic of intrinsic depression, such as desperate ideation, decreased sexual desire, guilt feeling, and depressed mood. Physical discomfort and anxiety symptoms, such as hypochondria, general physical symptoms, impatience, and digestive system symptoms have been reported \\[ 7 \\]. Elderly people with depression have less frequent symptoms of depressed mood, guilt feelings, and diligent thought, which are considered to be common in intrinsic depression; instead, excessive anxiety to physical symptoms and feeling of frustration are frequent.\n\n【19】This is thought to be one of the causes of the actual increase in the number of diseases with aging. Some common co-morbid conditions associated with depression are coronary artery disease in about 10-20% and endocrine disorders in 20-60%. Additionally, the prevalence rate of anorexia is approximately 66% in patients with advanced cancer \\[ 8 \\]. Furthermore, the mortality rate of depression has been reported to be high; this was true even in central nervous system diseases, such as dementia in about 10%, Parkinson’s disease in about 30%, and stroke in 20-30% \\[ 9 \\]. In the overwhelming majority of cases that appeared in literature, disordered patterns of eating, weight, and body image in the elderly were accompanied by co-morbid conditions of anxiety, depression, grief, or dementia \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. There have been cases of presumed anorexia that have actually been due to hypothalamic tumors and dysfunction \\[ 12 \\], but there was no evidence of any mass on CT or MRI. MRI is usually used to rule out organic causes for psychiatric symptoms. Specially, it is usefulness for diagnosis by exclusion of vascular depression or vascular dementia \\[ 13 \\]. Therefore, MRI was very useful in our case ( Fig. 2 ). In addition, anorexia and refusal to eat disorders in the elderly have several differential diseases ( Table 1 ). There is also a need to carefully exclude these diseases and situations.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Factors That Influence Refusal to Eat in the Elderly_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】About 10% of the elderly who receive primary medical care have been diagnosed with depression. Untreated geriatric depression could heighten the risk of cognitive function disorders, physical complications, and death; therefore, it is extremely important to test and diagnose this condition. Anorexia has proven to be an independent predictor of mortality in elderly people \\[ 14 \\]. Therefore, it is important to note that depression is a treatable disease even in the elderly and that patients require appropriate social support, as well as medical and mental therapies. In addition, depression in the elderly is an influential risk factor for suicide; in this sense, differences in depressive symptoms between young people and older people should be known and not overlooked.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this case report highlighted that in atypical populations, such as the elderly, there is a need to be aware of the possibility of eating disorders to decrease risks to health and even life due to a delay in the diagnosis. People suffering from geriatric depression often do not volunteer feelings of sadness, depression, or other negative emotions. The elderly have a tendency to get depressed due to biopsychosocial causes. More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, the effectiveness of primary care will become more important in the future and primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. We think that general medicine will have an more important part in medical practice in the future in Japan.\n\n【23】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【24】The authors especially thank the doctors of the Department of Psychiatry, Hospital of International University of Health and Welfare for their clinical advices and supports.\n\n【25】**Consent**\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【27】**Grant Support**\n\n【28】None.\n\n【29】**Competing Interests**\n\n【30】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

PGNMID has similarities to immune complex glomerulonephritis (GN) on light and electron microscopy (EM); however, by immunofluorescence (IF), the glomerular deposits are monoclonal, staining for a single light-chain isotype and a single γ heavy-chain subclass, most commonly IgG3κ. This entity affects adults and most patients present with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hematuria with or without renal failure.\n\n【3】We report a case of a young healthy female patient who presented with proteinuria and a normal kidney function and was found to have monoclonal immune deposits on the kidney biopsy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 20-year-old young female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the office for evaluation of worsening bilateral lower extremity edema and a 32-lb weight gain over the past 2 weeks. The patient reported a viral prodrome consisting of fever and sore throat that started 2 weeks ago. She denied any dysuria or hematuria but complained of facial swelling.\n\n【7】Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, hear rate of 72 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, afebrile. Lung and heart examination was normal and there was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Abdominal exam was significant for hepatomegaly. Bilateral, three plus pitting lower extremity edema was present.\n\n【8】Her laboratory evaluation showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.3 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 17,250/mm <sup>3 </sup> (85% granulocytes), platelets of 378,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 27 mm/h. Urine analysis showed protein of 100 mg/dL, red blood cell (RBC) of 0 - 3/hpf, and white blood cell (WBC) of 3 - 6/hpf. Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 1,853.28 mg/g CRE, blood urea was 17 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, Na/K/Cl was 137/5.4/108 mEq/L, Ca/P was 8.5 mg/5.6 mg/dL, serum protein was 4.5 g/dL, and albumin was 2 g/dL. Her serum complements (C3 and C4) were normal and serum cryoglobulin was initially positive but turned out to be negative on repeated testing. Rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane were normal. Serology tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Mycoplasma antibody IgG was negative; IgM was 322. Quantitative Strep O was negative. CMV IgG and IgM were negative. EBV IgG was positive, and IgM was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and free light-chain assay were normal. Urine immunoelectrophoresis (UPEP) showed a total protein of 3,287 with no monoclonal proteins on immunofixation. On retroperitoneal ultrasound, kidneys were of normal size and echogenicity. Renal biopsy showed eight glomeruli with endocapillary proliferation and neutrophil infiltration but no crescent formation. Ultrastructurally, there were segmental to global subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits with no associated GBM reaction or spikes. Segmental global mesangial deposits and segmental subendothelial deposits are also seen. Moderate podocyte effacement is noted. These findings were consistent with diffuse proliferative GN with exudates features and IgG3 kappa deposits.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Dysproteinemia is characterized by excessive synthesis of Ig molecules or subunits, which may form paraprotein tissue deposits and produce an array of pathologic lesions, most commonly amyloidosis and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Several renal diseases are associated with dysproteinemias, among which those manifesting monoclonal glomerular deposits of IgG are relatively uncommon. Glomerular diseases associated with monoclonal gammopathies include multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal Ig deposition disease, type I cryoglobulinemic GN and amyloidosis. Of these, MM is the most commonly associated.\n\n【12】In 2004, Nasr et al reported 10 patients with an unusual form of glomerular injury caused by monoclonal IgG deposition that does not belong to a specific entity, which was termed PGNMID \\[ 1 \\]. On IF, the glomerular deposits were monoclonal, staining for a single light-chain isotype and a single γ heavy-chain subclass. Light microscopy (LM) exhibited endocapillary proliferative or membranoproliferative GN, and EM revealed granular electron-dense deposits, mimicking ordinary immune-complex GN. Clinical presentations included proteinuria in 100% of patients (mean 24-h urine protein 5.8 g), renal insufficiency in 80% (mean serum creatinine 2.8 mg/dL), and microhematuria in 60%. A monoclonal serum or urine protein was identified in 50% of patients, although none of them had evidence of MM or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【13】In a retrospective study done by Nasr et al in 2009, entitled “Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits”, 37 patients were studied, of which 60% were older than 50 years. This study represented one of the largest series of PGNMID \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【14】On SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), seven patients had a monoclonal spike (M-spike) in both serum and urine, and four patients had an M-spike detectable in the serum only. The M-spike was detected at presentation in 10 of these 11 patients but not until repeat testing 3 years after presentation in the remaining patient. In all of these 11 patients, the monoclonal proteins in both serum and urine had the same heavy- and light-chain isotypes as the monoclonal Ig deposited in the kidney. IgG heavy-chain subclass analysis of glomerular deposits, performed in nine of the 11 patients, showed IgG1 in five patients, IgG2 in two, and IgG3 in two. Of the remaining 26 patients who had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE, four underwent serum free light-chain assay; of these, three were found to have normal κ:λ ratio, and one (who had glomerular monoclonal IgG3κ deposition) had an elevated κ:λ ratio. In our case, the patient had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE and serum free light-chain assay revealed normal kappa/lambda ratio.\n\n【15】At presentation, all patients had proteinuria. The mean 24-h urine protein was 5.70 g (range 0.36 - 17.00 g). Proteinuria was in the nephrotic range in 68.6% of patients, and 48.6% developed full nephrotic syndrome. Microhematuria was documented in 77.1% of patients. In our case, the patient had a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.36 mg/mg and had microhematuria persistent on repeated testing.\n\n【16】Regarding pathologic findings, the most common histologic pattern seen on LM was predominantly membranoproliferative GN characterized by diffuse and global double-contoured glomerular capillary walls (GCWs) with mesangial cell interposition and mesangial expansion by increased mesangial cell number and matrix. Most of these cases also showed endocapillary hypercellularity, including focal macrophage infiltration. The second most common pattern was predominantly endocapillary proliferative GN, characterized by endocapillary hypercellularity and leukocyte infiltration. IF identified staining of GBM for subclasses of IgG (IgG3-kappa being the most frequent type). In all cases, granular electron-dense deposits were confined to the glomerular compartment. The glomerular immune deposits were primarily subendothelial and mesangial. Subepithelial deposits were less frequent, and were segmental in most cases. In our case, LM showed an acute proliferative and exudative GN and EM showed glomeruli with endocapillary proliferation and neutrophilic proliferation and revealed subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits (EDD) as well as mesangial and subendothelial deposits. IF revealed monoclonal IgG3-kappa deposits.\n\n【17】In our case, the findings of acute proliferative and exudative GN ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) and the subepithelial hump-shaped ( Fig. 3 ) immune-type electron dense deposits on LM and EM, respectively, would be most characteristic of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (APIGN). Interestingly, the lack of hypocomplementemia would be somewhat unusual for APIGN, and the immunofluorescence findings of IgG kappa restricted deposits are also atypical. The presence of deposits of a single Ig class which is IgG and a single light-chain, kappa, and the absence of other Igs, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case ( Fig. 4 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Exudative GN on light microscopy._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Endocapillary proliferation on light microscopy._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits on EM._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【23】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Monoclonal IgG kappa deposits on IF._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】In fact, the diagnosis of PGNMID is based on the following criteria \\[ 2 \\]: findings on kidney biopsy of GN with 1) glomerular immune deposits staining positive for heavy-chain IgG, with negativity for Inga and IgM heavy-chains, thus confined to a single Ig class; 2) positive staining for a single IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4); 3) positive staining for a single light-chain isotype indicating monoclonality; 4) predominantly granular EDD in mesangial, subendothelial and/or subepithelial locations by EM, resembling immune complex GN; and 5) no clinical or laboratory evidence of cryoglobulines.\n\n【26】The etiology of PGNMID is not fully established. The majority of patients do not appear to have or develop hematologic malignancies during the published follow-up period. A small percentage of PGNMID cases were associated with neoplasm or viral infections \\[ 3-6 \\]. In fact, there are 21 more patients with PGNMID that have been reported in the literature \\[ 7-9 \\]. One patient reported by Evans et al \\[ 8 \\] with PGNMID with monoclonal IgG-κ deposits was found to have a follicular B-cell lymphoma infiltrating the kidney and expressing surface IgG-κ. That patient had a positive Bence Jones protein in the urine as well as a monoclonal IgM protein on serum IFE. None of the remaining 20 patients had any hematologic malignancy. In our case, the patient had no detectable M protein by SPEP/UPEP/IFE.\n\n【27】In regards to the clinical outcome of patients with PGNMID, prognosis is variable. For instance, most of the 16 patients with available follow-up data were treated with prednisone with or without other immunosuppressive agents. Five out of the 16 patients subsequently progressed to ESRD (31.3%). In the study by Nasr et al \\[ 2 \\], on an average of 30 months of follow-up for 32 patients, 38% had complete or partial recovery, 38% had persistent renal dysfunction, and 22% progressed to ESRD. Correlates of ESRD were higher creatinine, percentage of glomerulosclerosis, and degree of interstitial fibrosis but not immunomodulatory treatment or presence of a monoclonal spike. In our case, the patient had a complete remission with prednisone therapy.\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】In summary, we describe a unique case of PGNMID occurring in a young patient following a viral illness with spontaneous remission. The findings of an acute proliferative and exudative GN and the subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits in the absence of hypocomplementemia, along with the presence of IgG kappa deposits, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case. The pathophysiology of this disease is not well understood. Is PGNMID another form of post-infectious glomerulopathy in which an infection activates or induces a transient/acute monoclonal Ig formation?\n\n【30】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Idiopathic rupture is encountered in less than 1% of all cases. This condition is often difficult to diagnose clinically, even with increased timely access to computed tomography (CT). The approach requires a high index of suspicion as the patients present with non-specific abdominal pain and may not provide a clear history \\[ 1 \\]. Sometimes the idiopathic spontaneous rupture of the bladder is not even diagnosed or suspected during the victim’s life, being revealed during the autopsy.\n\n【3】We report this case of a young patient who presented with SRUB which occurred after alcohol intoxication and presented to us with vague abdominal pain, anuria, and intraperitoneal fluid collection.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 31-year-old Hispanic male with a remote history of lumbar-spine surgery presented to ER with generalized abdominal pain. He had presented to the ER with a painful urinary retention 4 days prior to this visit and was diagnosed with prostatitis. He was subsequently catheterized and discharged on finasteride and bactrim at that time. In his current visit, he stated that he had not urinated since the prior discharge, and noticed significant abdominal distension. On straining, patient was able to pass drops of blood. He also had diffuse severe abdominal pain, with no alleviating or aggravating factors. Patient stated that he had consumed 12 beers over a course of 12 h prior to his arrival.\n\n【7】Physical examination revealed a young male in an acute distress. Vitals were noted to be temperature of 98.1 °F, respiratory rate of 16 breath/min, heart rate of 99 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 142/87 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination did not show any abnormalities. Abdominal examination revealed sluggish bowel sounds, with no visible scars; abdomen was soft, diffusely tender to palpation, with no rebound-tenderness or organomegaly. Rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings revealed BUN of 43 mg/dL and creatinine of 5.56 mg/dL, both of which were significantly elevated from patients’ baseline. The complete blood count showed WBCs of 15.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL with normal hemoglobin/hematocrit and platelets. The coagulation panel was also normal.\n\n【9】In the emergency department, a three-way Foley catheter was placed draining sanguineous urine. A CT scan of abdomen was ordered and in comparison to the prior done on the patients’ previous ER visit, showed a newly developed pneumoperitoneum. The On-Call Urologist was immediately contacted and a CT cysto-urethrogram was performed, which confirmed intraperitoneal bladder rupture at the anterior bladder dome ( Fig. 1a, b ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a, b) CT cystogram showing an intraperitoneal bladder rupture with extensive extravasation of contrast.

The bladder defect was closed in two layers (water-tight closure) using a continuous technique. An indwelling catheter was left to ease healing of the bladder repair. The patient had an uneventful postoperative. He was discharged home with a fixed follow-up in the out-patient urology clinic.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】SRUB is a rare event. The clinical presentation is usually with features of peritonitis and most of the time, the diagnosis is made intraoperatively. The condition carries high rates of morbidities and mortalities (47%) \\[ 2 \\], attributed to the delay in diagnosis. It is often difficult to distinguish SRUB from other causes of acute abdomen especially in the absence of a history of traumatic event \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【15】The most common causes of atraumatic rupture of urinary bladder are chronic inflammation, bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) urothelial tumors, and radiotherapy. Intra-peritoneal ruptures are divided in two categories, depending on their etiology: rupture of the bladder secondary to a pathological lesion (chronic infections, tuberculosis, eosinophilic or necrotic cystitis, pelvic irradiation for cervical cancer, urothelial tumors) and rupture by over-distension. The spontaneous rupture of the bladder can be facilitated by excessive alcohol consumption which has a diuretic effect \\[ 4 \\] and leads to over-distension in the context of the sensitivity disturbances due to the α-sympathomimetic effect and CNS depression produced by the alcohol. In men, congestion of the prostate and prostatic urethra aggravates the obstruction of the outlet \\[ 5 \\]. With extreme increase of the intra-vesical pressure, the most susceptible part is the intra-peritoneal bladder \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【16】In the literature, an accurate preoperative diagnosis of urinary bladder rupture was made only in few cases \\[ 7 , 8 \\], and many of these cases were initially treated conservatively with urinary catheterization and antibiotics.\n\n【17】During the initial stages, the clinical manifestations of bladder rupture remain imprecise, and diffuse including pain and difficulty of urinating, and after the rupture, the signs and symptoms of peritonitis and urinary difficulties can be detected \\[ 9 \\]. Complications caused by the leakage of the urine into the peritoneal cavity and pelvis include intra-abdominal and pelvic abscesses, sepsis, and metabolic derangements. Significant peritoneal reabsorption of urea and creatinine can masquerade as acute renal failure on initial biochemical testing, as observed in our patient. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, uremia, or acidosis may also occur as extravasated urine is reabsorbed in the peritoneal cavity. Electrocardiogram abnormalities resulting from hyperkalemia may be seen. Several authors have noted increased mortality rates after severe symptom onset \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【18】Imaging modalities to evaluate a patient with suspected bladder injury have included retrograde cystography, CT retrograde cystography, and delayed CT cystography. Conventional abdominal non-contrast CT has an accuracy rate of only 60.6% for bladder injury compared to 95.9% for the retrograde cystogram \\[ 12 \\]. However, in a patient with worsening abdominal pain/distention and vital sign abnormalities, a CT scan will likely be the imaging modality of choice.\n\n【19】SRUB is a surgical emergency and can be rapidly fatal if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, with early and adequate treatment being essential \\[ 6 , 13 \\]. The treatment consists of laparotomy and suture as continuous leakage of urine does not allow spontaneous closure of the breach \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】Most cases of spontaneous bladder rupture in relation to excessive alcohol consumption can have a positive outcome with early prediction and management. This diagnosis should be considered in those who present with acute abdomen, anuria and a raised serum creatinine level.

Although opioids are commonly administered to prevent or treat severe postoperative pain, their use may be associated with adverse effects including respiratory depression and delayed gastrointestinal motility \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Epidural anesthesia has shown to be a safe and effective alternative for the prevention of postoperative pain \\[ 4 \\]. Despite its promising efficacy in controlling postoperative pain, adverse effects may still occur related to catheter placement or its subsequent use \\[ 5 \\]. These may include failure to correctly identify the epidural space, inadvertent dural puncture, epidural hematoma, neurological injuries, medication errors, catheter malfunction, catheter migration, infection, or local anesthetic toxicity \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]. We present a 6-year-old child with Hirschsprung’s disease who was scheduled for anesthetic care during planned laparotomy and transanal pull-through procedures. A persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak developed following inadvertent dural puncture during placement of an epidural catheter. Potential adverse effects of epidural anesthesia in children are discussed. Previous reports of persistent CSF leak are reviewed, and options for treating a persistent CSF leak are presented.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Investigations**\n\n【6】The patient was a 6-year-old, 20.8 kg boy with a past history of Hirschsprung’s disease functionally treated with previous Duhamel pull-through surgery. He was scheduled for revision of the transanal pull-through and creation of loop ileostomy. Parental consent was obtained for general anesthesia and placement of an epidural catheter for postoperative pain control. Following the induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position. Given the proposed surgical procedure, mid-thoracic placement of the epidural catheter was planned. Following sterile preparation, an initial attempt was made with a 2 in, 18-gauge Tuohy needle at the T8-9 interspace (identified by surface landmarks) which resulted in an inadvertent dural puncture and the return of CSF. The needle was promptly removed, and the procedure was repeated successfully placing a new Tuohy needle (2 in, 18 gauge) at the T9-10 interspace followed by a 20-gauge catheter on a single attempt. Loss of resistance was noted at 2 cm and the catheter was secured at 6 cm at the skin. A test dose of 2 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was administered after negative aspiration for blood and CSF. General anesthesia was supplemented by intermittent dosing of the catheter with 2 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine every 30 min. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 8 h. The patient’s trachea was extubated. After an uneventful recovery in the post-anesthesia care unit, he was admitted to the inpatient ward. Adequate postoperative analgesia was provided by an epidural infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine with clonidine at 4 mL/h.\n\n【7】**Diagnosis**\n\n【8】On the fifth postoperative day, the epidural was removed. Shortly after that, CSF was noted to be leaking from the epidural catheter insertion site (lower puncture site). This fluid leak persisted despite placement of a pressure dressing. The patient complained of mild back pain, but no headache or fever were observed.\n\n【9】**Treatment**\n\n【10】Neurosurgery was consulted, and a suture was placed bridging together subcutaneous tissue and skin at the site of the observed CSF leak. The procedure was performed at the bedside following cutaneous infiltration of local anesthetic. The CSF leak resolved, and the patient was further monitored. There were no signs or symptoms consistent with meningitis.\n\n【11】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【12】The patient’s postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus, multiple abdominal fluid collections requiring ultrasound-guided aspiration under general anesthesia, and the need for total parenteral nutrition. He was eventually discharged on postoperative day 15. Per recommendations of the neurosurgical team, the suture was removed 2 weeks from original placement.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Regional anesthetic techniques such as epidural analgesia have been shown to be a safe and effective option for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in infants and children, with potential benefits over intravenous opioids including earlier tracheal extubation, improved blunting of the hormonal-metabolic stress response, earlier return of bowel function, decreased respiratory complications, and shorter hospital stays \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. Despite these benefits, adverse effects may occur related to initial needle or catheter placement or the subsequent epidural administration of medications. Adverse effects related to placement, including bleeding or direct neurologic damage, are rare. In a 2018 comprehensive review of neuraxial anesthesia practice by the Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network (PRAN), there were no reports of hematoma formation or permanent neurologic injures related to needle placement \\[ 7 \\]. Among 30,000 epidural catheters placed, there were no reports of persistent CSF leak or cutaneous fistula. Although the observation and diagnosis of a persistent CSF-cutaneous fistula is a rare event, anecdotal reports in both adult and children have demonstrated its occurrence following spinal surgery, placement of intrathecal catheters, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, diagnostic or therapeutic lumbar puncture, and epidural anesthesia \\[ 9 \\- 24 \\]. A summary of the reports from pediatric-aged patients is outlined in Table 1 . Our review identified six reports including a total of seven patients ( Table 1 ). Persistent CSF-cutaneous fistula in children has been identified with the prolonged postoperative use of indwelling intrathecal catheters for CSF drainage following craniofacial or neurosurgical procedures, in the setting of multiple lumbar punctures, following multiple attempts at epidural catheter placement, and following apparently uncomplicated epidural catheter placement. Potential identified risk factors from these anecdotal cases reports included the extended use of an intrathecal catheter (3 and 9 days), repeated penetration of the dura with multiple lumbar punctures, and use of larger bore needles or catheters. However, the development of a CSF-cutaneous fistula remains a rare complication in children as demonstrated by the lack of reports found in comprehensive reports from the PRAN database \\[ 5 \\- 7 \\].\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Reports of CSF-Cutaneous Fistula in Children_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】The initial indication of the problem in our patient was the identification of clear fluid (CSF) draining from the insertion site following removal of the epidural catheter in absence of other significant clinical signs and symptoms. Additional clinical signs and symptoms reported in the literature have generally been non-specific including irritability, headache, vomiting, back pain, or listlessness. In our patient, the CSF-cutaneous tract was likely formed during the inadvertent dural puncture at the T8-9 interspace during the first attempt at epidural catheter placement. We would postulate that CSF drainage from the fistula was tamponaded by the presence of the catheter passing from the interspace below through the tract into the epidural space thereby blocking the leak of CSF. Additionally, this CSF leak may have been prevented by expansion of the epidural space following administration of the local anesthetic agent and pressure on the fistula tract. The leak was only manifested after removal of the epidural catheter. A similar chain of events was reported by Hosu et al with placement of an epidural catheter at an interspace below an area of inadvertent dural puncture and subsequent persistent CSF leakage after catheter removal \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【18】Although there is limited evidence-based medicine on which to develop a treatment algorithm, due to the theoretical risk of infection with a persistent leak, the observation time for spontaneous resolution should be limited. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that treatment strategies should differ between pediatric and adult patients. While spontaneous resolution of a CSF-cutaneous fistula may occur, treatment may be necessary given the concerns regarding the potential for retrograde infection of CSF, and the development of meningitis in the presence of a persistent leak. Invasive treatment with surgical exploration is unlikely to be required except with CSF leaks following surgical procedures or traumatic injuries. Conservative treatment with bedrest in the horizontal position has been shown effective in hastening resolution of a dural tear after lumbar decompressive surgery with a mean duration of bed rest of 2.6 days (range 2 - 4 days) \\[ 25 \\]. Other potential approaches suggested by Fang et al to treat CSF leak after spinal surgery have included suture placement, or augmented closure with dural substitute material, slowing CSF leakage by reducing the subarachnoid fluid pressure, or increasing the epidural space pressure using a tight fascial closure or an epidural blood patch \\[ 26 \\]. The latter approach has been reported anecdotally to be successful by several authors following the occurrence of a CSF leak after repeated lumbar punctures or epidural catheter placement \\[ 10 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 24 \\]. In our patient, as he was asymptomatic, a trial approach with placement of a sterile pressure dressing was attempted. When it failed, placement of a single subcutaneous suture was suggested by our neurosurgical consultants and proved to be effective. The role of prophylactic antibiotics for these patients is unclear, and its value in preventing infection remains unproven. As our patient was afebrile without signs of meningeal irritation, antibiotics were not deemed necessary. However, a low threshold to initiate antibiotic therapy is indicated should there be clinical concerns for local infection or meningitis.\n\n【19】**Learning points**\n\n【20】Neuraxial anesthesia remains an important tool for providing postoperative analgesia with specific advantages over systemic opioids, and an excellent adverse effect profile even for the neonate and infant population. Although infrequent, complications related to placement or subsequent use of a catheter may arise. We present the rare occurrence of a persistent CSF leak following inadvertent dural puncture during attempted placement of an epidural catheter. Anecdotal reports in the literature suggest that the incidence of this complication may be increased by the use of an intrathecal catheter, repeated penetration of the dura during multiple lumbar punctures, or with the use of larger bore needles or catheters. However, it can also occur following a single inadvertent dural puncture. Our experience suggests that the CSF leak was possibly facilitated by placement of an epidural catheter below the initial dural puncture, likely contributing to maintaining an open fistula tract. Consideration for placement of subsequent catheter placement at a level above the initial dural puncture is suggested to limit the occurrence of this complication. Treatment options include bed rest with the head of the bed flat to decrease CSF pressure, placement of a pressure dressing, attempts to seal or close the fistula tract with sutures, colloidal glue, staples, or epidural blood patch. More invasive interventions such as surgical exploration are rarely required. Anecdotal reports suggest that prompt resolution may occur even in difficult to treat cases with placement of an epidural blood patch.\n\n【21】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【22】None to declare.\n\n【23】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【24】None to declare.\n\n【25】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【26】None to declare.\n\n【27】**Informed Consent**\n\n【28】Informed consent was obtained from a parent for anesthetic care and use of patient data for publication purposes.

There are two types of chromosomal translocation: balanced and unbalanced translocations \\[ 1 \\]. It is difficult to detect balanced translocations because most balanced translocations do not involve the gain or loss of genetic information, and individuals carrying these genes do not exhibit clinical symptoms \\[ 2 \\]. However, several studies have revealed associations between short stature, developmental delay, and facial malformation with balanced translocations \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. Further, a rare case of a patient with abnormal phenotypes, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), has been reported \\[ 6 \\]. The characterization of disease-associated balanced translocations has led to the detection of genes responsible for various disorders, including various forms of DM. Here, we present the case of a 12-year-old boy with type 2 DM (T2DM) carrying a balanced translocation (46,XY t(6;7)(q24;q31.2)).\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Investigations**\n\n【6】The patient was a 12-year-old Japanese boy. He was referred to our hospital owing to the detection of glycosuria during urinary screening at his school. He was born at 41 weeks of gestational age. His birth weight and height were 3,028 g (-0.6 standard deviation (SD)) and 51 cm (+0.6 SD), respectively. He had no medical history of hyperglycemia during infancy. However, when he began elementary school, he had a medical history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for which he has received no medication to date. His score on the matrix reasoning subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-4) was 90 (average range: 85 - 115). His parents had normal physique and did not have DM. His 10-year-old sister had ASD, ADHD, and was obese.\n\n【7】**Diagnosis**\n\n【8】On physical examination, the body weight of the patient was 79.8 kg (+2.6 SD) and his height was 163.1 cm (+1.8 SD). His body mass index (BMI) was 29.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> (+2.19 SD, 98.6th percentile), and his waist circumference was 94.5 cm. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 118 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 70 mm Hg (criteria for metabolic syndrome in Japanese children are SBP ≥ 125 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 70 mm Hg \\[ 7 \\]). Laboratory investigations revealed a fasting plasma glucose level of 131 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 7.3%. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) value was 6.1 (reference range in non-obese pubertal children, < 2.6 \\[ 8 \\]). Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet antigen type 2 were negative. He did not have any endocrine abnormalities leading to insulin resistance, and his serum growth hormone, cortisol, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxin levels were 0.13 ng/mL, 20.9 µg/dL, 3.2 pg/mL, and 1.14 ng/dL, respectively. His serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 159, 111, and 48 mg/dL, respectively. His liver enzyme levels were elevated; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 58 and 106 IU/L, respectively. Computed tomography revealed fatty liver and visceral fat accumulation. Therefore, he was diagnosed with T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Genetic examination was requested because he had a mild developmental disorder. After we obtained informed consent from the patient and his parents, we conducted a genetic analysis for excluding chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Prader-Willi syndrome). G-banding and fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) were performed, and we identified a 46,XY t(6;7)(q24;q31.2) chromosomal translocation ( Fig. 1a ). To determine the origin of the reciprocal translocation, genetic examinations of the family members of the proband were performed. The proband’s father and sister had the same chromosomal translocation, while his mother had a normal karyotype ( Fig. 1b ). His father was phenotypically normal, but his sister was obese and had a mild developmental disorder, similar to the proband. Chromosome 6q24, the paternal allele of the imprinted gene locus, is closely related to diabetes \\[ 9 , 10 \\], while chromosome 7q31-33 is strongly linked to autism \\[ 11 \\]; therefore, we additionally performed array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). However, the results of array CGH did not show any copy number variation in the breakpoint regions on chromosomes 6 and 7 ( Fig. 2a ). The methylation coefficient of pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 ( _PLAGL1_ ) located on chromosome 6q24 was analyzed. However, no abnormal methylation was detected ( Fig. 2b ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) Cytogenetic analysis showing a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 6 and 7.

After lifestyle modification, the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of the patient temporarily decreased to 6.5%. However, HbA1c value increased from 6.5% to 7.2% over a 2-month interval. Subsequently, we initiated treatment with metformin (administered as two 250 mg doses per day).\n\n【14】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【15】After 6 months of treatment with metformin, the HbA1c value of the proband improved to 6.1%, and his body weight reduced to 74.8 kg.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】* * *\n\n【18】It is assumed that gene breakages, which lead to the formation of balanced translocations, do not cause a marked loss of chromosomal segments; consequently, considerable gene loss and phenotypic changes in the individuals do not occur \\[ 2 \\]. Nevertheless, balanced translocations lead to various chromosomal anomalies that can be detected in patients with abnormal phenotypes as well as healthy individuals who are asymptomatic \\[ 1 \\]. Previous studies have reported the association of short stature and developmental delay with balanced translocations \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Furthermore, a previous case study has suggested an association between balanced translocation and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【19】To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the association of balanced reciprocal translocation in chromosomes 6 and 7 with T2DM in a patient. We observed that the same translocation was harbored by the patient’s father and sister, and his sister had a similar phenotype with elevated HOMA-IR values. These considerations render this case even more interesting from a clinical point of view, as they indicate a correlation between supposedly harmless translocations and effect in predisposing carriers to certain health conditions.\n\n【20】There are several possible causes of symptomatic balanced translocations. Balanced translocations can become imbalanced via _de novo_ regulation at the molecular level, uniparental disomy, disruption of genes located at the breakpoint, and undetected mosaicism in the tissue \\[ 3 \\]. These minimal changes cannot be analyzed using G-banding and FISH. Both _PLAGL1_ and hydatidiform mole associated and imprinted _(HYMAI_ ) located on chromosome 6q24 are closely related to diabetes as the paternal allele of the imprinted locus \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. The whole-genome data from multiple families implicate the interactions among at least 10 genes on chromosome 7q31 in the causation of autism \\[ 11 \\]. We performed array CGH; we did not observe any copy number variation in the two imprinted genes on chromosomes 6 and 7.\n\n【21】Further investigations are required to determine the whole genome sequence and sample target tissues to identify any associated mosaicism. In this case, unfortunately, we could not exclude another gene anomaly. We could not perform whole genome sequencing in our patient, because the family refused this request, owing to socio-economic reasons.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we encountered a case of T2DM with t(6;7)(q24;q31.2) balanced translocation. Importantly, in the case of a reciprocal translocation with T2DM as a phenotypic manifestation, further analyses are warranted to obtain additional information that will aid in making an accurate diagnosis and providing effective treatment.\n\n【23】**Learning points**\n\n【24】In clinical practice, we often encounter children with obesity. However, not all children with obesity develop DM. Some children develop DM even after minimal weight gain. Presumably, obesity exacerbates the development of DM, but it is possible that other factors are responsible for impaired glucose tolerance. The discovery of chromosomal abnormalities can contribute to the development of therapies for various diseases. Ultimately, when a patient is found to harbor a balanced translocation, the most important consideration is genetic counseling for the patient and their family to detect the prevalence of any familial genetic conditions.\n\n【25】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【26】We would like to thank Dr. Maki Fukami from the National Center for Child Health and Development for helping us with array comparative genomic hybridization.\n\n【27】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【28】None to declare.\n\n【29】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【30】None to declare.\n\n【31】**Informed Consent**\n\n【32】Informed consent was obtained from the patient as well as his parents for participation in this study and the use of patient data for publication purposes.

He denied any neck pain, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, any urinary symptoms, seizure, or altered sensorium. He had a past history of polyarticular gout, hypertension, end stage kidney disease secondary to idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic disease and appendectomy. He had undergone placement of tunneled Ash catheter in the right internal jugular vein two months ago for hemodialysis and was awaiting a renal transplantation. His medications included amlodipine, clonidine, labetalol, calcium acetate, allopurinol and prednisone 20 mg daily, which he has been taking for more than 2 years. He lived in New York with his wife. He denied recent travel, as well as recent contact with a sick person or a pet. He drank alcohol occasionally but did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He had a history of allergy to morphine sulphate.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a temperature of 103.8 °F, blood pressure of 132/76 mm Hg **,** pulse of 139 /min, respiratory rate of 16 /min and oxygen saturation of 96 percent on ambient air. The lungs were clear on auscultation; cardiac examination revealed no murmurs. Neurological exam was unremarkable. Ash catheter exit site or tunnel infection was absent. There were no Osler’s nodes, Jane way lesions, conjuctival petechiae, splinter hemorrhage or Roth spots. Rest of the physical examination was normal.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests revealed: white cell count of 6900 /µL with 65% neutrophils and 26% bands, hemoglobin of 9 gm/dl (which was at his baseline) with mean corpuscular volume of 80 fl, platelet count of 116000 /µL, blood urea nitrogen of 83 mg/dl, creatinine of 13.4 mg/dl, normal electrolytes and liver function tests. The urine analysis was negative for pyuria or hematuria. Chest x-ray of the patient showed a questionable left upper lobe infiltration ( Fig. 1 ). Blood cultures were drawn. Computed tomography (CT) of head was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed: clear fluid with white cell count of 13 /µL with 90% neutrophils, red cell count of 34500 /µL, total protein of 64 mg/dl, glucose of 72 mg/dl (peripheral blood glucose 149 mg/dl) and negative gram stain and India ink.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Chest X-ray showing left upper lobe mass like infiltrate and a tunneled ash catheter in the right internal jugular vein._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Patient was started on intravenous (IV) cefepime, linezolid and moxifloxacin for possible health-care associated pneumonia.

The findings were consistent with septic embolization ( Fig. 2 , 3 ). The blood culture grew methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). CSF culture was negative. The patient was started on IV vancomycin 750 mg with hemodialysis after a one time loading dose of 2 gm and all other antibiotics were discontinued. Given the possibility of CRBSI leading to SPE, Ash catheter was removed. Culture of the catheter tip grew MRSA confirming the diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) as well as transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not reveal any vegetation or intracardiac thrombus ( Fig. 4 ). The patient’s clinical status improved.

The majority of 247 cases of SPE were associated with pneumonia, sepsis and infectious endocarditis with only one case associated with infected central venous catheter, thus showing the rarity of the catheter-related SPE. In this study, fungal SPE was twice more common then bacterial SPE and more likely to be associated with hematological or solid malignancy compared to bacterial SPE \\[ 12 \\]. In another study, tricuspid endocarditis was the most common cause and the drug abusers were the most common patients \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【19】CRBSI occurs at the frequency of 0.9 to 2.0 episodes/patient-year among HD population.Ten persent of whom would be hospitalized with sepsis or metastatic infection (such as septic thrombosis, endocarditis and septic arthritis) \\[ 2 \\]. Although CRBSI is very common, catheter-related SPE is unusual, more so in the absence of endocarditis or infected right atrial thrombus \\[ 3 \\- 11 \\].\n\n【20】The pathogenesis of SPE is related to the formation of infected catheter-induced thrombosis at the proximal end of the catheter, often with extension of the thrombus into the right atrium, which is frequently visualized by an echocardiogram. Alternatively, there could be associated tricuspid endocarditis. Dislodgement of the thrombus or vegetation to the pulmonary artery or its branches can lead to an infarction or a metastatic abscess \\[ 3 , 14 \\- 16 \\]. Our patient developed multiple SPE in the absence of overt clinical or radiographic signs of catheter-associated thrombosis, catheter infection or malfunction or endocarditis. Therefore, it is possible that the patient might have developed small thrombosis around the catheter site without extension into right atrium or the patient might have dislodged the entire cardiac thrombus without any residual thrombus.\n\n【21】SPE typically presents with fever, pleuritic pain, cough and hemoptysis. There is often a history of predisposing factor, e.g. drug abuse or extra pulmonary infection \\[ 13 , 14 \\] or a catheter, as in our patient. The clinical features and chest radiography could be nonspecific, as in our patient, thus delaying the diagnosis. High index of suspicion is important since SPE due to central venous catheters is probably under diagnosed \\[ 15 \\] and early identification may improve its prognosis. Equally important is the identification of septic focus since the resolution of the problem will depend on the elimination of the source. When chest radiograph findings are nonspecific or equivocal, the use of chest CT can play an important role in detecting the presence of SPE. Only 32% of lesions visible on chest CTs were detected by chest radiographs in a study \\[ 17 \\]. Chest CT might show patchy infiltrate, poorly defined nodule or wedge-shaped densities, which are typically multiple, sub pleural and peripheral, and located at the end of a blood vessel \\[ 13 , 14 , 17 \\], and sometimes associated with cavitations and air bronchogram within the nodule, ground-glass halo around the nodule, pleural effusion or empyema \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. These features, along with the clinical scenario, help to differentiate SPE from other causes of diffuse pulmonary nodules \\[ 18 \\]. Echocardiogram is valuable in detecting the presence of right-atrial thrombus or endocarditis; TEE is superior to TTE \\[ 14 \\]. Given the rarity of catheter-related SPE, we believe that the following criteria should be fulfilled before the catheter can be definitely implicated as the source of septic emboli: SPE occurs in the presence of CRBSI, and there are no other possible sources of septic emboli such as soft-tissue infection or drug abuse.\n\n【22】Once CRBSI is suspected, prompt empiric therapy with antibiotic covering methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (preferably vancomycin) and gram-negative bacilli (e.g. third generation cephalosporin, carbapenem, or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) should be started \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The infected catheter should always be removed for patients with infection due to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas species, or Candida species and a temporary (nontunneled catheter) should be inserted into another anatomical site. The catheter should also be removed in the presence of severe sepsis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or metastatic infection e.g. endocarditis, or osteomyelitis or in the absence of response to antibiotic therapy within 72 hours \\[ 1 \\]. Hence, in patients with SPE, the catheter should be removed. Our patient had infection with MRSA as well as SPE, hence the catheter was removed. Long-term HD catheter can be reinserted once blood cultures are negative as in our patient. The total duration of antibiotic in the presence of complicated or metastatic infection should be at least 6 weeks \\[ 1 \\]. The need of surgical interventions for complications of SPE such as lung abscesses, empyema and bronchopleural fistula, although once common \\[ 13 \\], is declining with earlier diagnosis and prompt use of antibiotics \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【23】**Conclusions**\n\n【24】1) The diagnosis of SPE might be overlooked because of the absence of respiratory symptoms and signs or the presence of nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Hence, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with HD catheter. 2) A diagnosis of CRBSI can be made by peripheral blood culture in conjunction with catheter tip or catheter blood culture. A chest CT, in addition to echocardiogram, can provide important additional diagnostic clues for SPE. 3). Empiric therapy of CRBSI should include vancomycin and gram-negative coverage with subsequent de-escalation based on cultures. SPE requires six-week course of antibiotics.\n\n【25】**Grant**\n\n【26】None.\n\n【27】**Competing Interests**\n\n【28】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【29】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There are several factors involved in its etiology. By comparison, that disease needs emergency attention and critical airway care in the setting of airway obstruction, leading to more fatal outcome.\n\n【3】The diagnosis can be difficult and a lot of clinicians often overlook this disease entity at their outpatient clinic. The early recognition of this pathology is very important with use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Signal changes caused by blood products which are visible on the MR images suggest the diagnosis of retropharyngeal hematoma. With a review of the literature, the author presents a rare case of a 51-year-old woman with spontaneous retropharyngeal hematoma after vomiting.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in September 2014 due to 3 days history of dull neck pain and orthopnea without history of preexisting neck disease. Especially, she felt dyspnea whenever she flexed her neck. Vomiting was suddenly developed due to indigestion just before she visited our hospital. Previous medical history was non-specific. On general examination, this patient looked healthy. The neck was non-tender and there was no significant limitation of neck movement. Her vital sign was also stable.\n\n【7】A fiberoptic laryngoscopic examination revealed a slight anterior bulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall with preserved glottis space ( Fig. 1 ). Hematology evaluation showed a hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, white blood cell count (per mm <sup>3 </sup> ) of 6,800, platelet count of 278,000/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 15 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 1 mg/L. Biochemical analysis, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and bleeding time were normal. Lateral soft tissue radiography of the neck showed increased thickness of prevertebral soft tissue: 11.6 mm at C1, 8.1 mm at C2, 9.8 mm at C3 and 9.8 mm at C4 ( Fig. 2 ). The airway was not significantly narrowed.\n\n|  _**Figure 1.** The laryngoscopic finding. The feature shows anterior bulging of posterior oropharynx wall._ |\n| --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n|  _**Figure 2.** Lateral neck X-ray shows a widening of the prevertebral space._ |\n| --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】And MRI was performed ( Fig. 3 ). The image sequences disclosed a retropharyngeal collection that exhibited high signal on routine T2-weighted image and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image. Low signal was also found at T1-weighted image. Above mentioned image sequences disclosed typical signal characteristics of an acute hematoma. The patient was managed conservatively with steroids and there was complete resolution of neck pain and orthopnea. On the third day, her symptom almost all resolved. The patient was discharged within 7 days.\n\n|  _**Figure 3.** Midsagittal T1-weighted image (A), T2-weighted image (B) and FLAIR image (C). The T1-, T2-weighted image and FLAIR image are consistent with the predominant deoxyhemoglobin._ |\n| --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】Anatomically, the retropharyngeal space is located between the middle and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia and presents ventral, dorsal and lateral borders. The ventral border of the retropharyngeal space is constituted by the bucco-pharyngeal fascia and the superior pharyngeal constrictor, the dorsal border by the alar and prevertebral fascia and lateral border by the carotid sheaths and other deep fascial spaces, respectively. That is largest interfascial compartment. Bleeding in these potential spaces can be an immediate life-threatening emergency with potential for airway compromise due to the wide extension of this potential space from the skull base to the level of carina \\[ 1 \\]. As a result, all physicians involved in the management of airway emergencies should be aware of this rare condition. In our case, retropharyngeal swelling and tracheal compression were not found. Fortunately, respiratory distress was not progressed.\n\n【17】The frequency of spontaneous retropharyngeal hematoma is clearly unknown. Spontaneous retropharyngeal hematoma is defined by the absence of any clear etiology. There are only a few case reports in the recent literature \\[ 2 \\]. Retropharyngeal hematomas are, although extremely uncommon, associated with a range of conditions including cervical trauma, anticoagulation, bleeding diathesis, following internal jugular vein cannulation, arteriography and carotid sinus massage \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【18】Precipitating factors, such as episodes of coughing, sneezing, straining, and vomiting, indirectly contribute to a retropharyngeal hematoma. A proposed mechanism is that increased intrathoracic pressure causes increased jugular pressure transmitted to tributary valveless veins leading to rupture of bridging veins \\[ 1 \\]. In traumatic cases, the hematoma is thought to be caused by a tear in the anterior longitudinal ligament, but it can also be due to bleeding from a cervical spinal fracture. However, our patient presented with acute onset of mild neck pain and dyspnea after vomiting. No apparent trauma history was noted. Vomiting was only predisposing factor for triggering hemorrhage.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of retropharyngeal hematoma can be difficult because symptom and sign are various and non-specific. Clinically, it may manifest as sore throat, neck pain, dysphagia, dyspnea and a hoarse voice. In case of trauma, the Capps triad has been described: tracheal and esophageal compression, ventral displacement of the trachea, and subcutaneous ecchymosis over the neck and anterior chest wall \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【20】The diagnosis is aided by X-ray, computed tomography, or MRI. The thickness of the prevertebral soft tissue is helpful in detecting a retropharyngeal hematoma. The thickening of prevertebral soft tissue should be correlated with the clinical findings. Lateral X-ray of the neck is a simple and useful tool for measuring the prevertebral soft tissue. Hauq et al reviewed a total of 131 lateral soft tissue radiographs in various age groups, of which 86 radiographs were normal. In this study, the mean thickness in the retropharyngeal region ranged from 6.2 ± 3.0 mm in the infant to 3.7 ± 1.0 mm in the adult \\[ 6 \\]. Rojas et al reported that the upper limits of normal range for thickness of prevertebral soft tissue in multidetector CT were 8.5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 18 mm and 18 mm at C1, C2, C3, C6 and C7, respectively \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, thickness of the prevertebral soft tissue was also mildly increased to 11.6 mm at C1, 8.1 mm at C2, 9.8 mm at C3 and 9.8 mm at C4 compared to these reference values. These findings allowed further diagnostic workup by CT and/or MRI.\n\n【21】MRI offers multiplanar anatomic display and the tissue characterization in head and neck. The differential diagnosis of retropharyngeal lesions can be possible with use of contrast. Also, the MRI allows more specific diagnosis about blood products in different stages of evolution, because of their paramagnetic signal properties which change over the time depending on their dominant component (acute deoxyhemoglobins, subacute intra- or extracellular methemoglobins and chronic hemichromes) \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. Our patient also exhibited hypointensity on T1-sequneces and high intensity on T2-weighted sequences and FLAIR image. The enhancing MRI was not carried out because MR findings of this patient were compatible to acute retropharyngeal hematoma although retropharyngeal infection was also considered as a differential diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory findings such as fever and dysphagia, leukocytosis and elevated ESR were necessary to consider infection.\n\n【22】The prognosis is good if recognized and treated promptly. Despite the absence of respiratory distress at the time of admission, emergent airway management with either rapid intubation or tracheostomy may become necessary. Bleeding into the retropharyngeal space is serious because the anatomic peculiarity of the pharyngeal muscles offers no resistance to the expanding hematoma. Compression of the arytenoids cartilages can occur, closing the vocal and obstructing the airway \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【23】However, surgical exploration and transoral drainage should be only considered for large hematoma, especially for those rapidly expanding. Most cases of small or moderate hematomas can be resolved with a conservative management \\[ 9 \\]. Fortunately, symptom and sign of this patient were rapidly improved after medication.\n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】Our case illustrates a presentation of spontaneous retropharyngeal hematoma after vomiting in the form of no airway compromise. Physician should be aware that retropharyngeal hematoma may be early misdiagnosed and could lead to airway obstruction. An early lateral neck X-ray and MRI are essential for diagnosis and management of this rare disease. This knowledge is very important for managing retropharyngeal hematoma properly.\n\n【26】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

CD is classified clinically into unicentric or multicentric form (MCD) \\[ 1 \\]. Co-presentation of MCD with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes (POEMS syndrome) was first noted in the 1980 and 1990s \\[ 5 \\], and it is estimated to occur in 11-30% of CD cases \\[ 1 , 4 \\].\n\n【3】POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome \\[ 3 , 5 , 6 \\] that is described by the acronym in its name: polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes \\[ 2 \\- 8 \\]. It was first described in 1938 when Scheinker reported a case of a 39-year-old man with sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, solitary plasmacytoma and cutaneous hyperpigmentation \\[ 2 , 4 , 9 \\]. The acronym was coined only in 1980 by Bardwick et al, and refers several but not all features of the POEMS syndrome \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 \\]. Due to its rarity and wide clinical features, misdiagnosis as another disease is common \\[ 7 , 10 \\], and with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n【4】Herein, we describe a case of a 69-year-old woman with a 1-year history of a left-side supraclavicular swelling associated with constitutional symptoms whose lymph node biopsy was compatible with CD. A review of symptoms and a complete physical examination followed by appropriate tests allowed an accurate diagnosis of POEMS syndrome associated with MCD. This case report aims to raise awareness about this entity.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】**Investigations**\n\n【8】We present a case of a 69-year-old woman, with a previous history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. Her medication included amlodipine 5 mg, candesartan 8 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and nebivolol 5 mg. She presented with a 1-year history of left-side supraclavicular swelling associated with progressive fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss (body weight: 74 to 63 kg). Cervical ultrasound documented multiple cervical lymphadenopathies with the largest lymph node (measuring 3.1 × 1.7 cm) being localized on the left supraclavicular region; and she was referred to the Department of General Surgery. A left supraclavicular lymph node excisional biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination of the specimen was consistent with the diagnosis of herpes virus-8-positive CD (HHV-8 CD, Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Histological findings in the surgical specimen.

Additional clinical history inquiry was attempted and revealed that, during the last few months, she noted progressive diffuse skin darkening and symmetrical paresthesia of the lower limbs. She denied fever, night sweats, gastrointestinal or respiratory complaints. Neurologic review of symptoms was negative for dysphagia, dysarthria, ocular changes, and bowel and bladder dysfunctions. She had no history of smoking, alcohol abuse, or illicit-drug use. She had no contact with animals or any sick person and did not have any recent travel outside Portugal. She had no family history of neurologic or oncologic diseases.\n\n【11】On physical examination, she was afebrile. Her blood pressure was 151/77 mm Hg and heart rate 62 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation was 97% while on room air. She had diffuse cutaneous hyperpigmentation and palpable lymph nodes in her cervical and supraclavicular regions, with the largest measuring 3 × 2 cm. Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged liver and no other abnormality. She had bilateral edema of lower limbs. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia below the ankles and tendon hyporreflexia; her muscle strength was decreased in upper and lower extremities with muscle strength grade 4-/5 proximal and grade 4+/5 distal.\n\n【12】**Diagnosis**\n\n【13】Blood tests showed normal complete blood count, coagulation tests, serum bilirubin (total and conjugated), aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were within normal range. Renal function, serum calcium and total serum protein were normal. Endocrine screening showed normal thyroid function, a normal glycemic profile (fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c), and a normal cortisol dosage. Hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections were ruled out. Auto-immune screening (antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) and rheumatoid factor) was negative with no complement consumption. Albumin was 3.2 g/dL (reference range (RR): 3.4 - 5) and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation demonstrated a monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG)/kappa peak with IgG level of 2,120 mg/dL (RR: 650 - 1,600). Serum free light chains ratio was normal. Bence-Jones proteins were not detected. Bone marrow biopsy showed the presence of reactive-appearing lymphocytes B and T and 5% of plasma cells ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Histological findings in the bone marrow biopsy specimen.

On transthoracic echocardiography there was a normal systolic function without pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion. Electromyography was consistent with sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Bone windows of computed tomography scan showing: (a) diffuse sclerotic lesions and (b) sclerotic lesion in right ischium._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】Thus, our patient meets the criteria for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome in association with CD.\n\n【20】**Treatment**\n\n【21】She was referred to the Hematology Department, and she started treatment with a combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.\n\n【22】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【23】After the first cycle, she noticed improvement of paresthesia and IgG level reduced from 2,120 to 960 mg/dL (RR: 650 - 1,600). She has tolerated treatment well without any clinically significant adverse effect.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】* * *\n\n【26】CD, also known as angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, was first described in 1956 by Castleman et al \\[ 1 , 8 \\], and is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder \\[ 1 , 4 , 8 \\]. CD is clinically classified into unicentric when only a single enlarged lymph node or region of lymph nodes is involved, or multicentric (MCD) disease, which involves multiple lymph node regions \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【27】Once biopsy suggests CD, further investigation should be focused on excluding diseases with CD-like adenopathy and identifying associated conditions. Even if a lymph node biopsy was consistent with CD, multiple diseases have been associated with Castleman-like histopathologic features such as autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus \\[ 5 \\]. Nevertheless, in our patient, history and physical examination were not compatible and serologic tests excluded those diagnoses. Infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, CMV and EBV virus infection were excluded too.\n\n【28】The findings on neurologic examination made us consider possible associated conditions. The combination of polyneuropathy associated with a monoclonal protein is seen in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM) \\[ 4 , 6 \\], Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) \\[ 6 \\], amyloidosis, CD, and POEMS syndrome \\[ 4 , 6 \\]. Despite the presence of a monoclonal peak on SPEP, the diagnosis of MM seemed unlikely given the absence of osteolytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Furthermore, bone marrow showed less than 10% of clonal plasma cells and polyneuropathy is uncommon in classic MM. MGUS occurs in the absence of systemic findings, beyond plasma cell proliferative disorder. Like MM, the age onset of MGUS is typically older than for POEMS syndrome. WM may be complicated by lymphadenopathies, organomegalies and polyneuropathy; however, WM is classically associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of abnormal lymphoplasmacytic cells in bone marrow examination \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【29】Several authors have reported a close association between MCD and POEMS syndrome \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]. In a study with 113 patients with MCD, 32% met the criteria for the POEMS syndrome diagnosis \\[ 8 \\], it should always be ruled out since it changes the patient’s management.\n\n【30】POEMS syndrome, also known as osteosclerotic myeloma, Crow-Fukase syndrome or Takatsuki syndrome \\[ 3 , 7 \\], is a rare multisystemic disorder \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\], mainly affecting men in the fifth and sixth decades of life \\[ 4 , 6 , 9 \\]. Peripheral polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder are the two cardinal features, and when both are present, the diagnosis should be suspected.\n\n【31】According to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria, the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome requires the presence of both mandatory criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder), plus at least one major criterion (sclerotic bone lesions, CD and elevated VEGF), and at least one minor criteria (organomegaly, extravascular volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema and thrombocytosis or polycythemia) \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\].\n\n【32】The clinical features of POEMS syndrome widely differ among patients and all symptoms are not always present \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. Patients may experience a delay in the diagnosis \\[ 7 , 8 \\] with a median time from onset to diagnosis of 18 months \\[ 10 \\]. Prompt diagnosis is critical to reduce the morbidity rate and increase survival.\n\n【33】Our patient meets criteria for POEMS syndrome based on polyneuropathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, sclerotic bone lesions, CD, elevated VEGF, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperpigmentation, and extravascular overload. Additionally, weight loss is also present, and it is known to be associated \\[ 6 , 9 \\]. Thus, our patient was diagnosed with POEMS syndrome associated with CD.\n\n【34】Interestingly, the type of light chain found in POEMS syndrome is almost always lambda \\[ 4 \\- 6 , 9 \\], although kappa light chain could also be seen. It is not known if there is any clinical manifestation difference regarding the involved light chain.\n\n【35】The pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome remains unclear \\[ 2 \\- 4 , 7 \\], but VEGF associated with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 seems to play a crucial role \\[ 2 , 4 , 7 \\]. An elevated plasma VEGF supports the diagnosis \\[ 3 , 4 , 6 \\], and could be used to monitor disease activity \\[ 2 \\- 4 , 6 \\].\n\n【36】Treatment for the MCD associated with POEMS syndrome is focused on the management of the plasma cell proliferative disorder. Due to its rarity, treatment for the POEMS syndrome is not standardized \\[ 2 , 3 \\]; and recommendations are based on limited trial data, case series and anecdotal data \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. For patients with localized disease, defined as the presence of an isolated bone disease without clonal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, radiation therapy is potentially curative \\[ 3 \\]. Patients with disseminated bone marrow involvement, require treatment with standard MM therapy: high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 \\]. If treated appropriately, the prognosis of POEMS syndrome is good \\[ 2 , 6 \\] with large series reporting average survival around 13.7 years \\[ 9 \\]. POEMS syndrome associated with MCD is rarely seen and more reports are needed to understand its natural history.\n\n【37】**Learning points**\n\n【38】In patients with lymph node biopsy compatible with CD, POEMS syndrome should be sought after with appropriate clinical, laboratory, and radiographic workup. POEMS syndrome should be considered in the presence of peripheral polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder. Early diagnosis of POEMS syndrome requires a high index of suspicion and is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\n【39】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【40】None to declare.\n\n【41】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【42】None to declare.\n\n【43】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【44】None to declare.\n\n【45】**Informed Consent**\n\n【46】Informed consent was obtained.\n\n【47】**Author Contributions**\n\n【48】VP was responsible for conception and writing the manuscript.

The patient had normal blood pressure and was febrile. While urinalysis was negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase, it was 2+ for protein and 3+ for blood, and there were 3 - 6 leucocytes and too many erythrocytes to count per area in magnification. Urinary culture was sterile. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 5 × 3 × 3 cm multilocular cystic lesion in the right kidney’s upper pole that looked hyperintense in T1 images ( Fig. 1 ). On the right anterolateral wall of the bladder, there was an increase in wall thickness that reached into the bladder and was 25 × 19 × 35 mm in size ( Fig. 2 ). Concurrent laparoscopic right-partial nephrectomy and transurethral resection (TUR) were performed on the patient.\n\n|  _**Figure 1.** On axial fatty print T2A images, an exophytic placed cystic mass with a lobulated contour, and containing thick irregular septations and is 53 × 22 mm on its widest part._ |\n| --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n|  _**Figure 2.** On axial fatty print T2A images, on the 2 cm thick bladder wall, a tumoral increase in wall thickness that is 1.5 cm on its thickest part._ |\n| --- |\n\n【9】**Partial nephrectomy**\n\n【10】Partial nephrectomy material, which was 5 × 3 × 2 cm in size, capsular and nodular in appearance, had a fatty tissue.

According to this, each tumor should meet definitive malignancy criteria, one should be different from the other and it must be proved that one is not the metastasis of the other \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. When assessed according to these criteria, our case was categorized as a urinary system cancer with synchrone. Our patient had MCRCC in his kidneys and high-grade urothelial carcinoma in his bladder. For every malignancy, there were several known predisposing factors. A cancer patient, depending on carcinogenic exposure such as tobacco and alcohol usage, genetic factors, side effects due to chemo-radiotherapy, carries a higher risk for other malignancies \\[ 3 \\]. For our patient, the prominent one was tobacco usage. In addition, developments in diagnostic tools and increase in their use, and scanning other parts when one lesion was spotted had increased the percentage of identified cases with multiple tumors \\[ 2 \\]. Two different tumors occurring on a patient simultaneously worsen the prognosis. The prognosis of a patient with dual malignancy depends on the more aggressive one of these tumors \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In such a case, the tumors’ biological patterns, stages and the patient’s concomitant diseases are all important factors affecting the treatment strategy \\[ 3 \\]. Amongst urinary system tumors, the one with the highest rate of cooccurrence with a second malignancy is primary renal cell carcinoma (17%) \\[ 2 \\]. A study shows that the second malignancies occurring in patients with primary RCC are for men prostate, bladder, colon, and rectum Ca, and for women breast, bladder and gynecological tumors \\[ 2 \\]. Our case was diagnosed with MCRCC and high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. RCC constitutes 3% of all adult tumors. MCRCC is a rare subtype of RCC and its prognosis is good. In the literature, its incidence is quiet low amongst other renal tumors. Robinson first diagnosed it in 1957. The diagnostic criteria for MCRCC first defined by Eble and Bonsib in 1998 were as such: 1) There must be an expansile mass surrounded by a fibrous capsule. 2) The interior of the tumor should completely consist of cysts and septas. Expansile nodule or solid component should be smaller than 10% of the tumor. 3) Septas should contain clear cell groups \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Although most RCCs originate from proximal tubules, a detailed immunohistochemical study performed by Imura et al has shown that MCRCC originates from distal tubules \\[ 8 \\]. However, MCRCC’s pathology still has not been completely illuminated \\[ 9 \\]. In our case, as well, we observed that the tumor was surrounded by a fibrous capsule, and that it consisted of cysts that were divided by septas containing clear cell groups, and that the solid component was 2%. According to these findings, the diagnosis was MCRCC, and the stage was assessed as pT1. Urothelial carcinomas constitute 3.2% of all adult tumors. The stage and grade of the tumor are factors that affect prognosis. Depth of invasion is the most important factor that affects prognosis. For high graded tumors with muscle invasion, reoccurrence rate is 80%, progression rate is 60%, and 10-year survival rate is 35% \\[ 10 \\]. TUR BT material taken from our patient had a high-grade urothelial carcinoma that infiltrated muscle tissue. Although there are reports of synchronized kidney and bladder tumor cooccurrence in the literature, high-grade tumor of the bladder co-occurring with MCRCC, which is quiet rare as it is, has never been reported. Our case is the first one reporting these two tumors’ cooccurrence.\n\n【22】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【23】We declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article and that we do not have a direct financial or personal relation with any people or organizations.\n\n【24】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Translocations are the most frequently encountered in structural anomalies at 1/500 frequency. Translocations are divided into three sub-groups as reciprocal, centric fusion (Robertsonian) and insertional. Reciprocal translocations are formed by means of breakage in non-homolog chromosomes and the mutual change of location of the broken fragments. If after the translocation there is no loss of the fragments transmitted due to translocation or if a fragment is not added to the genome as an extra, this is called a balanced translocation. Reciprocal translocations do not mostly give phenotypic findings in event that they are balanced. However, phenotypic influence can be seen in the children of these individuals, subject to the partial monosomy or partial trisomy in the relevant chromosomes \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【3】One of the reasons of most frequent application to Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology is short stature. The major reasons scope familial short stature, constitutional delay, systematic diseases, lack of nutrition and endocrine disorders \\[ 2 \\]. Chromosomal examination is required for cases whose reason cannot be detected and especially has a dysmorphic appearance.\n\n【4】In this study, a case which was applied to the Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology for due to growth and development delay in which balanced reciprocal translocation scoping the 16 and 22 numbered chromosomes in a cytogenetic analysis conducted in the Genetic Diagnosis Laboratory was detected.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】Our patient was a 12-year-old boy who had applied to the Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology due to underdevelopment and short stature which was observed in four years. It was seen in the detailed family history that there is no member having a similar complaint. The patient’s, who has a neuromotor development in accordance with his peers, body weight was measured as 23 kg (< 3% percentile) and height as 124 cm (< 3% percentile). The bone age of the patient, who was assessed as prepubertal, was determined as 9. The hemogram, liver and kidney functionalty tests, serum electrolytes, urine and stool examinations in the laboratory examinations were normal. No significant finding was observed during the examinations for endocrine, infection and malabsorption.\n\n【8】A genetic examination was requested to determine the reason of the short stature. It was determined that the patient had a 46, XY, t(16;22)(p11;q13) chromosome constitution ( Figs. 1 , 2 ). The pedigree of the patient was issued and a chromosome analysis was performed his relatives, who could be reached, so as to determine the origin of the reciprocal translocation. It was determined that the patient’s mother (II-7) and the mother’s father (I-3) had the same chromosome constitution and the father, brother and sister had a normal karyotype ( Fig. 3 ). With the available findings, the patient was diagnosed with constitutional short stature.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Karyotype having 46, XY, t(16;22)(p11;q13) chromosome constitution (arrows show breakpoints)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Partial karyotype of case having 46, XY, t(16;22)(p11;q13) chromosome constitution (breakpoints have been indicated on the ideogram)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Family pedigree of the case carrying 46, XY, t(16;22)(p11;q13) translocation points._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】Peripheral blood was taken under sterile circumstanced with a heparinised injector from each case for the chromosome analysis and the whole blood technique, which is the modified technique of the macro-culture technique developed by Moorhead et al. was applied \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The preparations were stained with the Giemsa Banding Technique (GTG) and the chromosomes in the 30 - 50 metaphase plate was evaluated in terms of the numerical and structural anomalies and a karyotype was made from 25 banded metaphases. The cytogenetic analysis results were reported according to ISCN 1995 \\[ 5 \\].\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】It is expected that the breakages leading to the formation of balanced translocations do not cause great piece loss in the chromosomes, consequently, that there will not much gene loss in the person and no change will occur in the phenotype of the person. Nevertheless, apparently balanced translocations form a widespread type of chromosomal anomalies that can be seen both in patients that have an abnormal phenotype and healthy individuals that have not been influenced. Approximately one fifth of these anomalies, which are mostly familial, is de novo \\[ 6 \\]. The risk of finding abnormal phenotypes in individuals having de novo regulation is approximately 6.7% \\[ 7 \\]. There are balanced translocations holding different chromosomes associated with short stature or development delay are available in literature \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Cytogenetically balanced reciprocal translocation is also observed in our case that has short stature exists. According to the literature data at hand, this case is the first balanced reciprocal translocation case scoping 16 and 22 chromosomes with structural short stature.\n\n【18】Finding the same translocation in our case’s mother and mother’s father, who have normal phenotypes, however both of them having a normal height during their childhood ages, makes our patient even more interesting. Along with complying with structural short stature with the available findings, we wonder what the final height will be.\n\n【19】Even under the best of circumstances, changes under 4 kb (kilobasis) cannot be analysed with chromosome analysis \\[ 10 \\]. The familial balanced translocation’s phenotypic affects can change due to imbalanced de novo regulations on a molecular level, uniparental disomy associated with translocationed chromosomes, disruption of genes located in the breakpoints, translocation indicating mosaicism in another tissue or modification of expression of the gene carried somewhere else in the genome \\[ 11 \\- 13 \\]. Hence, Baptista et al. \\[ 14 \\] have stated that as a result of the study in which they have conducted the molecular cytogenetic analysis of breakpoints in balanced reciprocal translocation carriers by means of fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) and array CGH methods, balanced reciprocal translocations do not bear imbalance in breakpoints in phenotypically normal patients and that the breakpoints in the translocations of patients, who are phenotypically abnormal, is mainly associated with cryptic imbalances. In addition to this, the mutations in the SHOX (Short Stature Homeobox) gene located in the pseudoaotomosal regions of the X and Y chromosomes’ short arms are held responsible of idiopathic short stature \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. In our case, a mutation that has occurred in the SHOX gene independently from reciprocal translocation may have also led too short stature. It was planned to research the translocation on a molecular level in our patient, however, the family has refused to this request to do socio-economic reasons. The answer to whether or not the translocation has left damage on a molecular level has not been found, however, the patient has been taken under periodic monitoring.\n\n【20】As a result, balanced reciprocal translocation may appear under a specific part of structural short statures. However, in order to give a healthy genetic counseling to individuals who have abnormal phenotypes such as short stature in which balanced reciprocal translocation is detected in the chromosome analysis, advanced molecular cytogenetic and molecular genetic methods should be referred to especially for the breakpoints regions.\n\n【21】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, the patient presents with acute joint pain, swelling, warmth, and restricted movement. The most commonly involved joint (50% of cases) is the knee. Other frequently involved joints are the wrists, ankles, and hips \\[ 1 \\]. Although the causative organisms are multiple, _Staphylococcus aureus_ (SA) (including methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA)) remains the most common bacterium infecting adult joints. Multiple risk factors were identified for SA, including the presence of a prosthetic joint. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) occurs in 1 to 2 percent of joint replacement surgeries. The risk of PJI is greater for knee arthroplasty than hip arthroplasty \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】We present a case of a 75-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a right swollen painful knee along with fever. The patient had undergone total knee replacement 4 years prior to presentation for osteoarthritis. The patient was admitted and systemic antibiotics with vancomycin 1g intravenous (IV) Q12 h and ceftriaxone 2g IV daily were started empirically after cultures were taken. The patient underwent arthroscopic lavage of the knee with retention of the prosthesis. Blood cultures as well as articular fluid cultures grew _Enterococcus faecalis_ sensitive to ampicillin. The patient was switched to IV ampicillin and gentamicin. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis and subsequent blood cultures were negative. A colonoscopy revealed the presence of a malignant colon mass that was subsequently removed surgically at a later stage. The patient received ampicillin 2 g every 4 h for 6 weeks and gentamicin 80 mg every 8 h for 2 weeks with a favorable clinical and biological response. Upon discharge, he was placed on oral amoxicillin 1g twice daily for a duration of 2 years. The patient now has been off antibiotics for 3 years, and is showing no signs of recurrence of his infection on his last follow-up.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】PJIs present a major therapeutic challenge for both healthcare providers and patients. The treatment of PJI usually includes both surgery and antimicrobial therapy. Surgical options include resection arthroplasty with reimplantation (in one or two stages), resection arthroplasty in the absence of subsequent hardware reimplantation, debridement and retention of prosthesis or amputation. A study done on 645 hips and 1,145 knees compared the different treatment strategies of PJIs. The two-stage protocol therapy was found to have the lowest risk for both PJI recurrence and need for additional surgery, making it the method of choice \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【9】The timing of appearance of the infection is important in guiding the choice of treatment: for instance, prosthesis removal is required in the majority of delayed-onset and late-onset PJI.\n\n【10】DAIR refers to a regimen of debridement, antibiotics, irrigation, and retention of the prosthesis. This method of treatment has shown to be usually effective for acute PJI when there is a well-fixed prosthesis without a sinus tract. It is curative in up to 71% of cases. It is also done in patients for whom surgery is contraindicated, but with a higher risk of relapse \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【11】Several studies showed the effect of prosthesis retention on PJI. A retrospective study done on 91 patients showed that 66% were infection free at a 3-year follow-up \\[ 4 \\]. Two other retrospective studies showed suppressive antibiotic therapy to be a good alternative in patients who were not candidates for revision surgery. This was proven for infections caused by Staphylococcal and Streptococcal pathogens \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Moreover, two large multicenter studies (including more than 340 patients each) followed up PJI managed with DAIR, one involving _Streptococcus_ sp., the other involving _Staphylococcus_ sp., both showed a failure of approximately 45% \\[ 7 \\- 8 \\]. Nevertheless, one of the studies proved that the exchange of removable components, the early use of rifampin and long treatment with β-lactams, were independent factors of success prediction \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【12】Following initial antibiotic therapy for retained PJI, indefinite antibiotic suppression with an oral antimicrobial agent may be warranted. Studies showed that for treatment of staphylococcal PJI managed with debridement and component retention, initial therapy consists of 2 to 6 weeks of pathogen-specific IV therapy in combination with rifampin (300 to 450 mg orally twice daily or 600 mg once daily). Subsequent therapy for knee PJI consists of 6 months of pathogen-specific oral therapy in combination with rifampin (vs. 3 months for hip, elbow, shoulder or ankle PJI). For treatment of retained PJI due to organisms other than _S. aureus_ , initial therapy consists of 4 to 6 weeks of pathogen-specific IV or oral therapy with high bioavailability \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【13】As noted above, most available studies were mainly done on _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus_ species. A retrospective study done between 1999 and 2014 on 87 patients with enterococcal PJI showed an overall treatment success in 45 patients. Only 39.4% were treated by irrigation and debridement. This study stated that enterococcal PJI has a high rate of treatment failure and that combination antibiotic therapy seems to have better outcomes \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【14】Two retrospective studies on PJI due to Enterococcus species treated with DAIR were done in January 2015. Duijf et al collected a sample of 44 patients with an early PJI (< 3 months after the implantation) with _Enterococcus_ sp. The mean follow-up was 678 days. The success rate was of 66%, as the prosthesis was retained in 29 patients. As for the antibiotic regimen, patients were either treated with teicoplanin 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, vancomycin or amoxicillin 500 mg or a combination of these antibiotics for 3 months postoperatively \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【15】Tornero et al collected a sample of 94 patients, where only early PJIs were included (< 90 days from index surgery). The mean follow-up period was also 678 days. The success rate was between 62 and 66% which was considered far from the 88% success rate obtained in staphylococcal infections treated with DAIR and a combination of levofloxacin and rifampin. At the end of this study, the author stated the importance of finding a fixed antibiotic regimen for PJI due to Enterococcus species \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【16】Our patient had an enterococcal prosthetic knee infection that occurred 4 years after the prosthesis was placed. Despite the late onset PJI, we elected to retain the prosthesis and attempt arthroscopic lavage along with aggressive IV antibiotics followed by 2 years of oral amoxicillin. The decision to stop the antibiotics was difficult given the risk of recurrence of the infection but after a long discussion with the patient, and given the fact that he was completely asymptomatic for 2 years with inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) within normal range all along, the decision was made to stop the oral antibiotics with a close and careful follow-up. The patient has been off oral antibiotics for 3 years now with no signs of recurrence of the infection.\n\n【17】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【18】The authors have no conflict of interest to report.\n\n【19】**Funding Support**\n\n【20】None.\n\n【21】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

CAV has been found to cause up to 1.5% of all angina hospital admissions \\[ 2 \\]. Patients with CAV typically present with symptoms consistent with typical angina; however, they can also present with fatal arrhythmias and/or acute myocardial infarction \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Lanza et al found that approximately 17% of patients with ST-segment changes secondary to CAV had evidence of myocardial infarction \\[ 2 \\]. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of CAV can be delayed due to unremarkable electrocardiograms (ECGs), negative stress testing, and the absence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary angiography \\[ 2 \\]. Subsequently, CAV has primarily become a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【3】CAV can be observed during coronary angiography secondary to an acute vasoconstriction episode, mechanical stimulation of the artery with engagement of the catheter, or an intra-coronary injection of an arterial vasoconstrictor \\[ 2 \\]. In comparison, CAV is rarely captured during cardiac stress testing. There are published case reports that have demonstrated CAV during adenosine stress testing \\[ 4 \\]. Despite similar adenosine receptor activation properties, regadenoson has been less commonly associated with CAV during stress testing \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. There have been very few cases of CAV captured immediately following regadenoson stress testing. To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) secondary to CAV following regadenoson stress testing. We report a unique case of an inferior STEMI secondary to CAV immediately following regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging in a patient with a history of CAD and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】**Investigations**\n\n【7】A 60-year-old female presented with recurrent episodes of typical angina. Her history was significant for CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and tobacco use. She underwent CABG 12 years prior with a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery and the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery. In the setting of known CAD with previous CABG and symptoms suggestive of typical angina we elected to proceed with a regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion scan. As part of our protocol, a baseline ECG was obtained showing normal sinus rhythm and non-specific ST wave changes ( Fig. 1 ). Our patient then received administration of regadenoson (0.4 mg intravenous (IV) over 15 s) and immediately developed severe substernal chest pressure with associated shortness of breath.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Electrocardiogram prior to regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging demonstrating normal sinus rhythm and nonspecific ST changes._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】**Diagnosis**\n\n【10】A stat ECG was performed demonstrating ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) consistent with an acute inferior STEMI ( Fig. 2 ). She was given nitroglycerin and emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for left heart catheterization with possible percutaneous intervention. Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate nonobstructive CAD but no explanation for her sudden onset symptoms or ECG changes ( Fig. 3 ). Follow-up ECGs demonstrated complete resolution of ST-segment elevations. Initial and serial troponins were unremarkable at 0.00 ng/mL, 0.03 ng/mL and 0.01 ng/mL, respectively (reference range: 0.00 - 0.78). In further review of her outpatient records, the patient had a documented history of catheter-induced CAV of the right coronary artery during a previous coronary angiogram. The diagnosis of CAV was made based on her symptomatology, post-stress test ECG findings, rapid resolution of pain with nitroglycerin, unremarkable coronary angiographic findings, and in the setting of prior catheter-induced vasospasm.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Electrocardiogram demonstrating inferior ST-segment elevation with associated reciprocal changes immediately following regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Right coronary artery angiography demonstrating no angiographically significant stenosis to explain the patient’s acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】**Treatment**\n\n【15】Medical management with amlodipine and isosorbide was initiated.\n\n【16】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【17】After starting medical therapy, she had no recurrence of her symptoms.

She is regularly seen in our clinic and has not reported any new concerns or adverse events.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】* * *\n\n【20】CAV is a rare condition that is caused by reversible subtotal or total occlusion of a coronary artery branch \\[ 1 \\]. Physiologically, CAV is the result of local coronary smooth muscle hyperactivity leading to coronary artery occlusion \\[ 7 \\]. Prompt diagnosis of CAV is crucial to prevent many serious life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and fatal arrhythmias \\[ 2 \\]. According to Lanza et al, patients with STEMI secondary to CAV have been shown to have an increased risk of major cardiac events \\[ 2 \\]. STEMI secondary to CAV is usually a diagnosis of exclusion; however, it can be captured on a stat ECG or during emergent coronary angiography immediately following an acute chest pain presentation \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. In comparison, the diagnosis of CAV without ST-elevation or other ischemic changes on ECG is frequently delayed given that most diagnostic testing is unremarkable \\[ 2 \\]. Previously, the administration of IV ergonovine or acetylcholine was used to provoke CAV; however, they have since fallen out of favor due to severe side effects.\n\n【21】Although approximately 40% of patients with STEMI secondary to CAV are found to have > 50% coronary stenosis on cardiac catheterization, CAD and CAV do not share identical risk factors \\[ 2 , 10 \\]. According to Hung et al, older age, smoking, and elevated C-reactive protein levels were found to be the main risk factors for CAV \\[ 10 \\]. Patients with prior coronary stenting have also been known to develop CAV involving the coronary smooth muscle just distal to the stent. Our patient was found to have mild to moderate nonobstructive CAD in the setting of an acute STEMI secondary to CAV, despite her history of CAD. This case demonstrates that regardless of cardiac history, CAV should be a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n【22】Prior reports of patients who presented as a STEMI secondary to CAV during pharmacologic cardiac stress imaging are limited. The pharmacologic agent, regadenoson, has been found to cause coronary vasoconstriction during stress testing due to its adenosine receptor activation properties. To the best of our knowledge, prior cases of regadenoson associated CAV have demonstrated either no ECG changes or non-specific ischemic ECG changes \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Our case is unique in that our patient demonstrated classic findings of an inferior STEMI secondary to CAV immediately following regadenoson stress testing. We were able to capture active CAV causing an inferior STEMI during stress myocardial perfusion imaging. This case stresses the importance of acknowledging CAV as a cause of STEMI during pharmacologic stress testing when using an adenosine receptor agonist.\n\n【23】Prompt diagnosis and treatment of CAV is crucial to prevent life-threatening conditions such as STEMI and fatal arrhythmias \\[ 2 \\]. The diagnosis of CAV is challenging and typically requires a process of elimination that utilizes both symptoms and diagnostic testing such as ECG, cardiac catheterization, and/or stress testing. Given the vasoconstrictive pathophysiology of CAV, the primary treatment is coronary vasodilation with nitrates \\[ 9 \\]. Commonly, patients presenting with STEMI secondary to CAV with an obvious vasospastic lesion receive intra-coronary nitrate injections during emergent coronary angiography \\[ 8 \\]. Our patient’s symptoms resolved completely after the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. This emphasizes the importance of immediate administration of nitrates to patients with suspected or known CAV that present with symptoms consistent with angina or ACS.\n\n【24】**Conclusions**\n\n【25】CAV is an uncommon condition of reversible coronary artery occlusion that is rarely captured during pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Few case reports have reported CAV during regadenoson stress testing. We report a very unusual case of an inferior STEMI secondary to CAV immediately following a regadenoson stress test in a patient with only mild to moderate nonobstructive CAD on angiogram. Our case highlights the importance of considering CAV as the cause of STEMI during pharmacologic stress testing, especially with the use of adenosine receptor agonists. It also emphasizes the importance of nitrates in the treatment of CAV to prevent life-threatening cardiac events.\n\n【26】**Learning points**\n\n【27】CAV can cause symptoms and ECG findings consistent with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to CAV can occur during regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging and should be considered in all patients that develop angina during pharmacologic stress testing. Regardless of cardiac history, CAV should be a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with angina. Lastly, prompt diagnosis and treatment of CAV is crucial to prevent major cardiac events.\n\n【28】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【29】None to declare.\n\n【30】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【31】None to declare.\n\n【32】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【33】None to declare.\n\n【34】**Informed Consent**\n\n【35】Informed consent was obtained.\n\n【36】**Author Contributions**\n\n【37】All authors reviewed the literature and helped write the manuscript.

Eight weeks earlier he had developed bradycardia and dizziness, and he underwent pacing generator replacement.\n\n【8】His past medical history includes two myocardial infarctions (30 and 15 years ago). A dual chamber rate adaptive (DDDR) pacemaker was implanted 11 years ago to manage his grade 3 atrioventricular (AV) block. He had been hypertensive for more than 30 years. Mild myocardial hypertrophy with inferior wall hypokinesia but normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) were seen on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 1.5 years before along with left atrial (LA) dilatation and moderate mitral and aortic sclerosis with trivial regurgitation without stenosis and normal right-sided cavities.\n\n【9】Initial workup on admission included an electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrated regular atrial driven ventricular pacing. Laboratory signs of an acute infection with increased leukocyte count (white blood cell (WBC)) (21 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with marked neutrophilia (74%) and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (106 mg/L, summary in Table 1 ) were present. Chest X-ray demonstrated a round opacity measuring approximately 1 cm in the upper field of the left lung. Otherwise, the findings were normal. Pacing electrodes in the right chambers of the heart were intact. Abdominal ultrasound showed a slightly inhomogeneous mass measuring 2.8 × 2.4 cm in the lower part of the right lobe of the liver. Differential diagnoses included a metastasis or a primary tumor. Neither lymphadenopathy nor ascites was reported.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Laboratory Results_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Whole body computed tomography (CT) was performed on the same day. The abdomen was scanned in native arterial and portal phase and thorax in arterial phase for pulmonary embolism. On unenhanced CT scan, the liver mass appeared isodense to liver parenchyma with smooth edges and bulging outside of the liver contours. There was no significant enhancement in the arterial phase, and the mass was slightly hypodense in the portal phase ( Fig. 1a ). The main trunk of the pulmonary artery (PA) and the right PA were dilated at 4 cm and 3.5 cm respectively. There was a large filling defect representing a thrombus in the upper lobe branch of the right PA and smaller filling defects in the lower lobe subsegmental branches of the right PA ( Fig. 1b ). A pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter was detected in the upper lobe of the left lung, which was thought to be benign due to low CT density. No other pulmonary nodules or enlarged lymph nodes were found ( Fig. 1c ). Incidentally, a significant filling defect in the right atrium (RA) of the heart with subtotal obliteration of the appendage was found. The atrial pacing lead was attached to the RA appendage (RAA) next to the mass. The mass was thought to represent a thrombus ( Fig. 1d ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) Contrast-enhanced CT scan performed on the day of admission.

CT: computed tomography._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】On the two-dimensional (2D) TTE there was a mass seen in the RA with a dimension of 4.2 × 2.0 cm. Its structure was described inhomogeneous, with echogenicity of the soft tissue and without calcifications. The mass seemed to be attached to the lateral wall of the RA and surrounded the pacemaker electrode fixed in the RAA. Part of the mass was moving through the tricuspid valve orifice into the right ventricle (RV) during diastole but did not cause any obstruction ( Fig. 2a, b ). The function of both ventricles was normal. There was mild hypertrophy of the left ventricle, and both atria were slightly dilated. There were no signs of pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion. Based on the clinical findings and the findings of the CT scan suspicion of the thrombotic mass was raised.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** (a) TTE (subcostal view) in systole. A mass is detected in the right atrium (arrow). (b) TTE in diastole. The same mass is noticed in the right ventricular inflow tract (arrow). (c) TEE in systole.

Mobile masses have moved into the RV inflow tract (arrow). TTE: transthoracic echocardiogram; TEE: transesophageal echocardiography; RAA: right atrial appendage._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】The history of recent pacing generator change, signs and symptoms of suspicion on acute infection or electrode endocarditis (fever, marked WBC and high CRP) justified commencing antibacterial therapy. Cefuroxime 4.5 g/day was given intravenously (IV). Due to marked thrombocytopenia (66 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) enoxaparin was administrated in a reduced dose (6,000 U/day). The patient was clinically stable, and his blood cultures were negative. Notwithstanding this, fever, WBC, and CRP remained at the same level as on admission. Therefore, antibacterial treatment was switched on the fifth day (ampicillin + sulbactam 4.5 g/day IV and gentamicin 240 mg/day IV). Fondaparinux (2.5 - 7.5 mg) was injected subcutaneously instead of enoxaparin due to a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Despite these changes in treatment, he remained febrile for the next 5 days the temperature was between 38.2 and 38.5 °C. He also complained of pain in the whole body.\n\n【19】In the purpose of follow-up of the dynamics another TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed 9 days after the first TTE. In the RA we found a multilocular mass with several interconnected immobile and mobile structures with soft tissue echogenicity attached to the lateral wall. The dimensions had increased up to 6.0 × 2.6 cm, and it was partly moving into the RV during diastole without obstructing the inflow to the tricuspid orifice ( Fig. 2c, d ). Besides, an immobile part of the mass of 5.5 × 3.0 cm was seen in the RAA, which extended to the ostium of the superior vena cava (SVC) not obstructing the blood flow. The immobile mass in the RAA surrounded the pacing electrode without infiltrating the atrial wall or causing pericardial effusion. Furthermore, no vegetations were suspected on the cusps of the tricuspid valve and the pacemaker electrodes.\n\n【20】ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax was performed 10 days after the first whole-body CT to depict the mass in more detail. A large irregularly shaped soft tissue mass with signs of contrast enhancement in the portal phase, measuring 5.8 × 4.4 × 5.6 cm was found extending into the RAA. Compared to the previous CT scan, the structure had grown in size, partially surrounding the atrial pacing lead. The second 5.0 × 2.2 cm mass was mobile, moving between the RA and RV.\n\n【21】The ventricular pacing lead was separated from the mass. Malignant looking upper lobe nodule of the left lung had enlarged, and a small area of subpleural right lung consolidation had developed there as well. There was still a sizeable inhomogeneous density thrombus filling the upper lobe branch of the right PA, which raised the possibility of a tumor thrombus. The expansion in the right lobe of the liver also raised suspicion of a malignant process. Taking into account the potential metastatic nodule in the left lung, potentially malignant mass in the liver and enhancing mass in the RA of the heart, there was strong suspicion for metastatic disease with the potential primary tumor being in the liver. There were neither signs of infection in the area of the implanted pacemaker nor deep vein thrombosis on ultrasound.\n\n【22】Although the patient’s high fever subsided only temporarily, SatO <sub>2 </sub> was 88% (with O <sub>2 </sub> 2 L/min), platelets (PLTs) dropped to 25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (it was thought to be associated with the increased consumption), WBC and CRP did not decrease, and the patient remained clinically stable. Repeated blood cultures were negative. We could not exclude infection of the pacing electrodes. Therefore, we suspected that the structures could still be covered by thrombotic mass, which can result in an endocarditis-like clinical picture. Since the patient refused all invasive diagnostic procedures (including a biopsy), his conservative management was based on clinical symptoms. Piperacillin with tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g/day IV was replaced after 4 days with imipenem and cilastatin 0.5 g/0.5 g/day IV, and also vancomycin 2 - 3 g/day was given IV. Subcutaneous antithrombotic treatment was administered as well.\n\n【23】Four days later magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was performed in purpose to characterise the hepatic lesion in detail. It was T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense with signs of marked diffusion restriction. We could not acquire contrast-enhanced series due to his inability to hold the breath. The mass showed a slight late enhancement in the delayed phase series. Additionally, a capsule-like peripheral enhancement was detected with characteristics not typical for a primary liver tumor. It was unclassifiable, possibly an atypical hemangioma. The differential diagnosis also included a hypovascular metastasis.\n\n【24】Three days later the patient’s general condition destabilised, he complained of dyspnea, tachypnea, weakness, and melena developed. His Hb decreased to 95 g/L, PLT to 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, WBC increased (37 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). On gastroscopy at the large curvature, an ulcer (0.7 cm) covered with fibrin and surrounded with petechiae and a polyp (0.3 cm) were found. Despite the reduction of the dose of fondaparinux (2.5 mg, subcutaneously) and infusion of red blood cells, PLTs and freshly frozen plasma the patient deceased 21 days after his admission.\n\n【25】Post mortem examination of the heart revealed a large white-greyish nodal mass in the RA with a diameter of 6.5 cm, which was tightly fixed to the lateral wall. Tumor mass extended into the RAA and extended partially through the ostium of the tricuspid valve into the ventricle, not obstructing it. In the ostium of the SVC, a non-occlusive tumor (2.0 × 5.0 cm) was found of the same consistency and color, covered with thrombotic mass. The RA pacing electrode, which was fixed to the appendage, was surrounded by a tumor and thrombotic masses. The ventricular pacing electrode was fixed in the apical septal area of the RV. Both electrodes were covered with thrombotic masses. Macroscopically and histologically there were no findings for endocarditis or vegetations. The LV was moderately hypertrophic, and the mitral annulus was calcified. Two post-infarct scars measuring up to 2.0 cm were found in the septal and posterolateral walls of the LV. Coronary tree revealed diffuse non-occlusive atherosclerotic plaque disease.\n\n【26】In the apical area of the left lung, there was a roundish grey nodule measuring 1.5 cm. In the small branches of the pulmonary arteries, many small emboli (histologically confirmed as osteosarcomas) were found bilaterally. In the lower lobes of both lungs, there was partial atelectasis with 900 and 1,100 mL of pleural fluid respectively.\n\n【27】In the central part of the right hepatic lobe, a roundish pinkish-white tumor was found in subcapsular location consisting of some small nodes and measuring 3.5 cm.\n\n【28】The prostate revealed a 4.5 cm yellow-pink honeycomb-like lobulated nodule. The sigmoid colon demonstrated moderate diverticulitis. The abdominal or thoracic cavities were free of enlarged lymph nodes.\n\n【29】Histology was performed in the Departments of Pathology of North Estonia Medical Centre and the Hospital Graz II. The tumors in the heart ( Fig. 3 ) and the lungs ( Fig. 4a, b ) had a myxoid appearance and consisted of the spindle and pleomorphic rhabdoid and sometimes signet-ring cells, which were immunohistochemically negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), desmin and smooth muscle actin, but at least partially positive for osteonectin. Focally, osteoid-like material could be seen. In the sections from the heart, the tumor was found within the lumen, but it did not infiltrate the myocardium. The hepatic tumor revealed a solid and papillary architecture and consisted of polygonal cells with eosinophilic and clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry was positive for hepatocyte antigen and cytokeratins but negative for osteonectin ( Fig. 4c ). The histological diagnosis of a poorly differentiated (high-grade) sarcoma with osteogenic differentiation in the heart with metastasis to both lungs was established. The hepatic tumor was considered a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Sections from the prostate demonstrated a moderately differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) ( Fig. 4d ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** (a) Primary cardiac extraskeletal osteosarcoma.

Also, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma were detected.\n\n【36】Usually, diagnostic problems arise in the case of a previously undiagnosed tumor in the heart. Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Both primary and metastatic cardiac osteosarcomas are extremely rare, and less than 100 cases of antemortem diagnosis have been described altogether \\[ 7 , 9 \\- 12 \\]. Diagnosis can be more complicated in a patient with a cardiac pacemaker with a variety of diagnostic possibilities such as a thrombus, a caseous calcification of the valvular annulus, primary or metastatic tumor, abscess or endocarditis \\[ 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【37】In our case the fast and exact path to the diagnosis was complicated due to contradictions in history: recently changed pacing generator, the unusual clinical course of the disease simulating inflammation, tumor or thrombus surrounding the electrodes in the right heart, liver mass, nodules in the lung and filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Since the clinical course was simulating pacemaker-endocarditis or a thrombus on the electrode, antibacterial treatment was initiated. Diagnostic alternatives considered were a primary malignant tumor in the liver with metastasis into the right side of the heart and to the lungs and a primary heart tumor with metastases to the lungs \\[ 3 , 17 , 18 \\]. Since antibacterial treatment with different and combined antibiotics was ineffective, a strong suspicion of a malignant tumor (above all in liver) arose, with a concept based on earlier clinical observations that most of the metastases located in the right chambers of the heart \\[ 13 , 14 \\] and up to 3% of patients with carcinomas have cardiac metastases identified at autopsy. Liver malignancies are one of the most frequent tumors to spread directly through inferior vena cava \\[ 19 \\]. Our patient did not complain of aching bones; clinically a tumor was not suspected, and a bone scan was not performed. Nevertheless, metastatic skeletal tumor thrombi most often from femur and humerus extending to the heart have been described \\[ 20 \\- 22 \\]. In rare cases, extra-skeletal osteosarcoma may spread via the hematogenous route to an unusual cardiac localisation such as the LA \\[ 11 , 14 \\].\n\n【38】Primary cardiac osteosarcoma of the right side of the heart is extremely rare \\[ 23 , 24 \\]. The clinical manifestations, regions of metastases (more than 50% to the lungs), imaging features, and laboratory tests are similar to other types of primary cardiac tumors \\[ 17 , 25 \\]. Calcifications on imaging (CT) are crucial for differentiating osteosarcoma \\[ 26 \\], but we encountered a case that was difficult to diagnose because imaging revealed no calcifications. The pathogenesis of primary cardiac osteosarcoma is not clear. It could develop through metaplasia of connective tissue or by malignant degeneration of embryonic somatic residues, which arise from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells in the myocardium and transform into active osteoblasts \\[ 23 , 27 \\]. Proposed etiological factors are a mechanical injury by causative agents and radiotherapy \\[ 28 \\].\n\n【39】Furthermore, the heart is known to have a skeleton. Namely, fibrous trigone and annulus are the essential parts of it. Histologically the annulus has fibrotic and elastic fibres, and this structure is also in continuity with valvular leaflet tissue, the atrium and the ventricles. The hypothesis of the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma could be based on malignant metaplasia and transformation of fibrotic and elastic fibres, which makes up the trigone \\[ 29 \\].\n\n【40】We also considered the opportunity that the undifferentiated cardiac tumor developed from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. We very carefully investigated both tumors histologically and by several immunohistochemical markers and did not find any similarity based on histomorphological and immunohistochemical features. Therefore, we concluded that it is more likely that the tumors in the heart and the liver are independent neoplasms, the former with pulmonary metastases. However, we did not perform molecular analyses to rule out a metastatic disease in the heart completely. Acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate are common in advanced age and therefore, not an unexpected finding.\n\n【41】Multiple primary malignancies are common only in 3-5% of tumors \\[ 30 \\]. Despite its low incidence, the association of two malignancies in a single patient has been widely reported in the literature, while only a relatively small number (0.5%) of three malignancies have been described including primary cardiac sarcomas \\[ 30 \\- 32 \\]. Some cases of cardiac sarcomas (pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma) in pacemaker patients are described \\[ 16 , 33 \\]. At the same time, there are no clinical reports of patients (with or without a cardiac pacemaker) with primary osteosarcoma of the heart after double carcinomas of the liver and prostate. Only immunological studies have demonstrated that novel cytokine interleukin-32 (IL-32) could be involved in cancer development, including prostate, liver and heart (adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and osteosarcoma) \\[ 34 \\].\n\n【42】**Conclusions**\n\n【43】We conclude that there is most likely a collision of two carcinomas: hepatocellular carcinoma and osteogenic sarcoma of the heart. The prostatic adenocarcinoma is a common finding in senior men. From the provided histology it is more likely that the tumors of the heart and the liver are independent. However, without molecular analysis (which was not performed) de-differentiation in a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded entirely. Injury of an electrode as a mechanical factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma is not yet confirmed.\n\n【44】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【45】None to declare.\n\n【46】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【47】None to declare.\n\n【48】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【49】None to declare.\n\n【50】**Informed Consent**\n\n【51】Not applicable.\n\n【52】**Author Contributions**\n\n【53】TL, KK and LK were involved in patient care and writing the manuscript.

Villous atrophy in CD that leads to calcium and vitamin D malabsorption that results in reduction of calcium intake and secondary hyperparathyroidism are the main reasons for the increased rate of osteoporosis and risk for fractures previously reported \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Prevalence of such disease is approximately 1% worldwide \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Besides gluten-free diet (GFD), which is the main approach in these patients, vitamin D, calcium and bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice. We report here the case of a 37-year-old woman with biannual history of extreme fatigue, chest pain, paresthesia, leg pain and severe weight loss during the last 12 months. Whole body bone scintigraphy revealed severe osteoporosis and extreme hyperparathyroidism with low calcemia. CD was diagnosed by means of positive serologic tests for antibodies and was confirmed through histopathological examination.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 37-year-old woman presented with weight loss, low appetite, and joint pain mainly localized in knees, ankles, lower back and chest. She was hospitalized in the neurology department for pain and paresthesia of the low extremities. The patient presented normal physical and mental development. During that period, she underwent osteodensitometry that revealed severe osteoporosis with diffuse focal fields in the joints, after which she was asked for parathyroid hormone level (PTH) examination that was found to be very high, 351.8 pg/mL (normal values 12.0 - 72.0 pg/mL) and high alkaline phosphatase, 291 U/L (normal values 37 - 98 UI/L for her age). She presented with hypocalcemia and iron deficiency anemia unresponsive to oral iron therapy. We were asked for an endocrinologist consultation and she was transferred immediately in the Clinic of Endocrinology for further examination and treatment with the diagnosis of suspected hyperthyroidism secondary to CD.\n\n【6】She presented no previous history of metabolic disease, her parents were alive, and she was married and had three healthy children. During 2 years, she was taking analgetics, when she had hard pain. She was living with her family and was unemployed. During the last year, she complained about difficulties to walk, morning stiffness, poor energy, pain in the chest and/or lower back especially during the supine rest, and difficulty standing up for a long time. She had abdominal pain and nausea and sometimes experienced vomiting after eating. She presented a weight loss of 10 kg in 12 months. During the physical examination, she was found to present demineralization of her teeth which she had artificially replaced. She presented no regional lymphadenopathy, no joints deformity, proximal muscle weakness and generalized muscle atrophy. Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs were positive. No pathologic findings were present in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and painful epigastrium on deep palpation was found. She was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol.\n\n【7】**Investigations and diagnosis**\n\n【8】Laboratory analyses revealed high PTH, low calcium and 25(OH) vitamin D ( Table 1 ) and anemia with low iron value ( Table 2 ).\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Biochemical Analysis Before and After Treatment_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click to view | _**Table 2.** Hemogram Before and After the Treatment_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Liver function tests were within the normal range as were also renal specific analyses. Inflammatory markers were negative. Thyroid function tests were normal. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed degenerative bone changes. Chest X-ray was normal. Ultrasound of abdomen showed normal liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreatic head and neck. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan showed marked changes which were interpreted as indicative of low bone mass for her age and severe osteoporosis ( Table 3 ).\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 3.** DXA Scan Results Before and After the Treatment_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】In the meantime, whole body bone scintigraphy revealed diffuse osteoporosis characteristic for metabolic bone disease ( Fig. 1 ). Celiac serology showed positive anti-gliadin (20.1 AU/mL) and negative anti-tissue transglutaminase (5.3 AU/mL). Thyroid functional tests were within normal range. Serum _Helicobacter pylori_ and brucellosis tests (ASHB) were negative. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed mild sub mucosal lesion. On histology, total resorptive villous depletion and intensive mononuclear inflammatory infiltration were revealed. Colonoscopy was also performed and internal grade II hemorrhoid nodules were found. She presented sinusal rhythm, 60 beat per minute cardiac frequency and no pathologic signs were found on electrocardiogram (ECG). Thyroid and neck ultrasound was performed revealing an isoecogenic nodule with hypoecogenic limits, diameter of 10 mm, in the low pole posterior of the right thyroid lobe, which remained same even after the treatment. CD was diagnosed through serologic testes, based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria \\[ 5 \\] for severe osteoporosis due to secondary hyperthyroidism and severe concomitant iron deficiency anemia.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Whole body scintigraphy of bone in admission and after the treatment._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】**Treatment**\n\n【19】GFD was immediately ordered and intramuscular cholecalciferol and intravenous calcium gluconate were administered, in order to replace vitamin D stores in the body. Moreover, intravenous medications for anemia were given. Oral daily vitamin D was continued after relieving gastrointestinal symptoms through GFD, approximately 50,000 UI per week in the beginning and after based on vitamin D serum value. Treatment with bisphosphonate was not necessary.\n\n【20】**Outcome and follow-up**\n\n【21】The patient was followed up monthly, for 3 months, during which period she showed marked clinical and biochemical improvement. After 3 months, she gained 7 kg. She did not experience paresthesia or joint pain and she felt better in general.\n\n【22】On follow-up analyses, vitamin D, PTH and calcium were satisfactory improved ( Table 1 ), DXA scan revealed significant improvement from marked osteoporosis to osteopenia ( Table 3 ) and full blood count also presented significant improvement ( Table 2 ).\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】* * *\n\n【25】We described the case of a young woman with osteoporosis and clinical, biochemical and imagery specific examinations.\n\n【26】Except in chronic renal failure, secondary hyperparathyroidism can be due to CD related to vitamin D and calcium malabsorption, which can increase bone turnover.\n\n【27】In CD, there is a loss of callous surface area \\[ 6 \\] with unabsorbed calcium binding to excess fatty acids in the intestinal lumen as a result of fat malabsorption \\[ 7 \\], causing a negative calcium balance. Malabsorption occurred due to the loss of absorptive area from autoimmune process caused from gliadin. Hypocalcemia in the meantime stimulates PTH to correct this imbalance. People at risk of developing this disease carry alleles encoding HLA-DQ2 or DQ8, leading to an autoimmune reaction that is characteristic of the early stages of CD \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【28】Patients with CD present nutritional deficiencies, most commonly iron, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin D, folate, and zinc deficiencies \\[ 9 \\]. Neurologic disorders have already been reported in association with malabsorption of vitamin B12, folate, copper, and vitamin D \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【29】Patients with CD should be evaluated for common concomitant autoimmune conditions, such as thyroid and liver diseases, as well as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D, and vitamin B12.\n\n【30】The main treatment is GFD, which alone has been shown to cause significant improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) and showed results similar to those achieved by bisphosphonates in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, with a reduction in bone remodeling \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. GFD is also associated with reduction in PTH levels, improvement in vitamin D levels and other biochemical parameters in CD patients \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【31】In our patient with CD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, there was a significant improvement in DXA scan, clinical, biochemical parameters after 10 months of GFD, calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The significant improvement in BMD within a short time in our patient could be attributed to her relatively young age, early diagnosis of CD, proper compliance, adherence to GFD and adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium.\n\n【32】It is recommended that patients with CD should be examined at least twice in their first year after diagnosis in order to monitor symptoms, serologic features, nutrition, dietary adherence and body mass index \\[ 15-17 \\]; meanwhile DXA scan evaluation for BMD is recommended during the first year after diagnosis \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【33】In the meantime, bone loss relationship with PTH gives us important information for monitoring the treatment of CD, hence identifying those patients at particular risk of osteoporosis.\n\n【34】Estimation of PTH is crucial when facilities for the measurement of BMD are not uniformly available.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CD has to be considered during the evaluation of patients with weight loss, hypocalcemia, anemia and non-specific metabolic, neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【37】Early treatment with GFD, vitamin D and calcium cures osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism in the meantime.\n\n【38】Treatment with bisphosphonates is not necessarily needed in the treatment of osteoporosis from CD.\n\n【39】For populations with high prevalence for vitamin D deficiency or osteomalacia, biochemical evaluation for suspicious cases should include measurement of PTH, calcium, vitamin D, whole blood count and specific antibodies for CD, in order for such cases not to be overlooked and remain undiagnosed.\n\n【40】**Conflicts of Interest**\n\n【41】We declare no conflicts of interest in this case report.\n\n【42】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The neurologic symptoms in these two cases are very useful for determining of the location of GP.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Patient 1**\n\n【6】An 80-year-old man without contributory medical history suddenly presented with leftward BL, right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and left-sided hypalgesia and thermohypoesthesia in the territory of the maxillary as well as mandibular nerve in August 2012. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. Laboratory examination was within normal ranges. Chest X-ray finding was normal. Electrocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities.

Moreover, because unilateral INO was observed in four of these five cases, the authors speculated that GP might run in the vicinity of the MLF \\[ 1 \\]. Tsuda et al \\[ 2 \\] noted a case of BL with hypalgesia and thermophypoesthesia in the territory of all divisions of the trigeminal nerve caused by a rostral pontine tegmentum infarction, and stated that GP might run in the vicinity of the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons. In our present patient 1, in addition to leftward BL, right-sided INO and left-sided hypalgesia and thermohypoesthesia in the territory of the maxillary as well as mandibular nerve was caused by infarction in the right rostral pontine tegmentum. This neurologic finding denoted that GP might run in between MLF and the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons.\n\n【14】NPPE is defined as unilateral INO with exotropia of the contralateral eye \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. NPPE without alternating exotropia is caused by complete involvement of the MLF as well as incomplete damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) \\[ 3 \\]. On the other hand, comitant skew deviation may be induced by abnormalities in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum and thalamus, and is considered as a poorly localizing sign of posterior fossa dysfunction \\[ 5 \\]. However, because comitant skew deviation with INO frequently develops, it is considered that damage to the MLF may cause comitant skew deviation \\[ 6 \\]. In our present patient 2, in addition to rightward BL, left-sided NPPE without alternating exotropia, and comitant skew deviation were observed. These neuro-ophthalmologic findings suggested that GP might run in the vicinity of MLF as well as PPRF in the rostral pons.\n\n【15】In conclusion, we emphasize that GP may run in between the MLF and ventral trigemino-thalamic tract as well as in the vicinity of PPRF in the rostral pons, based on the neurologic symptoms of our two patients.\n\n【16】**Grant Support**\n\n【17】None.\n\n【18】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

FNN extending into both the temporal fossa and the cerebellopontine angle occurs in only 3% of all cases, and almost always present with facial nerve palsy and hearing loss persisting for 4 months to 17 years \\[ 2 \\]. FNN has various manifestations, including facial palsy, hearing loss, vestibular weakness, a palpable parotid mass and even no symptom depending on its size and site \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Unfortunately, facial nerve is very resistant to compression, and often facial nerve paralysis or a facial weakness is not present, for this a normal facial nerve function occurs in 27.3% of all patients with FNNs \\[ 4 \\]. Preoperative diagnosis of FNN manifesting no facial nerve paresis is quite difficult. We present a case of FNN who presented with features suggestive of middle temporal fossa multicystic tumor but without manifesting facial nerve palsy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 44-year-old man was admitted to a local clinic, because of left tinnitus with decreased hearing in the left ear for 7 years. On admission, physical examination showed no facial palsy, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) demonstrated a multicystic mass sized 5.1 × 4.0 × 4.5 cm at the left middle cranial fossa and the meatus acusticus internus ( Fig. 1A, B ). Left internal auditory canal diameter was enlarged, and the mass extended from the internal auditory porus to the middle fossa, transecting the petrous bone. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as having neurinoma with extending into the temporal fossa. But MRI arrived at a diagnosis of FNN rather than acoustic neurinoma, since the petrous bone was eroded along the facial canal toward the geniculate ganglion. The surgery was made by left infratemporal fossa approaches with microneurosurgery. During the operation, the surgeons found that the tympanic cavity and sinuses were filled with reddish-gray neoplasm, which eroded the mastoid and petrous bone and invaded into the cranial cavity. Then, xanchromatic fluid was aspirated from the cystic mass in the middle cranial fossa. Tumor was totally extirpated under the facial nerve monitoring. Facial nerve was preserved. The diagnosis of neurinoma was confirmed by postoperative histological examination. Histologic examination of the specimen showed schwannoma which was included hypercelularity, xsantomatic histiocytic reaction, hyalinization and compact elongated cells (× 100, H&E). Postoperatively, on neurological examination, facial weakness with House-Brackmann Grade II was noted. After 8 months, facial weakness was resolved spontaneously. The patient showed a complete hearing loss in the left ear, but the facial sensation and visual acuity were normal. The patient was followed up for 2 years, and no enlargement of internal acoustic segment tumor recurrence was detected ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** MRI scans showed an enhancing cerebellopontine angle fusiform tumor: (A) with considerable internal auditory canal and middle cranial fossa multicystic tumor; (B) the multicystic tumor occupied the petrous bone and extended anteriorly and upwardly into the left middle cranial fossa._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Postoperative coronal T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium enhancement. The multicystic tumor was resected by the left side middle cranial fossa craniotomy (infratemporal approach). But internal acoustic canal tumor was not removed. It has been observed for 2 years._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】FNNs involving the middle cranial fossa are especially rare \\[ 3 \\]. It has been noted that there is a predilection for FNN to arise from the area of geniculate ganglion, which might be attributable to the major structural reorganization occurring between the labyrinthine and tympanic segments of the facial nerve \\[ 1 \\]. FNN is a rare cause of facial palsy accounting for less than 5% of cases \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Insidious onset of facial palsy, recurrent facial palsy and persistent facial palsy was after 12 weeks. This case has not paresis of his face. Enlargement of the auditory canal and erosion of the petrous bone along the facial nerve proximal to the geniculate ganglion might have prevented compression of the facial nerve and consequent impairment of its function. As mentioned, the absence of facial nerve dysfunction is probably attributable to the bony erosion, which allowed adequate space for the facial nerve.\n\n【12】MRI is preferred to detect an FNN, even in a small size, and to clearly delineate the location and the extent of the tumors, which is particularly important for the resection of the tumor and the preservation of the facial nerve. MRI of an FNN shows mildly hypo- or hyper-intense to grey matter on T1-weighted images and hyper-intense on T2-wighted images, which can be markedly enhanced by using gadolinium. Cystic change commonly shown in other neurinomas is occasionally seen in large facial neurinomas \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The initial accurate diagnosis of FNNs involving the middle cranial fossa is challenging. Differential diagnosis of dumbbell-shaped tumor located in the middle cranial fossa and cerebellopontine angle includes cholesteatoma, trigeminal schwannoma (TS), cavernous hemangioma and acoustic schwannoma (AS).\n\n【13】In this case, enlargement of the internal auditory canal and erosion of the middle portion of the petrous bone by bone CT, postoperatively, lead to the preoperative diagnosis of facial schwannoma despite the normal facial nerve function.\n\n【14】**Grant Support**\n\n【15】There is no grant.\n\n【16】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【17】There is no conflict of interest.\n\n【18】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Seventy percent of patients with exercise-induced LBBB were shown to have significant coronary artery disease \\[ 2 \\]. Patients with exercise-induced LBBB without coronary artery disease have a good prognosis compared to patients with coronary artery disease, despite frequent development of permanent LBBB \\[ 3 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 59-year-old Caucasian female was referred for exercise treadmill test for evaluation of atypical chest pain. She described abrupt onset of retrosternal, non-radiating sharp chest pain that developed while she was walking, and continued without increase in intensity throughout the day while active. The pain finally abated after she went to sleep. She reported history of palpitations, but no other associated symptoms. The patient had a past medical history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and metabolic syndrome. Her medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) 10/10 mg at bedtime, levothyroxine 112 mcg daily, and lisinopril 10 mg daily. She had family history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, but no premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death. She denied tobacco or alcohol use; she was a retired school teacher.

She was able to exercise for 8 min, achieving 9 METS. Her peak heart rate was 140 BPM (87% of maximal predicted heart rate) without ischemic ST changes, at which rate she developed LBBB, and complained of her usual chest discomfort ( Fig. 2 ). The test was terminated, and the patient was allowed to rest. Her rhythm continued to be LBBB until, at a heart rate of 110 BPM, a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) resulted in a compensatory pause and resolution of the LBBB ( Fig. 3 ). Shortly thereafter, her chest pain resolved. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, no wall motion abnormalities, and angiographically normal coronary arteries.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Electrocardiographic tracing at peak exercise, with development of rate-related LBBB at 140 BPM._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Electrocardiographic tracing 2 min and 30 sec into recovery, with resolution of rate-related LBBB at a heart rate of 110 BPM, following a PVC._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】The association of exercise-induced LBBB and chest pain has been previously reported \\[ 4 \\]. Virtanen et al \\[ 5 \\] reported a triad of exertional chest discomfort, transient rate-dependent LBBB, and normal coronary arteries in patients with clinical symptoms resembling effort angina. They, however, noted that the symptom onset was abrupt (simultaneous with the appearance of LBBB); the pain was localized, non-radiating; and that palpitation and “walk through” phenomenon were often present. Our patient’s chest pain shared those features, which were reproduced during the stress test, as her pain was localized, abrupt, coinciding with the development of LBBB, and resolved after resolution of the LBBB. The heart rate at which the LBBB occurred in our patient was 140 BPM, which also suggests a non-ischemic etiology. Vasey et al \\[ 6 \\] found no coronary disease in patients who developed exercise-induced LBBB at a heart rate of 125 BPM or higher, while the incidence of coronary artery disease was 50% when the LBBB developed at a heart rate less than 125 BPM.\n\n【15】It is interesting to note that our patient had no chest pain while her heart rate was 140 BPM before developing LBBB. However, after developing LBBB, her chest pain persisted despite the decrease in the heart rate to 110 BPM, until the LBBB resolved. This indicates that her chest pain was related to the development of LBBB, rather than an increase in heart rate or ischemia. Issa et al \\[ 7 \\] explained that during slowing of the heart rate, rate-related intraventricular conduction often fails to normalize at the critical cycle length which initiated the aberration. Therefore, the heart rate has to slow down more than would be expected to reestablish normal conduction. In our patient, a compensatory pause following a PVC apparently provided the critical cycle length necessary for normal conduction. The absence of ischemic ECG changes before the development of LBBB during exercise, and after the resolution of the LBBB at rest, provides further clue that her chest pain and LBBB were unlikely to be ischemic.\n\n【16】Little is known about the mechanism of chest pain in exercise-induced LBBB. One explanation is that abrupt ventricular asynergy as a result of altered electrical conduction may be perceived as chest pain. Virtanen et al \\[ 5 \\] performed kinetocardiographic recordings which showed sudden paradoxical cardiac motion at the onset of LBBB, followed by chest pain. Normal cardiac motion was restored with normal conduction. Mora et al \\[ 8 \\] found increased lactate concentration in the coronary sinus of a patient with exercise-induced LBBB, which may be indicative of localized coronary insufficiency. Ozcan et al \\[ 9 \\] reported exercise-induced LBBB associated with slow coronary flow in a patient complaining of exertional angina.\n\n【17】There is no specific treatment available for chest pain caused by rate-related LBBB. Heinsimer et al \\[ 10 \\] reported a 47-year-old female with chest pain associated with rate-related LBBB whose heart rate at onset of LBBB, after 3 months of exercise training, rose from 133 to 175 BPM. She no longer developed symptoms during routine daily activities or exercise. Shenoy and Sattur \\[ 11 \\] reported a 48-year-old man with chest pain associated with rate-related LBBB whose symptoms resolved after starting a low-dose non-selective beta-blocker. Tanaka et al \\[ 12 \\] reported a 53-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction (EF) 35%) and exercise-induced LBBB at 100 BPM; after 5 months of carvedilol and candesartan therapy for CHF, his EF improved to 49%, and the heart rate at which LBBB was induced increased to 126 BPM.\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Exercise-induced LBBB is rare, and while it independently predicts a higher risk of death and major cardiac events, especially in patients with underlying significant coronary artery disease, it appears to be associated with good prognosis in the absence of significant coronary disease. It renders the ECG uninterpretable for ischemia, and thereby mandates termination of the stress test, especially in the presence of chest pain. There are several clues presented which may point towards a non-ischemic etiology. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism of this condition, and investigate potential therapies.\n\n【20】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, conventional endometrial sensitivity assay is not an innovative technology in infertility. In order to exceed the limit of conventional endometrial sensitivity assay, as a new tool for the treatment of the infertile patients with recurrent implantation failures, the endometrial receptivity array (ERA) test is developed \\[ 1 \\]. The ERA test is used in order to diagnose the receptivity of the endometrium by a specific transcriptomic signature \\[ 1 \\]. Furthermore, the ERA examines 236 genes expressed at different stages of the endometrial cycle and thereby defines the endometrium as either receptive or non-receptive. As a result, it is shown that the ERA test can identify window of implantation (WOI) and adjust the timing of embryo transfer \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【3】However, the improvement of the reproductive outcomes for the infertile patients with recurrent implantation failures by ERA test is controversial \\[ 3 \\- 4 \\]. Therefore, innovativeness of ERA is not clear.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 34-year-old woman with infertility visited at our clinic in 2014. Semen examination, hysterosalpingography, hormone examination and anti-sperm antibody were carried out for the patient at our clinic. However, abnormalities were not observed. Therefore, as unexplained infertility, we conducted Timing Method (four times) and AIH (three times) for the patient, but it did not lead to pregnancy and shifted to _in vitro_ fertilization. Specifically, the Timing Method is a treatment that diagnoses ovulation day and adjusts the timing of sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the AIH means artificial insemination by husband.\n\n【7】After that, until August 2016, thawed frozen embryos with good morphological blastocysts were transplanted for the patient under hormone replacement therapy cycle (11 times). However, the patient could not experience live birth. During that period the patient experienced chemical pregnancy (four times), miscarriage (one time) and negative pregnancy reaction (six times). Specifically, negative pregnancy reactions mean that chemical pregnancy and/or clinical pregnancy is not observed. From these clinical processes, we diagnosed the patient as recurrent implantation failure (RIF). Furthermore, although we performed coagulation test, anti-phospholipid antibody test, blood test of thyroid function and hysteroscopy as cause search of RIF, abnormalities were not observed for the patient.\n\n【8】Therefore, we tried to identify window of implantation and adjust the timing of thawed frozen embryo transfer by ERA test with the patient’s informed consent. As a result, the patient could experience live birth by a cesarean section (38 weeks, 3,272 g, female) in 2017. The baby survives without birth defects.\n\n【9】Furthermore, we confirm that the work in this study was conducted in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Moreover, all of the experiments were approved by the institutional review board of Oak Clinic in Japan. In addition, our report was written in accordance with Case Report guidelines (CARE: https://www.care-statement.org/care-checklist.html).\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】In our report, ERA test was conducted for the patient with refractory RIF, and the pregnancy condition continued smoothly, and it was possible to get a live birth. This is the first successful birth case from a patient with refractory RIF by using ERA test in Japan, although we have introduced ERA test from November, 2014 for the first time in Japan.\n\n【13】The results of ERA test are checked at the genetic levels \\[ 2 \\]. When we can find that the patient’s WOI is shifted by the ERA test, it is possible to identify the WOI period of the patient and adjust the optimal timing of embryo transfer \\[ 2 \\]. Therefore, as embryo transfer can be performed at an appropriate timing by clarifying the WOI period at a genetic level, the improvement of the reproductive outcomes would be expected. From the above, we think that the ERA test may realize precision medicine \\[ 5 \\] in the field of reproductive medicine.\n\n【14】However, from the viewpoint of evidence-based medicine, in order to truly clarify the effectiveness of ERA test, it is necessary to conduct randomized controlled trials and to verify the results. Therefore, we participate in an international randomized controlled trial (prospective, randomized, multicenter, international, open label, controlled trial: UMIN ID, UMIN000022044; Fig. 1 ) as the only Japanese institute.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** ERA RCT consortium participant sites._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【17】We are grateful to all members at the Oak Clinic in Japan.\n\n【18】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【19】The present study is self-funded.\n\n【20】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【21】We have no conflict of interest.\n\n【22】**Informed Consent**\n\n【23】The patient’s informed consent was obtained for the preparation of this case report.\n\n【24】**Author Contributions**\n\n【25】All authors contributed equally to this work.\n\n【26】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Most of the cases are diagnosed in patients over the age of 40 and these are more commonly seen in males than females \\[ 3-5 \\]. Oral lipomas have been reported to occur in a variety of locations including the salivary glands, buccal mucosa, gingiva, lip, tongue and floor of the mouth. It appears as a single or lobulated long-standing painless lesion with either a sessile or a pedunculated base. Different histopathological variants have been recognized, such as fibrolipomas, angiolipomas, myolipomas, spindle cell lipomas, chondroid lipomas, chondrolipomas and osteolipomas. Among the histopathological variants, lipomas with cartilaginous metaplasia, called chondrolipomas, are uncommon in the oral cavity \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. The appearance of chondrolipomas in a child is very unusual. Here, we describe a case of chondrolipoma of the tongue in a 16-year-old boy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 16-year-old boy presented with a painless mass on the middle of the right lateral border of tongue ( Fig. 1 ). The lesion was first noticed about 15 years earlier which was a hazelnut-sized mass by his family and had not grown remarkably so far. He noticed an increase in the size of the mass over the past 1 year. At the time of presentation it was causing problems with speech and eating, and was subject to repeated trauma due to accidental biting. Intraoral clinical examination revealed a medium hard, multilobuler, irregular mass, consistency measuring approximately 6 × 4 cm in its major diamater, which was located along the midline of the right lateral border of the tongue with no evidence of submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy. No ulceration was noted. A detailed systemic examination and laboratory investigations were within the normal limits. His family history was unremarkable. Radiological investigations showed a well-circumscribed fatty mass in the right side of the tongue ( Fig. 2 ). Histological examination of biopsy revealed it was composed of mature adipose tissue arranged in lobules that are seperated by fibrous tissue septa. Under general anesthesia, the lesion was removed totally with following dropped 1 cm strong border ( Fig. 3 ). Microscopic examination revealed a benign neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes that were seperated by fibrous connective tissue and presence of a central area of mature cartilaginous tissue that exhibited lacune filled with chondrocytes ( Fig. 4 , 5 ). No evidence of malignant change was found and chondrolipoma of the tongue was diagnosed. A follow-up period of 2 years shows complete healing with no recurrence. Informed consent of the patient has been obtained.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Clinical image shows mass orginating from right lateral border of tongue._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Radiological investigation shows a well-demarked lesion at the lateral border of the tongue._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Clinical image shows the excised specimen._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Histopathological image shows island of mature cartilage, surrounded by mature fat cells (H&E stain, × 40)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Well-demarcated proliferation of mature fat cells arranged in lobules separated by connective fibrous tissue septa._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】Lingual masses are seen very rare in children. They are predominantly benign and congenital. Available data show that lesions are usually small (0.5 - 2.5 cm) and duration of disease before diagnosis ranges from 2 months to 2 years. Therefore, the present case is peculiar due to its long duration (approximately 16 years) and its size (approximately 6 × 4 cm). The peak incidence of lipomas is during the fifth and sixth decade of life \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. Our case is a 16-year-old boy. Bures and Barnes reported that a benign mesenchymoma may represent a hamartoma if the lesion occurs in an individual younger than 25 years, associated with other congenital anomalies or hamartomatous lesions or with a phacomatosis \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, detailed systemic examination and laboratory investigations were within the normal limits.\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of chondrolipomas is uncertain. Although the exact origin of the fat cells, chondroblasts remains controversial, it is generally accepted that they develop from different types of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The main mechanisms is differantiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells into adipose tissue and cartilage \\[ 3 , 5 , 8 \\]. Hietanen and Makinen \\[ 6 \\] and Maes and Eulderink \\[ 9 \\] also suggest that the tumor is essentially a lipoma or chondroma and the accompanying cartilage or fat is a form of metaplastic stromal reaction. Mesenchymal cells can be modified by local or systemic factors such as local trauma and prolonged ischemia \\[ 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 \\]. In our case, the lesion was first noticed about 15 years earlier which was a hazelnut-sized mass by his family and he noticed an increase in the size of the mass over the past 1 year. Nakano et al \\[ 11 \\] suggest that the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), latent TGF-β binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) might be impotant in the pathogenesis of chondrolipoma.\n\n【19】Lipomas are occasionally altered by metaplastic elements that form an intrinsic part of the tumor, the commonest variant being fibrolipoma \\[ 6 , 10 \\]. There is not any cartilage tissue in tongue normally. It is possible that the present case started out as either lipoma or chondroma. Exceptionally in lipomas of large size and long duration, cartilaginous metaplasia may ocur. Lingual chondrolipoma or lipochondroma was first described in 1989 in a 47-year-old male who presented with a firm mass less than 1 cm in diamater at the lateral border of tongue \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【20】Chondrolipomas are characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes associated with the deposition of mature cartilaginous tissue on hystopathological examination \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. Despite the similar nomenclature, chondrolipomas are different from chondroid lipomas. Chondroid lipomas are characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes arranged in the extracellular matrix with chondroid, myxoid and hyalinized areas \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. In contrast to chondroid lipomas, chondrolipomas do not contain lipoblast-like cells and are easily identified as benign tumors \\[ 3 , 10 \\]. In addition, chondroid lipomas can be differentiated from myxoid liposarcomas and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas by the lack of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, characteristic vascular patern, and the presence of both chondroid and fat cells \\[ 3 , 12 \\]. The treatment of these tumors consists of surgical excision, with no cases of recurrence having been reported. Chondrolipomas are well-demarcated tumors and can therefore be easily removed. Chondrolipoma shows a clear separation between the cartilaginous component and the fatty component, which makes the appearance of this lesion more benign.\n\n【21】Other differantial diagnosis of chondrolipomas includes osteocartilaginous choristomas and malign tumors. Osteocartilaginous choristomas differ from chondrolipomas by the formation of abundant bone or cartilage, despite poor fat tissue, upon microscopic examination. Chondroid lipomas can be differantiated from chondrolipomas by the lack of lipoblast-like features. Malignant tumors can be distinguished from chondrolipomas because they usually present cytologic features of malignancy such as mitotic activity and nuclear atypia \\[ 3 , 8 , 13 \\].\n\n【22】The treatment of choice for these tumors consists of surgical excision. They are well-demarcated tumors and can therefore be easily removed. After complete surgical excision no recurrence was described \\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 \\].\n\n【23】In conclusion, chondrolipoma was rarely seen in tongue especially in childhood. The pathogenesis is inconclusive. Although it is a benign tumor, a complete surgical excision must be done because of its localization and potential complications.\n\n【24】**Conflicts of Interest**\n\n【25】There are not any potential conflicts of interest.\n\n【26】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The inner core, referred to as the adrenal medulla, is derived from neural crest cells. The outer adrenal cortex is derived from the mesothelium. Neoplasms may arise from both compartments and present with different clinical symptoms. Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine secreting tumor derived from the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, whereas adrenocortical adenoma is a benign epithelial tumor derived from adrenal cortical cells. Coexistence of adrenocortical adenoma and pheochromocytoma in the same gland is extremely rare. Only few cases have been reported in the English literature \\[ 1 \\- 9 \\]. Herein, we report another case of adrenal collision tumor comprised of an adrenocortical adenoma and a pheochromocytoma in the same adrenal gland and emphasize the importance of conducting biochemical tests for pheochromocytoma before performing surgery to avoid intraoperative and postoperative complications of adrenal masses.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 38-year-old female patient was referred to the outpatient clinics of Hacettepe University Community Hospital with the complaint of palpitation and chest pain, as well as tremor present for the past couple of years. Six years ago she was diagnosed with nodular goiter and hypothyroidism. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a single bilobular mass in the right adrenal gland with prominent fatty components in the posterior part and intense opacification in the anterior part consistent with adrenocortical adenoma, whereas the left adrenal gland was normal. Elevated metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were detected in spot urine test. Right adrenalectomy was performed laparoscopically with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma which was made upon biochemical, clinical and radiographic evaluation.\n\n【6】**Pathological Findings**\n\n【7】Right adrenalectomy specimen composed of three fragments having a total weight of 36 grams was examined ( Fig. 1A ). Macroscopically, the cut surface showed a brown nodule measuring 3 cm in diameter, a hemorrhagic nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter and a yellowish-orange nodule measuring 2.5 cm in diameter ( Fig. 1B ). Microscopically, the first two nodules consisted of neoplastic cells growing in a trabecular pattern with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei ( Fig. 2A ). These two nodules had fibrotic capsules demarcating them from the adrenal gland. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells in both nodules diffusely stained with chromogranin ( Fig. 2B ) and sustantecular cells were positive for S-100 ( Fig. 2C ) whereas neoplastic cells were negative for inhibin ( Fig. 2D ), calretinin and melan-A. Overall, these findings confirmed that the nodules had characteristic features of pheochromocytoma. Sections taken from the last nodule showed neoplastic cells with lipidized or eosinophilic cytoplasm and uniform nuclei ( Fig. 3A ). The nodule had a thin capsule separating it from the gland. The neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for inhibin ( Fig. 3B ), focally positive for calretinin and melan-A, whereas they were negative for chromogranin in immunohistochemical study. This nodule was diagnosed as an adrenocortical adenoma. The histologic findings of the nodule were also consistent with adrenocortical adenoma according to the criteria of Weiss. There was no evidence of necrosis, mitosis, capsular or vascular invasion in both neoplasms and both had a low Ki-67 proliferation index.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** A: Macroscopic appearance of the “adrenal mass” specimen composed of three pieces with a total weight of 36 grams.

To the best of our knowledge, the current case presents the eleventh of such cases. A corticomedullary mixed tumor, which has been defined as a single tumor mass originating from both adrenocortical and adrenal medullary cells, is also extremely rare \\[ 10 \\].\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Review of the English Literature for Adrenocortical Adenoma and Pheochromocytoma in the Same Adrenal Gland_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】A collision tumor is a rare condition in which two independent neoplasms without a substantial histologic admixture at the interface coexist adjacent to each other \\[ 11 \\]. Based on this principle, the present case represents an extremely rare example of an unusual combination of adrenocortical adenoma and pheochromocytoma, collision type. The larger tissue specimen demonstrated neuroendocrine morphology, whereas the smaller tissue specimen showed typical characteristics of adrenocortical adenoma of the adrenal gland.\n\n【18】The most commonly described collision tumor in the adrenal gland is adrenal adenoma with myelolipoma. The other collision tumors reported in the adrenal glands include cases such as metastasis into an adenoma or myelolipoma and pheochromocytoma with adenoma or myelolipoma. Although collision tumors are rare, they have been reported in many other sites, including the meninges, the chest, the bowel, the hepatobiliary system, the lymph nodes and the genitourinary tract \\[ 11 \\]. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the mechanism of the collision tumors \\[ 12 \\]. The occurrence of two primary tumors in continuity with each other incidentally is the simplest explanation. Alternatively, two different tumors may occur in contiguity because of similar alterations in the region induced by the same carcinogenic stimuli. Another possibility is that the changes created by the first tumor in the microenvironment may lead to the development of the second tumor. Since the adrenal cortex and medulla are different in their embryological origin, structure and function, it is hard to speculate on the pathogenesis of two different tumors. The release of corticotropin from pheochromocytoma is one of the major mechanisms in the development of adrenal hyperplasia and/or adenoma by stimulating the adrenal cortex. Another mechanism considered to take part in the development of adrenal hyperplasia and/or adenoma, is that the secretion of catecholamines by pheochromocytoma stimulate the anterior pituitary gland and in turn the release of corticotrophin \\[ 13 \\]. However, it still remains unclear why most patients with pheochromocytoma do not have an accompanying adrenocortical adenoma in the adrenal glands.\n\n【19】Although pheochromocytomas are rare, occurring in 0.01- 0.1% of hypertensive patients, it should be noted that they may have life-threatening consequences. The tumors occur most frequently in the 4th and 5th decades. The classical symptoms of pheochromocytoma include headache, palpitation, and diaphoresis in association with severe hypertension. However, one should keep in mind that some patients are totally asymptomatic while others have intermittent symptoms. The hallmark clinical manifestation of pheochromocytoma is hypertension seen in only about half of the patients, paroxysmal in about one third and absent in about one fifth \\[ 14 \\]. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually established with biochemical studies, i.e., measurements of catecholamines and/or its metabolites in urine and/or plasma, followed by clinic and radiographic evaluation. In the present case, although the presence of single bilobular mass at computed tomography (CT) suggested a diagnosis of an adrenocortical adenoma, biochemical tests performed prior to surgery strongly suggested a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma with elevated metanephrine and normetanephrine levels in the urine. Histopathological evaluation of the adrenalectomy material confirmed the presence of both adrenocortical adenoma and pheochromocytoma in the same gland.\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】In conclusion, even if the radiographic evaluation of an adrenal mass suggests adrenocortical adenoma, all clinicians need to be aware of the probability of pheochromocytoma to avoid intraoperative hypertensive crisis and/or postoperative adrenal insufficiency. Clinical suspicion is the single most important factor in the identification of pheochromocytoma. Thus, we strongly recommend conducting biochemical tests to rule out pheochromocytoma for every adrenal mass before surgery \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Decubitus ulcers typically occur over bony skin such as the buttocks. These wounds can be common in spinal cord injury patients with limited mobility. The number of patients with pressure ulcers is estimated to be approximately 1.3 - 3 million in the USA and the number of hospitalized patients has increased by more than 75% between 1993 and 2006 \\[ 1 \\]. Pressure ulcers can be classified according to four stages. Stage 1 is discolored but not broken skin. Stage 2 is a shallow open red-pink wound and may have a blister. Stage 3 manifests as a full thickness loss of skin with visible adipose tissue. Stage 4 is full thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed muscle and bone \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【3】Mesenchymal/multipotential stem cells or MSCs are thought to have regenerative capacity and can be isolated from a variety of tissue sources including adipose or fat tissue \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are MSCs which have been collected from fat. Easily accessible subcutaneous fat from the abdomen or the flanks can be collected via mini-lipoaspiration and contains high amounts of ADSCs \\[ 6 \\]. Both ADSCs and MSCs are multi-potential cells with ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, muscle and fat and can be expanded in culture. The expression of different cytokines and growth factors by these cells is thought to be part of a healing cascade and new blood vessel formation. By stimulating a local inflammation process and immunomodulatory/paracrine response, this signaling can enable the repair of damaged tissue \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. MSCs/ADSCs are currently being considered in various diseases and injuries \\[ 5 , 9 \\]. The exploitation of stem cells ability to promote a healing cascade is a new paradigm in medicine. The cells are anti-inflammatory and promote angiogenesis \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. This complex signaling process causes the homing of other cells to the area to repair damaged tissue and regeneration occurs.\n\n【4】The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is the mixture of cells from adipose tissue collected via mini-lipoaspiration after the adipocytes (fat cells) have been depleted. The remaining cells include a large percentage of ADSCs. The population is known to have a large percentage of CD34 <sup>+ </sup> cells which have a role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis \\[ 12 \\]. CD34 is a protein expressed on the cellular membrane of ADSCs and pericytes. Fat tissue has a network of microvessels and capillaries which are rich in pericytes \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【5】It is believed that these cells help to build and maintain an endothelial network. Because SVF contains a variety of regenerative cells and growth factors and can be offered as an out-patient surgical procedure, it represents a novel therapeutic tool for many indications. Further, fat tissue is quickly becoming the preferred source for stem cells as compared to bone marrow due to the relative higher amounts of ADSCs/MSCs and lower amounts of pro-inflammatory leukocytes \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【6】Local injection of SVF may reduce inflammation and promote healing/normal tissue formation as opposed to scar tissue. SVF can be collected bed side after a simple adipose tissue collection making it a practical surgical procedure for physicians to provide to their patients \\[ 16 \\]. Comella et al reported on the safety of SVF in a variety of indications with various delivery methods. Other publications have demonstrated success of SVF for specific conditions including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \\[ 17 \\], congestive heart failure \\[ 18 \\], degenerative disc disease \\[ 19 \\], osteoarthritis/orthopedics \\[ 20 \\- 24 \\], radiation necrosis \\[ 25 \\], sclerosis \\[ 26 \\], tendinopathy \\[ 27 \\], xerostomia \\[ 28 \\], psoriasis \\[ 29 \\] and multiple sclerosis \\[ 30 \\]. The following is a case report and to our knowledge first in man a single injection of SVF and PRP into a chronic non-healing stage 3 ulcer in a patient with an incomplete spinal cord injury.\n\n| **Patients and Methods** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】The following case report was completed on a 49-year-old male with prior incomplete spinal cord injury with stage 3 decubitus ulcer on the buttocks. The wound had persisted for 8 months with full thickness loss of epidermis and no exposure of underlying bone, muscle or tendon. Prior interventions include wound cleansing with hydrogen peroxide, wound dressing with eusol (bleach, boric acid and water) and gauze, and pressure relief by changing of position in bed.\n\n【10】The patient provided written informed consent to undergo the experimental clinical procedure as well as consent to publication of outcomes, images and data. Using less than 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000) and a 30-gauge 0.5-inch needle, local infiltration blebs allowed small incisions with a no. 11 blade for cannula entry. Areas to be treated were then infiltrated with a standard tumescent solution (500 mL normal saline, 20 mL of lidocaine (2%), 10 mL of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/mL)) with a 14 gauge × 15 cm infiltration cannula. After good tumescence was achieved, a harvester cannula was introduced through the entry points. Adipose tissue was then aspirated gently using the 2.1-mm small cannula.\n\n【11】The total fat collected was approximately 60 mL minus the infranate. Using a commercially available collection kit and enzyme (Adipocell™ Enzyme; US Stem Cell, Inc. Sunrise, FL), the fat was processed to obtain the SVF. Briefly, the fat was washed using a balanced salt solution to remove red blood cells and debris and then placed on enzyme to digest collagen bonds in the extracellular matrix. The SVF was separated by density after centrifugation. After washing, the cells were prepared for final suspension in platelet-rich plasma (PRP).\n\n【12】To create PRP, whole blood was collected via a 22-gauge butterfly needle into ACD solution A blood tubes (BD Vacutainer®). The autologous whole blood was centrifuged at 500 g for 8 min. Using a 10 mL syringe and cell extractor, approximately 5 mL of PRP was collected just above the buffy coat (white ring). The final SVF pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of PRP. After local numbing with 5 mL 1% lidocaine and 1 mL bicarbonate, the 5 mL of the SVF and PRP was injected in 0.25 mL intervals in and around the ulcer.\n\n【13】The patient was monitored for any safety events including adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs) before, during and following the procedure. SAEs are defined as any fatal or life-threatening events leading to hospitalizations, or requiring major medical interventions. Baseline parameters collected included blood work, blood pressure, weight/height, pulse and photographic imaging of decubitus ulcer. Photographic imaging was also at day 6, day 21 and 2 months post-injection.\n\n| **Results** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】The entire procedure including the mini-lipoaspiration, the blood collection and the SVF/PRP injection was well tolerated with no reported AEs. During the follow-up period, the patient did not report any AEs or SAEs. Normal activities were resumed in under a week and the patient reported a willingness to repeat therapy should it be necessary. Approximately 30 - 60 million nucleated cells are typically collected from a 60 mL sample of fat tissue after adipocyte depletion. During the follow-up period, the patient reported satisfaction with the healing process of his wound, reduction of pain until non-painful stage and no AEs. Figure 1a shows photograph of stage 3 decubitus ulcer prior to cell therapy. Figure 1b , taken 6 days after direct injection of SVF plus PRP, shows re-epithelialization of the ulcer.

Chronic stage 3 and 4 pressure sores can be difficult to heal and lead to life-threatening complications. Recent literature has revealed the anti-inflammatory and healing properties of stem cells. The use of SVF in a clinical outpatient setting for non-healing ulcer wounds could be a novel therapy. Future studies could help to establish appropriate clinical protocols (including repeat dosing or quantity/volume of cells/PRP) for specific indications.\n\n【21】Given the complex nature of the healing cascade and the lack of understanding of the mechanisms of action of stem cells, it is unclear to what extent this protocol may be successful in other cases. Proposed mechanisms of action in this patient could be an immunomodulary/paracrine effect or engraftment of the injected cells. The injection of the SVF most probably stimulated a reduction of inflammation followed by the formation of new healthy tissue. Complete tissue remodeling as a result of a complex sequence of events is stimulated by expression of growth factors, chemokines and cytokines.\n\n【22】Direct injection of SVF plus PRP in a chronic stage 3 decubitus ulcer can be effectively and safely completed in an outpatient setting according to this case study. The patient tolerated the procedure with no reported AEs. Photographic imaging depicted the stages of wound healing after a single injection of the cellular mixture.

The majority of patients have a history of upper respiratory tract infection \\[ 1 , 2 \\] prior to developing SAT. SAT has typical findings on ultrasound (US), which consist of focal ill-defined hypoechoic areas on gray scale US and no hypervascularity in the acute stage, with slightly increased vascularity seen in the recovery stage on color Doppler US \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma is very rare. Only three case reports of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma have been reported in the literature \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\].\n\n【3】Recently, we had a case of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed by immediate repeat US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 44-year-old woman visited a local medical clinic for a routine exam. On thyroid US, a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid was detected incidentally. She was referred to our center for FNA of the thyroid nodule. She had an upper respiratory tract infection about 3 months prior to presentation and then subsequently developed anterior neck pain 2 months prior to presentation. She was treated at a local medical clinic. Physical examination revealed diffuse enlargement and mild tenderness of the thyroid gland, and there were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. On laboratory investigation, T3 was 132.0 pg/mL, (normal range: 60 - 181 pg/mL), free thyroxine (FT4) was 1.34 ng/dL (normal range: 0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.06 µIU/L (normal range: 0.35 - 5.50 µIU/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 56 mm/h (normal range: 0 - 20 mm/h). Antithyroglobulin was 155.8 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), antimicrosomal antibodies were 52.7 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) was < 1 U/L (normal range: 0 - 10 U/L).\n\n【7】US examination was carried out using a real-time scanner (Philips Healthcare IU 22, Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with a 10 MHz linear array transducer using color Doppler imaging. The thyroid US revealed a 1.2 x 0.8 cm hypoechoic, irregularly-shaped nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid which was suspicious for malignancy and ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid, findings compatible with SAT. Color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas ( Fig. 1 ). An US-guided FNA of the nodule was done, and one week later, cytologic diagnosis was found to be benign. We repeated the FNA that day and the result was papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tc-99m scintigraphy showed non-visualization of both thyroid lobes and 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake was 0% ( Fig. 2 ), which suggested destructive thyroiditis. We started oral prednisolone 20 mg per day, and the anterior neck pain and tenderness improved within several days. Total thyroidectomy was performed with dissection of the central compartment of the neck and the nodule was confirmed to be papillary carcinoma without lymph node metastasis. Pathologic finding revealed a stony hard papillary carcinoma and the other portion of the thyroid showed some scattered foci of granulomatous thyroiditis ( Fig. 3 ). The patient was treated with 30mCi of adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy. Four months after discharge, she remains in stable condition.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (A) The transverse and longitudinal thyroid sonograms show ill-defined hypoechoic areas in the periphery of both lobes of the thyroid and a 1.2 x 0.8 cm hypoechoic, irregularly-shaped nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid.

However, the prognosis of SAT is excellent. More than 90% of the patients with SAT recover completely, with or without treatment. SAT is diagnosed after evaluating clinical manifestations and laboratory findings including elevated ESR, abnormal thyroid function tests, and thyroid scan with radioactive iodine uptake. Our patient had anterior neck pain, elevated ESR, and non-visualization of the gland on <sup>99m </sup> Tc thyroid scan. The first reports on ultrasonographic findings in SAT were published as early as the 1970s \\[ 9 \\]. Several recent reports have shown that US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring SAT \\[ 5 , 10 \\]. Typical gray US findings include the presence of ill-defined hypoechoic thyroid lesions without a discrete round or oval shape. Color Doppler US demonstrates no hypervascularity in the acute stage, and slightly increased vascularity is seen in the recovery stage. This suggests that US features of SAT are more useful in the acute stage. US of our patient revealed ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid and color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas. Though our patient complained of anterior neck pain, the US findings suggested that the patient was not in the acute stage. In terms of the thyroid function tests, T3 and FT4 were normal range, which also suggests that our patient was not in the acute stage.\n\n【16】As thyroid US has become increasingly common, many incidental thyroid nodules are being detected. US features suggestive of thyroid cancer include the presence of microcalcifications, irregular margins, marked hypoechogenicity, nodule height greater than width, and evidence of invasion or regional lymphadenopathy. Many guidelines recommended FNA for such suspicious thyroid nodules \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. FNA of thyroid nodules is widely used as a diagnostic method in identifying malignant lesions. However, false-negative results are reported in 1.3% to 13.6% of cases. Repeat FNA may reduce the false negativity of FNA \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. However, there has been continuous debate on the management of thyroid nodules with benign cytologic results. Most guidelines suggest that benign lesions may be followed annually by US only. However, Kwak et al \\[ 15 \\] recommend that repeat FNA should be performed for thyroid nodules that have suspicious US features, even if the initial cytologic results are benign. Timing of repeat FNA also has been debated \\[ 16 \\]. The Bethesda System recommends that thyroid nodules with an initial fine-needle aspiration (FNA) result of non-diagnostic, unsatisfactory, or atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) be re-aspirated, but no sooner than 3 months following the initial aspiration \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【17】The US features of our patient’s nodule were suspicious for malignancy. We performed US-guided FNA and the initial cytologic results were benign. Therefore, we performed immediate repeat aspiration which revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the prognosis of thyroid carcinoma is good and the growth rate of tumors is slow, patients worry about malignancy. Therefore, it is helpful to perform early repeat aspiration in patients with US features suspicious for malignancy to obtain a prompt diagnosis.\n\n【18】The coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma is generally regarded as coincidental. Therefore, when SAT is suspected clinically and by laboratory findings, thyroid US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring this disorder and it may help identify a hidden thyroid malignancy as in this case.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are a component on the pilosebaceous apparatus and are usually found in close association with hair follicles. The spectrum of sebaceous tumors ranges from the very common differentiated sebaceous hyperplasia to the rare and undifferentiated sebaceous carcinoma (SC) \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【3】Sebaceous tumors can be grouped into three categories: sebaceous adenoma (SA), basal cell carcinoma with sebaceous differentiation, and SC \\[ 2 \\]. Among these, SA is a rare solitary tumor that preferentially affects the forehead and scalp.\n\n【4】Although several treatment modalities have been reported, the full range and efficacy of options are unclear. Medications include antiandrogens, isotretinoin pills or capsules, trichloroacetic acid (rubbed onto your skin), cauterization, cryotherapy, excision, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy, and curettage \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【5】Among these treatment therapeutic options, carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2 </sub> ) laser has demonstrated its efficacy in the SA removal with excellent results \\[ 4 \\]. As demonstrated in a recent study \\[ 5 \\], CO <sub>2 </sub> laser can produce considerable positive cosmetic outcomes with marked clinical improvement without any recurrence for SA removal and has been described to produce good (75%) clinical improvement and lesion shrinkage ranging from 50% to greater than 75% without lasting adverse effects.\n\n【6】In addition, it was also demonstrated from literature \\[ 6 \\] that 8,040 SA lesions were successfully treated with CO <sub>2 </sub> laser. The lesions were treated with freehand handpieces in which the laser beam is fixed; and it is the physician who has to move over the lesion in order to remove it completely, and for large lesions, this procedure could be lengthy.\n\n【7】For these reasons, the objective of this case report was to determine the efficacy and safety of a 10,600-nm CO <sub>2 </sub> laser device in the treatment of large scalp SA, using a new scanning system which allows to speed up the removal of the lesion.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】**Investigations and diagnosis**\n\n【11】A 65-year-old male with a Fitzpatrick skin grade of III, was diagnosed with SA on the scalp area. The physical examination showed a 4 × 2 cm sized mass palpable in the center of patient’s scalp. Clinically, it occurs in the form of small skin reliefs (papules) appeared probably as a result of excessive sun exposure of the scalp area where the patient’s hair was thinner. Following the proper physical examination, a collection of patient’s anamnestic information to exclude familiarity with other more serious pathologies was done.\n\n【12】**Treatment, follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【13】For the treatment of SA, patient underwent one session with the CO <sub>2 </sub> laser system (DEKA MELA, Calenzano, Italy).\n\n【14】For this procedure, a new scanner system (DermaSCAN scanner, DEKA MELA, Calenzano, Italy) with 7-inch or 4-inch focal handpieces was used. During the initial phase, the 4-inch focal handpiece was used, and the following parameters were chosen to remove most of the lesion in a short time: power 4 - 10 W, dwell time 0.2 ms, a high-power pulse (UP/HP pulse) and cue ball for the scanning shape. In the final stages, however, the following parameters were used to refine the lesion: power 0.5 - 1 W, a high-power pulse (UP/HP pulse) and point (no scanning movement) for the shape. Finally, in order to give homogeneity and uniformity to the tissue, the following parameters were used with the 7-inch focal handpiece: power 8 - 15 W, dwell time 0.2 - 0.3 ms, CW pulse and hexagon for the shape.\n\n【15】This new scanning system is a microscanner that was developed for surgical dermatology treatments to enhance vaporization capability of standard freehand handpieces, and it is therefore particularly useful for those dermatological surgery treatments where larger areas need to be removed.\n\n【16】A local anesthesia with lidocaine was performed before laser treatment.\n\n【17】After treatment, it was suggested the application of topical antibiotics on the lesion covered by a hydrocolloid transparent patch. This patch has a high absorbency and can manage the exudate and secretions of the skin. The patient can remove the patch every day and wash the treated area with a cleansing foam and then reapply it, for 1 - 2 weeks, without crust formation, and protect the wound with sunscreen.\n\n【18】Some possible side effects such as dyschromia, burning sensation, bleeding and mild to moderate post-treatment erythema, itching, crusting, and edema, were checked.\n\n【19】In order to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, clinical photos that documented the patient lesion were captured before treatment and at 1 month of follow-up. The patient’s informed consent was acquired regarding the risks, advantages, and treatment options.\n\n【20】The clinical and aesthetic results observed after laser procedure were excellent, as reported in Figure 1 , with a complete remission of patient’s scalp SA lesion at 4 weeks’ follow-up. Patient satisfaction was very high, and no side effects were observed.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Case presentation of a 65-year-old male patient affected by sebaceous adenoma on the scalp area.

Recent studies also demonstrated the efficacy of this system in the management of burn and postsurgical scars \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【26】Furthermore, the CO <sub>2 </sub> laser can be used in any phototype and race, provides a safe and effective result for different dermatological pathologies \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【27】The advantages of CO <sub>2 </sub> laser include a reduced healing time, an infrequent need for anesthesia, reduced thermal damage, less bleeding, less inflammation, and minimal undesirable side effects (unaesthetic scarring and dyschromic effects). These benefits must be considered in comparison with other available surgical techniques such as diathermo-coagulation and traditional surgery, which on the contrary necessitate frequent anesthetics, a longer recovery period, a slower cicatrization, and a high incidence of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Another relevant limitation of these two surgical treatments is its limited usage in many anatomically difficult areas such as the internal corner of the eyes, the ears, the alae of the nose, and the genital areas characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous damage upon using these techniques. The laser CO <sub>2 </sub> technique is preferred in patients with several or wide lesions, those with a pacemaker, or for patients who cannot be subjected to anesthetics \\[ 16 \\- 19 \\].\n\n【28】The greater advantage of DermaSCAN is represented by its ability to speed up the ablation/vaporization procedures thanks to the specific emission modes designed for this scanner. This scanner allows to reach both a deep ablation in the tissue (first ablation phase) alternating with a more superficial and gentle vaporization (second ablation phase), which give a final definition of the skin lesion. In fact, the selection of the cue ball scan figure is indicated to perform a fast ablation generally in the initial stages of dermatological procedures when it is necessary to remove larges volumes. The selection of the point scan shape (no scanning movement, the scanner is operative but fixed on one point), instead, allow you to use the freehand handpiece without having to remove the scanner and therefore have a more superficial ablation to better definition of the lesion. Finally, the use of hexagon shape allows homogenization and uniformity of the tissue. This laser system technology actually allows for precise, effective, and targeted action on the lesions treated while simultaneously protecting the surrounding areas, ensuring the best possible re-epithelialization. As a result, it is appropriate for surgical procedures because the reduced inflammatory response promotes faster healing. Due to the application’s extreme accuracy, it is possible to vaporize the epidermis horizontally on its own or to extend the thermal effect even further into the papillary or reticular derma with a control of tissue damage and spare vertically the hair follicles while simultaneously maximizing efficacy.\n\n【29】Indeed, our results demonstrated the effectiveness of the treatment, with clinical photos that documented the complete remission of patient’s scalp SA lesion at 4 weeks’ follow-up. Patient satisfaction was very high, and no side effects were observed.\n\n【30】Our future goal will be to increase the clinical cases involving more patients to reconfirm the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n【31】**Learning points**\n\n【32】The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the efficacy and safety of a 10,600-nm CO <sub>2 </sub> laser device in the treatment of large scalp SA using a new scanning system (DermaSCAN) that allows for faster lesion removal. The clinical and aesthetic results observed after laser procedure were excellent, with a complete remission of patient’s scalp SA lesion at 4 weeks’ follow-up. Patient satisfaction was very high, and no side effects were observed. Our future goal will be to increase the clinical cases involving more patients to reconfirm the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n【33】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【34】None to declare.\n\n【35】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【36】No funding was provided for this study.\n\n【37】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【38】Authors IF, TZ, FM, GG were employed by El.En.

Compared with adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma has a lower incidence and poorer prognosis. A histological analysis reported that pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) comprises only 0.09-0.4% of all cancers that occurs in the pancreas \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. PASC is diagnosed based on the criteria that more than 30% of squamous components are included in the pancreas tumor tissues \\[ 3 \\]. The biological nature of PASC is its aggressive proliferation and invasiveness into other tissues, including the lymph nodes, vessels, and nerve plexuses. Here we report the case of a patient with PASC that had penetrated into the stomach and transverse colon.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 55-year-old male with no relevant medical history presented with complaints of left flank pain, general fatigue, a sense of listlessness, and melena. His mother and aunt had died of colorectal cancer, and his father had died of lung cancer. He had been experiencing a dull pain in the left flank for 2 months prior to his presentation to the hospital. Upon presentation, severe anemia was evident based on his palpebral conjunctiva. There was tenderness over the upper abdomen and a palpable mass on his left upper abdomen.\n\n【6】Blood chemistry revealed remarkably elevated inflammatory reactions (white blood cell count of 25,250/μL, of which 93% were neutrophils, and a C-reactive protein level of 8.56 mg/dL), severe anemia (red blood cell counts of 13.3 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL, and a hemoglobin level of 3.6 g/dL), severe hypoproteinemia (5.2 g/dL), severe albuminemia (1.7 g/dL), mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (78 IU/L), mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245 IU/L), mild hyponatremia (131 mEq/L), and a mild coagulation disorder (73% prothrombin and D-dimer level of 1.9 μg/mL). His carcinoembryonic antigen level was moderately elevated at 37.9 ng/mL, and the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was remarkably elevated at 1,977 U/mL. The SCC antigen and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, which are two tumor markers, were moderately elevated at 29.8 ng/mL and 1,165 U/mL, respectively.\n\n【7】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver metastases and thickened gastric walls ( Fig. 1a ). A cystic tumor was apparent in the pancreatic tail, with invasion into the transverse colon ( Fig. 1b ). Ultrasonography revealed remarkably thickened muscle layers of the gastric body ( Fig. 2a ) and the cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail ( Fig. 2b ). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 4.0 cm sized protruding mass with an ulcer formation in the greater curvature of the middle gastric body ( Fig. 3a ). Endoscopic biopsies revealed two components of SCC and adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 3b ). Colonoscopy revealed massive ulcers extending from the splenic flexure to the middle transverse colon ( Fig. 3c ). Endoscopic biopsies also revealed two components of SCC and adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 3d ). Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas that had invaded into the stomach and transverse colon. Although chemotherapy and palliative surgery were considered, the patient was unable to tolerate the treatment until his general condition and malnutrition improved. Administration of a red blood cell concentration (RCC) and intravenous nutrition was provided. On day 20, the patient’s blood pressure suddenly deteriorated and his anemia worsened. Although 10 units of RCC were administered, he died of circulatory insufficiency.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a marked thickening of the gastric walls along with multiple liver metastases (a), a cystic mass surrounded by contrast-enhanced margins (circle) (b), and thickening of the walls in the transverse colon (square) (c)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Ultrasonography revealed thickening of gastric muscle layers characterized by low echoic lesions (a) and a cystic mass in the pancreas tail (b)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Upper gastric endoscopy revealed a raised mass with central depressive lesions in the middle body of the greater curvature (a).

Histological findings of the pancreatic tumors ( Fig. 4c ) and invaded gastric lesions ( Fig. 4d ) confirmed adenosquamous carcinoma with atypical cells accompanied by inflammatory cells and fibrosis proliferation, forming an alveolar and sheet-like structure along with keratinization, an intercellular bridge, and glandular formation. Based on these findings, it was concluded that his death was caused by bleeding from the stomach that was invaded by the PASC.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** An autopsy revealed that the stomach was perforated and contained 100 mL of blood (a).

According to the current guidelines, PASC is defined by the presence of both adenomatous and squamous components, in which the latter comprises over 30% of the tumors \\[ 3 \\]. Adenosquamous carcinoma occurs in the esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, biliary tract, liver, salivary glands, and female reproductive system \\[ 4 \\]. Besides the aggressiveness and invasiveness of adenosquamous carcinoma, in general, there is little difference between PASC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in its clinical manifestation, including age, sex, location, size, and primary symptoms.\n\n【19】The mucous membranes in the pancreatic duct have no squamous epithelium, and SCC is hypothesized to originate from glandular tissues. There are four proposed mechanisms for the development of adenosquamous carcinoma: 1) ectopic squamous epithelium, 2) squamous metaplasia of the pancreatic ductal epithelium, 3) squamous metaplasia of the glandular system, and 4) histological transformation of adenocarcinoma. To date, evidence from many studies suggests that a histological transformation of adenocarcinoma to SCC 4) might be the underlying mechanism \\[ 5-7 \\]. However, considering that there are some cases of early-stage squamous carcinoma without an adenomatous component, 1)-3) mechanisms are also possible.\n\n【20】The squamous component of this type of tumor was reported to proliferate two times faster than its adenomatous component (doubling time of squamous component is 81.8 days, whereas that of adenomatous component is 166.3 days) \\[ 8 \\]. The rapid growth of squamous components in PASC is presumably related with bleeding or cystic and necrotic transformations of the tumor. The compression of adenomatous components by squamous cell proliferation leads to the loss of a distinct border between the two components. Furthermore, as the tumor progresses, squamous cell proliferation continues to replace adenocarcinoma. Tumors with a higher percentage of squamous components tend to progress more rapidly and have a poorer prognosis. It is notable that expansive growth is a characteristic of PASC.\n\n【21】In general, adenosquamous carcinoma has a poor prognosis compared with cancers with other histological origins in the pancreas because of its tendency to aggressively invade the lymph nodes, vessels, and nerve plexuses \\[ 9 \\]. Thus, the prognosis of PASC is generally considered to be poor; the average survival period of patients undergoing surgical resection is approximately 6 months and that of those who underwent palliative treatment is 1.5 months.\n\n【22】The characteristics of an imaging diagnosis are rich vessel proliferation and cystic transformation accompanied by internal necrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT of PASC revealed contrast-enhanced margins accompanied by non-contrast-enhanced lesions inside, suggesting hemorrhage or necrosis changes \\[ 10 \\]. This finding is effective for differentiating PASC from pancreatic ductal carcinoma. In our patient, contrast-enhanced CT revealed a cystic tumor with contrast-enhanced margins, which was indicative of PASC.\n\n【23】The laboratory characteristic of PASC is increased level of serum CA19-9. It may be helpful to assess serum CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic tumors that have different clinical or imaging characteristics from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【24】The treatment of PASC is a curative resection in patients without distant metastases; however, few PASC cases are discovered at an early stage because of its aggressive proliferation, making them unsuitable candidates for a surgical resection. A surgical resection of a localized PASC is controversial because of its worse prognosis after the resection than that without surgery; however, it is certain that some patients with PASC can benefit from a longer survival time after the surgical treatment \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【25】There are a few cases reported in Japan where the patient survived for more than 5 years after the surgical resection of PASC. The mainstay of PASC is chemotherapy. However, there are currently no compromised protocols for treating PASC. PASC regimens are proposed in accordance with those of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including a monotherapy of S-1, or a combination therapy of S-1 plus gemcitabine, or an S-1 plus platinum- and/or a paclitaxel-based chemotherapy \\[ 12-15 \\]. Squamous carcinoma is considered to be susceptible to radiation therapy, and postoperative radiation therapy has been found to yield some favorable results \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【26】This present patient was deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of his poor performance status and malnutrition. If he had survived until his general condition had improved enough to be able to tolerate chemotherapy, there was a little hope for longer survival.\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】We herein reported the case of a patient with PASC that had penetrated into the stomach and transverse colon. Although PASC is characterized as having a poor prognosis because of its rapid and aggressive growth, efficient and compromised treatment strategies have yet to be established. In advanced PASC stages that are unsuitable for a surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of both therapies are attempted; further accumulation of experiences in treating PASC is required.\n\n【29】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, those seen in adults in the absence of previous trauma, should raise the suspicion of a neoplastic process \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\].

Bone scintigraphy with technetium 99, showed lytic lesions in the left iliac crest, rib cage, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and an irregular captation site at the right proximal femur region corresponding to fracture ( Fig. 2A ).

Due to the rapid deterioration of the patient’s lung function, elective surgery could not be performed and 19 days after hospitalization, the patient died of respiratory failure.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Isolated fractures of the femoral lesser trochanter in adults are rare \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 \\]. There are 33 cases reported in the literature \\[ 1 \\]. In the first study which was conducted by Bertin et al \\[ 1 \\], 36 cases of isolated fractures of the lesser trochanter were collected, of which only 4 were in adults with no history of direct trauma or fall. Of these, all were secondary to metastases: one thyroid, one pancreatic, one prostate and one adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. All patients were in good general condition before the diagnosis of the fracture. This paper also mentions that retrospectively reviewing the radiographs, obvious radiographic changes suggestive of metastasis were missed.\n\n【15】In a radiological study Phillips et al \\[ 2 \\] collected, 4 cases of metastasis. In these cases, primary tumors were: colon, prostate, bronchial adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. In the largest study conducted on tumor processes of the proximal femur by James and Davies \\[ 4 \\], 295 cases were identified retrospectively over a period of 20 years. Of these cases, only 15 were atraumatic fractures of the lesser femoral trochanter. Metastases were the most common cause (60%), and the most common primary tumors were: breast, bronchus, kidney, bladder and melanoma. The remaining cases (40%) were diagnosed of myeloma, Ewing sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and giant cell tumor of bone. The study also noted that incidence of 5% of the lesser trochanter avulsion fractures was probably enlarged because the study was conducted in an orthopedic oncology center.\n\n【16】As for primary tumor lesions of bone, Afra R, Boardman DL \\[ 4 \\] were the first to describe the avulsion of the lesser trochanter as a primary manifestation of non-metastatic cancer, which corresponded to chondrosarcoma \\[ 2 \\], Ewing sarcoma \\[ 1 \\] and solitary plasmacytoma \\[ 1 \\]. Finally, a single case of leukemia in a patient with avulsion of the lesser trochanter as a primary lesion has been published \\[ 6 \\]. After a review of the literature Rouvillain JL et al, state that the etiology of Isolated fractures of the femoral lesser trochanter in adults with no history of trauma is metastatic most of the times, accounting for 70% of cases (3). The most frequent primary causes are: myeloma (9%), chondrosarcoma (9%) and Ewing sarcoma (6%) \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【17】To diagnose these lesions, an antero-posterior and axial hip radiograph are necessary. It is important to take into account that an older patient with this type of injury and no history of trauma, should raise the suspicion of an underlying neoplastic process. After diagnosis, many authors recommend a magnetic resonance imaging to study the trochanteric region and display the extent of tumor infiltration to plan tumor resection \\[ 2 , 4 \\- 6 \\]. In our case it was not performed due to advanced stage of the primary tumor. To rule out other bone metastases, some authors recommend a technetium-99 scintigraphy \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In the case presented it allowed the diagnosis of rib and vertebral metastases.\n\n【18】Finally, treatment of these patients depends on the stage of primary tumor, as discussed previously. In advanced stages, prophylactic fixation associated with palliative treatment of tumor is the most recommended treatment \\[ 1 \\]. In patients with single metastases or controlled primary tumor, resection of the lesion and proximal femoral prosthetic replacement is recommended. In this sense Rouvillain et al report a case of resection-reconstruction by megaprosthesis of the proximal femur in a patient with an isolated fracture of the femoral lesser trochanter secondary to metastatic lung adenocarcinoma \\[ 3 \\]. In the case presented, prophylactic nailing was planned but it was not performed because of the patient’s respiratory rapid deterioration.\n\n【19】In conclusion, in an older patient (adult) with an isolated lesser femoral trochanter fracture, without traumatic history, an underlying neoplastic process must be suspected. Because metastatic infiltratyive processes are the most common cause of these fractures, thorough medical history and additional tests need to be performed in order to diagnose the primary lesion.\n\n【20】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Its adverse procedural outcomes are mostly linked to device malposition and acute coronary occlusion (ACO), the latter being reported in 2-3.5% of cases \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Obstruction is usually caused by displacement of bulky bioprosthetic valve tissue during TAVI covering the coronary ostia and is linked to significant 30-day morbidity and mortality ranging up to 53% in ViV patients \\[ 3 \\]. Risk factors include female sex, coronary height of less than 12 mm from the annular plane and sinus of Valsalva diameter of less than 30 mm \\[ 4 \\]. In case of ViV implantation, ACO is more common in stentless surgical bioprosthesis, stented bioprothesis with externally mounted leaflets and in patients with a virtual transcatheter valve to coronary ostia distance of less than 4 mm \\[ 3 \\]. According to the literature, Freedom Solo stentless valve appears to have the highest rate (50%) of ACO, mainly attributed to its very elongated leaflets \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【3】To prevent such complications, an upfront coronary artery protection called “chimney technique” can be used \\[ 6 \\]. It consists of positioning a coronary guidewire, balloon or undeployed stent in the endangered artery prior to transcatheter aortic valve deployment. If coronary artery flow is compromised, a stent can then be positioned from the proximal/ostial portion of the artery up in the ascending aorta creating a channel parallel to the prosthetic valve for sufficient coronary perfusion \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【4】We present a case of a ViV TAVI implantation of a Sapien 3 valve into a degenerated Freedom Solo bioprosthetic valve with subsequent left and right coronary artery occlusion.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】**Investigations and diagnosis**\n\n【8】An 89-year-old patient with a history of aortic valve replacement with a Freedom Solo 23 mm bioprosthesis (Sorin Group, Saluggia, Italy) 13 years prior was admitted to the traumatology department due to cardiogenic syncope and subsequent T1 and T2 fracture. Conservative treatment with a neck splint was advised for the thoracic vertebral fracture. As part of diagnostic workup during hospitalization, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed that showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction, severe bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration (valve area of 0.7 cm <sup>2 </sup> , maximal velocity of 4.3 m/s, mean gradient of 42 mm Hg and Doppler velocity index of 0.22) ( Fig. 1 ) and normal pulmonary arterial pressures. Significant coronary artery disease was excluded by coronary angiogram. He was evaluated by the local heart team and TAVI was recommended due to his high age and operative risk (STS score of 3.7%). Contrast computed tomography (CT) showed thickened and calcified bioprosthetic aortic valve leaflets with an average annulus diameter of 26 mm, annulus area of 529 mm <sup>2 </sup> , a small sinus of Valsalva with a minimal diameter of 25.1 mm and relatively low coronary ostia heights (12.2 mm for the left main coronary artery and 13.1 mm for the right coronary artery) ( Fig. 2 ). Due to the risk of coronary artery occlusion, a balloon expandable 26-mm Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was chosen for implantation via left transfemoral approach.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Transthoracic echocardiography of the bioprosthetic aortic valve: 2D picture showing thickened left ventricular septum and severely calcified aortic cusps (left); continuous doppler through the bioprosthetic aortic valve showing severe stenosis (maximal velocity 4.3 m/s, mean gradient 43 mm Hg) (right)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** CT aortogram measurements: aortic annulus (up left); sinus of Valsalva (up right); left coronary ostia height (bottom left); right coronary ostia height (bottom right).

The aortic valve was initially crossed with a 0.0035” straight-tip wire that was later exchanged for a 0.0035” Amplatz SS (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA, USA) using an Amplatz left (AL) 1 catheter (Launcher, Medtronic, MN, USA). As coronary artery ostia occlusion was expected, another 6-F introducer with a Judkins left (JL) 4.0 6-F catheter (Launcher, Medtronic, Minnesota, USA) was positioned in the right femoral artery and a 0.0014” guidewire was advanced in the distal part of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Valve pre-dilatation with a Zelos PTA 22 × 40 mm balloon (OptiMed, Germany) was performed. Flow through both coronary arteries was present during balloon inflation ( Fig. 3a ). Next, we positioned an undeployed everolimus drug-eluting stent (3.0 × 20 mm) in the middle segment of the LAD ( Fig. 3b ) and proceeded with the implantation of a Sapien 3 valve, underinflating the balloon by 2 mL ( Fig. 3c ). Immediately after valve expansion occlusion of the left coronary artery was noted. The pre-positioned stent was retracted smoothly from the LAD and positioned from the ostium of the left main coronary artery to the ascending aorta establishing sufficient flow using the “chimney technique”. A proximal balloon post-dilatation (POT) of the aortic stent extension was also performed ( Fig. 3d ). Minutes later, the patient became hemodynamically unstable developing severe hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest. Bedside TTE revealed a dilated right ventricle with impaired function, without signs of tamponade. During a short resuscitation, an intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced through the right femoral artery. Aortography revealed a well patent left coronary artery and an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) that could not be engaged even after several attempts using different techniques ( Fig. 3e ). At the end we decided for a bailout intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin (5,000 IU) and eptifibatide (180 µg/kg). Following this, flow through the RCA restored and the patient stabilized ( Fig. 3f ). Control aortography demonstrated a good prosthetic valve position with patent coronary vessels and no residual aortic regurgitation.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** (a) Balloon aortic valvuloplasty with a 22 × 40 mm balloon and a BMW wire placed in the distal LAD.

Hospitalization was further prolonged by a spontaneous small subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma 2 days after procedure that were treated conservatively. Ticagrelor therapy was withheld due to bleeding complications, leaving the patient on only acetylsalicylic acid for 5 days. After documented hematoma resorption and stabilization, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel was initiated and advised to be continued for further 6 months. Control TTE before discharge showed a mildly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with an akinetic basal inferior and infero-septal segment, a dilated right ventricle with impaired systolic function (fractional area change of 22%) and a prosthetic aortic valve with mildly elevated doppler signals (maximal velocity of 2.5 m/s, mean gradient of 15 mm Hg) ( Fig. 4 ). With rehabilitation the patient’s cognitive and physical function substantially improved over the next weeks and was discharged after 30 days of hospitalization.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** TTE Doppler gradient through the Sapien 3 valve before discharge showing mildly elevated velocity and gradients.

With good pre-procedural evaluation, serious complications can be predicted and treatment strategies accordingly adjusted. Our patient had several risk factors for possible ACO during implantation including a small sinus of Valsalva, relatively low coronary ostia and presence of a stentless surgical valve. As it has been shown that left coronary artery is affected by ACO in the vast majority of cases \\[ 3 \\], we planned to protect it using the “chimney technique”. This technique creates a stented channel allowing sufficient flow and perfusion in case of ACO. It is a known bailout procedure during TAVI, yet its use is relatively infrequent accounting for 0.5-2.2% of all cases \\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]. Studies have shown that when anticipated, it lowers the risk of major cardiovascular complications \\[ 7 \\]. Recently, another preventive method with intentional endovascular leaflet laceration (BASILICA) has also been described with promising results \\[ 10 \\]. In our case, the use of the “chimney technique” allowed us to successfully resolve the ACO of the left coronary artery.\n\n【21】Unfortunately, our patient also had an ACO of the unprotected RCA that led to acute right ventricular failure and cardiac arrest. In such cases difficult coronary ostia engagement and revascularization leads to higher rates of in-hospital morbidity and mortality \\[ 7 , 11 \\]. Alternative treatments include urgent surgical coronary artery bypass grafting or valve removal using a snare \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. We tried to gain some hemodynamic support by using an intra-aortic balloon pump, although use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has also been reported \\[ 11 \\]. Following multiple failed catheter engagement attempts, we decided to infuse an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin and eptifibatide. Dosing was calculated according to the ESC guidelines on myocardial revascularization \\[ 14 \\]. This proved to be the saving bailout strategy as flow through the RCA restored. We hypothesize that ACO of the RCA was caused by calcific debris from the degenerated aortic valve dislodged by the procedure and turbulent flow between the bioprosthetic valve and aortic wall, leading to possible thrombus formation and coronary artery embolization. To date, no such complication and bailout strategy have been described.\n\n【22】Due to left main coronary stenting and high risk of in-stent thrombosis, we decided for a dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and acetylsalicylic acid. However, owing to major intra-cranial bleeding complication, we first decided to withhold dual antiplatelet therapy and then use a combination of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel for a shorter duration of 6 months. All decisions were made in concordance with the ESC guidelines on dual antiplatelet therapy \\[ 15 \\]. Despite all complications, the patient recovered well and was safely discharged home.\n\n【23】**Learning points**\n\n【24】With the current rise of ViV TAVI, it is important to consider all possible complications that can arise during the procedure. Here we presented a successful utilization of two different techniques for managing ACO. The “chimney technique” is a useful option but must be prepared in advanced. On the contrary if coronary arteries cannot be engaged with a catheter after implantation, we recommend a treatment attempt with intravenous anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy if not contraindicated.\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】ACO after ViV TAVI is a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with poor outcomes. To predict an impending occlusion during TAVI, a variety of different valve, anatomical and physiological factors need to be considered and understood. Upfront coronary artery protection using the “chimney technique” can be a feasible and safe option in case of ACO. However, long-term data about its durability and efficacy are still lacking. In case of unprotected ACO and unsuccessful catheter engagement, use of intravenous anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy can also be considered as a bailout strategy.\n\n【27】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【28】None to declare.\n\n【29】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【30】None to declare.\n\n【31】**Conflict of interest**\n\n【32】Authors declare no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【33】**Informed Consent**\n\n【34】Patient gave informed consent for the publication of this article including relevant images.\n\n【35】**Author Contributions**\n\n【36】MB performed the procedure, made substantial contributions to conception, design, and analysis and interpretation of data, and wrote the manuscript.

This occlusive thromboaortopathy has an estimated incidence of two cases/1,000,000 population/year and is more prevalent in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]. The etiology of TA remains poorly understood and likewise its exact pathogenic sequence is yet to be established \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]. The disease demonstrates a striking female predilection and commonly but not exclusively presents in the second or third decade of life \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Owing to the paucity of distinctive symptoms and absence of a reliable serological marker of disease course, TA often poses a diagnostic dilemma leading to its under-recognition, misdiagnosis and delayed management \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\].\n\n【3】The hallmark of TA is the granulomatous inflammation that commences from the adventitia and progresses to the intima with resultant segmental stenosis, occlusion, dilatation and aneurysm formation leading to end-organ ischemia \\[ 5 \\]. The characteristic proximal arterial involvement usually leaves the brain parenchyma until later stage of disease progression \\[ 5 \\]. Takayasu-induced cerebral ischemia may result in a myriad of neurological manifestations including headache, organic confusion, dementia, seizure, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, visual disturbances and syncope \\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]. Although between 42% and 80% of patients with TA present with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, convulsive syncope as the primary presentation is rare \\[ 5 \\]. We report a case of convulsive syncope as an initial presentation of TA in a 17-year-old male patient of African origin.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 17-year-old male patient secondary student of African origin was referred to us from an upcountry regional hospital with a diagnosis of medically intractable epilepsy for cardiovascular review. He presented with a 28-week history of recurrent convulsive syncope attacks which were unresponsive to anti-epileptic drugs. The seizures were generalized tonic-clonic in nature followed by loss of consciousness of variable duration (10 - 30 min). These episodes were often associated with abrupt change of posture particularly sitting upright and on standing. On average he experienced 1 - 3 episodes daily. He denied bladder/bowel incontinence or presence of aura symptoms following or preceding the convulsive episodes respectively. Neurologist’s notes revealed post-ictal drowsiness with a transient memory impairment following the attack. There was a negative history of recurrent headaches, fever, visual disturbances, arthralgias, claudication or unintentional weight loss. His past medical history was unremarkable and he denied substance abuse.\n\n【7】On examination, he was alert, oriented and well-kempt. He was pale (conjuctival and palmar) but not jaundiced. Oral examination revealed a lateral tongue bite mark with adequate dentition. His left-sided brachial and radial arterial pulses were feeble, whereas pulses on his right side and in both lower limbs were normal. Left-sided carotid and vertebral bruits were noted. His blood pressure (BP) was 169/91 mm Hg on his left and 124/82 mm Hg on the right side. He had a pulse rate of 119 beats/min which was regular and of good volume. He was afebrile (37.2 °C) and had a healthy weight (body mass index (BMI) 21.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). Abdominal examination was uneventful with no evidence of renal bruits or aneurysms. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【8】His hematological, biochemical, serological and autoimmune tests revealed normal findings except for raised inflammatory markers, i.e. erythrocyte segmentation rate (ESR) 58 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 27.6 mg/L. A tuberculin test was negative. Echocardiographic examination revealed normal findings except for a trace aortic regurgitation. Due to a clinical suspicion of TA, we ordered a carotid Doppler ultrasound scan (USS) which showed a complete occlusion of the left common, internal and external carotid arteries. On the other hand, renal Doppler USS revealed bilaterally patent vessels with a spontaneous phasic flow. Moreover, both common and deep femoral arteries exhibited a normal course and calibre with no evidence of intraluminal plaque or stenosis on femoral Doppler USS.\n\n【9】Computed tomography (CT) of brain was negative for stroke or space occupying lesions and electroencephalogram (EEG) ruled out likelihood of a focal cerebral pathology. Furthermore, CT angiogram of his thoracic and abdominal aorta revealed changes suggestive of a diffuse arteritis, i.e. irregular narrowing with variable degrees of stenosis, tapering and corrugated appearance ( Fig. 1 ). Additionally, left common carotid, left internal carotid, left external carotid and left vertebral arteries could not be visualized on the magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the brain ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Computed tomography angiogram of thoracic and abdominal aorta displaying (1) left common carotid artery, (2) origin of left subclavian artery and (3) features suggestive of diffuse arteritis, i.e. irregular narrowing with variable degrees of stenosis, tapering and corrugated appearance._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Brain magnetic resonance angiogram showing total occlusion of the left common carotid, left internal carotid, left external carotid and left vertebral arteries._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】Based on the clinical presentation and radiological features, our case fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria \\[ 7 \\] for TA. He was counseled and dexamethasone (60 mg per day), methotrexate (10 mg per day), acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg once daily) and amlodipine (10 mg once daily) were initiated on the sixth day of hospitalization. The patient had a total of 14 convulsive syncope episodes in the initial 6 days of hospitalization (i.e. before initiation of steroids) and five episodes in the last 7 days. He was discharged home after 13 days of hospitalization in a considerably stable state. We reviewed him as an out-patient at 3 and 6 months. He had a controlled BP (132/78 mm Hg left-sided and 117/71 mm Hg right-sided) and was seizure-free for the last 5 months (i.e. had two episodes within the first month after discharge).\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】TA is a rare yet the most common large-vessel vasculitis with an unidentifiable cause and undetermined pathogenesis \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]. Owing to the involved vascular territory and the degree of disease progression, TA patients vary greatly in their clinical presentation which is collectively characterized by active and quiescent phases \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]. Such unpredictability in its presentation and course often makes the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition difficult and late \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\].\n\n【17】In spite of their relatively late onset, neurological manifestations are not uncommon in TA \\[ 4 \\]. Decreased blood flow resulting from steno-occlusive lesions and/or shifting of the blood flow (steal) is responsible for various TA-associated CNS manifestations \\[ 4 \\]. Whereas convulsive syncope as an initial clinical presentation is extremely uncommon \\[ 8 \\- 12 \\], several other neurological manifestations including headache, vertigo, organic confusion, dementia, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, visual disturbances and intracranial aneurysms have been commonly associated with TA \\[ 4 , 6 \\].\n\n【18】As presented in this case, the young boy presented with convulsive syncope which was labelled epilepsy and he was prescribed several anti-seizure drugs with no relief. Due to the absence of other clinical manifestations, it took literally 7 months to reach the definitive diagnosis of TA. Despite all the existing challenges attributable to TA diagnosis, we believe that this case is a clear reminder of how fundamental thorough history taking and physical examination are. We are convinced that despite the rare symptomatology, a couple of TA signs including elevated BP, BP discrepancy between arms, unequal pulses and bruits along the neck region were present but missed during the 7 months course of this case illness.\n\n【19】Worth noting is that, a number of medical conditions may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, therefore, not every seizure is epilepsy. Unfortunately, we are living in a world where clinicians have lost clinical examination capabilities and rely almost entirely on laboratory and radiological tests to reach a diagnosis \\[ 13 \\- 15 \\]. As a result, this form of substitution in clinical discipline has led to increased incorrect diagnoses and a more pricey management approach \\[ 15 \\]. Nonetheless, it is imperative for clinicians to be aware of the unusual presentations of TA because a timely and appropriate intervention has the potential to halt the inflammatory process and improve the health-related quality of life.\n\n【20】Despite its rarity, TA may manifest with convulsive syncope mimicking epilepsy. It is necessary for clinicians to understand the dynamic symptomatology of this condition for an early diagnosis and timely management to curb damage accrual and attributable morbidity. Moreover, physicians should strive to take detailed history and perform thorough physical examination so as to timely pick characteristic signs of TA especially in patients presenting with unanticipated symptoms.\n\n【21】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【22】The authors are grateful to the staff of the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute for their tireless efforts in daily patient care.\n\n【23】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【24】None to declare.\n\n【25】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【26】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【27】**Informed Consent**\n\n【28】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【29】**Author Contributions**\n\n【30】SB and PP took the history and performed the physical examination.

Chronic starvation can lead to a spectrum of histologic changes, ranging from glycogenic insufficiency to fatty deposition in hepatocytes. These changes are further reflected in liver biochemical derangements, previously described in patients with anorexia nervosa \\[ 1 \\]. While nourishment ultimately leads to the resolution of these laboratory abnormalities in most cases, physiologic changes in refeeding can also cause an acute but temporary worsening of transaminases. We present a patient who exhibited both phenomena of nutrition-related transaminase abnormalities.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Investigations**\n\n【6】A 45-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a failure to thrive. She was in her usual state of health until 6 years prior to admission. She developed a poor appetite and severe food aversion, and her weight declined from 54.5 kg to her admission weight of 34.2 kg. The patient reported chronic constipation and intolerance of many foods, including oil, fats and meats. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal bloating, pain, or diarrhea. The personal and family medical histories were unremarkable. She was not on any prior medications or supplements. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\n\n【7】**Diagnosis**\n\n【8】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. She measured 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 34.2 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . There was profound cachexia. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, or distention. A comprehensive gastrointestinal workup including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, and small bowel series, was unremarkable. Complete blood count was normal. Notable abnormalities on the metabolic panel were the sodium at 129 mEq/L (normal 135 - 148), chloride at 88 mEq/L (normal 96 - 109), and creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL (normal 0.5 - 1.2). The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 154 U/L (normal 0 - 31) and 136 U/L (normal 0 - 31), respectively. The serum bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, glucose, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin and prealbumin were normal. Psychiatry was consulted, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\n【9】The patient was started on a regular diet on day 1 of hospitalization, with estimated needs of 1,345 - 1,598 calories per day and 40 - 47 g of protein per day. However, given her gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, several tests were pursued which required alterations in her diet during the initial week of hospitalization. For the most part, she was _nil per os_ (NPO) status or ordered for a clear liquid diet while workup was pending until day 8 of hospitalization. Thus, refeeding was determined to have started on day 8 of hospitalization. She was initially ordered a vegan diet per her request, with subsequent liberalization to a regular diet. A calorie count performed on days 14 - 16 of hospitalization revealed she was consuming almost 100% of all food trays. Total parenteral nutrition was discussed early during her hospitalization, given food intolerance and disruptions in oral nutrition; however, it was not pursued. Notably, her weight initially decreased from her admission weight of 34.2 kg to a nadir around 30.8 - 31.0 kg on days 10 - 13 of hospitalization. Her weight began to increase starting day 14 of hospitalization or day 7 of refeeding.\n\n【10】On hospitalization day 6 (i.e., before refeeding), the patient’s AST and ALT rose steeply to 671 and 362 U/L, respectively. They peaked at 750 and 638 U/L, respectively, on hospitalization day 10, 2 days after refeeding was initiated ( Fig. 1 ). Additional laboratory workup for the etiology of liver injury (LI) included hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, which were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper were normal. Ferritin and serum iron were mildly elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibody titers were slightly elevated at 1:20 dilution, but this was considered a false positive with negative anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. The immunoglobulin profile was also normal. Acetaminophen levels were undetectable. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was normal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed on hospitalization day 11, 3 days after refeeding; histology revealed mild glycogen depletion, marked ceroid pigment around the central veins, and scattered hepatocellular atrophy ( Fig. 2 ). There was no histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or significant fibrosis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Transaminase levels throughout the patient’s hospitalization, with peak levels of AST 750 U/L and ALT 638 U/L on hospitalization day 10, 2 days after refeeding was initiated.

She was eventually transferred to an Eating Disorders Unit for monitoring and treatment. She then started on the nutrition protocol for eating disorders with a slow increase in daily nutrition from 1,500 calories per day to 4,000 calories per day by day 40 of hospitalization. Over the subsequent 2 months, the patient’s weight increased from 34.2 kg (BMI 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) to 38.4 kg (BMI 16.0 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and her transaminases normalized.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】* * *\n\n【18】Malnutrition is known to cause hepatic dysfunction and even severe liver failure \\[ 2 \\]. One of the first reports linking anorexia nervosa to hepatic dysfunction included two anorexic women found to have elevated AST and ALT, which resolved with increased body weights \\[ 1 \\]. A prospective study of 101 anorexic Japanese women found that BMI negatively correlated with both AST and ALT levels prior to refeeding \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】Elevations in serum transaminases may stem from malnutrition-related hepatic steatosis. One hypothesis has been the impaired degradation and secretion of lipids, resulting in the depletion of several amino acids \\[ 4 \\]. In carnitine deficiency, for example, long-chain acyl-CoA cannot be shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation and is instead shunted toward triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis \\[ 5 \\]. A recent case report also noted the presence of abundant lipofuscin and hepatic steatosis in a patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who presented with severe protein-calorie malnutrition \\[ 6 \\]. Our patient, however, did not have evidence of hepatic steatosis on liver biopsy.\n\n【20】Another proposed mechanism of LI is starvation-induced autophagy \\[ 2 \\]. Autophagy involves the lysosomal degradation of cellular components into potentially reusable subunits; it has an adaptive cytoprotective role under stress conditions \\[ 7 \\]. In nutrient deprivation, autophagy can delay cell death by recycling endogenous metabolites and even suppressing apoptosis \\[ 8 \\]. An increase in hepatocyte permeability during autophagic cell death has been posited as a reason for elevated serum transaminases in the absence of significant cellular necrosis on histology \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【21】**Refeeding**\n\n【22】Interestingly, our patient also had an acute and sharp rise in transaminase levels during her hospitalization that coincided with increased oral intake, though it preceded her increase in weight. LI during the refeeding phase is hypothesized to be related to a rapid increase in glucose availability leading to fat deposition \\[ 3 , 9 \\]. In a study of 67 patients with anorexia nervosa and normal ALT on admission, 32 (48%) developed elevated ALT during oral refeeding \\[ 9 \\]. Similar to other studies, the degree of ALT elevation was mild compared to starvation-related ALT levels prior to refeeding. One study showed that the quantity of initially prescribed calories was associated with increased odds of elevated liver enzymes in 14 patients, further implicating increased nutrition as a causative factor \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【23】**Normalization**\n\n【24】While on the Eating Disorders Unit, our patient’s serum transaminases progressively normalized, coincident with continued oral intake and an increase in BMI. The improvement presumably stemmed from the resolution of chronic and acute insults: malnutrition and acute refeeding.\n\n【25】In summary, severe malnutrition and acute refeeding are distinct entities of LI relevant to the malnourished patient. In this case, the peak in AST and ALT occurred shortly after the start of refeeding but before the nadir in the patient’s weight, so it is unclear whether it was malnutrition or refeeding, or both, that led to the acute rise. Both are important considerations on the differential diagnosis when evaluating a malnourished patient with abnormal transaminases. Early risk stratification and close monitoring may help minimize acute hepatic injury and other serious adverse events in patients with eating disorders and malnutrition.\n\n【26】**Learning points**\n\n【27】Both chronic starvation and refeeding have been associated with LI. In chronic starvation, malnutrition may lead to hepatic steatosis due to impaired degradation and secretion of lipids. Starvation-induced autophagy is another potential mechanism of LI, with increased hepatocyte permeability during this phase potentially causing elevations in AST and ALT. Reintroducing nutrition may also result in rises in AST and ALT, possibly due to a rapid increase in glucose availability, though the mechanism is less clear. These liver injuries are crucial for clinicians to recognize in patients with malnutrition or those undergoing refeeding. Fortunately, they often resolve with conservative management.\n\n【28】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【29】Dr. Robert A.

A new cluster was identified in the East of France at the end of February 2020 after a religious meeting of about 2,000 people. In the following weeks, our hospital had to face a massive influx of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We present a series of six cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom bone marrow aspirate revealed hemophagocytosis.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】We hereby report a series of six cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in whom bone marrow aspirate revealed hemophagocytosis. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The presence of at least one cytopenia justified bone marrow aspirates.\n\n【6】Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these six patients are summarized in Table 1 . On the day of bone marrow aspirate, four patients had hyperthermia. Clinical examination revealed neither lymphoid tumor syndrome (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy), nor neurological and cardiological symptoms. Every patient presented either anemia or thrombocytopenia and five patients had lymphopenia. All of them had moderate-to-severe inflammatory syndrome.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Clinical and Laboratory Parameters_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Bone marrow aspirates revealed constantly a rich marrow with abundant pleiomorphic megakaryocytes and the presence of numerous plasma cells. Moreover, hemophagocytosis features ( Fig. 1 ) were observed and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) was suspected.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Bone marrow sample (magnification, × 50). May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining of bone marrow aspirate shows two histiocytes with engulfed nucleated cells (one neutrophil (green arrow) and one erythroblast (red arrow))._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】All patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation with vasopressor support. Two patients had renal replacement therapy. Three patients required transfusion. Concerning outcome, four patients died during hospitalization, and two patients are still hospitalized.\n\n【12】This retrospective study was approved by local ethics committee.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an immune-mediated life-threatening disease, during which a proinflammatory cytokine production and a tissue infiltration by activated lymphocytes and macrophages occur. This syndrome is characterized by fever, organomegaly (lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly) and cytopenia related to platelets, red blood cells and leukocytes phagocytosis. HLH can progress to a sepsis-like syndrome and a terminal multiple organ failure. The diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory parameters and histological criteria.\n\n【16】HLH is divided into familial (primary) HLH (pHLH), which occurs in children, adolescents and young adults, characterized by inherited defects of cytolytic pathway proteins, and acquired (secondary) HLH (sHLH), particularly in adults and commonly triggered by infection, malignancy and autoimmunity \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\].\n\n【17】Viral infections are one of the most frequent trigger factors for HLH. Herpes viruses are the most common triggering agents and among them, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most frequently incriminated virus \\[ 3 \\]. Other viruses triggering HLH are: hepatitis A, B, C, parvovirus B19, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, enterovirus, rubella, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie, para-influenza type III, dengue, influenza H1N1 and avian influenza (H5N1) \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. A case of HLH has also been reported with SARS-CoV-1 \\[ 6 \\]. However, this patient concomitantly presented a significant replication of EBV.\n\n【18】Hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow in itself is neither a sensitive nor a specific criterion of HLH \\[ 1 \\]. When performing a systematic bone marrow aspirate in thrombocytopenic patients during septic shock in the ICU, prevalence of hemophagocytosis can reach up to 60% \\[ 7 \\]. Diagnosis of sHLH may be guided by the H-score \\[ 4 \\]. In our series, only one patient has a high H-score in favor of sHLH.\n\n【19】COVID-19 patients’ hemophagocytosis does not share typical clinical and biological features of sHLH, probably pleading for a different mechanism of macrophage activation.\n\n【20】HLH is usually referred to a disorder of histiocytic system characterized by macrophage activation and proliferation. The central abnormality appears to be a cytotoxicity deficiency of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In the presence of a microorganism, normal but ineffective activation of CTL and NK T lymphocyte system appears, resulting in the persistence of both pathogen and macrophagic antigen-presenting cells. The sustained macrophage activation and homing to the sites of T-cell activation result in tissue infiltration and the production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). This activation plays a major role in tissue damage and the resulting clinical symptoms \\[ 1 , 2 , 8 \\].\n\n【21】Macrophage activation in HLH is mediated by indirect activation. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 infection, new pathophysiological data hypotheses could point us towards a different activation mechanism which could be, at least in part, direct.\n\n【22】We know that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to penetrate cells \\[ 9 \\]. Park reported the results of a preprint by Feng et al \\[ 10 \\]. These authors performed pathological analysis of lymph node and splenic tissues. They noted the expression of ACE2 receptors on certain subtypes of macrophages but also the presence of nucleoprotein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells and showed upregulation of IL-6. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 by binding to ACE2 receptors could modulate expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) \\[ 11 \\]. Macrophages express α7 nAChRs subunits and it has been shown that disruption of α7 nAChRs expression could lead to a release of cytokine, particularly TNF-α \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【23】During SARS-CoV-2 infection, macrophage activation/modulation appears to play an important role in pathogenesis \\[ 13 \\]. Indeed, this infection induces morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes. A distinct change in the morphology and function of monocytes/macrophages could be predictive of disease severity. Inflammatory macrophages accumulate in lungs and other affected organs and are likely source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with fatal evolution induced by SARS-CoV-2 \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【24】Hemophagocytosis alone and even more sHLH seem to be a poor prognosis factor in SARS CoV-2 infection. Hemophagocytosis indicates macrophage activation. In this situation, it may be partially different from that of HLH, with the possibility of a direct activation mechanism by virus without the need of lymphocytes.\n\n【25】Better comprehension of macrophage activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide an optimal treatment at an early stage, so as to prevent the virus from binding to cell receptors, thus regulating inflammatory response.\n\n【26】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【27】None to declare.\n\n【28】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【29】None to declare.\n\n【30】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【31】None to declare.\n\n【32】**Informed Consent**\n\n【33】Not applicable.\n\n【34】**Author Contributions**\n\n【35】GL, LMJ and AR performed data analysis; GL wrote the first draft, EV, VP, LP, CM, AD, IH, BD, and KK reviewed the manuscript; LMJ, AR, EV, VP, GL, AD, and IH provided patient care and data; all authors reviewed the manuscript and provided final approval.\n\n【36】**Data Availability**\n\n【37】The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n\n【38】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The symptoms and manifestations of this infection are complicated and vary widely, and have posed a huge challenge. SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and in the end of 2021 more than over 278 million cases and just under 5.4 million deaths have been reported globally, while the number of both confirmed and fatal cases is continually increasing \\[ 1 \\]. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily a respiratory disease, it affects various systems and organs throughout the body. Its effects on the respiratory, cardiac, neurological, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, muscle-skeletal, cutan, ocular, and urological systems are now well known \\[ 2 \\- 13 \\]. In addition to the typical cases, there have been a large number of reports on atypical forms or presentations of the disease and related complications \\[ 11 , 14 \\- 18 \\]. However, there are only a limited number of publications on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ovaries. According to a PubMed search with the keywords “ovarian insufficiency, COVID-19” and literature review conducted on September 28, 2021, limited clinical cases have been published on the effects of the virus on the female reproductive system \\[ 5 , 18 \\]. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into cells. There is evidence that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in female reproductive processes such as folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, and ovulation \\[ 18 \\- 23 \\]. However, the expression of ACE2 is very low in stromal and perivascular cells of the ovarian cortex, while its expression is highest in the endothelium, lungs, kidney, and the heart \\[ 2 , 3 , 10 , 19 \\- 21 , 24 \\]. The purposes of this paper are to present a case of a 27-year-old woman who developed amenorrhea after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and to draw attention to clinicians to follow COVID-19 patients for a long time, and they need to pay attention to menstrual disturbances, especially in young female patients.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】**Investigations**\n\n【6】A 27-year-old female patient presented with amenorrhea. She had been diagnosed with COVID-19 eight months ago, and she had missed eight menstrual cycles since then. The patient had fever on the second day of the menstrual cycle and, on the same day, her cycle had been interrupted. There were no signs of metrorrhagia. The patient had a sub-febrile temperature of 37.5 - 37.8 °C for 2 - 3 days. She also had myalgia, fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, and mild sleep disorder.\n\n【7】**Diagnosis**\n\n【8】Based on the clinical, laboratory, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RT) data of a nasopharyngeal swab sample, she had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other members of her family had also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection around the same time. As the patient had a mild form of the disease, she was treated only with vitamin supplements. She reported that she had a healthy lifestyle and did not have any health-related problems. Her first menstrual cycle had been at the age of 12 years, and since then, up to 8 months ago, her cycles had been regular. She had not taken any oral contraceptives prior to the infection, and she had not undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the last 12 months. She mentioned that she was not worried and hoped that her menstrual cycle would resume in the near future. An objective structured clinical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings. As the patient had amenorrhea for more than 3 months, a hormonal evaluation was recommended. These were the findings of the evaluation: follicle-stimulating hormone 57.7 mIU/mL (menopausal range: 26.7 - 133.4); luteinizing hormone 26.21 mIU/mL (menopausal range 5.16 - 61.1); progesterone 0.4 ng/mL (0.1 - 0.3 on follicular phase and 1.2 - 15.9 on luteal phase); estradiol 10 pg/mL (menopausal level < 28 pg/mL); anti-Mullerian hormone 0.01 ng/mL (menopausal level < 0.2 ng/mL). The levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and prolactin were within the normal ranges, and liver enzyme and renal function results were also normal. Pregnancy was excluded as a possibility.\n\n【9】**Treatment**\n\n【10】The patient was referred to a gynecology specialist and started on estro-progesterone therapy.\n\n【11】**Follow-up and outcomes**\n\n【12】After 1 month, she referred that menstrual cycle was returned.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】This report describes a rare case of amenorrhea as a post-COVID-19 complication in a 27-year-old woman. While pre- and post-natal COVID-19-related complications have been reported in pregnant women, none of them were related to the absence or even interruption of the menstrual cycle. It is possible that similar cases of amenorrhea have been overlooked in clinical practice because of the non-disturbing effects of menstrual interruption. Additionally, female patients are probably reluctant about consulting a doctor about this issue and prefer to wait until their menstrual cycle returns to normal. This is a reason why COVID-19 patients need to be followed up for a long time, especially in young female patients. According to Li et al, psychological factors could play a role in such conditions; however, the patient in this case did not have any psychological symptoms \\[ 25 \\]. She had a clinically mild form of the disease, with no pulmonary involvement, no difficulty in breathing, or other life-threatening complications. She did not have any signs of depression during or even after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To gather more relevant information regarding our case, we searched PubMed and other medical websites, but we found a very limited number of papers. In one such paper, Somasundaram et al pointed out that men are more likely to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors on spermatogonia and somatic (Leydig and Sertoli) cells in the testis, but similar studies in females have not found the presence of ACE2 receptors in ovaries or the effect of this virus on the ovaries. ACE2 was also expressed in the endometrium, to a greater extent in epithelial cells than stromal cells, and moreover, the expression of ACE2 changed with the menstrual \\[ 20 , 23 , 26 \\]. Li et al reported that apart from the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that is involved in the reproductive and ovulatory processes, SARS-CoV-2 may affect female infertility through direct invasion of ovarian tissue and granular cells or may even cause direct endometrial damage. Renin-angiotensin (Ang)-aldosterone system (RAS) is involved in female reproductive processes such as folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation and ovulation \\[ 25 \\]. Reis et al detected ACE2 mRNA transcripts in ovaries from reproductive-age women and postmenopausal women \\[ 25 \\- 27 \\]. Additionally, data obtained from Bgee showed that the expression level of ACE2 in oocytes is relatively high. Therefore, the ovary and oocytes might be potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 \\[ 3 , 10 \\]. Li et al to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might attack ovarian tissue and granulosa cells, and decrease ovarian function and oocyte quality, leading to female infertility or miscarriage or damage endometrial epithelial cells and affect early embryo implantation to affect the female fertility. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Fallopian tube, which should be paid greater attention in the future.\n\n【16】On the other hand, this is one case of amenorrhea associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may well be a coincidence. However, based on the data currently, the exact effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the ovaries and its potential mechanisms are unclear. More evidence, including both epidemiologic and clinical studies, as well as long-term follow-up studies, is needed to verify the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the human ovary, especially in reproductive-aged women.\n\n【17】**Learning points**\n\n【18】The pandemic of COVID-19 is continuing spreading all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multisystemic disease, and it is important for physicians to understand its various complications. Clinicians and health workers are very concerned about its impact on reproductive health. For us as health workers, it is essential to protect the human reproductive system, as it is vital to the survival of humans. In particular, the potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on fertility are unclear, and more research and clinical studies are needed to understand if SARS-CoV-2 infection has direct or indirect effects on the ovaries.\n\n【19】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【20】None to declare.\n\n【21】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【22】This report received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【23】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【24】The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.\n\n【25】**Informed Consent**\n\n【26】Written informed consent for publication of his clinical details and/or clinical images was obtained from the patient.\n\n【27】**Author Contributions**\n\n【28】Entela Puca reviewed the literature and drafted the manuscript, conceived and designed this case report and revised the manuscript; Edmond Puca contributed to the literature review and manuscript drafting; both authors read and approved the final version of the submitted manuscript.\n\n【29】**Data Availability**\n\n【30】The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Assessment of normal structures and exclusion of abnormal findings are crucial before intra-cardiac procedures. Echocardiographically, a Chiari network formation appears commonly as a highly mobile whip-like structure in the right atrium which could easily be confused for thrombus formation or valve vegetation. 3D transthoracic echo has been shown to have an increased role in differentiating these findings.\n\n【3】Entanglement of catheter devices in the Chiari network is a serious concern and can increase the complexity of procedures. Potential consequences include breaking of the net-like structure initiating an embolus or prolapsing structure into the tricuspid valve causing regurgitation. Local insult and abrasion via catheter introduction could lead to increased risk of thrombus formation or altered electrical activity leading to dysrhythmia. Catheters, guide wires and pacemaker leads have the potential to damage or get entangled in both identified and unidentified Chiari network. Discovering the existence of this abnormal structure pre-procedurally may alter the course of diagnostics or treatment, and allows the medical team to have a heightened sense of awareness during any given procedure.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 92-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure decompensation. She had a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease with stent placement, peripheral vascular disease with femoral artery embolectomy, history of DVT, pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, seizures, and dementia. Upon initial examination, her blood pressure was 116/60 mm Hg, pulse was 90 and irregular, respiration was 16, O <sub>2 </sub> saturation was 95% on 2 L nasal cannula, and was afebrile.\n\n【7】Echocardiogram demonstrated an abnormal whip-like structure in the right atrium consistent with a Chiari network ( Fig. 1 ). Additional echo findings were mildly calcified aortic valve with regurgitation, moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with mild dilation, mitral calcification, thickening, and mild regurgitation. Also present was moderate to severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension that was estimated to be > 60 mm Hg. As this patient was identified as a candidate for cardiac catheterization (right and left), we were subsequently compelled to inform the cardiac team of the prominent presence of the network.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Echocardiographic image of the right atrium, demonstrating Chiari network as the lower echogenic shadow, as well the pacing wire is also demonstrated on top._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】In weeks 3 - 8 of embryological development, the sinus venosus and atrium undergo a plethora of changes with the eventual involution of one communicating side of the sinus venosus \\[ 1-3 \\]. However, as first described by pathologist Hans Chiari in 1897, a remnant of this sinus venosus can persist in the right atrium \\[ 4 \\]. Its configuration and size can vary with a net-like structure being the most described arrangement ( Fig. 2 ). Prevalence of this abnormality has been reported from 2% to as high as 10% in various studies and is usually incidentally found \\[ 2-4 \\].\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Gross pathology image of Chiari network, close-up of coronary sinus with fenestrae in valve.

However, other studies have demonstrated trapped thrombi forming a complex within the Chiari network which can be refractory to thrombolytic therapy \\[ 6 \\]. Additionally, further studies have suggested that the web of the formation could actually encourage new thrombus creation \\[ 2 , 3 , 7 \\]. To date, there is no surgical indication to remove an asymptomatic Chiari network.\n\n【14】Previous case reports have described massive right atrial thrombus formed on a Chiari network, leading to intermittent tricuspid obstruction \\[ 5 \\]. In one report thrombus had formed after the use of a Hickman catheter for the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \\[ 5 \\]. Another case reports cardiac catheterization in a 51-year-old man with secundum atrial septal defect, and catheter entrapment within the area of the inter-atrial defect \\[ 6 \\]. At thoracotomy, the catheter was found to be caught by and looped within a Chiari network involving the septal defect, a hitherto unreported complication of cardiac catheterization \\[ 6 , 8 \\]. A guide wire having been entrapped by the Chiari network prior to an intended radiofrequency ablation procedure has also been reported \\[ 6 , 8 \\].\n\n【15】**Conclusion**\n\n【16】Central venous catheters (especially right atrial catheters) for large bore access or venous sampling, right heart pressure catheters, ablation catheters, invasive electrophysiological study catheters and internal cardiac cardioversion catheters are frequently utilized in the hospital setting. Procedures deploying these devices present their own set of risks without anatomic abnormalities. When considering inserting and removing guide wires, sheaths, and other parts of intra-cardiac catheters, the threat of getting entangled within the varied construct of a Chiari network is high. Therefore, careful pre-procedural echocardiographic evaluation is paramount in mitigating potential adverse effects of cardiac-based procedures which may occur as a result of this not uncommon finding.\n\n【17】**Financial Support**\n\n【18】No financial support was provided for this publication.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

A biopsy was taken from the mass revealing endometrial tissue with no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【11】Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a U-shaped uterine cavity with thickened and inverted uterine fundus on sagittal and coronal sections ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Coronal (A) and sagittal (B) MRI views showing U-shaped uterine cavity with thickened and inverted uterine fundus._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Based on the mentioned clinical and imaging findings, non-puerperal uterine inversion with super infection was strongly suspected, and the decision for hysterectomy was made and discussed with the patient.\n\n【15】A laparotomy was carried out, the round and utero-ovarian ligaments and part of the urinary bladder were dragged into a cup-shaped depression ( Fig. 2 ). The constricting ring was too tight, therefore, after identifying both ureters the uterus was repositioned using the Haultain procedure followed by abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( Fig. 3 ). The histopathological report revealed no abnormality to which the uterine inversion could be attributed.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Uterine inversion found at laparotomy.

Acute inversion causes severe pain and hemorrhage, and almost always is a consequence of a delivery; whereas chronic inversion is insidious and characterized by pelvic pain, bleeding, anemia and urinary dysfunction, including urine retention, as in this case, resulting from anatomical distortion causing bladder neck obstruction \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\].\n\n【23】The diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion. Finding a mass coming through the cervix without definite cervical margins, absence of the uterine fundus or fundal dimpling during bimanual or rectal examinations suggest the diagnosis. The openings of the Fallopian tubes may be identified if it had been dragged through the endometrial surface. The diagnosis is easier with complete uterine inversion when a fleshy mass protrudes from the vulva with a constricting ring of the cervix superiorly \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan and MRI can help in the diagnosis of uterine inversion. The suggestive features on ultrasound include Y shape fundal indentation and depressed longitudinal groove extending from the uterus to the center of the inverted portion \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【25】MRI is the best radiological modality not only for the correct diagnosis, but also clearly defines the lesion and its relation to neighbouring structures \\[ 9 \\]. The features of the standard pelvic MRI protocol with T2-weighted scans will include U-shaped uterine cavity, thickened and inverted uterine fundus on sagittal section and bull’s eye configuration on an axial image \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【26】In most cases, treatment is guided by whether the condition is acute or chronic, stage of inversion, the reproductive wish of the patient and the cause of the inversion (benign or malignant).\n\n【27】In stage 1, inversion is intrauterine (incomplete) and the fundus remains within the cavity; stage 2, complete inversion of the uterine fundus through the fibromuscular cervix; stage 3 total inversion where the fundus protrudes through the vulva; stage 4, the vagina is also involved within total inversion \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【28】Surgical repositioning or hysterectomy could be done through either abdominal or vaginal approach.\n\n【29】Spinelli and Kustner are transvaginal surgical repositioning techniques with the basic difference being that Spinelli’s approach is anterior and requires dissection of the bladder and an anterior uterine wall incision; while Kustner’s is a posterior approach which involves entering the space of Douglas vaginally and splitting the posterior aspect of the uterus and the cervix, which makes it a bit easier and safer \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【30】Surgical repositioning can also be done through a laparotomy using the Huntington procedure, which involves a gentle upward traction of the round ligaments of the uterus after dilating the cervical ring digitally until the uterus is reinverted \\[ 2 , 3 , 8 \\].\n\n【31】The operation in this case is consistent with the Haultain procedure, which uses an abdominal approach in which a vertical incision in the posterior portion of the constricting cervical ring is made with traction on the round ligaments until the uterus is reinverted to its normal anatomy. This was followed by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\n【32】**Conclusions**\n\n【33】This case shows that chronic uterine inversion could occur without the usual predisposing factors and high index of suspicion is necessary to detect these unusual presentations.\n\n【34】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【35】None to declare.\n\n【36】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【37】None to declare.\n\n【38】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【39】Not applicable.\n\n【40】**Informed Consent**\n\n【41】Informed consent was obtained from the patient; publication was permitted by the center ethical committee.\n\n【42】**Author Contributions**\n\n【43】Each author contributed in searching for and editing the content.\n\n【44】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Granular cell tumors (GCTs) of the biliary tree are extremely rare, and according to the literature, are always benign \\[ 1-4 , 7-10 \\]. GCTs are usually located in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, oral cavity, head, and neck \\[ 2 , 7 , 8 , 11 \\]. They are infrequently located in the gastrointestinal tract, and rarely located in the biliary tree (< 1%) \\[ 2 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 11 \\]. GCTs are related to the peripheral nerves, and it is generally accepted that they have a neurogenic origin and arise from Schwann cells \\[ 1-5 , 7-11 \\]. Thus far, few cases of GCTs in the extrahepatic biliary tree have been reported, but no author has ever reported a malignant GCT in the biliary system \\[ 1-5 , 7-11 \\]. GCTs of the biliary tree are usually found in young African-American females between 30 and 40 years of age \\[ 1-3 , 7-10 \\]. The symptoms are mild, the radiological findings are non-specific, and the diagnosis is made postoperatively, based on the pathological and histochemical findings \\[ 1-3 , 7-10 \\]. Surgery is often radical, with these patients undergoing major procedures due to the suspicion of malignancy in the biliary tree \\[ 1-3 , 7-10 \\]. Almost all of the cases that have been reported had good prognoses, with the mortality and morbidity being caused by reasons other than the tumor’s biology \\[ 1 , 2 , 10 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of increasing pruritus and jaundice, and did not complain of any other symptoms. Her medical history was free from any underlying disease, and she was not taking any medication. Her family history was unremarkable, and her gynecological history revealed one natural delivery. Overall, the patient was in good physical condition and completely fit. The physical examination revealed mild abdominal pain in the left hypochondrium that did not cause any discomfort to the patient, with no signs from any of the other systems. Her vital signs were normal, and the laboratory results were all within the normal ranges, except for mild transaminasemia and small elevations in the total and conjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n【6】The patient underwent computed tomography (CT), which revealed excessive dilation of the endohepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, caused by an obstruction at the level of the distal common bile duct (CBD) without revealing any visual mass ( Fig. 1 ). The CBD below this level was stenotic, while the pancreas, pancreatic duct, and all of the other structures were normal. This patient then underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( Fig. 2 ) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) which revealed an ovoid, enhanced, solid mass 13 mm in diameter located between the CBD, head of the pancreas, and second part of the duodenum ( Fig. 3 ). This mass caused severe obstruction of the CBD lumen, which was proximally dilated, as well as the common hepatic duct (11 mm) and the portal endohepatic bile ducts (about 9 mm). All of the other anatomical structures were found to be normal. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were not observed in the CT scan or MRI-MRCP.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) Axial CT and (b) coronal reconstruction images show that there is no any visible mass._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** MRI coronal T2-weighted image (a) and axial post-contrast vibe image (b) show dilatation of the common bile duct and normal appearance of pancreatic head._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** On MRCP, 2D (a) and 3D (b) dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts as well as dilatation of the common bile duct with ill-defined intraluminal filling defect is depicted. The distal common bile duct is normal._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】After the examination, the patient was scheduled for surgery with the diagnosis of a possible cholangiocarcinoma of the lower third of the CBD, and a cholecystectomy was performed via open laparotomy. During the surgery, a small tumor was found in the lower third of the CBD, which was excised, and reconstruction was conducted via a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The patient’s recovery was fast and uncomplicated, and she was discharged from the hospital on the sixth postoperative day.\n\n【14】The gross examination revealed an intramural, yellow, oval-shaped solid tumor that extended inside the CBD lumen, causing an obstruction, which was 15 mm at its largest diameter. This mass was located 3 mm centrally from the distal end of the CBD, above the pancreas. A GCT of the CBD was shown by the histological examination. The microscopic examination showed a well-demarcated mass consisting of semicircular, ovoid, and slightly elongated cells, with rich eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm, containing small semicircular, ovoid, and slightly elongated mild hyperchromatic nuclei. The cells were located in nests and cords separated by fibrous bands ( Fig. 4 ). Necrosis and mitotic activity were not observed in the specimen, and invasion of the tumor capsule was not discovered in any of the tumor specimens. Small groups of glandular cells were observed between the granular cell nests, and were composed of cylindrical epithelium without atypia ( Fig. 4a, b ). The adjacent tissues were found to be completely normal. The immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor cells were positive for neurospecific enolase (NSE) and CD68, and strongly positive for the S-100 protein ( Fig. 5 ). The pathological examination of the gall bladder showed chronic hyperplastic cholecystitis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Histological examination shows infiltration around epithelial elements of ampulla of Vater by large polygonal cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and small round regular usually eccentric nucleus (H&E, × 100) (a).

The patient was followed up postoperatively, and found to have recovered completely. After 15 months, the patient was well and disease-free.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【20】* * *\n\n【21】A GCT was first described by Abrikossoff in 1926, and the first similar tumor in the biliary tree was described by Coggins in 1952 \\[ 1-4 , 7-10 \\]. Since then, many authors have reported GCTs, and thus far, 82 cases of GCTs in the biliary tree have been reported in the English literature \\[ 8 \\]. Here we report the 83rd case of a GCT in the extrahepatic biliary tree (located in the CBD), and the first case ever reported in Greece.\n\n【22】GCTs are rare benign tumors that usually appear in African-American women during the third and fourth decades of life \\[ 1-4 , 7-10 \\]. The mean time of appearance is 31 years of age, and ranges from 14 to 91 years of age \\[ 1 \\]. The ratio between female and male occurrences is almost 4:1, taking into account all of the cases reported with GCTs of the biliary system \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【23】These tumors are exclusively diagnosed after pathological and immunohistochemical examinations, which suggest a strong correlation between these tumors and peripheral nerves \\[ 1-4 , 7-10 \\]. After many reports and discussions, it is now generally accepted that GCTs arise from Schwann cells, which is confirmed by the expression of the S-100 protein in the immunohistochemical analyses \\[ 1-5 , 7-9 \\].\n\n【24】Clinically, when GCTs develop in the biliary tree, the patients appear with symptoms such as abdominal pain, biliary colic, and obstructive jaundice, but these symptoms are non-specific and can lead to many diagnoses \\[ 1 , 7 , 11 \\]. The jaundice worsens over time and can be accompanied by pruritus \\[ 7 \\]. GCTs are usually located in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, head, neck, and chest \\[ 2 , 7 , 8 \\]. They have also been reported in the breast, larynx, uterus, intestine, esophagus, vocal cords, bronchus, and practically all other parts of the human body \\[ 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 \\]. Their location in the gastrointestinal system is rare, ranging between 5% and 9%, but in the biliary tree the presence is less than 1% \\[ 3 , 8 , 9 \\]. The preoperative diagnosis of a GCT in the biliary tree is almost impossible, and is usually made after the surgery and the pathological, anatomical, and histochemical analyses of the biopsy of the excised specimen \\[ 3 , 9 \\]. When GCTs are superficially located, a biopsy and diagnosis are easily conducted, but these are very difficult when the tumors invade and develop in the biliary tree \\[ 3 \\]. The differential diagnosis of a GCT in the biliary tree includes malignant tumors like cholangiocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and benign diseases like sclerosing cholangitis, adenomas, papillomas of the extrahepatic biliary system, postoperative stenosis, and choledochocele \\[ 1 , 3 , 7 \\]. Following the excision of the tumor, many biopsies are usually required to confirm the diagnosis \\[ 2 \\]. According to the literature, only two cases of GCTs of the biliary tree have been diagnosed preoperatively thus far \\[ 10 \\]. Both diagnoses were made after biopsies that were taken during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures \\[ 10 \\]. One alternative diagnostic modality that has been proposed for these tumors is an intraoperative needle biopsy and frozen section \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. An ideal goal is to achieve treatment while avoiding major surgery, using ERCP as a diagnostic tool to take many deep biopsies from the CBD and common hepatic duct \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【25】Radiologically, a GCT of the biliary tree appears as a soft tissue mass that causes obstruction from outside or from within the lumen of the CBD or the hepatic ducts \\[ 7 \\]. CT imaging shows an isodense tumor and MRI shows an isointense tumor of the hepatic parenchyma, which enhances after the injection of a contrast agent \\[ 7 \\]. MRCP reveals the stenosis, and an endoscopic ultrasound shows a hypoechoic mass with well-defined borders \\[ 7 \\]. A gross examination shows that GCTs are solitary, yellowish-white, oval shaped, painless nodules of less than 3 cm in their maximum diameter \\[ 1 \\]. A microscopic examination of these tumors reveals the presence of polygonal or ovoid to round cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, and small regular uniform hyperchromatic nuclei \\[ 1-3 \\]. The cells are arranged in nests and cords, appear as clusters or sheets, and infiltrate the tissues separated by thin fibroconnective tissue septa \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Mitoses are absent, and there is no atypia or necrosis \\[ 3 , 8 \\]. Immunohistochemical analyses indicate a non-epithelial origin with characteristics of neuroectodermal (Schwannian) origin \\[ 1-4 , 9 \\]. An examination using electron microscopy reveals cytoplasmic lysosomes filled with lipid material and microtubules that are related to myelin, characteristics that confirm the diagnosis of a GCT \\[ 3 \\]. All GCT cells show strong positivity for the S-100 protein, but negative results for some other staining \\[ 2-4 , 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【26】The standard treatment goal for a GCT is excision of the tumor, with free tumor margins, and restoration of the bilioenteric continuity \\[ 1-3 , 7-9 , 11 \\]. A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the best choice in this case \\[ 8-10 \\]. When the intrapancreatic part of the CBD is involved, the recommended solution is a Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy, even though diversions and simple bypasses have been reported for tumors in this location \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The treatment of these tumors with stents using an endoscopic or percutaneous approach is unacceptable, and not appropriate for this curable disease \\[ 1-3 , 7 , 9 \\]. Generally, the extent of the excision depends on the tumor’s location and size \\[ 7 , 11 \\]. If the tumor is located at the bile cyst or the cystic duct, then all that is needed is a simple cholecystectomy with free tumor margins \\[ 9 , 11 \\]. In those cases in which a benign tumor is suspected in the biliary tree, it is not easy to exclude malignancy due its rarity, and major surgery may still be necessary for treatment \\[ 2 , 6 , 10 \\]. If a biliary obstruction persists over time and is left untreated, secondary biliary cirrhosis will appear and may cause liver failure requiring liver transplantation \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have no effect in the treatment of these tumors \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【27】Long-term follow-up is necessary \\[ 3 , 11 \\]. Based on the literature, only one patient died after the excision of a GCT due to other medical reasons \\[ 2 \\] and only two patients (of the 83) had recurrence due to incomplete excision \\[ 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 11 \\]. Thus far, there has not been a single case referring to a malignant GCT in the biliary tree, even though they have been reported in other parts of the human body \\[ 9 \\]. There have been five cases of multifocal GCTs and five cases of concomitant extrabiliary involvement reported in the literature \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. Moreover, the prognosis is excellent after a free margin excision \\[ 1 , 3 , 10 \\]. Overall, morbidity depends on the surgery, and there is no mortality based on the nature of the tumor \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【28】In conclusion, a GCT of the biliary tree is a rare condition that all physicians should be aware of when treating a patient with obstructive jaundice, and presenting with a tumor in the extrahepatic biliary tree. Although rare, GCTs should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumors that cause obstruction of the biliary tree \\[ 2 \\]. Local excision of the tumor and reconstruction of bilioenteric continuity is the ideal treatment \\[ 1-3 , 7-9 \\], but demands preoperative suspicion in order to avoid major surgery, as long as biliary tumors are considered to be malignant \\[ 7 \\]. Wide resections offer the best chance for a cure, and there must be a low threshold for an extensive resection when facing tumors in the biliary tree that cannot be easily diagnosed preoperatively, such as GCTs \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【29】**Competing Interests**\n\n【30】The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【31】**Consent**\n\n【32】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\n【33】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is generally considered to be simple, easy, and noninvasive examination. Until now there have been a few reports of serious adverse reactions after acetazolamide challenge, and here we report our experience of a case of acute heart failure that occurred after cerebrovascular SPECT with intravenous administration of acetazolamide and required many life-saving treatments.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A man in his seventies without complaints was referred for examination with cerebrovascular SPECT with and without acetazolamide challenge to determine whether revascularization was indicated. He had a history of cerebral infarction about 3 months previously and occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery was noted at that time. He also had diabetes mellitus and renal dysfunction, as well as a prior history of myocardial infarction and arteriosclerosis obliterans.\n\n【6】First, SPECT examination was performed using N-isopropyl-4-iodoamphetamine \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] ( <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP) without acetazolamide challenge \\[ 4 \\] and no adverse reaction occurred. SPECT examination using <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP with acetazolamide challenge was performed 1 week later in accordance with the Japanese Extracranial–Intracranial Bypass Trial (JET study) \\[ 5 \\] using autoradiography method \\[ 2 , 4 , 6 \\]. First, 1,000 mg of acetazolamide dissolved in 20 mL of normal saline was injected intravenously. Ten minutes after administration, 222 MBq of <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP was intravenously administered and 10 min after <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP injection, arterial blood sampling from the right brachial artery was performed. Ten minutes after arterial blood sampling, a SPECT scan was started.\n\n【7】About 45 min after acetazolamide administration, the patient complained of difficulty breathing and tightness in the chest. His condition did not improve and dyspnea became apparent. He was moved to the emergency rescue unit and treatment by cardiologists and emergency rescue doctors was started. First, oxygen inhalation (10 L/min) was started. The patient’s dyspnea and discomfort did not improve and he gradually became unresponsive to verbal stimuli. Wheezing and rales were heard on pulmonary auscultation. His pulse rate was around 170 beats/min, systolic blood pressure ranged from 200 to 170 mmHg, and percutaneous oxygen saturation was around 97%. On electrocardiography, regular tachycardia, narrow QRS, abnormal Q wave on II, III, and aVf, and poor R wave progression on V1 - 3 were continuously observed. On ultrasonic cardiography, diffuse left ventricular hypokinetic wall motion was observed and left ventricular ejection fraction was around 27%.\n\n【8】Intravenous administration of 20 mg of adenosine triphosphate twice, administration of seven or 8 direct current shocks, intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of digoxin and 20 mg of furosemide, continuous intravenous infusion of human atrial natriuretic peptide with an injection rate of 0.025 µg/kg/min, again application of a direct current shock, two injections of 2mg of isosorbide dinitrate, one injection of 1mg of isosorbide dinitrate, and continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin with an injection rate of 0.3 µg/kg/min were performed one after another. However, his symptoms and signs did not improve quickly.\n\n【9】Over the 3 hour after these emergency treatments, about 700 mL of urinary output was obtained, and dyspnea improved gradually and systolic blood pressure was reduced to around 100 mmHg. His dyspnea disappeared the following day. Although a plain-film chest radiograph taken on the day of onset showed marked cardiomegaly and increased vascular markings of both lungs, these findings improved after admission ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Chest plain radiographs showing a) marked cardiomegaly and increased vascular markings on both lungs on the day of onset, and b) improvement of these findings on day 2._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Transient elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and isoenzyme CPK-MB elevation was observed ( Table 1 ), and given his past history of myocardial infarction, onset of myocardial ischemia was suspected. Although examination of the coronary arteries and cardiac function in detail was recommended, the patient’s family did not consent to the procedure. The patient was transferred to another hospital and was lost to follow-up. Therefore the details including the condition of his coronary artery disease could not be confirmed.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Change in Serum Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) and Isoenzyme CPK-MB_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】Acetazolamide-augmented brain SPECT for evaluation of cerebrovascular reactivity is now a common diagnostic procedure \\[ 6 \\]. At the time of this study, mild adverse reactions such as paresthesias, dizziness, and indefinite complaints are sometimes experienced \\[ 7 \\]. There have also been a few reports of serious adverse reactions however. A comprehensive literature search identified two reports of enlargement of cerebral infarction \\[ 8 , 9 \\] and one report each of Stevens-Johnson syndrome \\[ 7 \\] and metabolic acidosis \\[ 9 \\]. Two cases of adverse reactions involving the circulatory system after acetazolamide challenge have been reported in patients with coronary disease \\[ 10 , 11 \\], but symptoms of those cases were not so severe. In one of these cases, Shimotsu et al performed acetazolamide augmented <sup>99m </sup> Tc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime brain and <sup>201 </sup> TlCl myocardial SPECT simultaneously in a patient with severe coronary artery disease and <sup>201 </sup> TlCl myocardial imaging with dipyridamole was performed 5 days after acetazolamide stress imaging. A defect seen on acetazolamide stress imaging was seen to be located in the same region as that seen on dipyridamole imaging. In their case, blood pressure and heart rate was unchanged and the patient had no chest pain, ischemic ST-T change, or arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the acetazolamide stress test. However, the patient showed significant ST-T changes on electrocardiography after dipyridamole administration \\[ 10 \\]. They subsequently performed the same examination in 9 patients, and showed acetazolamide could cause myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease. In their cases, none of these patients caused myocardial ischemia after acetazolamide administration manifested electrocardiographic ST-T changes, arrhythmia or chest pain \\[ 12 \\]. However, the authors could not explain this mechanism \\[ 12 \\]. On the other hand, Suzuki et al performed acetazolamide-augmented cerebrovascular SPECT in patients with severe coronary artery disease with continuous intravenous administration of nicorandil, and severe back pain with ST depression on electrocardiography occurred in one case. Although sublingual administration of isosorbide was ineffective, symptoms disappeared 30 min after intravenous administration of morphine although mild ST depression continued for a further 90 min \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【17】Shimotsu et al speculated that a vasodilation mechanism unrelated to acetazolamide’s ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase is involved in the direct action of acetazolamide on vascular smooth muscle, and that acetazolamide also reduces systolic blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance and increases the cardiac output ratio in patients with cardiovascular diseases \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. They also mentioned that acetazolamide might increase myocardial oxygen consumption by increasing cardiac output, thus inducing myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease with low ischemic thresholds \\[ 12 \\]. In contrast, Suzuki et al conjectured that there is little possibility of coronary spasm because of inefficacious sublingual administration of isosorbide, and also mentioned that it seemed unlikely acetazolamide would raise blood pressure and heart late, increase myocardial oxygen consumption, and worsen angina \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【18】Although they considered cardiac output would be increased at the onset of angina, this phenomenon was attributable to sympathicotonia caused by chest pain, not by acetazolamide, because change in the electrocardiography wave continued even after chest pain disappeared. They considered that acetazolamide affected the tonus of the coronary artery, and that the steal phenomenon occurred not only from dilatation of the coronary artery but also potentialization of nicorandil’s pharmacological action \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【19】Our patient, however, had no complaint of chest pain, both heart rate and blood pressure were raised, and double product (i.e. systolic blood pressure multiplied by heart rate) of > 30,000 was continued. Although myocardial ischemia should have occurred in the present case because of elevation of CPK and CPK-MB, the mechanism causing it should be different from that in Shimotsu and Suzuki’s cases. It should be considered whether elevation of cardiac output induced myocardial ischemia or whether onset of myocardial ischemia induced acute heart failure. It would seem that there is little possibility that acetazolamide causes myocardial ischemia directly \\[ 10 \\- 13 \\]. Although the details were unclear, our patient also had systemic arteriosclerosis including severe coronary artery disease. One possible explanation in this case is that acetazolamide might have increased myocardial oxygen consumption by increasing cardiac output, but peripheral vascular resistance might not have been much reduced. This might have caused increased cardiac work, leading to cardiac ischemia because of severe coronary arteriosclerosis with a low ischemic threshold as well as increased myocardial oxygen consumption, followed by acute heart failure with high systolic blood pressure and tachycardia. In addition, renal dysfunction might have aggravated the symptoms as a synergistic effect.

The syndrome usually presents in healthy young males as upper extremity edema, pain and erythema. It most commonly occurs in the setting of vigorous activity; rarely, a specific precipitating event cannot be ascertained \\[ 1 \\]. In this patient population, aggressive diagnostic evaluation should be performed, as surgical correction of anatomic abnormalities can be curative. Initial diagnostic modality includes venous doppler ultrasonography to detect thrombosis and obstruction. This should be followed by chest CT to detect bony abnormalities. It is imperative to maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion, as often these testing modalities are equivocal. Conventional venoangiography is often necessary as the gold standard for diagnosis \\[ 1 \\]. It is also important to assess the contralateral extremity as obstruction frequently occurs bilaterally \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【19】Numerous predisposing congenital anatomical anomalies are associated with the syndrome, including cervical ribs, extra ribs, scalene muscle hypertrophy, or abnormal muscle tendon insertion sites \\[ 1 \\]. Patients may also develop venous compression through repetitive movements, or from bony rib trauma. These movements cause continual venous injury and results in expansive fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia \\[ 1 , 3 , 4 \\]. This fibrosis occurs both within the vein itself as well as around the vessel, causing contraction and venous blood flow stasis \\[ 4 \\]. Recurrent injury leads to initiation of the coagulation cascade thrombosis \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Anatomic abnormalities may also reduce mobility of the subclavian vein, further predisposing to obstruction and thrombosis \\[ 1 \\]. In the patient discussed above, his first rib anatomy as well as scalene muscle hypertrophy presumably resulted in venous compression and development of PSS.\n\n【20】Complications of PSS include pulmonary emboli and post-thrombotic syndrome \\[ 1 \\]. Post thrombotic syndrome develops from thrombosis induced venous valvular injury resulting in valvular incompetence \\[ 5 \\]. It can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, pain, edema, and hyperpigmentation \\[ 5 \\]. Approximately 10 of patients with PSS develop pulmonary embolus \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【21】Management of this complex disorder requires a multidisciplinary and should include Internists, Thoracic Surgery, and Interventional Radiology. Consultation with a Hematologist is often helpful for ruling out alternative thrombophilias. Conventional systemic anticoagulation is a cornerstone of initial therapy. In order to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome, definitive thrombotic therapy is often necessary utilizing both mechanical thrombectomy and pharmacologic thrombolysis \\[ 7 \\]. Definitive surgical correction of the underlying anatomic abnormality is critical to prevent recurrence \\[ 4 , 6 \\]. The timing of these procedures however remains controversial \\[ 3 \\]. Long term anticoagulation is usually required for at least three months \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【22】While Paget-Shroetter syndrome remains an uncommon cause of UEDVT, clinicians should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for this elusive syndrome in young, healthy patients with upper extremity edema. This is particularly important in patients presenting with history of repetitive movements who are thought to have musculoskeletal injury alone. Accurate diagnosis can result in prevention of pulmonary embolus or post-thrombotic syndrome and its’ associated morbidity. Surgical therapy of anatomic abnormalities can lead to definitive cure, making this challenging disorder rewarding for patients and clinicians alike.\n\n【23】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】**Grant**\n\n【26】None.\n\n【27】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is amongst the most pathogenic species of Clostridium species, alongside with _Clostridium botulinum_ , _Clostridium tetani_ and _Clostridium difficile_ .\n\n【3】_C. perfringens_ can be found in samples of water, soil, and it is present in gastro-intestinal tract of healthy animals as well as in humans. It has also the ability to cause disease in humans and animals, with a rapid growth of bacterial inoculum with spore and toxins formation. There are five biotypes of _C. perfringens_ , based on the type of toxin that is produced, type A, B, C, D and E \\[ 2 \\]. The main toxin is the α-toxin, an enzyme that splits lecithin into phosphocholine and diglyceride, causing damage to red blood cell membrane, accounting for development of spherocytosis and subsequent intravascular haemolysis \\[ 3 \\]. The clinical presentation of _C. perfringens_ infection includes a variety of manifestations, such as gas gangrene, emphysematous cholecystitis, crepitant cellulitis, fasciitis and myositis. It is frequently associated with septic shock and intravascular haemolysis \\[ 4 \\- 5 \\].\n\n【4】The diagnosis of intravascular haemolysis by _C. perfringens_ should be suspected in the presence of acute anaemia with a raised mean cell haemoglobin concentration and a reduced mean cell volume, spherocytosis, negative indirect and direct Coombs test, haemoglobinemia and haemoglobinuria. It is also associated with Gram-positive rods on Gram stain of a peripheral blood smear and positive blood or tissue culture. A plain radiograph of the abdomen may reveal the presence of abscess or gas in tissues \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【5】We report a case of a man that die with a _C. perfringens_ sepsis with massive intravascular haemolysis, 22 hrs after the onset of symptoms.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】A 66-year-old male was admitted in the Emergency Room of our hospital with a 12 hrs history of fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and dark red urine. He had a past medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and nephrolithiasis. He reportedly did not have travelled abroad namely to malaria endemic areas.\n\n【9】At admission, his core temperature was 38 °C, pulse rate was 106/minute, blood pressure was 157/67 mmHg. Physical examination was normal with the exception of moderate pain on palpation of the epigastric and right flank zone but without signs of peritoneal irritation.\n\n【10】In the initial hemogram ( Table 1 ), haemoglobin concentration and platelet count were within the normal range with an elevation of white blood cell count. Biochemical screening showed elevation of total bilirrubin, direct bilirrubin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum aspartate transaminase, serum alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase. Urine analysis showed the presence of hemoglobinuria without haematuria.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Laboratory Data_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】A peripheral blood smear revealed spherocytosis and absence of schizocytes. The direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative. Plasmodium was not detected in microscopic examination of blood. Electrocardiogram and chest X-rays were normal. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and showed no relevant findings.\n\n【14】A few hours later the patient remained febrile (38 °C), tachycardic and became dyspneic. Arterial blood gases revealed severe metabolic (lactic) acidosis with pH 7.33; HCO <sub>3 </sub> 12.2 mmol/L; PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 16.4 mmHg; PaO <sub>2 </sub> 51 mmHg; SaO <sub>2 </sub> 90.8%, lactate 10.4 mmol/L. Antibiotic therapy was started with piperacilin/tazobactam 4.5 g ev qid.\n\n【15】He was promptly admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of massive intravascular haemolysis. His condition deteriorated very rapidly, with the development of multiple organ failure.\n\n【16】He was intubated and invasive mechanical ventilation was started. Large doses of vasopressor agents were given and renal replacement therapy was immediately started, without any significant clinical improvement. The second chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia (PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio - 43.9 mmHg), compatible with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Laboratory data in the subsequent hours following ICU admission revealed very low levels of haemoglobin concentration and platelet count, low haptoglobin and a marked increase in creatinine and transaminases ( Table 1 ).\n\n【17】Coagulation tests were compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【18】Despite intensive therapy and supportive care, the patient died 22 hrs after the onset of symptoms and 10 hrs after hospital admission. The performance of an exchange transfusion was considered but the rapid and severe courses of the disease preclude its implementation.\n\n【19】The definitive diagnosis of _C. perfringens_ sepsis was made after its identification in blood cultures for anaerobes, performed before death. The blood cultures for aerobes were sterile. Autopsy was not performed because of the advanced decomposition of the body, that took place in less then 24 hrs after death, which also pointed to the presence of gas-producing bacteria ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Body decomposition.

Among the infectious causes one should consider malaria, but also clostridial bacteraemia and other rare conditions, such as bartonellosis and babesiosis as possible aetiologies \\[ 7 \\]. Nevertheless, with the exception of clostridium bacteraemia, these infectious diseases are usually straightforward to diagnose and can normally be easily excluded because of their particular epidemiology. Non-infectious causes of intravascular haemolysis include haemolytic transfusion reactions, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or haemolysis caused by snake venoms.\n\n【28】In our patient, the possibility of HUS was raised, since this can be associated with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and haemolysis. However, our patient blood smear showed spherocytes, not schizocytes typically present in this syndrome. Moreover there was no other evidence of microangiopatic haemolytic anaemia that is also characteristically present in HUS.\n\n【29】The diagnosis of _C. perfringens_ sepsis is difficult without its identification in blood cultures \\[ 8 \\]. If clostridium bacteraemia is suspected, antibiotics should be started immediately, including high-dose penicillin (up to 30 million units per day) or tetracycline (if β-lactam allergy is suspected). In the presence of gas gangrene, clindamycin is also recommended. Chloramphenicol, doxycycline, imipenem and metronidazole are also alternative agents \\[ 1 \\]. If there is a perceived infection focus, large and rapid surgical debridement is part of the initial approach \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【30】Finally two additional therapeutic options must be considered: exchange transfusion and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Exchange transfusion could be beneficial at an early stage of intravascular haemolysis by removing toxin-damaged red cells, free haemoglobin and fibrin split products \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. The beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been reported in several case series since an oxygen-rich environment promotes the death of _C. perfringens_ and blocks the production of toxins \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【31】Van Bunderen et al. reviewed 40 cases of _C. perfringens_ septicaemia with massive intravascular haemolysis published in the literature since 1990 \\[ 6 \\]. They found that 37.5% of patients had no underlying condition related to this infectious disease. The most common associated diseases were haematological disorders (22.5%), pancreatic or gastric cancer (12.5%). Diabetes was present in 30% of the patients, being the only risk factor in 15%. The focus of infection was mostly hepatobiliary (45.0%), being intestinal in 17.5%. A gynaecological origin, after an invasive procedure, was found in 10% of the cases \\[ 10 \\]. The mortality rate was very high, ranging between 70 - 100% \\[ 1 , 7 \\]. In the large majority of cases the definite diagnosis was confirmed only after death \\[ 3 \\], as it was our case.\n\n【32】The present case is particular and rare since it was complicated with massive intravascular haemolysis, with an extremely rapid clinical course, without identification of an obvious infectious focus, in a patient with only one predisposing factor (diabetes).\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】Despite all the medical treatments and organ support, our patient presented a very severe septic shock and had a fatal outcome.\n\n【35】The severity of _C. perfringens_ infections, associated with a high mortality rate, reinforce the importance of rapid clinical diagnosis and, above all, immediate antibiotic therapy and focus control, when appropriate.\n\n【36】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【37】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【38】**Grant Support**\n\n【39】There were no sources of funding for this research.\n\n【40】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 1 year ago requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with lateral internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD), SVG to first diagonal, ramus intermedius (RI) and right coronary artery (RCA). After surgery, patient started complaining of above-mentioned symptoms and was initially treated with up-titration of antianginal therapy without relief of his symptoms. Patient was admitted to our facility with unstable angina. Physical examination was unremarkable. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute ST segment abnormalities concerning for ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal right and left ventricular size and function, grade I diastolic dysfunction and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed significant step-up of oxygen saturation from inferior vena cava and underwent right and left heart catheterization which showed native three-vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease including 99% mid LAD, 30% proximal circumflex, and 100% proximal RI. There is 50% to 60% diffuse RCA disease ( Fig. 1 ). Fractional flow reserve (FFR) was performed for RCA diffuse disease, and measured FFR was 0.88, which was hemodynamically non-significant. LIMA to LAD, and SVGs to D1 and RI were patent. SVG destined to RCA was anastomosed to an anomalous right coronary vein which drained into right atrium ( Fig. 2 ). Coronary computed tomography showed patent SVG to small right coronary vein with flow distal into the right atrium ( Fig. 3 ). The RCA coursed immediately subjacent to the right coronary vein, though the graft did not anastomose to the RCA. Patent SVG to RI and diagonal branches was observed. Approximately 50% focal luminal narrowing of the RCA was immediately subjacent to the aforementioned anomalous vein as above. Luminal reconstitution was appreciated distal to this stenotic segment. A multidisciplinary “Heart Team” meeting was convened and it was decided to proceed with catheter-based coiling. Coil embolization of the SVG to right coronary vein was performed. Using a Prowater coronary wire, the guide catheter was placed in the proximal and mid segments of the graft and a Direxion 0.021 × 130 cm microcatheter was placed in mid segment of graft. Five diamond-shaped interlock-18 coils (Boston Scientific) were implanted to occlude the shunt. A subsequent angiogram revealed complete obliteration of iatrogenic aorto-right atrial shunt ( Fig. 4 ). The patient’s symptoms significantly improved upon follow-up.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** LAO cranial view showing right coronary artery dividing into PDA and PLV branches.

Fistulas that arise from a coronary artery and terminate into a chamber of heart are known as coronary-cameral fistulas. Fistulas that terminate into vein are coronary arteriovenous fistulas (CAVFs). True incidence is unknown, as at least 50% are asymptomatic. CAF accounts for 0.002% of the general population. They account for 0.2-0.4% of congenital cardiac anomalies. CAF can be either congenital or acquired. Congenital CAF is either an isolated finding or seen with other congenital cardiac anomalies or structural heart defects, most frequently in critical pulmonary stenosis or atresia, pulmonary artery branch stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), coarctation of aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and aortic atresia. Acquired CAF is seen in relation with trauma, infection, or iatrogenic injury, such as an intracardiac congenital heart operation, transcatheter techniques, myocardial biopsy, CABG, septal myomectomies, permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantations, electrophysiology (EP) ablations, and transbronchial lung biopsies. Iatrogenic aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula (ACAVF) resulting from placement of an arterial or venous graft to a cardiac vein is a rare complication of CABG \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Only 37 such cases have been reported in literature. The reasons for this complication may be anatomical distortion due to myocardial scarring, intramyocardial course of intended artery, pericardial fibrosis, or previous coronary bypass surgery. Also, pericardial fat may disturb coronary exploration \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. This iatrogenic CAVF may result in myocardial ischemia, infective endocarditis, severe systemic to pulmonary shunt, heart failure with high cardiac output, or fistula rupture \\[ 5 \\]. Treatment options for iatrogenic CAF that have been reported in literature include either redo CABG, balloon or coil embolization, stenting of engrafted artery, or covered stent implantation in the cardiac vein \\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]. Percutaneous closure by embolization with either detachable balloons or coils \\[ 9 \\] or deployment of a vascular plug offers an effective and safe management for symptomatic patients.\n\n【16】**Conclusions**\n\n【17】We presented a rare case of iatrogenic aorto-right atrial fistula following inadvertent SVG implantation to a right coronary vein in a patient with persistent angina following CABG. Our case highlights the following main points. First, it emphasizes the serious clinical and cardiovascular ramifications of iatrogenic cardiac fistulae, and the need for vigilance and increased recognition of such potential complications on behalf of operators during any coronary revascularization procedure. Second, it demonstrates the feasibility and safety of coil embolization of cardiac fistulae by experienced operators in carefully selected cases with suitable anatomy. Third, it demonstrates the use of multimodality imaging especially coronary CT angiogram in confirming the diagnosis of coronary fistula and outlining the path of arteriovenous fistula. Lastly, it shows that marked symptomatic improvement can be achieved following successful obliteration of a large, hemodynamically significant, fistula when medical management has failed.\n\n【18】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【19】None to declare.\n\n【20】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【21】None to declare.\n\n【22】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【23】None to declare.\n\n【24】**Informed Consent**\n\n【25】Informed consent was taken from the patient.\n\n【26】**Author Contributions**\n\n【27】All authors sufficiently contributed to the intellectual content, review of literature and analysis of data.

Radiographically, it manifested with calcium deposits and a dropsy of the retropharyngeal soft tissues. The mechanism of its formation is not fully enlightened, attributing this more recently to genetic and metabolic factors, rather than traumatic factors as described initially \\[ 1 , 3-5 \\].\n\n【3】The most frequent locations of acute calcifying tendinitis are the extremities and within the shoulder. Retropharyngeal impacting typically occurs to the long neck muscle tendon insertion or longus colli, although it is rarely described in the literature \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【4】The long neck, the main muscle flexor of the cervical spine, consists of three parts: inferior oblique, upper oblique and vertical, this muscle is located ahead of first cervical vertebrae \\[ 6 , 8 , 9 \\].

The day after the presentation, she went to her physician for primary care that consisted in immobilizing her neck with a soft cervical collar, and some drugs (diazepam, AINEs), with poor clinical improvement. Then she decided to go to the emergency room because of the pain and suddenly odynophagia and dysphagia for solids and liquids. She also had difficulty for the mouth opening, feeling of cervical inflammation, no changes in voice and no fever at his home. Concomitant upper tract infection was not presented in this process.\n\n【10】Upon arrival to the emergency room, she had low-grade fever (37.4 °C), strong neck pain with important limitation of cervical mobility, odynophagia and dysphagia. There was limitation of cervical mobility especially in the extension, with right para-tracheal tenderness that increased with swallowing and cervical paravertebral muscles contraction. There were no tender lymph nodes and oropharyngeal examination performed by otorhinolaryngologists of guard was rigorously normal. Moderate leukocytosis and increased ESR were detected. Blood cultures and urine cultures were performed, as well as X-rays of posteroanterior and lateral cervical spine at the suspicion from retropharyngeal infectious process.\n\n【11】After a simple cervical X-ray, a loss of cervical physiological lordosis and widening of the prevertebral soft tissues associated with an amorphous focal calcification prior to the first and second cervical vertebrae were observed ( Fig. 1a, b ). In computerized tomography (CT) scan of neck, we noted moderate increase of prevertebral soft tissue at the height of C2, C3 and C4 without evidence of the presence of organized abscess collections showing in location immediately preceding the basis of process odontoid process and lower anterior atlas arc. Dim calcification of irregular morphology of this was approximately 15 × 14.5 × 9.5 mm in intimate relation with the proximal portion of the longus colli muscle belly ( Fig. 1c, d and e ), providing us the diagnosis of prevertebral calcific tendinitis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Two images of cervical plain on top.

The longus colli muscle consists of three parts: superior oblique, inferior oblique and vertical. Classically, the calcification affects the superior oblique portion of muscle longus colli at level C1-C2. Acute prevertebral calcific tendinitis may go unnoticed and be misdiagnosed due to its rare occurrence \\[ 1-4 \\].\n\n【19】The acute retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis is a form of disease by deposition of calcium hydroxylapatite which specifically involves the extensor longus colli and longus tendon of the big toe. This is a rare location for a disease that typically involves large joints such as the hips or shoulders. The etiology of calcium hydroxylapatite crystals deposit is not clear. It is believed that in the time that calcium crystals have been deposited within the extensor longus colli muscle, it cause a pain due to the rupture of these crystals which can cause a painful inflammatory response to foreign bodies in the long neck muscle which would lead to the formation of reactive fluid in the prevertebral space surrounding the muscle \\[ 2 , 5-7 \\].\n\n【20】Condition affects adults within a reported age range of 21 - 81 years, with greater distribution between 30 and 60 years. The symptoms are secondary to inflammation of long extensor muscle of the neck and include an acute to subacute onset of pain in the neck, dysphagia, odynophagia and fever of low grade \\[ 5-9 \\]. Dysphagia is due to the proximity of the retropharyngeal space to the adjacent pharyngeal constrictor muscles. It produces no shortness of breath. The patient may have a low-grade fever, as well as be quietly altered leucocyte and globular sedimentation speed. All this could mistakenly target a retropharyngeal infection. However, in the latter, the patient usually presented greater breach of general state with marked fever and alteration of the differential and acute phase reactants. A thorough anamnesis and clinical exploration is therefore fundamental \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【21】The typical pain occurs mainly in the anterior cervical region with contracture of the muscles paravertebral rear component and no irradiation. The pain increases with mobility, being very limited, and increases with the expansion and improvement with the flexion of the neck.\n\n【22】Oropharyngeal in these patients is completely normal inspection and odynophagia pertaining to patients is typically lateralized \\[ 10-13 \\].\n\n【23】The main radiographic findings include swollen prevertebral soft tissue, and previous amorphous calcification to rent C1-C2. The amorphous and diffuse thickening of the prevertebral soft tissue typically extends from C1 to C4, while you can extend below to C6.\n\n【24】Although this condition is rare, its true incidence is probably higher, since it is frequently not diagnosed by ignorance of many clinicians, misrepresentation and confusion with other entities. The progressive accessibility of emergency services CT will probably allow document new cases \\[ 4-6 \\].\n\n【25】The thickening of the soft tissue represents either spill discrete or diffuse edema, which can be differentiated in the CT or MRI. The lack of improvement that surrounds the spill may be useful in reactive differentiation of a spill from an abscess. CT can help identify calcium deposits, which often may seem weak on plain X-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not so useful as CT for detecting calcifications due to its less sensitivity. Besides, MRI is not always available in Emergency Department. However, it would show an increase of signal in T2 to edema in the retropharyngeal space and occasionally could demonstrate bone edema in the vert.\n\n【26】It is a self-limiting disease which can resolve spontaneously after 1 - 2 weeks. If it is not, it is self-limited and resolves within several weeks of the onset of symptoms, while it is quite painful and debilitating for the patient during that time. Some forms of conservative treatment, such as a short course of anti-inflammatory steroid-inflammatory and the avoidance of aggravating the neck movements, can help relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids provide a speedy clinic recovery \\[ 3 , 6 , 8 \\].\n\n【27】Knowing the strange thing of this entity and its pathognomonic radiological findings can avoid incorrect medical therapy and invasive attempts as surgical drains. On the other hand, to be aware of this disease, we can save the patient from unnecessary diagnostic, anxiety and delays in discharge from undue hospital \\[ 1-3 \\].\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】The most important element for the diagnosis of this entity is the knowledge of its existence and recognition of its characteristics in plain X-ray and CT. MRI, being of help, is less than CT scans in diagnostic capability due to their low sensitivity to detect calcium deposits.\n\n【30】No definition of calcifications in the soft parts on the simple X-ray may lead to other diagnoses. So the implementation of CT is recommended if clinical suspicion is high and the X-rays show no calcification.\n\n【31】It is a self-limiting disease which can resolve spontaneously after 1 - 2 weeks. Knowing the strange thing of this entity and its typical radiological findings, they do that we can avoid incorrect medical therapy and invasive attempts as surgical drains, opting for a simple treatment with no steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, non-steroidal and neck brace immobilization.\n\n【32】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These symptoms usually start around fourth to the sixth decade of life and thus OPMD can be easily overlooked \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Here we present a case of OPMD, who was initially admitted as aspiration pneumonia and later on was found out to have underlying OPMD.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 75-year-old male presented to the hospital with a complaint of fever, cough of 1 week duration and worsening of 2 years of chronic dysphagia. His cough was productive with yellowish phlegm which was not blood mixed. He was having a persistent fever and started noticing difficulty breathing even on rest for which he presented to the emergency department. His dysphagia started around 2 years ago which progressively got worse with difficulty swallowing mainly solid meals. He had modified his swallowing technique by himself to avoid choking and he had no previous history of aspiration. His past medical history was adult-onset bilateral ptosis that was first noticed when he was around mid-50s. His ptosis had also progressed significantly over the years and he was offered blepharoplasty by an ophthalmologist in past which he had refused. His father and paternal grandfather also had a history of ptosis and dysphagia. His father had deceased from a complication of aspiration pneumonia. On physical examination, he was febrile and tachypneic with bilateral rhonchi on chest auscultation. Bilateral ptosis was present ( Fig. 1 ). Cranial nerve examination was intact. The motor exam revealed 3/5 weakness of the bilateral infraspinatus and other shoulder girdle muscles. Distal arm and forearm muscle groups including biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, wrist flexors and extensors and intrinsic hand muscles were 5/5. Muscle strength in the bilateral lower extremities was 5/5 in all muscle groups tested. The sensation was intact throughout. Ataxia was absent. He had an elevated WBC of 19,000 and a chest CT revealed consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes and in the right lower lobe posteriorly ( Fig. 2 ). A modified barium swallow showed frank tracheal aspiration ( Fig. 3 ). An acetylcholine receptor antibody test was negative. An electromyogram and nerve conduction study revealed a generalized myopathic process with the absence of myotonia. With a history of adult-onset bilateral ptosis and progressive dysphagia with aspiration complication along with the positive family history of ptosis and dysphagia, there was a strong suspicion for OPMD. Genetic testing was performed, which was positive as it detected GCG expansion, with expanded allele size of 13 repeats, in the poly(A) binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) gene, which is associated with OPMD and thus the diagnosis of OPMD was established. He was treated with antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia along with supportive management. Initially, the patient required high flow oxygen but with resolution of pneumonia his respiratory status improved and he was not requiring any oxygen support at the time of discharge. He was offered surgical corrective measures to help him with his ptosis and dysphagia but he declined any surgical interventions. At the time of discharge, the patient was offered a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement to help him maintain proper nutritional status due to underlying severe dysphagia, which he accepted. Genetic counseling for his family members was recommended after his diagnosis.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Bilateral ptosis with tendency to contract the forehead muscle to raise the eyelids._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Chest CT showing consolidation, predominantly in the left lung._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Modified barium swallow showing deep laryngeal penetration with frank tracheal aspiration._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】OPMD is a rare genetic myopathy with adulthood onset, most often between 40 and 60 years of age. The prevalence of OPMD is highest in the French-Canadian population of the province of Quebec and among Bukhara Jews living in Israel. In the United States, the majority of affected individuals are of French-Canadian extraction, Ashkenazi Jews, and the Hispanic population \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In Europe, the estimated prevalence is 1:100,000 \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. OPMD is a rare form of genetic muscular dystrophy which is inherited mostly as autosomal dominant and rarely as an autosomal recessive disorder. OPMD is characterized by ocular and pharyngeal muscle involvement, and it commonly presents with adulthood onset ptosis, dysphagia and proximal muscle weakness in advanced cases along with a positive family history of ptosis and dysphagia \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]. Our patient had all the classic clinical features of OPMD, with positive family history along with proximal muscle weakness in upper extremity which points towards advance stage of disease but was not diagnosed until late as OPMD is easily overlooked and underdiagnosed. The PABPN1 gene mutation contains GCG trinucleotide repeats, and the expansion of this repeat leads to OPMD, which was detected in our patient. The confirmatory diagnosis is made by detection of an expansion of a GCG trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1 \\[ 5 \\]. Muscle biopsy is warranted only in individuals with suspected OPMD who have two normal PABPN1 alleles. Unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions are seen in muscle biopsy \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Currently, treatment is supportive as no therapeutic intervention is currently available for patients with OPMD. Surgical interventions like blepharoplasty and cricopharyngeal myotomy can temporarily help manage symptoms related to the ptosis and dysphagia, respectively. Malnutrition and recurrent aspiration pneumonia are the potential complications that reduce the life expectancy of these patients \\[ 2 , 6 , 7 \\]. PABPN1 gene therapy for OPMD is in the experimental phase. The recently published article showed that the treatment of mouse model of OPMD with PABPN1 gene therapy significantly reduces the muscle fibrosis, level of insoluble aggregates, reverts muscle strength and normalizes the muscle transcriptome. The efficacy of this gene therapy was further confirmed in cells derived from OPMD patients. These findings show a promising pathway towards a gene replacement approach for OPMD treatment in future \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【14】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【15】All the participating authors disclose no conflict of interest.\n\n【16】**Funding**\n\n【17】None.\n\n【18】**Authorship**\n\n【19】All authors had access to the data and played a role in writing and critical review of this manuscript.\n\n【20】**Consent**\n\n【21】Yes.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

She had stocking-like anesthesia in the entire right lower extremity and below the calf in the left lower extremity. She had a history of Hodgkin’s lymphoma treated 22 years ago with radiation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a huge 9.3 × 9.4 × 9.3 cm mass in the right thoracic cavity originating from the spinal canal ( Fig. 1 , 2 ). Fine needle aspiration revealed malignant schwannoma compatible with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The patient had T1-3 laminectomy and resection of the intradural-extramedullary neoplasm. She also had thoracotomy and resection of the intracavitary lesion.

A giant type IV schwannoma is an intraspinal-extraspinal dumbbell-like tumor with the extraspinal component more than 2.5 cm in diameter \\[ 2 \\]. Spinal schwannomas are mostly benign and extramedullary and rarely grow beyond 6 - 8 cm in diameter without giving significant symptoms \\[ 2 \\- 6 \\]. They may, however, manifest themselves in different ways. For example, Georghiou et al., 2003, reported a 57-year-old woman who presented with progressively aggravated dyspnea at rest, productive cough, and a referred vague left chest pain. She was found to have a 12 × 14 cm schwannoma compressing the upper lobe of the left lung and displacing the mediastinum with subocclusion of the main pulmonary artery \\[ 7 \\]. Kara et al, 2002, reported a 45-year-old woman who presented with cough and mild sputum production and was found to have a 16 cm ancient schwannoma in her left hemithorax \\[ 8 \\]. On the other hand, Kumar et al, 2006, reported an incidental finding of a 14 × 15 × 19 cm schwannoma in the right hemithorax of a 59-year-old woman \\[ 4 \\]. Schwannomas, thus, can be insidious tumors that give subtle symptoms for many years before the patient decides to seek medical help \\[ 9 \\] or discovering them by chance \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【12】Our case is interesting because previous radiotherapy probably contributed to the pathogenesis of the schwannoma.

Ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve blocks (II/IH-NB) are an important component of perioperative pain management. The II/IH nerves reside between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles entering this plane medial to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) \\[ 2 \\]. Cadaveric studies suggest that the transversalis and iliacus fascia are contiguous with one another. The continuity of this fascia allows a pathway for anesthetic to track toward the femoral nerve if infiltration occurs beneath or into the transversus abdominis muscle \\[ 2 \\]. The result is self-limited femoral nerve palsy (FNP) secondary to anesthetic blockade \\[ 3 \\]. Symptomatology of this palsy includes quadriceps muscle weakness, numbness or paresthesias in the anterior thigh, and proximal psoas muscle weakness \\[ 4 \\]. We present a case of FNP following intraoperative landmark-based II/IH-NB.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 75-year-old male presented to a community hospital for elective repair of a chronically incarcerated right inguinal hernia. He reported a 6-year history of incarceration and elects now for repair secondary to intractable discomfort which is lifestyle limiting. He reported no change in hernia size, bowel or bladder habits. A Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy was performed without complication. At the conclusion of the procedure, an II/IH-NB was performed utilizing 10 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine. In recovery, the patient reported numbness in the right anterior thigh. Upon examination, hip flexor weakness, quadriceps paralysis, and an inability to ambulate were noted. The patient was admitted for observation and had full return of neurologic function 8 h postoperatively. It was determined that he suffered from transient FNP due to his II/IH-NB. He reported no residual neurologic symptoms at follow-up appointments.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】Perioperative pain control is an important component of surgical care. Recently, there has been an increased emphasis on adequate pain management with minimal opioid administration \\[ 5-10 \\]. This is particularly important with an aging population who are prone to the adverse effects of opioids including somnolence, cognitive impairment, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression \\[ 11 \\]. As a result, II/IH and transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have gained popularity for perioperative pain control. While the overall safety of these blocks is well established, it is important to be aware of potential complications.\n\n【9】Complications following II/IH-NB are 4.5-9% \\[ 3 , 9 , 12 \\] with serious complications rarely reported. In addition to transient FNP, complications include trauma to blood vessels, pelvic hematoma, intravascular injection, urinary retention, and bladder/enteric penetration \\[ 3 , 5 , 9 , 12 \\]. Practitioner experience and modality of administration have been associated with complications and failure of NB to provide adequate analgesia \\[ 5 , 13 \\]. In an effort to avoid these complications, ultrasound-guidance was introduced as an alternative to traditional landmark-based administration.\n\n【10】Conventional landmark-based infiltration, known as a “blind” technique, utilizes the ASIS as its primary landmark. While all sources agree that the insertion occurs 2 cm medial to the ASIS, there is variation in coronal infiltration from 2 cm superior/inferior to the ASIS \\[ 7 , 13 \\]. This variation is in part due to anatomic variations of the II/IH nerves. In a study by Al-Dabbagh, the courses were identified in 110 primary inguinal hernia repairs and compared to accepted anatomic texts. They were consistent in only 41.8% of cases \\[ 14 \\]. The appropriate depth of penetration is determined by two palpable “clicks” as the needles transverses of the external and internal oblique aponeurosis ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Relevant planes and structures of II/IH blocks. 1: external oblique aponeurosis; 2: internal oblique aponeurosis; 3: II/IH nerve penetrating transversus abdominis; 4: transversalis fascia; 5: iliacus fascia; 6: femoral nerve; A: desired needle depth for II/IH block._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Local anesthetic, typically 0.5% bupivacaine, is infiltrated into this plane \\[ 2 , 13 \\]. Inadequate analgesic rates of 28-45% are reported \\[ 5 , 7 , 13 \\]. Suggested mechanisms include unpredictable nerve course, inaccuracy of tactile clicks, user experience and anatomic muscular variation \\[ 5 \\]. The combined thickness of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, which constitutes the desired landing zone, is less than 5 mm in cadaveric studies \\[ 2 \\]. Previously mentioned complications are secondary to inappropriate infiltration depth into or through the transversus abdominis muscle ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Improper administration depth. 1: Improper penetration through, into, or deep to the transversalis muscle. 2: As the transversalis and iliacus fascia are contiguous with one another, infiltration into this plane can result in tracking, inadvertently anesthetizing the femoral nerve._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】Several adjustments to the basic technique have been utilized in an attempt to produce consistent analgesic results. These include a fan distribution of infiltration, multiple site injection, and direct visualization \\[ 5 , 7 , 10 , 13 \\].\n\n【16】Ultrasound (US) guidance is a well-documented technique that allows direct visualization during infiltration \\[ 5-7 , 13 \\]. In this method, a high frequency probe is placed equidistance between the iliac crest and costal margin. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves are then identified between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. The area surrounding the nerves is infiltrated with local anesthetic until they appear to be completely surrounded with fluid. This characteristic visual effect is referred to as the kayak sign \\[ 7 \\]. It is recognized that this anatomic identification can be difficult and proficiency is associated with a learning curve. When performed by an experienced physician, US blocks have rapid onset, lower total dose administration, and more consistent analgesic effect than landmark-based methods \\[ 5 , 7 , 13 \\].\n\n【17】Another method of visualized infiltration is administration during laparoscopic procedures \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. This nerve blockade, typically utilized for TAP blocks, is performed during pneumoperitoneum with direct laparoscopic visualization. The needle is introduced at insertion sites in the midaxillary line equidistance between the iliac crest and costal margin. Two distinct “clicks” are felt and analgesic is infiltrated. Laparoscopic views are used to confirm bulging of the transversus abdominis muscle. This method similarly attempts to eliminate potential complications, specifically colonic or small bowel perforation which has been described with the other administration techniques. Proponents also note that there is little to no learning curve with this method which takes advantage of tactile sensation and laparoscopic visualization \\[ 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【18】Though the incidence of FNP following II/IH-NB is an uncommon occurrence, it does represent a potential risk to patient safety. Though there were no significant safety events in this case, there are reports of patient falls resulting in significant injuries including ankle sprains, ankle fractures, and femoral neck fractures \\[ 12 , 17 , 18 \\]. This risk is increased in the elderly, and those with baseline ataxia or neuromuscular disorders. There is no literature discussing postoperative safety screening measures aimed at identifying this complication. As a result of this occurrence, the institution performed a review for FNP screening following II/IH and TAP-NB. Screening had to be low cost, with minimal effect on nursing workflow. Patients receiving NB undergo a focused neurologic exam of the lower extremities by the nursing staff prior to ambulation and discharge home. Motor examination with strength testing of the hip and knee flexion/extension is tested. Sensation of the anterior thigh is also assessed. If the patient has no new neurologic deficits, the patient undergoes assisted ambulation. If there are no perceived deficits, the patient follows standard same day surgery discharge criteria. When deficits are noted, the physician is notified and the self-limited nature of this complication is discussed with the patient and responsible party. Final recommendations for observation or discharge are made on a case by case basis pending function status, debility, and home support. This protocol can be effectively implemented and adopted by recovery nurses with minimal effect to current workflow. This ensures safe and appropriate disposition of the patient, minimizing the potential risk of falling.\n\n【19】**Conclusions**\n\n【20】Inguinal hernia repairs are one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures. The integration of regional anesthetic NBs has decreased the opiod administration following these surgeries. Application of US and laparoscopic guidance has improved the safety and efficacy of these blockades. While this has proved an effective method of perioperative analgesia, it also introduces a new complement of complications. Transient FNP is one of these complications and is of particular interest due to its potential for significant patient injury if it is not promptly recognized. With identification, simple safety care plans can be developed on an individual basis. In this case, serious safety events were avoided. This has led to the integration of a new postoperative safety assessment aimed at prompt identification of FNP and appropriate disposition of those patients.\n\n【21】**Grants**\n\n【22】None.\n\n【23】**Financial Disclosures**\n\n【24】None.\n\n【25】**Conflicts of Interest**\n\n【26】None.\n\n【27】**Abbreviations**\n\n【28】II-IH: ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve; FNP: femoral nerve palsy; NB: nerve block; ASIS: anterior superior iliac spine; TAP: transverse abdominis plane; US: ultrasound\n\n【29】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy from all pregnancies is 0.15% (1:2,226). The incidence of cesarean scar pregnancy from all ectopic pregnancy is 6.1% \\[ 1 \\]. Gestational age ranges from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and 4 days at diagnosis \\[ 2 \\]. Early diagnosis is important because maternal mortality increases with increasing gestational weeks. Cervical pregnancy, incomplete abortion and cervico-isthmic pregnancy should be considered for the differential diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy. The transvaginal ultrasonography is the most commonly used imaging modality for differential diagnosis. Sonographic criteria, which could be helpful in diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy, are defined by Vial et al; however, transvaginal ultrasonography cannot put a definitive diagnosis in all cases \\[ 3 \\]. In this case report, a cesarean section scar pregnancy cannot be ruled out in patients who suspected of having cervical pregnancy by TVUS and clinical findings. For this reason MRI was performed additional to TVUS. After MRI, the diagnosis was changed to post-cesarean scar pregnancy. In this presentation, the clinical and radiological diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy, the advantages of MRI and treatment options were discussed with current literature.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】HB, a 39-year-old woman gravida 4, para 2 was referred to Kafkas University School of Medicine, Gynecology and Obstetric Department, approximately 7 weeks after her last normal menstrual period (LMP). She had a mild abdominal pain and a vaginal bleeding for 2 days. She had a history of two prior cesarean deliveries, 4 and 2 years ago, and a curettage following a spontaneous abortion. On vaginal examination, the uterus was mild tender, external cervical os was closed and clots with minor bleeding was seen. Blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg and heart rate was 92 beats per minute (BPM) on physical examination. She was hemodynamically stable. Her laboratory examination showed that hemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL, platelet count was 226 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and white blood cell count was 12.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (3.5 - 10.5). Prothrombin time was 13.9 s (10 - 15 s), and INR was 1.06 (0.8 - 1.2). The β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) level (13.405 mIU/mL) was significantly elevated. Liver and kidney function tests were in normal limits. Electrolyte imbalance was not observed. TVUS was performed by using VOLUSON (GE Healthcare Technologies, Ultrasound, Milwaukee, USA) transvaginal (7.5 MHz) transducer. The ultrasound examination revealed that there was a retrovert, normal uterine fundus with a thick endometrium. The uterine cavity was empty. There was a gestational sac at the level of the lower uterine segment. The crown-rump length was 4.9 mm which corresponds to an estimated gestational age of 6 weeks and 1 day ( Fig. 1 ). A possible uterine rupture was ruled out because there was no free fluid in Douglas. The fetal heart rate was seen in color Doppler ultrasound examination but it was bradycardic (50 - 60 BPM). A peak velocity of 35 cm/s and pulsatility index of 0.8 were measured in pulse Doppler examination. A localized cervical ectopic pregnancy was considered in the first place. However, due to the patient’s history of two previous cesarean sections, possible cesarean scar pregnancy could not be ruled out. Pelvic MRI was performed in a 1.5 Tesla MR unit (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens, USA) in order to localize the lesion more clearly. Sagittal T2 turbo spin echo (TSE), fat-suppressed sagittal, axial and coronal T2-TSE sequences were performed. A gestational sac which protrudes from myometrium at the anterior wall of the lower uterine segment was monitored. A very thin myometrium in the central part of the sac and thin serosa layer was viewed around the sac. Bladder wall integrity was preserved and the wall invasion was not detected. Uterine and cervical cavity was empty ( Fig. 2 ). As a result of MRI findings, patient was diagnosed in cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy without bladder invasion. Systemic methotrexate therapy (1 mg/kg) was initiated. In the first day, β-hCG level was not changed, fetal heart rate was observed and vaginal bleeding was persisted. The second dose intramuscular methotrexate therapy (1 mg/kg) was administered 4 days later but the serum β-hCG levels were decreased minimally; follow-up ultrasound examinations show that fetal cardiac activity and vaginal bleeding continued. Therefore, D & C was done. Patient’s ultrasound controls were normal after therapy, and β-hCG level reached normal levels at sixth week.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (A, B, C) At the level of the cervical canal there was an ectopic gestational sac including crown-rump length measuring 7.6 mm corresponding to an estimated gestational age of 6 weeks and 5 days._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** (A) Sagittal plan T2 TSE sequence; (B) Sagittal plan T2 FS TSE; (C) Coronal plan T2 FS TSE sequences shows a gestational sac which protrudes from myometrium at the anterior wall of the lower uterine segment (white arrow).

Bladder wall integrity was preserved and the wall invasion was not detected (arrow head). Uterine and cervical cavity was empty (red arrows)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】The pathophysiology and etiology of cesarean scar pregnancy has not been fully understood and different theories have been proposed in the literature. According to one hypothesis, a poor vascularity in the anterior lower uterine segment disrupts healing process after cesarean procedures in some women; therefore, this area is vulnerable to form small dehiscent tracts or defects where a trophoblast can implant \\[ 1 \\]. Most define the embryo entering the myometrium through microscopic tracts from small uterine dehiscences, with the lack of decidua basalis over the scar. This would explain why the gestational sac in a cesarean scar pregnancy is completely embedded in the myometrium, surrounded by fibrous scar tissue and separate from the endometrial cavity \\[ 4 \\]. In women who underwent cesarean section more than one is at increased risk of scar implantation caused by the formation large scar areas. This situation is observed not only following cesarean section but also after curettage, myomectomy, metroplasty, hysteroscopy and manual removal of the placenta \\[ 1 \\]. In some studies, there was no correlation between the number of previous cesarean section and the number of scar tissue ectopic pregnancies \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. On the other hand, other studies demonstrated that especially patients who had three or more cesarean sections have an increased risk of scar tissue ectopic pregnancy but patients undergoing operation once or twice have no significantly increased risks of ectopic scar pregnancy \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. In our case, the patient had a history of two cesarean sections and D & C.\n\n【12】Patient’s medical history supports the idea that the uterine wall damage may be associated with cesarean scar pregnancy. Medical history and physical examination findings are very important in the diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy as in other obstetric and gynecologic diseases. Seow et al indicated that the amount of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain pattern could provide important clues in the differential diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy. They reported that massive vaginal bleeding and cramp style severe abdominal pain occur in spontaneous abortion secondary to detachment of chorionic sac; on the other hand, mild vaginal bleeding and moderate abdominal pain may occur in scar pregnancy \\[ 6 \\]. In our case, there were slight vaginal bleeding and abdominal tenderness continuing for 2 days.\n\n【13】TVUS should be the first imaging modality to be used for diagnosis after medical history and physical examination findings. The ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by ultrasound in most of the cases. Sonographic criteria which may be helpful in diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy were defined by Vial et al: 1) a trophoblast located between the bladder and anterior uterine wall at the presumed site of the cesarean section scar; 2) a gestational sac which is ovoid and regular in shape, as opposed to distorted and collapsed as can be seen in miscarriages and 3) a thin or discontinuous myometrium between the gestational sac and urinary bladder wall on sagittal images of the uterus through the amniotic sac \\[ 3 \\]. Vascularity of the sac on color Doppler interrogation can aid in distinguishing a CSP from the avascular sac of an aborting pregnancy. Alternatively, a negative “sliding organ sign” when gentle pressure is applied to a sac seen at the level of the internal orifice of the uterus using the endovaginal probe can help differentiate a CSP from a spontaneous abortion in progress. Findings of high velocity (peak velocity > 20 cm/s) and low impedance (pulsatility index < 1) waveforms on pulsed Doppler have been described with scar implantation \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【14】Cesarean section scar pregnancies are often diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography and Doppler findings but if there is a difficulty in diagnosing cases as in our patient, MRI can be used. MRI is very helpful in showing sac characterization, localization and whether there is an invasion of adjacent organs because it is a multiplanar imaging method and it has a high soft tissue resolution. Another advantage of the MRI is that it gives critical information for further treatment plan and guidance to surgeons \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【15】MRI’s disadvantages are the high cost and long duration of shooting. Patients with massive bleeding should be monitored during MRI shooting and the length of exposure time should be kept in mind.\n\n【16】In our patient, the ultrasound findings showed that there was an ectopic pregnancy at the lower uterine segment, but we could not distinguish whether it was a cervical pregnancy or a cesarean scar pregnancy. Second confusing situation is that the bladder invasion could not be evaluated clearly because a sac location was very close to the bladder. MRI demonstrated that the gestational sac was protruding out of the myometrium at isthmoservical junction at the level of cesarean scar and a sac location was very close to the bladder but it is understood that there was no bladder invasion by monitoring intact bladder wall. In light of these findings, medical therapy was started safely. However, as a result of inadequate medical treatment D & C was performed to the patient.\n\n【17】There is no universal method or consensus for the treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy. The patient’s age, clinical status, pregnancy size, future pregnancy expectations, whether there is a scar rupture, β-hCG levels, technical equipment and the team’s experience are important factors for the choice of treatment. In order to avoid uterine rupture and hemorrhage of the uterus and to preserve fertility and uterus, medical or combined medical and surgical treatment modalities are preferred. Medical treatment is administered systemically or locally. Ultrasound guided injection of methotrexate or potassium chloride to the gestational sac and aspiration of the sac are usually used for local application \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. Intramuscular methotrexate (1 mg/kg) is applied to patients in systemic medical therapy. Surgical treatment is introduced in cases unresponsive to medical therapy. After medical therapy, follow-up weekly β-hCG should be done until β-hCG level is reached undetectable level and monthly ultrasound follow-up examination should be done until no detection of pregnancy materials. The β-hCG generally reaches its normal levels after 4 - 16 weeks \\[ 13 \\]. Gestational sac can be removed by laparotomy or laparoscopy in the surgical treatment. Hysterectomy can be performed in patient with an uncontrolled bleeding and an absence of expected future pregnancies. Another treatment method is uterine artery embolization (UAE). UAE might be a life-saving practice as an alternative to surgical treatment in patients with severe vaginal bleeding and who want to preserve fertility. However, it cannot be performed at all centers because it requires an experienced team and technical equipment \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【18】Consequently, the MRI application in cesarean scar pregnancies reveals localization of gestational sac and its relationship with adjacent organs more clearly. Therefore, it provides very important information in determining the treatment plan and guidance the surgeon. As our case report, it is recommended that MRI should be used in addition to TVUS in cesarean scar pregnancy in selected cases that cannot be diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography.\n\n【19】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Initially she developed sharp, stabbing generalized abdominal pain followed by abdominal distension. She did not open her bowel for 4 days with nil flatus for 2 days. She had previously been treated for gastritis for _H. pylori_ 15 years ago. She never had any abdominal operation. She also noticed a 50 kg weight loss in last 1 year, some of which was intentional. Since dieting, her bowel motion reduced from three times per day to once per week. On physical examination, she was hemodynamically stable. Her abdomen was soft but generalized tender with no bowel sound. CT scan of abdomen showed dilatation of stomach, first and second part of duodenum. There was compression of D3 (third part of duodenum) between the aorta and SMA ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Distal to this, the bowel loops were completely collapsed. A subsequent barium meal and follow-through demonstrated a linear compression at the third part of the duodenum causing dilation of the proximal duodenum. This was also compatible with compression by the SMA ( Fig. 3a-d ). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organized that showed gastroparesis and scattered stomach ulcer in antrum. D1 and D2 were visualized without any obvious lesion. It was unable to reach D3, possibly secondary to dilated and stretched stomach. SMA syndrome was diagnosed. She was treated conservatively for 6 days without any improvement. She was taken to theater and Strong procedure was performed and discharged on second postoperative day. Postoperatively, she was put on a high-calorie diet, and subsequently gained 10 kg in body weight with no recurrence on 6 and 12 months follow-up.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** CT scan of abdomen showing dilatation of stomach, first and second part of duodenum.

Prevalence is about 0.013-0.3% with female predominance and occurs mostly between 10 and 39 years.\n\n【14】Normally, the SMA forms an approximately 45° angle (range, 38-65°) as it comes off the aorta. This angulation produces an aortomesenteric distance that spans 10 - 28 mm without impingement on the duodenal lumen as the third portion traverses laterally toward the ligament of Treitz. Decreasing the aortomesenteric angle to less than 25° will decrease the aortomesenteric distance to less than 10 mm. When this condition occurs, the third portion of the duodenum is compressed and SMA syndrome symptoms ensue \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【15】**Predisposing factors**\n\n【16】Predisposing factors include: 1) reapid weight loss; 2) reduction of the mesenteric fat around the SMA (causes: AIDS, malabsorption, cancer, cerebral palsy, and other conditions associated with cachexia; catabolic conditions, e.g. burns; eating disorders, e.g. anorexia nervosa and drug abuse \\[ 1 \\]); 3) following surgery (spine surgery: scoliosis correction, due to a relative lengthening of the spine postoperatively (prevalence 0.5-2.4%) \\[ 4 \\]; ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) - stretch the SMA over duodenum as the ileal pouch reaches pelvis; surgery associated with rapid weight loss - bariatric surgery, esophagectomy, abdominal trauma; others: compression from an AAA or SMA aneurysm \\[ 4 \\]); and 4) anatomical variants (high ligament of Treitz; low origin of the SMA).\n\n【17】**Diagnosis**\n\n【18】Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Unlikely our patient, most cases present in a chronic, insidious manner with the development of intermittent abdominal pain associated with vomiting, early satiety, and anorexia, esophageal reflux or anorexia. Sometimes they present with weight loss. Patients rarely present with signs and symptoms of acute duodenal obstruction \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【19】**Investigations**\n\n【20】Radiological evidence of D3 compression by SMA includes: 1) aorto-mesenteric angle < 22° (normal 38-65°) \\[ 6 \\]; 2) aorto-mesenteric distance < 8 mm (normal 10 - 28 mm); and 3) proximal duodenal dilation with cut-off at D3 indicates SMA syndrome ( Fig. 4a, b ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** (a) Anatomy and origin of SMA. (b) Normal aorto-mesenteric angle and distance._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【22】Contrast X-ray studies involve barium studies (that show duodenal dilation, retention of barium within the duodenum, and the characteristic vertical linear extrinsic compression at the third part of the duodenum), CT of abdomen (with oral contrast) and CT angiogram \\[ 7 \\]. Endoscopy is used to confirm external compression at the third part of the duodenum and can rule out intrinsic pathology of the duodenum \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【23】**Treatment**\n\n【24】Conservative management combined with a high-calorie diet is usually advocated \\[ 1 , 6 \\]. Nutritional support with nasojejunal feeds when possible or TPN in selected patients is helpful. Positioning the patient in a knee-to-chest position or prone after eating helps to improve symptoms.\n\n【25】Surgical intervention is indicated only when medical therapy fails. Strong procedure involves division of the ligament of Treitz \\[ 3 \\], and allows caudal duodenal mobilization outside the aortomesenteric angle. Although appealing because bowel integrity is not compromised by an anastomosis, the drawback of the Strong procedure is a 25% failure rate resulting from tethering of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery \\[ 2 \\]. Bypass of the third part of the duodenum by the creation of a duodenojejunostomy together with division of the ligament of Treitz has been the operation of choice. Recently, laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy has been attempted in a number of centers with satisfactory results \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【26】**Conclusions**\n\n【27】SMA syndrome is a rare cause of chronic duodenal obstruction. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. It requires surgical intervention if conservative management fails. Currently, advances in minimal-access bariatric surgery have demonstrated the safety and low morbidity of laparoscopically created enteric anastomoses \\[ 3 \\]. But there is no large scale study to compare the treatment modalities.\n\n【28】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【29】There is no conflict of interest.\n\n【30】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Firstly, the patient had respiratory symptoms rather than gastroenterology symptoms. The most common symptoms for esophageal cancer are dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Our patient presented with a chronic cough. Esophageal cancer can present with respiratory symptoms of cough and lung infection \\[ 16 \\]. This mechanism is commonly due to the presence of an acquired tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), which the patient did not have. In the literature, there was a case of an esophageal cancer in a patient presenting with acute respiratory symptoms rather the chronic, without a history of respiratory disease or acquired TEF \\[ 17-19 \\].\n\n【30】Secondly, EAC arises from the distal third of the esophagus \\[ 20 \\]. The unusual location and distribution of the tumor in our case was very rare. The first friable mass was located at 22 cm from the incisors, which is part of the proximal two-thirds. The lesions were diffuse and extending down 35 cm from the incisors.\n\n【31】Thirdly, common risk factors for EAC are Barrett’s esophagus caused by chronic GERD, low socioeconomic status, obesity, and male gender \\[ 21-23 \\]. Higher alcohol consumption was not associated with increased risk of EAC \\[ 24 \\]. Our patient did not have any risk factors to suspect esophageal cancer.\n\n【32】In the review of the literature ( Table 1 ) \\[ 9 , 10 , 25-38 \\], 16/21 patients presented with atypical symptoms of either metastatic or non-metastatic esophageal cancer.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Review of the Literature for Esophageal Cancer With an Unusual Presentation \\[ 9 , 10 , 25-38 \\]_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【34】Endoscopy with biopsy is the diagnostic test of choice for esophageal cancer \\[ 39 \\].

It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery. Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32%. The diagnosis of this rare disease is difficult to make. Pregnancy-related pathologies such as pre-eclampsia, myocarditis, or underlying genetic disease show overlapping symptoms with PPCM. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder that presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Edema is frequently present in patients with pre-eclampsia.

Chest radiography showed left lower lobe pneumonia and pulmonary congestion. In view of rising trend of total white blood cells, a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia was made. She was started on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【9】On postoperative day 5, she had persistent and worsening dyspnea and was noted to be clinically overloaded. Chest X-ray showed that the lungs were congested and there is bilateral perihilar airspace opacification in a bat wing’s configuration, which was worrisome for pulmonary edema. She was given frusemide and a cardiologist referral was made. A two-dimensional echocardiography was done which showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 58% with moderate mitral regurgitation, unlikely to be PPCM.\n\n【10】Ultrasound abdomen and kidneys showed normal liver and kidney functions. Her creatinine levels and liver function tests progressively returned to normal. Fluid overload resolved with strict fluid restriction. Her pneumonia resolved after 10 days of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged on POD15 well and afebrile.\n\n【11】The patient returned 3 days later to the emergency department complaining of left thigh blisters with fever. She also complained of mild dyspnea and a productive cough. Her vitals showed tachycardia with a pulse rate of 124 beats per minute but blood pressure was normal. On examination, there was a 2 cm vesicular lesion on the anterior aspect of her left thigh. Chest X-ray showed increased opacity and haziness over bilateral lower lung lobes compared to previous X-rays. Patient was advised for admission to treat for pneumonia but she declined and went home.\n\n【12】She returned to the emergency department a day later with increased shortness of breath and persistent left thigh blister that was increasing in size. She was tachypneic and unable to speak in full sentences. Her blood pressure was 169/126 mm Hg and heart rate was 158 beats per minute. The temperature was 37.5 °C. Her oxygen saturation was 35% on a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood gas showed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with type 1 respiratory failure. Patient had a seizure while her blood was taken which was aborted with intravenous midazolam. She was subsequently intubated and kept on mechanical ventilation. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral basal crepitation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion and a diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema was made. She was then admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with central line monitoring.\n\n【13】The patient was reviewed by the cardiologists and a formal two-dimensional echocardiography was done. It showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, mild global left ventricular hypokinesia, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderately dilated left atrium, mildly dilated right atrium and normal ventricles. A diagnosis of PPCM was made. Patient was treated with intravenous frusemide and started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Residual HELLP syndrome was unlikely as the patient was 3 weeks postpartum and biochemical investigations do not support ongoing or worsening HELLP syndrome. The patient had an episode of pulseless electrical activity 1 day after admission to intensive care unit. She was resuscitated for 3 min and intravenous adrenaline was given with return of spontaneous circulation within 2 min. The patient’s care was taken over by the cardiologists and she was transferred to the cardiology intensive care unit.\n\n【14】She was extubated 3 days after admission and intravenous frusemide was converted to oral. Anti-hypertensives were started for blood pressure control and diuresis was achieved with negative balance of up to 500 mL/day. Her renal function gradually improved with creatinine levels on a downward trend till normal before discharge. Infection markers were also on a downward trend and intravenous antibiotics were stopped. The patient was discharged home well 10 days after the second admission.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【16】* * *\n\n【17】Our patient first presented with HELLP syndrome secondary to severe pre-eclampsia. She was unfortunate to have suffered from nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged hospital stay. Acute kidney injury was thought to be a complication of HELLP syndrome but the renal physicians did not rule out the possibility of chronic kidney disease that was not diagnosed before pregnancy. PPCM is likely, as the patient had no past history of cardiac disease before pregnancy. The patient gave a history of increased fluid intake when she was at home as she thought it would improve her kidney function. Her actions probably resulted in acute pulmonary edema as her heart was unable to cope with the increased fluid due to cardiomyopathy.\n\n【18】PPCM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown origin. It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery \\[ 1 \\]. PPCM is rare in some places but more common in others. It seems to be more prevalent in developing countries. For example, the incidence in Nigeria (1%) or Haiti (0.33%) surpasses that in more developed countries, such as South Africa (0.1%) or the United States (1:3,000 - 4,000 deliveries) \\[ 2 \\]. The reason for these discrepancies remain unknown but may be due to environmental and genetics factor, quality of perinatal care and also socio-cultural practices.\n\n【19】Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32% \\[ 3 \\], and the diagnosis of this rare disease is not always straightforward.\n\n【20】PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion and defined based on four criteria: 1) development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum; 2) the absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure; 3) absence of recognizable heart disease before the last month of pregnancy; and 4) LV systolic dysfunction shown by echocardiographic data such as depressed shortening fraction (e.g. ejection fraction less than 45%, M-mode fractional shortening less than 30%, or both, and an LV end-diastolic dimension of more than 2.7 cm/m <sup>2 </sup> ) \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【21】It may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of normal late pregnancy. Giddiness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or pedal edema can happen in both normal late pregnancy and early congestive heart failure. Therefore, we need to be extremely cautious when dealing with patients with dyspnea in late pregnancy or postpartum. Careful history taking and physical examination need to be undertaken to exclude conditions that can cause or exacerbate heart failure. Volume status of the patient needs to be assessed through postural blood pressure, weight, blood investigations and physical examination. A complete works of blood investigations should be done to exclude causes of heart failure. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram and chest radiograph should be done to assess for cardiac abnormalities and hypertrophy of the heart. Chest radiographs can also be used to look for pulmonary edema. Two-dimensional echocardiogram is useful to assess LV size, wall thickness, and valvular function.\n\n【22】Several etiologies have been postulated but none is definite. They include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, stress activated cytokines, abnormal responses to hemodynamic stress of pregnancy, increased myocyte apoptosis, malnutrition, genetics factors, abnormal prolactin production, abnormal hormonal function, increased adrenergic tone secondary to emotional or physical stress, and myocardial ischemia.\n\n【23】Risk factors include advanced maternal age, multiparity, obesity, African origin, multiple pregnancy, malnutrition, gestational hypertension, diabetes, prolonged tocolysis, low socioeconomic status, poor perinatal care, breast feeding, substance and tobacco abuse, and family history \\[ 2 , 5 \\].\n\n【24】The standard principles of acute treatment for PPCM are the same as for heart failure. This includes fluid and salt restriction, treatment of hypertension, diuretics, vasodilators and digoxin. The aim of the treatment is to relieve the symptoms, delay progression of left ventricular dysfunction, and improving survival. Special cautions need to be given when deciding which medications when given to the mother will be harmful to the neonate when breastfeeding. Currently, cardiologists use three types of drugs (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and B-blockers) for the treatment of chronic heart failure \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【25】Diuretics help to improve pulmonary and peripheral edema within hours or days \\[ 6 \\]. ACEIs improve survival in all severities of myocardial disease, but are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding, due to its severe teratogenicity. ARBs help to improve survival in patients with heart failure but they have similar teratogenic risks as ACEIs. Three different B-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol) have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【26】Atrial arrhythmias should be treated with digoxin. However, class III and class IV anti-arrhythmias should be avoided because of their teratogenic risks \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】Early delivery is recommended if the condition of a patient with PPCM is unstable despite medical treatment. Prostaglandins and oxytocin can be used as methods of inducing labor with minimal risks. Adequate analgesia, such as epidural, is recommended to reduce the load of the heart as pain will stimulate a sympathetic response. Strict fluid restriction should be maintained in order to avoid fluid overload. It will be beneficial to insert an indwelling urine catheter or even a central line to monitor the volume status of the patient. A vaginal delivery is recommended over cesarean section in view of the potential surgical risks of cesarean section. However, a cesarean delivery should be performed if there are obstetrics indications. Thromboprophylaxis should be given peripartum.\n\n【28】Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem condition, involving hypertension and proteinuria, which happens in pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation. Edema is frequently present. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves endothelial damage and capillary leak. Some of the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia include headache or visual disturbances, impaired coagulation, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, ascites, and renal failure. Pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria are caused by endothelial dysfunction with subsequent capillary leak. As pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria occur in heart failure too, it makes the diagnosis of PPCM difficult \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【29】HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of pre-eclampsia and it involves hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia \\[ 9 \\]. It occurs in < 1% of pregnancies during the third trimester or in the first few days postpartum. The pathophysiology involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia secondary to general activation of coagulation cascade. It presents with epigastric pain, visual disturbances, headache and parasthesiae. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is the most frequent major complication. Acute renal failure occurs in almost half of such cases.\n\n【30】Our patient’s encounter demonstrates the complexity of managing a patient with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome and acute renal failure, and PPCM. The symptoms are often similar which makes the diagnosis extremely difficult. A multidisciplinary team of specialists will be required for optimal care and management of such patients.\n\n【31】**Grant**\n\n【32】None.\n\n【33】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【34】None.\n\n【35】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The involvement of different layers of the intestinal wall usually gives rise to different clinical manifestations. The mucosal form, which is the most common EG subtype, presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal blood loss, anemia and weight loss secondary to malabsorption. The muscularis form is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils predominantly in the muscularis layer, leading to thickening of the bowel wall, which might result in gastrointestinal obstructive symptoms. The subserosal form occurs in a minority of patients with EG, and it is characterized by exudative ascites with higher peripheral eosinophil counts compared with the other forms \\[ 2 \\]. The etiology of EG is unknown and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. EG has features of allergy and immune dysregulation but does not clearly fit into the category of allergic or immune disorder \\[ 3 \\]. The diagnostic criteria for the EG are well defined. They include gastrointestinal symptoms, eosinophilic infiltration in at least one area of the digestive tract demonstrated by biopsy, absence of eosinophilic infiltration in other organs outside the digestive tract and absence of parasitic infections \\[ 4 \\]. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy with a 90% response rate in some studies. Appropriate duration of steroid treatment is unknown and relapse often necessitates long-term treatment \\[ 1 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】We present a 51-year old white gentleman who presented with acute onset of severe constant right-sided abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. He was unable to tolerate solids or liquids. He states that he has not had a bowel movement or passed flatus in the last 48 h. He had a colonoscopy 5 months prior to this presentation which showed moderately severe diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Past surgical history consists of inguinal hernia repair and appendectomy.\n\n【6】**On examination**\n\n【7】He was in mild distress, and abdomen was soft, distended with tenderness in the right lower quadrant and otherwise normal exam.\n\n【8】**Labs**\n\n【9】WBC 11,800/µL with 81% neutrophils and 0.7% eosinophils, HGB 14.8 g/dL, platelets 250,000/µL.

Surgery team was consulted and due to the severity of symptoms they decided to proceed with laproscopic procedure. During the procedure, the ileum was distended with thickened bowel wall. Several centimeters proximal to the ileocecal valve, there was a puckering which appeared to be stricture with some ulceration with no obvious cobble stoning. The colonic mucosa was tan-pink to red, smooth and glistening, and displays prominent irregular folds. Right hemicolectomy was done and the tissue was sent for pathologic evaluation.\n\n【15】**Pathology**\n\n【16】Dense infiltrate of eosinophils in the muscularis propria suggests EG ( Fig. 2 ).

Clinical features depend upon the most prominent layer of visceral wall involvement by eosinophils, i.e. mucosal, muscular or serosal \\[ 6 \\]. Approximately 57.5% have mucosal, 30% muscular and 12.5% (sub) serosal disease, respectively \\[ 7 \\]. Although the disease may affect all ages, typical presentations are in the third through fifth decades. EG tends to have an equal gender distribution, 50% of patients may be atopic and 50% may have a history of food intolerance of allergy \\[ 8 \\]. Mucosa-predominant disease is manifested as non-specific abdominal discomfort, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy \\[ 9 \\], whereas muscularis-predominant disease leads to bowel wall thickening and intestinal obstruction. Cramping and abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting occur frequently. It can also present as an obstructing cecal mass or intussusception \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. In contrast, subserosa-predominant disease more commonly results in eosinophilic ascites and markedly elevated counts of eosinophils in peripheral blood \\[ 9 \\]. Peripheral eosinophilia occurs in a variable number of EG patients (20-90%), and is not a reliable prerequisite for diagnosis \\[ 10 \\]. The endoscopic appearance in EG is non-specific, including erythematous, friable, nodular and occasional ulcerative changes \\[ 6 \\]. In the muscular form, endoscopy may appear normal. Most EG cases have been diagnosed on surgical, full-thickness biopsy or resection performed for obstruction or suspicion of malignancy \\[ 7 , 11 \\]. Radiographically, there is no pathognomonic appearance of EG, the appearance being identical to Crohn’s enterocolitis, with thickening and flattening of the valvulae conniventes (most common), strictures, filling defects, ulceration, polypoid lesions and rigidity of the ileocecal valve \\[ 10 \\]. The mainstay of treatment in non-obstructive disease is a trial of dietary avoidance of food allergens, but if the symptoms persist or are severe, then corticosteroid therapy is recommended \\[ 7 , 9 \\]. Prednisone at a dose of 20 - 40 mg daily for 8 weeks can yield a good response. Budesonide is an alternative steroid with fewer systemic side effects \\[ 7 \\]. Surgical treatment is required for patients with intestinal perforation and/or obstruction \\[ 2 , 10 \\].\n\n【23】In our case, the patient had small bowel obstruction due to a stricture and small bowel wall thickening caused by EG requiring surgical intervention. The patient was followed up later on with complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【24】In conclusion, eosinophilic enteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ileitis. Patients, with muscular form of EG, usually present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction due to small bowel wall thickening and rarely stricture formation. Surgery is the treatment of choice in the presence of obstruction. To our knowledge, very few cases with this entity have been reported.\n\n【25】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【26】The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【27】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

About 67% are located in the second portion of the duodenum. The prevalence in the general population ranges from 0.06% to 22% depending upon mode of diagnosis. Higher prevalence was reported in autopsy studies \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Prevalence ranges from 1:1 to an increased prevalence in men as compared to women \\[ 4 \\]. Majority of the cases of duodenal diverticula are asymptomatic and identified incidentally on investigative studies \\[ 5 \\]. The most common clinical presentation in patients with symptomatic diverticula is abdominal pain \\[ 6 \\]. Complications are rare but can result in significant mortality \\[ 2 \\]. Complications of duodenal diverticula include mechanical obstruction of the common bile duct, pancreatic duct or duodenum, diverticulitis with perforation, abscess, fistula formation, sepsis and hemorrhage \\[ 2 \\]. Hemorrhage from duodenal diverticula is rare and the first case was reported in 1951 by Patterson and Bromberg \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. We present a case of massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from multiple duodenal diverticula.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 43-year-old man with no significant past medical history was evaluated for dizziness, lightheadedness, hematemesis, and melena. Patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg and was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and blood products. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple diverticula in bulb, sweep and second portion of the duodenum with active bleeding from diverticulum ( Fig. 1 , 2 ). Diluted epinephrine (1:10,000) was injected around bleeding diverticulum and multiple endoclips were applied to achieve hemostasis ( Fig. 3 ). Patient continued to have persistent melena and required multiple units of packed red blood cells, a total of about 20 units throughout his hospital course. A repeat EGD showed active bleeding from another duodenal diverticulum. Endoscopic therapy with epinephrine injection and endoclips was used to achieve hemostasis again. Patient again began to hemorrhage, thus angiography was performed. Angiography showed celiac artery stenosis with poststenotic dilatation. There was retrograde flow of the gastroduodenal artery and was a major arterial supply to hepatic artery proper ( Fig. 4 ). Hence, embolization of gastroduodenal artery was not performed due to risk ischemia to the liver. Patient was thus referred for surgical management. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Incidentally, large 4 cm extra luminal mass was found and excised in its entirety from the anterior wall of the antrum. Through a gastrostomy, no bleeding was visualized from ampulla or diverticulum. The patient did not have any further episodes of bleeding and was discharged home. Pathology of gastric mass was consistent with GI stromal tumor.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Upper endoscopy showing multiple duodenal diverticula at the duodenal bulb._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Upper endoscopy showing active hemorrhage and clot formation from a duodenal diverticulum._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Repeat upper endoscopy showing continued active bleeding from another duodenal diverticulum with six endoclips applied to achieve hemostasis._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Angiogram showing a 3 French microcatheter used to selectively cannulate the gastroduodenal artery from the celiac axis with retrograde flow noted within the gastroduodenal artery from the superior mesenteric artery._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Duodenum diverticula are rare cause of massive upper GI hemorrhage. It is estimated that 0.14% of upper GI bleeding is caused by duodenal diverticula \\[ 4 \\]. They are more common in older patients and colonic diverticula may also be present in about 30% of patients \\[ 8 \\]. Most duodenal diverticula are acquired, and consist of a sac of mucosal or sub mucosal layers herniating through a muscular defect or weak point in bowel wall \\[ 3 , 8 \\]. However, the exact pathogenesis remains somewhat uncertain \\[ 3 , 8 \\]. More than 90% of duodenal diverticula occur on the medial side of the duodenum in second, third and fourth portion. The second portion is the most common site within 2.5 cm of the major duodenal papilla \\[ 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 \\]. Hemorrhage has been reported to occur more commonly with diverticula located in the third and fourth portion of the duodenum \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【16】The reported incidence of bleeding from duodenal diverticula is about 7% \\[ 10 \\]. The exact mechanism is unknown but some studies have implicated the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa or aortoenteric fistulas, erosion into a major vessel or stasis-induced ulceration as the cause of diverticular bleed \\[ 3 , 5 , 8 \\]. Clinically, significant bleeding from duodenal diverticula usually presents as melena \\[ 5 \\]. Presentations as hematemesis and hematochezia have been rarely described \\[ 5 \\]. The use of EGD as an initial diagnostic approach offers the advantage of possibly identifying the bleeding site and investigating the presence of other more common etiologies of upper GI bleeding \\[ 5 \\]. However, EGD might not be successful in identifying the bleeding site especially if the bleeding is massive or located at a distal site. Other diagnostic modalities such as a computed tomography scan with contrast, magnetic resonance imaging or upper GI barium studies might be helpful in identifying the diverticulum \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【17】Treatment of duodenal diverticula is generally only recommended in symptomatic cases \\[ 4 \\]. Currently, no guidelines exist on the optimal therapeutic approach to manage a bleeding diverticulum. Treatment options include endoscopic techniques to achieve hemostasis, selective arterial embolization and surgical management \\[ 2 , 3 , 10 \\]. The first case of endoscopic hemostasis of duodenal diverticula bleeding was reported in 1991 by Sim et al \\[ 7 \\]. However, the use of endoscopy as the sole management can be limited due to the high incidence of re-bleeding \\[ 10 \\]. In our case, the patient required endoscopic therapy twice to achieve hemostasis; however, the patient had re-bleeding. Selective embolization was not feasible given the presence of celiac artery stenosis and retrograde flow of gastroduodenal artery. Surgery remains the definitive treatment in cases with persistent life-threatening hemorrhage \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【18】In conclusion, duodenal diverticula are a rare cause of upper GI bleeding but should always be considered in patients with an unknown etiology for upper GI bleeding. Cases of successful endoscopic management have been described in literature but there is a significant incidence of re-bleeding. No clear consensus on the therapeutic approach exists but the selection should be on a personalized basis depending on the location, patient’s individual risk factors and hemodynamic significance of the hemorrhage.\n\n【19】**Grant Support**\n\n【20】None.\n\n【21】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【22】No.\n\n【23】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Her regular medications were drugs for diabetes and osteoporosis. The patient’s chief complaint was pain on the left side of her neck. She experienced worsening pain and no limitation during her jaw movement. She reported no surgical history or tonsillectomy. The patient did not complain of symptoms mimicking glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Upon examination, she had severe neck pain but normal vital signs. Neck examination revealed tenderness in near front of the mastoid process. Other examinations were normal. Blood test and X-ray findings were also normal. Because of concern regarding an underlying fracture, a computed tomography scan of the neck was performed, which revealed a fracture of the SP ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Computed tomography of the neck showing a fracture of the styloid process.

After 2 months when conservative treatment started, her neck pain gradually resolved.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Investigations of the epidemiology of fracture of the SP have indicated that such fractures are rare traumatic events that frequently occur in association with other head and neck fractures, especially mandibular fractures \\[ 1 \\]. Several reports have described fractures of the SP in patients with Eagle syndrome \\[ 3-5 \\]. However, no reports have described fracture of the SP due to a minor trauma such as that induced by rolling over.\n\n【12】With respect to the cause of the fracture of the SP in the patient, traumatic injury is likely. When she rolled over, her neck sprained unnaturally. She also had a history of osteoporosis; thus, bone fragility might have contributed to the fracture. She had no other predisposing risk factors for fracture of the SP, although the influence of osteoporosis was not completely ruled out. Therefore, the cause of the fracture of the SP in her could be considered to be related to rolling over.\n\n【13】Regarding the therapeutic approach to the fracture of the SP in the patient, conservative management was chosen and provided good recovery. However, optimal management of a fracture of the SP depends on its severity and displacement \\[ 3 \\]. Surgical removal of an SP bone chip could be necessary in some patients, but conservative treatment might be sufficient in those with only mild discomfort. The patient was treated conservatively with a neck brace to limit her neck movement, and we prescribed an analgesic. To the best of my knowledge, no reports have described fractures in elderly patients in association with rolling over. Fracture of the styloid process should be considered in elderly patients with sudden onset of neck pain during sleep.\n\n【14】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The possibility of anastomotic suture site perforation or avulsion while performing traditional angioplasty/stenting would be particularly lethal, especially in an unstable patient. We present a case of acute MI complicated by cardiogenic due to acute LIMA to LAD graft closure and successful rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by directly deploying a PK Papyrus covered stent (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) across the distal anastomosis. We feel this strategy would not only be an appropriate rescue option but would also be “fool-proof” in preventing anastomotic site perforations, which may occur with traditional angioplasty or stenting and therefore should be routinely utilized in acute internal mammary artery (IMA) graft failure involving the anastomotic site.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 75-year-old male with the past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis via a right upper extremity fistula was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. Selective coronary angiography revealed multivessel disease, including a critical 80% stenosis of the ostium of the left main coronary artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function. The patient underwent two-vessel CABG: LIMA to LAD and reverse saphenous venous graft to obtuse marginal (OM) branch with 7-0 Prolene sutures distally in end-to-side fashion to the OM and LAD, respectively.\n\n【6】Less than 24 h later, the patient developed acute respiratory distress following extubation and suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation. Following resuscitation, the patient’s hemodynamic status quickly deteriorated requiring maximum vasoactive pharmacologic support. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and severe anterior wall hypokinesis. Patient was referred for temporary mechanical circulatory support and urgent angiography. An Impella CP device was placed and angiography revealed a 95% stenosis at the LIMA to LAD anastomosis with slow flow in the distal LAD ( Fig. 1 ). Re-operation was not considered due to patient’s poor hemodynamic status and PCI was deemed risky given the possibility of anastomotic site perforation due to suture breakage, given that the graft was barely 1 day old. A novel strategy of direct stenting with the new covered stent platform was felt to be the most optimal technique in this setting. A 6-French IMA guide was used to engage the LIMA, a standard work-horse 0.014-inch coronary guide wire was advanced across the lesion into the LAD, and in rapid exchange fashion, a 2.5 × 15 mm PK Papyrus covered stent (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) was advanced across the lesion (traversing the LAD to LIMA anastomosis), and successfully deployed at nominal pressure of 10 atm. Subsequent angiography revealed antegrade Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow of the LIMA and LAD with excellent myocardial blush of the subtended anterior and apical myocardial wall segments ( Fig. 2 ). Additionally, antegrade flow of the native LAD close to the anastomosis was noted, providing adequate myocardial perfusion of the basal and mid anterior wall segments ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Selective LIMA angiography in the (a) anterior-posterior (AP) and (b) right anterior oblique/cranial (RAO-CRAN) projection showing critical, flow-limiting disease of the LIMA to LAD anastomosis and of the native LAD immediately to the graft touchdown.

Early graft failure post CABG, leading to perioperative MI, occurs in 5-10% of cases \\[ 2 \\]. LIMA is the most commonly used arterial conduit for bypassing the LAD. Acute IMA graft failure is rare, and most commonly results from graft thrombosis, dissection, spasm or stenosis \\[ 3 \\]. Data regarding the best revascularization strategy for acute IMA graft failure involving the anastomosis are lacking. Percutaneous revascularization may be preferred, especially if the patient’s clinical condition may not support re-operation \\[ 4 \\], but traditional angioplasty or stenting is fraught with risk of perforation due to loss of suture site integrity early after surgery. In this regard, several case reports have described successful PCI of a failed graft anastomosis \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In a case series of patients who underwent urgent PCI for perioperative MI after CABG, the rate of native coronary/bypass graft perforation due to urgent percutaneous revascularization was 30%, and all patients who suffered a perforation were then subsequently treated with covered stent placement \\[ 7 \\]. Covered stent deployment in this series was used as a bail-out treatment, a strategy that could be unforgiving in an already hemodynamically unstable patient, such as ours. An out-front covered stent approach will likely mitigate potential risk of anastomosis rupture, a strategy that has not been previously reported. Given the technical challenges of delivering a covered stent through a tortuous LIMA, the newer generation PK Papyrus stent, which is what we used, would be more ideal.\n\n【15】To our knowledge, we report the first case of a PK Papyrus direct covered stent implantation as a primary stent strategy in acute IMA graft anastomosis failure. Limitations of this strategy include lack of prior data and some reports of a higher incidence of periprocedural MI. RECOVERS trial data show an almost a three-fold higher incidence of subacute MI among patients undergoing saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) PCI with a covered stent as compared to standard bare metal stent, which may be due to subacute stent thrombosis \\[ 8 \\]. Until recently, the Jostent Graftmaster covered stent (Abbott Cardiovascular, Abbott Park, IL) was the only commercially available covered stent approved for bail-out treatment of free perforations of native coronary arteries or SVGs (≥ 2.75 mm in diameter). However, its inflexible sandwich-stent design and high crossing profile negatively impact deliverability and procedural success \\[ 9 \\]. In comparison, the newer generation PK papyrus covered stent, membrane covered single stent design, has a slimmer crossing profile and easier maneuverability. In this regard, we believe that direct stenting with the PK Papyrus covered stent ensures technical success, and is a more appropriate technique for acute graft anastomosis failure, which can significantly reduce life-threatening complications like perforation or graft avulsion. To our knowledge no data exist regarding PK Papyrus stent longevity implanted within an arterial graft or across a graft-to-native vessel anastomosis. Although we achieved an angiographically excellent result, due to lack of experience of this stent platform in this clinical scenario, we plan to perform a selective angiography in the near future to assess anastomosis patency, irrespective of evidence of ischemia.\n\n【16】**Conclusions**\n\n【17】Balloon angioplasty, with or without stent deployment, at the anastomosis of a newly placed IMA graft may increase the risk of vessel perforation or anastomosis avulsion. Direct new generation covered stenting is a viable option particularly in hemodynamically unstable, inoperable patients. To our knowledge, this is the first case to describe upfront stenting of a LIMA to LAD anastomosis with a PK Papyrus covered stent. More data and collective clinical experience are needed to establish best revascularization strategy in such high risk patients.\n\n【18】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【19】None to declare.\n\n【20】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【21】None to declare.\n\n【22】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【23】The authors report no conflict of interest.\n\n【24】**Informed Consent**\n\n【25】Informed consent was obtained.\n\n【26】**Author Contributions**\n\n【27】HT reviewed the literature and wrote the manuscript.

Associated clinical signs and symptoms of the condition include intrauterine growth restriction, severe psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, characteristic facial features, profound developmental delays, seizures and various congenital midline fusion anomalies \\[ 1-6 \\]. The latter may include cleft lip or palate, congenital heart disease (atrial or ventricular septal defects), hypospadias and midline scalp defects \\[ 1-6 \\]. Given the associated congenital anomalies, anesthetic care is often required for various surgical interventions. We report a 3-month-old girl with WH syndrome scheduled for gastrostomy tube placement. Previous reports of anesthetic care for such patients are reviewed and potential perioperative concerns are discussed.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required by Nationwide Children’s Hospital for presentation of single case reports. A 3-month-old, 3 kg girl presented for gastrostomy tube placement. The patient was diagnosed with WH syndrome based on intrauterine ultrasound reports and subsequent genetic testing. Chromosomal microarray showed results consistent with the diagnosis of WH syndrome. On physical examination, the child was noted to be small for her age, quiet, and hypotonic. Dysmorphic features included wide-spaced eyes, microcephaly, microstomia, a prominent glabella, low set ears, and micrognathia. Her preoperative vital signs included a resting respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, an oxygen saturation of 99% by pulse oximetry while receiving 0.5 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula, a heart rate of 134 beats/min, and a blood pressure (BP) of 83/62 mm Hg. Preoperative echocardiography revealed an atrial septal defect. No sedative pre-medication was required. The patient had a pre-existing 24-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula in the right saphenous vein with maintenance IV fluids infusing. The patient was held _nil per os_ for 6 h and transported to the operating room where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced by the administration of IV ketamine (5 mg) and atropine (0.1 mg). Sevoflurane was administered and incrementally increased to 5%. A shoulder roll was placed beneath the patient, prior to anesthetic induction, to facilitate optimal alignment of airway structures. Because of the patient’s non-reassuring airway examination, spontaneous ventilation was maintained throughout induction and endotracheal intubation. Light cricoid pressure was applied, which brought the vocal cords into view (Cormack-Lehane score of I vs. IIa). Endotracheal intubation was easily achieved using a Miller 1 blade and a cuffed, styleted 3.0 endotracheal tube. The patient tolerated anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation without adverse hemodynamic effects. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for the case. The surgery lasted approximately 30 min. Mild hypotension occurred during the maintenance phase of anesthesia using sevoflurane (inspired concentration 2-3%), despite the administration of a 20 mL/kg fluid bolus of 0.9% NS. Therefore, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was decreased and neuromuscular blockade was provided by the administration of rocuronium 3 mg (1 mg/kg). Fentanyl (2.5 µg/kg) was also administered. The expired concentration of sevoflurane was decreased to 1.2% in a mixture of 50% air and 50% oxygen. After completion of the surgical procedure, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. The patient’s trachea was extubated in the operating room and she was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient was discharged from the PACU back to the neonatal ICU. The remainder of the postoperative course was uneventful. Tube feedings were started the next day based on the surgical team’s recommendations.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】Patients with known genetic syndromes pose a variety of challenges to the anesthesia provider \\[ 7 \\]. WH syndrome is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder caused by partial deletion (monosomy) of the short arm of chromosome 4. It was first described in 1961 by Hirschhorn and Cooper and subsequently published in Humangenetik by both Hirschhorn and Cooper as well as Wolf et al in 1965 \\[ 8-10 \\]. Current estimates place the prevalence at about 1:50,000 with a 2:1 female/male ratio.\n\n【9】WH syndrome is characterized by a spectrum of observable abnormalities, the most important of which for the anesthesia provider include congenital heart disease and facial structural abnormalities, which may lead to difficulties with airway management. Congenital heart disease includes primarily atrial and ventricular defects. Phenotypic features include ocular hypertolerism (wide-set eyes), low-set malformed ears, micrognathia (small, recessed mandible), microcephaly (small head), prominent glabella (a “Greek helmet” appearance), broad or beaked nose, cleft lip or palate, small down turned “fish like” mouth, hypotonia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with a subsequent failure to thrive. Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome is now grouped together with WH syndrome, since both are the result of deletions on the same portion of chromosome 4, although “Pitt” syndrome generally results in milder physical and congenital abnormalities \\[ 1 , 6 \\].\n\n【10】To date, there are a limited number of reports in the literature regarding the anesthetic care of patients with WH syndrome ( Table 1 ) \\[ 11-18 \\]. As with all anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Of primary concern to the anesthesia provider is the potential for difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation related to micrognathia, microstomia, and associate cleft lip/palate. The appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction, as recommended by Engelhardt and Weiss \\[ 19 \\]. General anesthesia can be induced by the incremental inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation until the airway is secured. In our patient, we administered a small dose of ketamine to induce anesthesia and maintain spontaneous ventilation followed by the administration of incremental concentrations of sevoflurane until adequate bag-valve-mask ventilation was demonstrated. Endotracheal intubation was accomplished without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Airway management may be further compromised by the risk of aspiration as noted in some of the case reports which have led some to use rapid sequence intubation (RSI). However, the use of RSI must be weighed against the risks of potential difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Previous Reports of Anesthetic Care in Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】While the early reports in the anesthesia literature suggested a correlation between the administration of inhaled anesthetics and the development of malignant hyperthermia (MH), more recent articles have questioned this association as there are several published reports showing that volatile agents have been used safely and without complications. Both of the patients in the two previous reports of potential MH-like symptoms had current upper respiratory infections and received high doses of atropine, muddying the picture as to whether or not it was MH, anticholinergic crisis, or active infection. When we questioned the MH hotline regarding a possible correlation between WH syndrome and the development of MH, we were told: “Although there is one report alleging an association, that has not been proven, nor do we consider that disorder a risk for MH.”\n\n【14】Given the associated hypotonia, another perioperative concerns is the choice of neuromuscular blocking (NMBA), especially with regard to the safety of using succinylcholine \\[ 20 \\]. Anecdotal reports have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of succinylcholine while other reports have failed to demonstrate significant perioperative issues such as prolonged duration of action following non-depolarizing agents including vecuronium, rocuronium, and cis-atracurium \\[ 21 \\]. Alternatively, endotracheal intubation can also be accomplished without the use of an NMBA using a combination of propofol and remifentanil or as noted in one case report, midazolam and remifentanil \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【15】Seizures may be a comorbid condition in patients with WH syndrome. Preoperative management strategies to limit the potential for perioperative seizures include optimizing and confirming therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to the surgical procedure. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s _nil per os_ status with subsequent intraoperative dosing as needed. Alternative routes of delivery (IV or rectal) may be required when enteral administration is not feasible. Consultation with the neurology or pharmacology service may be helpful to determine dosing conversion from enteral to IV administration or to guide intraoperative redosing.\n\n【16】In summary, WH syndrome is a rare chromosomal abnormality with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The potential perioperative implications of WH syndrome are summarized in Table 2 . While initial reports suggested a predisposition to the development of MH, subsequent reports have failed to confirm this association. Other comorbid conditions which may impact perioperative care include facial anomalies which lead to difficult airway management, associated congenital heart disease, central nervous system involvement including hypotonia and underlying seizure disorder, and the potential for chronic aspiration and perioperative respiratory problems.\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 2.** Anesthetic Concerns in Patients With Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood sample can be affected by many reasons, one being the presence of metabolically active cells like white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets leading to spurious or pseudo hypoxemia \\[ 3 \\]. We present a case of blast crisis due to acute myelogenous leukemia ((AML) presenting with spurious hypoxemia which improved after leukapheresis.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】An 85-year-old elderly female with past medical history of diabetes, hypertension and recent diagnosis of AML was admitted to our ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute respiratory failure. She received recent chemotherapy at outside hospital. Her chest X-ray was normal, thereby, ruling out pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism was high with acute hypoxemia in a cancer patient with unimpressive chest X-ray. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show any right heart strain pattern. On arrival, she was clinically in shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and had WBC count of 455,000/µL. Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) on admission after endotracheal intubation showed pH of 6.64, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 67 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 29 mm Hg on 100% FiO <sub>2 </sub> but pulse oximetry read SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100%. Her ICU course was complicated by septic shock, multi-system organ failure and refractory metabolic acidosis. Oncology service was consulted, and patient underwent emergent leukapheresis for blast crisis with improvement in WBC count to 140,000/µL. Her ABG improved to pH of 6.89, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 30 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 351 mm Hg with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100% on pulse oximetry. Her PO <sub>2 </sub> improved dramatically after leukapheresis and removal of WBC from the blood. Family soon opted for comfort care measures, and she developed asystolic cardiac arrest and died.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】Hypoxemia is a serious condition commonly seen in the ICU patients. Underlying physiologic derangements include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, hypoventilation, shunt and abnormality of diffusion capacity \\[ 1 \\]. ABG is a common test employed to diagnose hypoxemia. Hypoxemia can be true or spurious. Common clinical conditions leading to hypoxemia in ICU include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome and congestive heart failure. Pseudo hypoxemia or spurious hypoxemia is an entity where laboratory abnormalities of PaO <sub>2 </sub> are not a true reflection of patient’s bloodstream oxygen tension. Causes of inaccurate measurements of PaO <sub>2 </sub> include improper sampling, delay in transport with failure to cool the specimen, presence of bubbles in the sample, elevated cell count, blood gas analyzer malfunction or miscalibration or methemoglobinemia \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Spurious hypoxemia has been reported in patients with hyperleukocytosis or thrombocytosis in the setting of hematological malignancies \\[ 2 , 4 , 5 \\]. It was first described in 1979 by Fox et al and was coined leukocyte larceny \\[ 3 \\]. This is due to the presence of high number of metabolically active WBCs with elevated consumption of dissolved oxygen in the arterial blood samples \\[ 6 \\]. The rate of oxygen consumption by WBCs is typically not important clinically in majority of patients with normal blood counts. Spuriously low PaO <sub>2 </sub> measurements are common when WBC count exceeds 50,000/µL or with severe thrombocytosis. This entity is not very well described in the critical care literature with not many cases reported in ICU setting \\[ 1 , 2 \\]\n\n【9】Patients with hyperleukocytosis in the setting of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia or blast crisis can develop true or spurious hypoxemia. Causes of true hypoxemia in these patients include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary leukostasis, leukemic infiltration, hemorrhage and drug-related toxicities. Inconsistencies between SpO <sub>2 </sub> with pulse oximetry and PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood can help to differentiate spurious hypoxemia from these causes. In leukocyte larceny, SpO <sub>2 </sub> is normal and PaO <sub>2 </sub> is low. Cooling of blood sample on ice and rapid analysis can help reduce the discrepancy.\n\n【10】Pulse oximetry is the most accurate method to assess oxygenation in patients with hyperleukocytosis \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. It measures hemoglobin saturation directly and is unaffected by the plasma oxygen tension. Understanding the concept of spurious hypoxemia in patients with hematologic malignancies will help to prevent unnecessary tests like CT scans and ventilation/perfusion scans to rule out pulmonary embolism, minimizing ICU admission of these patients and saving hospital resources and costs.\n\n【11】Our patient did not undergo these expensive tests for the workup of pulmonary embolism as PaO <sub>2 </sub> improved after leukapheresis.\n\n【12】**Conclusion**\n\n【13】ICU physicians should be vigilant about the concept of pseudo/spurious hypoxemia and leukocyte larceny in patients with leukemias and blast crisis. Causes of true hypoxemia still need to be ruled out in the correct clinical setting. Pulse oximetry is the most reliable and easy method to clinically assess oxygenation in patients with leukocyte larceny.\n\n【14】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 31 kg in the right and 29 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, left-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was positive. Manual muscle testing on the left upper extremity demonstrated that pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, biceps brachii, triceps brachialis, and brachioradialis were at grade 4, while extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris at grade 5-. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. However, manual muscle testing on the right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities demonstrated no abnormalities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation, and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense), and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis, and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. Dysmetria, decomposition of movement, and intension tremor were not observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were slow on the left side. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the left side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. As a result, there was moderate weakness in the left upper extremity with proximal dominancy. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest roentgenogram findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized MMI on the right side ( Fig. 1 ). Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Seven days of intravenous argatroban therapy were performed. Thereafter, oral clopidogrel at 75 mg/day was initiated.

In 2011, based on the diffusion tensor tractography analysis, Kwon et al \\[ 4 \\] reported that the hand somatotopy of the corticospinal tract was located at the medial portion of the medullary pyramid; in contrast, the leg somatotopy occupied its lateral portion. However, in our patient, despite PMM in the upper extremity, a localized infarct lesion was detected in the lateral portion of the medial medulla oblongata. This neurological symptom was incompatible with the diffusion tensor tractography analysis which was reported by Kwon et al \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】There were only two reported cases of lateral medullary infarction with ipsilateral monoparesis of the leg \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In both cases, infarct lesion was observed in the most caudal region of lateral medulla oblongata. Regarding the etiology of leg weakness due to ipsilateral lateral medullary infarction, Liu et al \\[ 5 \\] and Tsuda et al \\[ 6 \\] speculated that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities might decussate at different levels, and that the decussation of the lower extremity might locate rostral to that of the upper extremity.

The patient denied travelling history, nor contact history of influenza, etc. A complete blood count showed WBC of 11.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, platelet of 655 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, and a chest film showed nodular opacities over right upper lung and infiltrate over right lower lung field ( Fig. 1A ). A chest CT showed right hilar and mediastinum lymph node enlarged with severe necrotic change ( Fig. 1B ) and multiple tiny splenic low attenuation lesions ( Fig. 1C ), more in favor of tumor progression after chemotherapy. However, high fever with chill developed rapidly, a follow-up complete blood count showed leukocytosis with WBC of 17.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ and platelet of 282 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μ, C-reactive protein showed 202 mg/L, the patient developed progressive worsening dyspnea shortly after admission, while an arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxemia with respiratory acidosis, he then received endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, and transferred to ICU for further intensive care. A series of CXR ( Fig. 2 ) showed progressive change from right upper lung nodular density ( Fig. 2A ) to right upper lobe consolidation and right lower lobe infiltrate ( Fig. 2B ) and then rapidly deteriorated to bilateral diffuse infiltrate with ARDS pattern ( Fig. 2C ). Unexpectedly, the blood culture indicated the presence of a strain of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ that was susceptible to ceftazidime, imipenem, and minocycline. He received intravenous ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h for 2 weeks, his general condition improved with successful extubated on the eighth ICU day and was transferred to general ward the next day. Then he received antibiotics treatment with ceftazidime 2 g q8h and minocycline 100 mg q12h for additional 3 weeks. His condition improved and the follow-up blood culture showed no growth, while follow-up CXR revealed substantial improvement of the consolidation, and he then was discharged with stable condition. He was keep on oral antibiotic with a combination of doxycycline 100 mg twice a day, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 80 mg/400 mg two tablets twice a day along with target therapy with gefitinib 250 mg qd for his lung adenocarcinoma. The patient condition improved and he completed the antibiotics treatment 20 weeks after discharge, with a smooth and stable disease condition.\n\n|  _**Figure 1.** CXR at presentation showing nodular opacities over right upper lung with infiltrate over right lower lung (A), chest CT at presentation showing right hilar and mediastinum lymph node enlarged with severe necrotic change (B) and multiple tiny splenic low attenuation lesions (C)._ |\n| --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n|  _**Figure 2.** Series of CXR showed progressive change from right upper lobe nodular density (A) to right upper lobe consolidation and right lower lobe infiltrate (B) and then rapidly deteriorated to bilateral diffuse infiltrate with ARDS pattern (C)._ |\n| --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Lung infections can be severe consequences of chemotherapy-induced immune defects. Most of the cases are related to neutropenic condition. During the past decades, the attention in management of infections in cancer patients has focused on fever and neutropenia \\[ 6-8 \\]. However, latest guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend that immunocompromised non-neutropenic cancer patients should receive equal attention as those with neutropenia \\[ 9 \\]. Cytotoxic drugs used for the treatment of lung cancer can affect chemotactic and phagocytic function, without reflecting on the total cell count. The functional capabilities of phagocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells may be intrinsically defective even before the initiation of chemotherapy \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【12】Severe septicemic melioidosis pneumonia with respiratory failure following administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma patient is very rare; to our knowledge, this is the first case in English literature. Patients with septicemic melioidosis pneumonia can present severely unwell with fever and prostration, sometimes with few clinical features to suggest a focus of infection but with chest radiography revealing abnormalities consistent with bacteremic pneumonia, typically multiple nodular opacities or multiple patches of alveolar infiltration \\[ 3-5 \\]. These cases often progress rapidly with coalescence of lesions, development of new lesions, and cavitation. Clinical progression of acute melioidosis pneumonia is often rapid, and septic shock and death are common outcomes \\[ 3-5 \\]. Acute pneumonia with upper lobe consolidation in endemic regions warrants consideration of melioidosis.\n\n【13】Previous study demonstrated that acute septicemic melioidosis has an upper lobe predominancy in endemic regions, and may be initially misdiagnosed as having tuberculosis \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The initial clinical presentations of pulmonary melioidosis can mimic tuberculosis, which exhibits fever, dyspnea, a loss of body weight, and fatigue \\[ 10 \\]. It might be difficult to distinguish one from the other, unless microbiological information is confirmed \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Previous study demonstrated that multisystemic involvement, particularly multiple splenic abscesses, provides an important clue for melioidosis \\[ 12 \\]. However, if the lesion coexists with lung tumor, as in our case, it represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the course of chemotherapy following diagnosis of lung cancer. In image study of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma under stable disease after chemotherapy, it might be mistakenly diagnosed as progressive disease with multiple spleen metastasis, or hilar lymph node metastasis especially when the melioidosis pneumonia developed initially. It is possible that the _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection in our patient was community-acquired, and it is likely that the environment may play a role in _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection in cancer patients, even those receiving less toxic chemotherapy. In some endemic area, melioidosis pneumonia should be considered in differential diagnosis of severe pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy. This is a very important lesson in the care and management of patients on chemotherapy. The subtle and complicated nature of the course of this patient merits our emphasis on unusual presentation of severe pneumonia in newly diagnosed lung cancer patient. Physicians should be cautious to differentiate progressive disease or superimposed infection with an unusual presentation of severe community-acquired pneumonia in chemotherapy-treated patients.\n\n【14】**Declaration of Interest**\n\n【15】We declare no conflict of interest.

Approximately 80-90% of HCCs arise from chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis that develops after HBV or HCV infections; however, a growing number of HCCs have recently developed from non-B-non-C hepatitis. Another cause of hepatitis and liver cirrhosis is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is related to lifestyle diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and obesity. NASH has the potential of developing HCC. Till date, HCC was believed to arise from the background of cirrhosis liver and uncommonly in a liver not damaged by cirrhosis. Here we report the case of a patient with HCC that developed from non-cirrhotic NASH.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 76-year-old male presented to our hospital with a complaint of abdominal distention. His past medical history included impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that were treated using anti-hypertensive drugs. He denied any use of tobacco and alcohol. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass of 5 cm in S5 of the liver. He was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of this liver mass.\n\n【6】Upon arrival, his blood pressure was 168/76 mm Hg, heart rate was 87 beats/min with regular rhythm, blood oxygen saturation was 96% under atmospheric conditions, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. On initial clinical examination, his weight was 70.7 kg, height was 170.0 cm, and body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . There was no evidence of anemia upon inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva. Chest auscultation revealed no signs of abnormal heart murmurs and no rales or other respiratory sounds. The abdomen was slightly distended, with no tenderness in the upper abdomen, and normal peristalsis was evident. Further, there was no palpable mass or any signs of peritoneal irritation.\n\n【7】Laboratory analysis results, including complete blood counts, biochemistry, and blood coagulation values were all within normal limits. In addition, tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, revealed values within normal limits. Virus markers were negative for HBs-Ag, HBV-DNA, HCV-Ab, and HCV-RNA.\n\n【8】Ultrasonography revealed a lobular mass in S5 of the liver with a marginal low echo that measured 50 × 40 mm ( Fig. 1a ). Contrast-enhanced CT also revealed a mass in S5 of the liver that measured 48 × 45 × 45 mm, with marked enhancement in the early phase ( Fig. 1b ). In the late phase, contrast agents in the interiors of the mass were washed out with the residues of the contrast agent at the margin of the tumor ( Fig. 1c ). Based on the imaging modalities, the patient was diagnosed with HCC. As a result, he was chosen as a candidate for surgical resection. Subsegmentectomy of S5 and S6 was performed under general anesthesia. Gross examination of the specimen revealed a white-yellowish soft tumor with multiple nodules ( Fig. 1d ). Microscopic histological findings of the tumor indicated moderately differentiated HCC (low power fields, Fig. 2a ; high power fields, Fig. 2b ). In addition, macrovesicular lipid depositions and mild steatosis without fibrosis were observed in the background liver, which were compatible with A2F1 (low power fields, Fig. 2c ; high power fields, Fig. 2d ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) Ultrasonography revealed a lobular mass in S5 of the liver with a marginal low echo, measuring 50 × 40 mm.

NASH is considered to be another potential cause of hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and also deemed to be an underlying non-B-non-C HCC disease. Past research has demonstrated strong associations between NASH and lifestyle diseases. Increase in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been found to have a positive correlation with liver fibrosis, suggesting that the level of HbA1c affects the progression of NASH \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【16】Liver damage that is not associated with a history of alcoholic use, which shares similar histological findings to alcohol-associated liver disease, was discovered in 1980; thus, the concept of NASH was first established \\[ 2 \\]. Subsequently, the relationship of NASH with metabolic syndromes, including obesity, DM, and hypertension, was observed \\[ 3 \\]. Although it was considered uncommon for non-cirrhosis NASH to develop into HCC, there has been an increasing number of cases of HCC developed from NASH. Recently, it was reported that oxidative DNA damage may, in part, be a carcinogen \\[ 4 \\]. Furthermore, patients with metabolic syndrome suffering from obesity, DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia tend to demonstrate increased oxidative stress \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【17】A recent pathological study regarding NASH complicated by HCC demonstrated that 64% of HCCs arose from non-cirrhotic liver \\[ 6 \\]. This finding may suggest that fatty liver has a high potential for developing HCC. Recently, the concept of “immunometabolism” has gained momentum as a potential pathway to the development of HCC, stemming from complicated changes in the immunosystem or metabolic malfunction. Hence, immunometabolism is considered an important factor in the development of HCC from non-cirrhotic liver.\n\n【18】In the current study, closer examination of virus markers in the patient showed a positive indicator for HBs-Ab and negative indicator for HBc-Ab, HBe-Ag, and HBe-Ab. Although it is unclear if the present patient had a history of HBV vaccination, it is possible that he contracted HBV without being aware of it, indicating that acute HBV-related hepatitis might remit before knowing. Immunostaining of background liver tissues by HBs-Ag and HBc-Ag revealed negative and false-positive results, respectively ( Fig. 2e, f ). Based on this result, it seems likely that HBV viruses undetectable by serologic tests are involved in liver tissues. Upon further examination of liver fibrosis in this patient, the serum hyaluronic acid and serum collagen type IV levels were within normal limits; this result suggests no evidence of liver fibrosis in this patient. According to studies of asymptomatic HBV carriers, chronic HBV hepatitis, and HBV cirrhosis, it is known that negative seroconversion rates of HBV infections are 1-2%/year \\[ 7 \\]. Despite the amelioration of liver tissues in patients with HBV remission after the seroclearance of HBs-Ag, serum HBV-DNA and the normalization of serum ALT levels, it is possible for HCC to occur \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. It is recognized that HBV-DNA in liver tissues may work as a carcinogen, even if serum HBV-DNA is not detected. Recently, the concept of occult HBV has received attention after the revelation of fulminant HBV hepatitis developed during immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy \\[ 10 \\]. Occult HBV is defined as absence of HBs-Ag and presence of HBc-Ab and/or HBs-Ab; it carries a risk of reactivation of HBV hepatitis \\[ 11 \\]. In our patient, it was challenging to differentiate whether HCC stemmed from NASH or from occult HBV; nonetheless, it is suggested that patients with positive HBc-Ab and/or positive HBs-Ab, or positive HBs-Ab and/or positive HBc-Ab should receive regular follow-ups with serological viral marker testing and imaging modalities. Moreover, it should be noted that patients with metabolic syndrome should be meticulously observed by ultrasonography despite results of hepatitis virus markers.\n\n【19】A randomized control trial demonstrated that weight loss by diet and exercise is effective for the amelioration of liver steatosis \\[ 12 \\]. Likewise, in our patient, weight management and control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels is important for ameliorating NASH and preventing HCC recurrence.\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】There is a growing concern about NASH as a contributing factor in the development of non-viral hepatitis or cirrhosis. NASH should be carefully observed because it carries a potential risk of developing HCC regardless of history of non-cirrhotic liver. Moreover, whenever encountering HCC with negative indicators for serum HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab, it is important to examine serum HBc-Ab and HBs-Ab to determine the presence of occult HBV. Our findings suggest that clinicians should increase awareness of these growing concepts of NASH and occult HBV.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) metastases can appear in almost any organ. It is difficult to distinguish renal metastases from primary renal cell carcinoma without histopathology, although this is an important distinction. Renal metastases from SCLC are uncommon, even though kidney metastases from lung primaries are frequently found postmortem \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【3】Here, we describe a case of SCLC disseminating to the kidney, liver, bone and brain along with urothelial carcinoma that was diagnosed antemortem.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 71-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of worsening dysuria and hematuria. He was a bus driver and a heavy smoker (60-pack-year). An enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 2.6 cm irregular and ill-defined heterogeneous contrast-enhanced lesion in the right upper pole ( Fig. 1 ). We suspected renal cell carcinoma, so the patient underwent right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy ( Fig. 2 ). Pathologic examination after surgery revealed SmCC. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD56, synaptophysin, chromogranin and TTF-1, and negative for Ki67 and P53 ( Fig. 3 ). Although the operation was performed successfully, his hematuria continued. Flexible cystoscopy demonstrated a bladder mass. A transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was undertaken, and histology was consistent with invasive, high-grade urothelial carcinoma ( Fig. 3 ). The patient was evaluated with a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F18 FDG), which showed significant uptake within the central left upper lobe, left hilar and left lower paratracheal lymph nodes, the aortopulmonary (AP) window, the right hepatic lobe, the C7 vertebral body and the right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal wall ( Fig. 4 ). Therefore, we performed an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) of the left paratracheal lymph node and subcarinal lymph node. This procedure confirmed the diagnosis of SCLC, and we observed the same positive tumor biomarkers as seen in the surgical kidney samples. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple enhancing nodular metastatic lesions. The final diagnosis was SCLC metastasizing to the contralateral kidney, liver, lymph nodes, bone and brain along with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Our patient will receive six courses of combination chemotherapy using 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> etoposide and 60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> cisplatin.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** An abdominal computed tomography scan reveals the right renal mass.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few cases of these concurrent tumors reported in the literature.\n\n【17】SCLC comprises 20-25% of all lung cancers and is characterized by a swift clinical course and metastasis \\[ 3 \\]. Tumor dissemination is a process that includes shedding, penetration, migration and proliferation of the primary tumor lesion. The anatomic structure of the primary tumor, the inherent anatomical structure of the target lesion and other elements can affect tumor production of metastases in the target organs \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【18】The patient is a heavy smoker and a CT scan showed a 3 cm sized small, solid, enhancing renal mass with perinephric fat involvement. Such lesions are usually suspected to be renal cell carcinoma, although the management of small renal masses is controversial \\[ 5 \\]. Through a surgical operation, we confirmed that the diagnosis was SmCC from the lung. SmCCs are mostly found in the lungs, but may occur in a wide variety of organs \\[ 1 \\]. Renal SmCC is more uncommon than SCLC, which should always be considered when examining renal SmCC. An abdominal CT scan is a useful tool to screen for renal tumors. However, on CT scan, renal metastases resemble renal cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, renal abscesses and renal sarcoma. CT images of renal metastases were characterized as small, multiple, bilateral, wedge-shaped, less exophytic, and located within the renal capsule \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【19】Our patient’s hematuria persisted despite laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Patients with renal metastases usually complain of hematuria, like those with renal cell and urothelial carcinomas. It is hard to distinguish between them based upon clinical signs alone. We considered other diseases and found urothelial cell carcinoma in the bladder. Renal SmCC shares comparable morphological and immunohistological features with SmCC of other organs, and renal SmCCs often accompany urothelial carcinomas, suggesting a potential association between SmCC and urothelial carcinoma in the kidney \\[ 7 \\]. An immunohistochemical examination was performed in all samples. Our patient’s specimens of kidney and lung were strongly positive for CD56, synaptophysin and TTF-1, and weakly positive for chromogranin. Although there is no lung specific tumor marker, with the help of a relatively restricted marker, TTF-1, it is possible to separate a lung primary from a metastasis with a reasonable degree of certainty \\[ 8 \\]. Some extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas were positive for TTF-1, but other extrapulmonary neuroendocrine tumors were not positive for TTF-1. Although small cell carcinomas in the bladder (2/4), uterine cervix (1/7) and prostate (4/4) were positive for TTF-1, renal small cell carcinoma was negative (0/1) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【20】Hematuria is a common symptom, and we considered all possibilities during the differential diagnosis. Kidney metastasis from lung cancer is rare, and is found in conjunction with bladder cancer even more rarely. In this case, the renal and bladder lesions were detected retrospectively. To prevent unnecessary surgery in such cases, fine needle biopsies should be performed.\n\n【21】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【22】None to declare.\n\n【23】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【24】None to declare.\n\n【25】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【26】None to declare.\n\n【27】**Informed Consent**\n\n【28】Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【29】**Author Contributions**\n\n【30】Two authors contributed to the writing and correction of this manuscript as well as being involved in the patient treatment.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is defined as an inflammation of bone and bone marrow caused by pyogenic bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi \\[ 2 \\]. If untreated, osteomyelitis may lead to formation of _sequestra_ , i.e. pockets of dead cortical bone with abscess formation, and _involucrum_ , new bone incorporating the sequestrum \\[ 3 \\- 6 \\]. When the new bone is totally surrounding the sequester, the involucrum is called ‘Totenlade’ (coffin) in German. This involucrum may or may not be adequate in supporting the limb structurally once the sequester is removed \\[ 7 \\]. Sequestrum formation may result in large bone defects which may be overcome by involucrum formation, but these late results of chronic osteomyelitis are seldomly encountered in the industrialized world \\[ 5 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【3】We present a case of an adult and healthy young man from The Netherlands who developed chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis of his fibula. Because of ongoing disease unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement was performed and finally a sequester of the fibula, completely incorporated by an involucrum, was found. The patient was informed that data concerning his case would be submitted for publication and he consented.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】In June 2010, a 22-year-old man with no relevant medical history, presented at the emergency department of a non-academic, teaching hospital. He experienced pain in his right calf since one week. There was no history of preceding trauma or surgery. History taken from the patient revealed that he returned from a holiday to New-Zealand, the Fiji-islands, and Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago. There he suffered from small pustules on his left arm and right foot which recovered spontaneously. At physical examination done at first presentation, the patient had a temperature of 101 °F (38.2 °C), a blood pressure of 144/87 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 96 bpm.The lungs were clear and heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was not tender and the liver and spleen were not enlarged. A warm, tensed and tender right calf was seen which was painful during active and passive extension of the foot. Extremity pulses were normal.\n\n【7】Laboratory testing was suggestive of infection with a leukocyte count of 20.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> / L (normal: 3.4 - 10.0 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and a C-reactive protein level of 100 mg/L (normal, 0 -10 mg/L). Ultrasonography was performed to exclude deep venous thrombosis. No thrombus was seen; however, diffuse swelling of the muscles was found. A supplementary radiograph of his right lower leg showed no abnormalities ( Fig. 1 ). The swelling of the muscles was explained as reactive to severe physical activities he had undertaken the past few days and he was discharged with oral pain medication.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** X-ray of the fibula of our patient at initial presentation without signs of osteomyelitis._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】At day seven after the initial onset of symptoms, he presented to the same hospital with aggravation of his complaints. The existence of a compartment syndrome was clinically suspected and a four compartment fasciotomy of the right lower leg was performed. When releasing the fascia of the deep posterior compartment, a large amount of pus was discharged. Culture of the pus revealed a Staphylococcus Aureus. The patient was treated with Flucloxacilline for two weeks (one week intravenous, one week oral). The fasciotomy wound was closed with a split skin graft after three weeks and the patient was discharged.\n\n【11】Six weeks after the initial presentation, the patient was admitted again. He had a small pustule on his right calf and redness of the skin surrounding the fasciotomy scar. No pain or fever was present. Both plain radiographic imaging ( Fig.2 ) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were suspicious of osteomyelitis of the fibula.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** X-ray of the fibula 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms showing periostal reaction and partial lysis and interruption of the fibula._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】The patient was referred to our institution where a subsequent computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis osteomyelitis with destruction of the fibula and excessive periostal reaction with new bone formation ( Fig. 3 ).

A new MRI of the right fibula revealed severe marrow abnormalities with extreme periostal reaction in addition to extensive soft-tissue abnormalities with intramuscular abscess formation ( Fig. 4 ). Based on the MRI findings and given the lack of clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement, surgical debridement of the fibula diaphysis was performed. A large abscess was found in the deep posterior compartment and material was collected for bacterial cultures. The lateral and anterior part of the fibula was found to be necrotic and a large sequester, incorporated by an involucrum was seen ( Figs. 5 , 6 ). After debridement and sequestrectomy the patient was treated with bed rest with his right limb elevated. Gentamicine beads were left in the wound and since cultures of the bone revealed Staphylococcus Aureus sensitive for Flucloxacilline, he was once more treated with intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks. The Gentamicine beads were replaced after 2 and 4 weeks and removed after 6 weeks, following a negative culture. At the most recent follow-up visit, 5 months after hospital discharge, an excellent recovery was seen. X-rays showed bone formation at the site of the former sequestrum and the function of the leg was unrestricted.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** MRI image of our patient with extreme periostal reaction and extensive soft-tissue abnormalities with intramuscular abscess formation._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【19】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Sequestrum incorporated by an involucrum of the fibula._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 6.** Removed sequestrum of the fibula._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】* * *\n\n【25】Waldvogel in 1970 was the first who described an osteomyelitis staging system \\[ 3 \\].

Distant foci of infection may lead to bacteraemia without clinical signs of sepsis. For patients with Staphylococcal osteomyelitis it is common to have a cutaneous infection such as pustules or furuncles in their medical history, as was the case in our patient \\[ 10 \\]. The clinical pattern may evolve over months or even years and is characterized by a low-grade inflammation \\[ 9 \\]. The development of necrotic bone and chronic osteomyelitis occurs roughly after ten days \\[ 11 \\] which explains the initial plain radiograph without abnormalities in the presented case.\n\n【26】Changes in plain radiographs can include soft-tissue swelling, osteopenia, scalloping of the cortex and periostal reaction \\[ 6 , 9 \\]. CT scanning can be helpful in the identification of sequestra while MRI is more useful for soft-tissue assessment and revealing early bony oedema \\[ 9 \\]. Both changes were seen in the presented case, however, only four months after the initial onset of symptoms.\n\n【27】Based on the CT-scan which did not show any sequestra, it was decided to treat this patient with intravenous antibiotics. This is in line with treatment guidelines based on the Cierny-Mader classification of osteomyelitis stage 1 ( Table 1 ) \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Cierny-Mader Classification System of Adult Osteomyelitis \\[ 12 \\]_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【29】A useful algorithm of these treatment guidelines was presented in a ‘current concepts review’ by Lazzarini in 2004 \\[ 13 \\]. However, a large sequester of the diaphysis of the fibula was found during the operation that was performed after four months delay. This discrepancy between the radiological imaging and what was found during the operation has, as far as the authors know, not been described before. The delay in diagnosis in the presented case was partly due to its indistinct presentation. Delay in diagnosis due to nonspecific symptoms was also described in hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis and is reported to be two to four months \\[ 14 \\], which is comparable with the delay described in our case. However, once referred to our institution the false-negative result of the CT directed us towards a conservative treatment while surgical debridement was in fact indicated.\n\n【30】Surgical management of osteomyelitis consists of two basic steps; debridement and obliteration of the subsequent dead space by soft tissue \\[ 15 \\]. All sequestra must be removed and resection of scarred and infected bone and soft tissue is indicated \\[ 16 \\]. Periostal stripping should be avoided because it may result in avascularity and the involucrum surrounding the infection can be left in place \\[ 6 \\]. Debridement of the bone is performed until the ‘paprika sign’ is seen; a pin-point bleeding noted on the viable bone \\[ 12 \\]. The dead space created following debridement may be replaced with viable vascularized tissue such as local muscle and skin flaps, or bone transport to fill large bone defects \\[ 9 \\]. In the presented case, we decided to perform debridement with removal of the necrotic diaphysis of the fibula. Following debridement Gentamicine beads were changed until the the cultures showed no bacteria. No soft tissue was necessary to cover the dead space.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】The lesson learned from this patient is that due to involucrum formation a CT scan can be false-negative regarding sequesters. We believe it is important to be cautious for this uncommon complication of osteomyelitis, even when radiologic imaging is suggesting otherwise. In case of progressive symptoms in a conservatively treated patient with osteomyelitis, surgical debridement is advised.\n\n【33】**Grant**\n\n【34】There were no sources of funding for this research.\n\n【35】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【36】The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【37】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although it may be presented late in women due to menstrual blood loss, men usually present with it earlier in the third or fourth decade of life with symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia. This is a case of a young patient presenting with heart failure symptoms with incidental elevated iron level in the body in the absence of common risk factors of heart disease.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】We present a case of a previously healthy 32-year-old Hispanic man who presented with newly onset shortness of breath, orthopnea, intermittent palpitation and bilateral leg swelling and unintentional 10 pounds weight gain during the last month. He reported that his shortness of breath is progressive and he could not walk more than one block recently. He denied any recent chest pain, dizziness, syncope, fever, night sweats, recent hospitalization or travel history. The patient was recently diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was also told that he has abnormal liver functions when he received abdominal ultrasound for other reasons although he denied any history of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.\n\n【6】Upon hospital admission, blood pressure (BP) was 96/68, pulse rate 103, respiratory rate 18, and oral temperature 97.6 °F (36.4 °C) with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 97% and body mass index (BMI) of 25.50 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【7】On examination jugular venous distention was noticed with heart examination showing irregular heartbeats, normal S1 and S2, without murmurs or rub. Bilateral lungs crackles in the mid and lower lungs were heard in addition to bilateral leg pitting edema. He had normal hemoglobin level, mild elevated liver function test (LFT), and elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1,517. Iron panel showed a high iron level of 255 and low unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) of < 55, and transferrin of 214 with elevated ferritin of 7,049. Common hemochromatosis gene mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) were negative.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray showed pulmonary congestions with bilateral pleural effusions. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed new onset atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with transthoracic echocardiogram showing mild left ventricular hypertrophy with newly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (30-35%) in addition to diastolic dysfunction. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hepatic hemochromatosis with secondary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The patient was diagnosed with acutely decompensated heart failure secondary to hemochromatosis that was confirmed with cardiac MRI. Our patient was treated for heart failure and A-fib and started on weekly phlebotomy. His condition was improved significantly afterward.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】The cornerstone of diagnosis of hemochromatosis relies on molecular diagnosis. The genetic heterogeneity of hemochromatosis is mediated by hepcidin-ferroportin interaction. Most cases of adult-onset hemochromatosis arise from single point mutation at position 282 (C282Y) of the hydration free energy (HFE) protein that results in the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine. It accounts for about 80% of hemochromatosis and is particularly common in northern Europe. It is also most common in whites, but extremely rare in nonwhites.\n\n【12】The second common mutation is characterized by the replacement of histidine by aspartic acid at position 63 of the protein (H63D). Its contribution to the clinical disease is minimal, except in compound heterozygosity with C282Y. Although other mutations were discovered, they are much less common as those below. Our patient, however, presented with C282Y and H63D negative mutations. Table 1 shows the most common etiology of iron overload in hemochromatosis \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n| Click to view | _**Table 1.** Primary Hereditary Hemochromatosis due to Increased Gastrointestinal (GI) Absorption of Normal Diet_ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】Secondary hemochromatosis includes that secondary to iron-loading anemia (transfusion-related), such as in thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, sideroblastic anemia, diamond blackfan anemia, congenital dyserythropoesis anemia, chronic renal disease, end-stage renal disease, dialysis and post-stem cell transplant patients, and that secondary to dietary overload (African iron overload), due to increased diet with genetic predisposition.\n\n【15】The miscellaneous type includes fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, hepatitis B and C, alcoholic liver disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and aceruloplasminemia.\n\n【16】Pathologic iron deposition begins initially within the epicardium and extends towards the myocardium and then endocardium, which helps explain the preservation of heart systolic function until very late in the disease \\[ 3 \\]. Myocardial cell damage in hemochromatosis is mediated by production of reactive free radicals especially hydroxyl ions \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【17】The initial symptoms are quite variable ranging from totally asymptomatic early in the disease to terminal irreversible heart failure symptoms in severely iron overloaded patients.\n\n【18】Patients often presented with exertional shortness of breath (as in our patient) as a result of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction secondary to restrictive pathophysiology. As the condition progresses to a dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic failure can happen and more symptoms develop \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【19】Iron deposition in the conduction system can cause different arrhythmias with paroxysmal A-fib being the most common arrhythmia seen in iron-induced cardiomyopathy \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【20】As the extent of iron deposition increases in atrium, supraventricular arrhythmias and first-degree atrioventricular blocks may happen, which correlates with the extent of disease \\[ 7 \\]. Left ventricular dilatation with systolic dysfunction predisposes to more frequent ventricular arrhythmias. As severe cardiac impairment happens, average survival is usually less than 1 year \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【21】Hemochromatosis should be suspected due to positive family history, abnormal hepatic enzymes, endocrinopathies, or other organ involvement which are followed by measurements of ferritin level and transferrin saturation. A transferrin saturation of greater than 55% and a serum ferritin concentration of greater than 300 µg/L in men and greater than 200 µg/L in women make the diagnosis of hemochromatosis after exclusion of secondary causes of iron overload. Diagnosis of hemochromatosis nowadays relies on genetic testing. Testing for HFE and H63D mutations should be performed once iron overload conformed to differentiating hereditary hemochromatosis from hemosiderosis. Those patients who test positive for C282Y homozygote and the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote are considered at highest risk for the disease.\n\n【22】As iron overload proceeds, echocardiography may reveal ventricular diastolic dysfunction with cardiac dilatation and progressive evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy from myocardial damage \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【23】Iron deposition in the heart tends to be patchy; therefore biopsies may miss the areas of deposition and provide a false negative result. Quantitation of liver iron can be obtained by measuring liver iron concentration (LIC) in the liver, which can be noninvasively measured using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), a very sensitive technique, but its use is limited by the very small number of available machines \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【24】Alternatively, MRI is the only presently available noninvasive method with the potential to assess quantitatively myocardial iron load. It provides an accurate reproducible measure of left ventricular systolic EF that can be followed over the course of therapy. Non-iron overloaded hearts tend to be homogenous and relaxation time lasts for a longer duration. Hearts with iron overload, however, produce changes in MR signal intensity, which shortens the relaxation time and darkens the image more quickly. T2\\* method which stands for time constant decay of gradient echo in milliseconds is highly sensitive and specific for quantitation of myocardial iron deposition. As myocardial iron deposition increases, the relaxation time will be shortened. Thus, T2\\* will be shorter, and progressive decline in left ventricular EF will be noticed \\[ 11 \\]. Cardiac T2\\* value is useful in providing guidance through the course of treatment and assessing the time interval for monitoring of cardiac function \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【25】Management of hemochromatosis is mandatory especially in symptomatic patients once iron level increases significantly to protect the heart and prevent liver fibrosis. Phlebotomy remains the most effective treatment that prevents organ damage and increases survival if started early during disease. The recommended protocol is to remove (one or two) 400- to 500-mL units of blood (approximately 200-250 mg iron in each unit) weekly, until serum ferritin level is less than 50 ng/mL and transferrin saturation less than 30% thereafter by periodic removal of blood.\n\n【26】Once iron depletion is reached, lifelong therapy with three to four phlebotomies per year maintains the iron store at an adequately low level. Improvements in cardiac function in hemochromatosis patients with cardiomyopathy and refractory arrhythmias have been noted with aggressive iron removal with phlebotomy, especially when started early in the disease process. Gonadal dysfunction and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus require lifelong hormonal replacement therapy.\n\n【27】At present, the only therapy alternative to phlebotomy for patients with anemia or severe cardiac disease is iron chelation to detoxify body organs. Patients can be managed with chelators like deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone with protocols that are similar to those established for secondary iron overload. Serum ferritin and urinary iron excretion are used to monitor the treatment efficacy. Erythropoietin has been used in selected patients to increase hemoglobin levels and to allow concomitant phlebotomy.\n\n【28】**Conclusions**\n\n【29】The goal of this case report is to consider the possibility of cardiac hemochromatosis in any patient with unexplained heart failure with elevated serum iron especially in the absence of significant risk factors. Cardiac hemochromatosis is a potentially lethal but preventable disease. Imaging using MRI in addition to genetic testing has replaced liver biopsy which is restricted to patients who do not have an informative genotype or is used for prognostic evaluation in cases of severe iron loading. Frequent iron studies in addition to phlebotomy form the cornerstone for disease management. This case shows a rare and interesting young patient who was tested negative for the common mutations. However, diagnosis of hemochromatosis was established based on clinical, biochemical and imaging studies. This was confirmed by significant improvement in patient’s symptoms as well as his cardiac function with the most recent left ventricular EF being 54% after phlebotomy was initiated.\n\n【30】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【31】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n【32】**Financial Support**\n\n【33】No financial support or grants have been provided.\n\n【34】**Author Contributions**\n\n【35】Co-authors helped write or edit the manuscript.

Much progress has been made since: most patients \\[ 1 \\] meeting the criteria for CHARGE have a mutation in the CHD7 gene on chromosome 8 though the genotype-phenotype predictions remain imprecise \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]. Congenital heart defects (CHD) are a common presenting feature of CHARGE \\[ 5 \\] and occur in 75-85% of cases \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is historically the most common CHD \\[ 5 \\- 8 \\]. Others include aortic arch (AA) anomalies, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular or atrial septal defects \\[ 2 , 5 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【3】We present a neonate with CHARGE syndrome who has a “window” PDA and a never described type of incomplete double AA (DAA): a dominant RAA with persistence of the proximal left dorsal aorta. To our knowledge, our patient’s combined cardiac findings have never been reported, let alone with CHARGE syndrome. There have been only 6 case reports of a window PDA \\[ 11 \\- 16 \\]: three were based on post-mortem autopsies, only one describes an association with a RAA and none report an association with CHARGE syndrome. We also present for the first time a “window” PDA imaged by three-dimensional (3D) MRI angiography. We describe the embryological underpinnings of the anomalies and outline key learning points.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A female infant was born at 38 weeks gestation to a healthy, 30 year old mother. Prenatal screening suggested Trisomy 21; however, amniocentesis revealed a normal 46XX karyotype. Pre-natal ultrasounds showed a two vessel cord, an absent stomach and polyhydramnios. A tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF) was suspected. Three days prior to delivery, an ultrasound demonstrated persistent polyhydramnios and a plateau in fetal growth. Cesarean section occurred for a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Apgar scores were 9 and 9. A chest x-ray revealed a nasogastric tube coiled in the esophagus thus confirming a TEF.\n\n【7】The infant was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and remained stable on room air. A systolic murmur and low set ears were noted. An ultrasound showed bilateral renal hypoplasia. Bilateral optic nerve colobomas and hearing loss were diagnosed. On echocardiography (ECHO), the AA anatomy was difficult to delineate. On the typical sweep for branching pattern, the appearance was consistent with a very large PDA ( Fig. 1 ) (Movie 1, supplementary data) and a DAA \\[ 17 \\] with a dominant right AA (RAA) ( Fig. 2 ) (Movie 2, supplementary data). Intracardiac anatomy, size, and function were normal. Consequently, CHARGE syndrome was suspected and confirmed (CHD7 gene mutation).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** **Movie 1.** A large PDA (with left to right shunt) was seen measuring 0.72 cm in diameter, compared to a descending aorta diameter of 0.69 cm.

The MRI showed a RAA with only two branches. The first was a suspected large brachiocephalic trunk (BCT) giving rise to the right common carotid artery (RCCA), left common carotid artery (LCCA), and left subclavian artery (LSCA) ( Fig. 3 ) (Movie 3, supplementary data). The second branch was the right subclavian artery (RSCA). The PDA was large and unusually oriented; it appeared to connect the main pulmonary artery (MPA) (close to the left pulmonary artery (LPA) origin) to the AA right at the base of the suspected BCT. The MRI suggested there was neither a vascular ring nor a DAA.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** **Movie 3.** 3D MRI angiogram reconstruction.

The patient developed heart failure at four weeks of age due to the persistently large PDA. Ligation by median sternotomy (due to the odd orientation of the PDA) occurred at 5 weeks.\n\n【16】Intraoperatively, the MRI anatomy was verified. However, the surgeon felt the length of the PDA too short for simple ligation, as ligation might compromise the takeoff of the LSCA and/or the LPA ( Fig. 4a ). The patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the PDA transected and the two ends closed with patches of bovine pericardium ( Fig. 4b ). The PDA tissue had the texture of normal great vessel wall - indistinguishable from the MPA and aorta. The patient recovered uneventfully.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Schematic of intra-operative anatomy showing shortness in length of PDA and relationship of proximity of LPA and LSCA, pre-transection (a), and post-transection (b)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】A repeat MRI was performed post-operatively ( Fig. 5 ) (Movie 4, supplementary data). The uniqueness of the RAA became much clearer. The suspected BCT was oriented anteriorly such that blood from the ascending aorta took a U-turn to perfuse it. Off this trunk, the RCCA, LCCA and LSCA arose individually while the distal end was patched.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** **Movie 4.** 3D MRI post-op: The suspected BCT was oriented anteriorly such that blood from the ascending aorta took a U-turn to perfuse it.

The cardiologist saw her at 7 and 18 months of age. The cardiac exam was normal including four limb blood pressures. An ECHO showed no coarctation and unobstructed blood flow to the RAA and its branches ( Fig. 6 ) (Movie 5, supplementary data). No further Cardiology follow-up was deemed necessary.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 6.** **Movie 5.** Echo study: forward flow from ascending aorta into large caliber persistent proximal left dorsal aorta then into head and neck vessels without obstruction or flow acceleration._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】* * *\n\n【26】To our knowledge, our patient’s combined cardiac findings have never been reported, let alone with CHARGE syndrome. This patient has: 1) a “window” PDA and; 2) a never described type of incomplete DAA: a dominant RAA with persistence of the proximal left dorsal aorta.\n\n【27】From the initial series of six pairs of embryonic aortic arches, the usual LAA develops through the systematic involution and persistence of specific arches \\[ 18 \\]. The left 4th arch becomes the actual AA, while the 5th arches involute. The PDA is formed by the distal portion of the left 6th arch while the right one involutes \\[ 19 \\]. The right dorsal aorta distal to the RSCA involutes to allow for a left-sided AA ( Fig. 7 ) \\[ 18 \\]. The most common branching pattern consists of three branches: the BCT, LCCA, and LSCA \\[ 20 \\]. The BCT branches into the RSCA and RCCA; the PDA connects the LPA near its origin to the proximal descending aorta. Variants from this AA pattern have been described in CHARGE with an aberrant R/LSCA seemingly the most common \\[ 5 , 7 , 8 , 21 \\- 23 \\]. A DAA associated with CHARGE appears much rarer with only one report found \\[ 24 \\].\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 7.** Schematic of embryologic development of a normal LAA._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【29】  \n\n【30】The uniqueness of our case lies in the AA branching pattern. From the 3D MRI ( Fig. 5 ) (Movie 4, supplementary data), there appeared to be two main branches off a RAA. The first was the suspected BCT giving rise to the RCCA, LCCA and LSCA. The second branch was the RSCA. The suspected BCT is actually a large segment of a persistent left dorsal aorta ( Fig. 8 ). Due to the failure of the LSCA to ascend cephalically and posteriorly, this segment embryologically had to persist in order to supply the LSCA, the left vertebral artery and the “window” PDA. A sharp U-shaped bend results between the ascending aorta and the left dorsal aorta as seen on MRI ( Fig. 5 ) (Movie 4, supplementary data). This is a form of incomplete DAA which explains why the ECHO ( Fig. 2 ) (Movie 2, supplementary data) imaging was consistent with a DAA \\[ 17 \\]. Typically the terminology of an incomplete DAA refers to an atresia of one of the AA resulting in a vascular ring created by the persistent ligamentum of the atretic segment; this entity is rare but described \\[ 25 \\- 28 \\]. In our patient, there is no vascular ring as the left dorsal aorta distal to the LSCA completely involuted as confirmed in surgery. To our knowledge this is the first description of an incomplete DAA with involution of the distal left dorsal aorta but persistence of the proximal portion.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 8.** The suspected BCT is actually a large segment of a persistent proximal left dorsal aorta (LDA) (a) making this an incomplete double aortic arch with involution of the distal portion of the left dorsal aorta (b)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【32】Our case is also unique as the PDA has a clear insertion into the MPA segment in an anterior-posterior fashion instead of the usual branch PA insertion. This anatomy supports Congdon’s theory \\[ 18 , 29 \\] that the ventral half of the left 6th arch initially contributes to the formation of the MPA and later to the branch PA. More interestingly, the large but extremely short PDA and atypical PDA tissue, point us to the diagnosis of a “window” PDA - an extreme rarity. Five cases describe a “window” PDA associated with a LAA \\[ 11 \\- 14 , 16 \\]. Three were recognized at postmortem. Only one previous case describes an association with a RAA \\[ 15 \\]. No reports were associated with CHARGE syndrome.\n\n【33】The diagnosis of a window PDA is commonly retrospective, where the initial PDA imaging is difficult to discern. The final clinical descriptions are all similar intra-operatively: the PDA appears short, almost non-apparent on external inspection, with the MPA appearing continuous with the aorta, and the PDA tissue is similar to aortic tissue. Histologically, the tissue contains little or no circular medial musculature and few or no intimal pads that are required to “close” the PDA \\[ 12 \\]. Pathology specimens from our case may have assisted in the diagnosis but, given the shortness of the PDA, were not attainable. A patch closure may be the safest way to close such a “window” PDA \\[ 11 \\- 13 \\], although Vida et al \\[ 15 \\] closed one by dividing and suturing it.\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】In summary, this case demonstrates an incomplete DAA with a large persistent segment of the left dorsal aorta coupled with a “window” PDA. Several important learning points arise. Firstly, as MRI is now a standard technique when ECHO assessment is unclear, practitioners must become familiar with these rare cases so that a proper, timely diagnosis is made. We present for the first time a “window” PDA imaged by 3D MRI angiography. The impact on clinical management is notable, as a “window” PDA is unlikely to close spontaneously. Therefore, with early diagnosis, intervention could occur prior to a patient developing congestive heart failure. Furthermore, surgical mishaps have occurred without understanding the possibility of a “window” PDA. One paper reports a mistaken ligation of the descending aorta as it appeared smaller than the PDA \\[ 12 \\]. Based on our management success and previous case reports, patch closure with cardiopulmonary support may be the best option.\n\n【36】Secondly, the risk of interrupting blood flow to head and neck vessels must be recognized in this AA anatomy. Given the orientation of the persistent left dorsal aorta, the blood exiting the ascending aorta must flow around a “U-turn” before entering these vessels. No other published papers describe this entity with such clear imaging and long-term follow-up.\n\n【37】Finally, this case reinforces the need for detailed attention to the cardiac anatomy in patients with CHARGE syndrome \\[ 7 , 21 \\]. Aside from case reports, recent published literature rarely describes PDA management in CHARGE \\[ 21 , 24 , 30 , 31 \\]. Management was last detailed 20 years ago \\[ 7 \\]. This area warrants further research.\n\n【38】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【39】Thank you to the patient’s parents for agreeing to dissemination of their daughter’s information.

The laboratory tests revealed thrombopenia (30,000 - 50,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), though the blood smears showed platelet aggregates together with reactive lymphocytes typical of IM ( Fig. 1 ). IM was therefore diagnosed and confirmed by the presence of IgM against EBV, with seroconversion 1 month later of IgG against EBV viral capsid antigen. During admission, the laboratory tests made in citrated tubes with manual counts yielded a platelet count of > 120,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . One month later, control testing in tubes containing EDTA revealed a platelet count of 132,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with no platelet aggregates in the smears.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Platelet aggregates are observed (black arrows), together with reactive lymphocytes typical of infectious mononucleosis (red arrows)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】IM can cause thrombocytopenia through autoimmune mechanisms in over 50% of the cases, though the drop in platelet count is usually mild and asymptomatic, and requires no treatment.\n\n【12】PT has been related to blood sample collection and processing in a medium containing EDTA, and can be associated to autoimmune disorders, drugs, solid tumors, and myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative syndromes. The cause of the reaction with EDTA appears to be related to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (platelet fibrinogen receptor) \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The explanation for the platelet aggregates would be a change in the structure of the glycoprotein, with the expression of new surface antigens that would be targeted by certain antibodies. This conformational change of the protein is produced by the chelating action of EDTA, since the presence of calcium is needed to maintain the structure of the glycoprotein \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. In addition to a drop in platelet count evidenced by the auto-analyzer, other laboratory test alterations can also be seen, such as pseudoleukocytosis and platelet “satellitism” phenomena. Pseudoleukocytosis is a false increase in leukocyte count in which the auto-analyzer counts the platelet aggregates as leukocytes, while “satellitism” is characterized by platelet adherence to the periphery of the neutrophils observed in the peripheral blood smear \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【13】We have described a case in which IM was the direct cause of PT, giving rise to false severe thrombopenia. Such cases have rarely been described in the literature \\[ 4 , 5 \\], though the possibility of such situations must be taken into account in order to avoid diagnostic and management errors.\n\n【14】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although fractures during removal of intramedullary tibial nails have been reported \\[ 1-4 \\], there have been few reports of difficult removal for femoral nails \\[ 5-7 \\] and no reports of fracture during removal of a femoral intramedullary nail, to our knowledge. A case of femoral fracture during removal of a femoral intramedullary nail is presented. The fracture appeared to be closely tied in with the structure of the femoral intramedullary nail.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 28-year-old man sustained a transverse fracture on his right femur while playing soccer. A week after the injury, intramedullary interlocking nailing was performed using a Zimmer (Warsaw, IN) ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail. An intramedullary nail, 10 mm in diameter, was inserted after 11 mm reaming according to the standard reaming-nailing technique. The operation was completed without any trouble, and the postoperative radiograph showed favorable reduction ( Fig. 1 ). Postoperative course also was uneventful, and he did not visit the hospital over a period of more than 1.5 years after the bone union.\n\n|  _**Figure 1.** A postoperative AP radiograph showing anatomical reduction._ |\n| --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Two years and 5 months after the initial operation, the nail was removed at the patient’s request. The radiograph immediately before the removal showed complete healing of the fracture with an anatomic alignment and without any hardware failure ( Fig. 2 ). Following removal of interlocking screws, the intramedullary nail was tried to be extracted. The nail started to be pulled out with relatively little resistance at first, but considerably greater resistance was encountered after it was taken out several centimeters. After an addition of harder blows, the resistance suddenly disappeared and the nail was pulled out completely without stopping. There was no breakage in the removal instruments and the nail. However, the radiographs taken immediately after the removal demonstrated several new, longitudinal fracture lines proximal to the primary fracture site ( Fig. 3 ). A CT image showed fracture lines that radiated in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) and a narrow, newly formed intramedullary bone that was the same in configuration as the nail surface ( Fig. 4 ). The fracture was treated conservatively with protected weight-bearing. In the fifth postoperative month, the patient could tolerate full weight-bearing and no significant functional disorders were observed thereafter. The patient gave his informed consent prior to being included into this case report.\n\n|  _**Figure 2.** An AP radiograph taken immediately before the nail removal showing complete union of the fracture._ |\n| --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n|  _**Figure 3.** An AP radiograph taken immediately after the nail removal showing longitudinal fracture lines (arrows)._ |\n| --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n|  _**Figure 4.** A CT image showing fracture lines that radiate in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) and a narrow, newly formed intramedullary bone that is the same in configuration as the nail surface._ |\n| --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】The Zimmer ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail is made of stainless steel. The entire surface of the nail is treated with shot-peening to enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of the nail. It has flutes in the four directions to provide space for revascularization and to enhance fixation by four-point cortical contact. Nails which are larger in diameter (12 - 16 mm) have a slot anteriorly instead of a flute to increase the flexibility of the nail. The flutes stop at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws to preserve the nail strength, and the cross-sectional shape of the distal end of the nail, several centimeters in length, differs from the upper part of the nail, being cylindrical except the thin anterior slot ( Fig. 5 ).\n\n|  _**Figure 5.** ZMS ® femoral nail (distal end)._ |\n| --- |\n\n【18】In postoperative CT, the fracture lines were observed in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) of the femur. There existed a mature bone, which was newly formed in the same configuration as the cross-sectional shape of the intramedullary nail. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the fracture is closely tied in with the structure of the nail stated above. That is, the mature, hard bone which was formed in the three flutes was hit against the distal cylindrical part of the nail at the distal end of the flutes when the nail was extracted, producing strong resistance, and eventually giving rise to a fracture. Seligson et al \\[ 5 \\] reported two cases of irremovable interlocking femoral nails, including one case of 13 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail, and stated that the bone overgrowth into the slot of the nail might have prevented the distal, unslotted end of the nail from being extracted from the medullary canal. They recommended the use of nails with closed and constant cross-sectional designs to prevent the problem of difficult removal. Although the 10 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail used in our case did not have the slot and had a closed cross-section, it had flutes that stopped at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws. Our case suggested the importance of the constant cross-sectional design to prevent the difficulties and the fracture on nail removal.\n\n【19】There have been some reports of fracture on removal of tibial intramedullary nails \\[ 1-4 \\]. Takakuwa et al \\[ 1 \\] reported four cases of fracture on removal of an ACE tibial nail, and stated that 5° bend at the distal tip and the posterior slot which stopped at the level of the distal bend as well as late retrieval of the nail contributed to the fracture. Moreover, skepticism was brought against the necessity of reaming to use nails of larger diameter \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Im and Lee \\[ 4 \\] also reported three cases of fracture on removal and two cases of inability of removal of ACE tibial nails, and stated that younger age of the patient was significantly associated with the difficulty in nail removal, comparing with 30 cases of uneventful removal. Problems of the inconstant cross-sectional design, the late removal, the reaming, and the young age of the patient could be considered as contributory factors to the fracture on removal also in our case.\n\n【20】Although the nail used in our case was made of stainless steel, which is known as less osteoconductive material than titanium and its alloys, postoperative CT demonstrated abundant bone formation along the nail surface. This might be related to the micro-texture of the nail surface, in addition to the late removal and the patient age. The surface of the nail was not smooth because of the shot-peening applied for strength and corrosion resistance. It is known that, when the surface of a titanium implant is roughened, bone apposition onto the implant surface and bone-implant interfacial strength is increased \\[ 10 \\]. This property seems not peculiar to titanium alloy \\[ 11 \\], and it is possible that the roughened surface of the stainless steel nail accelerated osteoconduction on the nail surface. Unlike the surface of the metal implants for cementless arthroplasties, the surface of the metals for osteosynthesis would not have to be highly osteoconductive.\n\n【21】We were unable to find any previous reports on cases of the femoral fracture that occurred during removal of the intramedullary femoral nail \\[ 12-14 \\]. Husain et al \\[ 12 \\] reviewed their 45 cases of femoral nail removal, and did not find particular difficulties in late removal of titanium nails as well as stainless steel nails. The titanium nail in their report was a fluted nail with a satin surface, and the stainless steel nail was a slotted nail with a polished surface. Thus, in addition to the macrotexture such as cross-sectional design, the surface roughness of the nail could be a significant contributory factor to the fracture on nail removal.\n\n【22】The succeeded model of the intramedullary nail from the same manufacturer (M/DN <sup>® </sup> Femoral Nail, Zimmer, IN) is a stainless steel nail with a polished surface, and also the flutes do not stop above the distal holes, extending almost to the distal end of the nail.\n\n【23】Although some previous studies have indicated that the removal of intramedullary femoral nails should be restricted in asymptomatic patients \\[ 13 , 14 \\], the nail removal might be useful for symptomatic patients \\[ 15 \\]. In Asian countries, patients prefer the removal of metallic hardware also for cultural reasons \\[ 1 , 4 \\].\n\n【24】When internal fixation is to be done with an intramedullary nail and its removal is to be expected, we consider it necessary to choose a nail whose cross-sectional shape does not differ at levels and whose surface is not rough. At removal, the structure of the nail as well as the period that extends to the nail removal should be considered.\n\n【25】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【26】The authors have received nothing of value, and no financial support of this study has occurred. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. The device that is the subject of this manuscript has been approved by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.\n\n【27】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

NTM infections exhibit a wide geographical variation worldwide \\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]. _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC) is the most reported species causing pulmonary disease globally, followed variably by _Mycobacterium kansasii_ ( _M. kansasii_ ), _Mycobacterium xenopi_ ( _M. xenopi_ ), and other NTM, largely depending on geographic location \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. _M. xenopi_ is the second most pathogen of pulmonary NTM infections in Canada, southwest Europe, and UK \\[ 4 \\], while _M. kansasii_ is only behind MAC as an isolated organism of non-tuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the USA, predominately Southwest and Midwest regions of the USA \\[ 5 \\]. The usual infection route is inhaling airborne particles from an environmental source \\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]. NTM infections are universally not contagious \\[ 1 , 3 \\].\n\n【3】The majority of NTM-PD were reported in hosts with underlying lung diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and prior mycobacterial tuberculosis \\[ 6 \\]. Despite immune deficiency being considered a risk factor for NTM lung infections, immunocompromised patients comprise only a small population of those with pulmonary disease, in contrast to typical mycobacterial tuberculosis \\[ 6 \\]. The clinical features of NTM lung disease are variable and usually mimic the symptoms of pre-existing lung diseases \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【4】The diagnosis of NTM-PD is challenging, partly because of the nonspecific nature of their clinical features and radiological characteristics \\[ 1 , 4 , 6 \\]. The diagnosis typically requires specific microbiological criteria in the presence of pulmonary symptoms and suggestive radiological findings \\[ 2 , 6 \\]. The microbiological criteria entail either two positive sputum cultures, a positive culture from a bronchial wash or lavage, or a lung biopsy with histologic findings of mycobacterial infection in the presence of a positive culture \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【5】Herein, the authors present a series of three elderly patients with chronic lung diseases, who were diagnosed with NTM-PD from a community-based hospital in the midwestern USA. The infections were caused by _M. xenopi_ in two patients and MAC in the third patient. The NTM-PD masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. The current literature reporting on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological features, diagnosis, and management of NTM-PD is briefly reviewed in this communication.\n\n| **Case Reports** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】**Case 1**\n\n【9】_Investigations_\n\n【10】A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy smoking (a 55-pack-year), emphysema, and occupational asbestos exposure, presented initially to the pulmonary outpatient clinic for abnormal findings on a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan for lung cancer screening. The patient was asymptomatic, and the physical exam was only notable for a hyperinflated chest wall with decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The low-dose chest CT scan showed diffuse emphysema with large bulla/cavities most significantly in the upper lobes and bilateral small lung nodules. A follow-up CT was recommended within 3 months for close monitoring of the nodular lesions, but the patient lost to follow-up. After 2 years, the patient presented to the pulmonary clinic with exertional shortness of breath and a productive cough for several weeks. The patient’s symptoms only partially improved with courses of oral antibiotic therapy and bronchodilator inhalers. A CT scan of the chest redemonstrated a similar appearance of severe emphysema and thick-walled apical bullae with an interval progression in the number and size of left-sided pulmonary nodules ( Fig. 1a ). Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated only a hyper-metabolic uptake in the prostate region. He was referred to the urology service, and further workup ruled out prostate cancer. The patient’s complaints continued to progress despite regular compliance with the prescribed inhalers, and he lost significant weight over 3 months’ time.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Axial images of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest demonstrating interval progression of the left-sided lung nodules in the upper lobe over a period.

Other lung pathologies were fairly stable. Sputum Gram stain and culture were negative for any growth. Urine antigens for fungal pathogens were unrevealing. Serial expectorant morning sputum samples were positive for many acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and cultures grew _M. xenopi_ , which was further identified by the direct matrix-associated laser desorption (MALDI) technique. Sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ ( _M. tuberculosis_ ) and MAC. A diagnosis of an atypical mycobacterial infection with _M. xenopi_ was made based on a combination of a suggestive clinical history with possible radiological findings and confirmatory microbiology.\n\n【14】_Treatment_\n\n【15】The patient commenced triple therapy comprising a multi-drug regimen of rifampin, ethambutol, and azithromycin after the diagnosis was made.\n\n【16】_Follow-up and outcomes_\n\n【17】The patient’s symptoms started to gradually improve with the triple therapy and a repeat CT chest revealed an interval reduction in the size of the left upper lobe lesion.\n\n【18】**Case 2**\n\n【19】_Investigations_\n\n【20】A 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for heavy smoking (a 25-pack-year), daily marijuana use, long-standing COPD with bullous emphysema, and prior unprovoked pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation, presented to the pulmonary outpatient clinic with increasing tiredness and worsening productive cough for a few months. The patient endorsed regular compliance with her medications, but she admitted to continuing active smoking. Notably, the patient has a history of cavitary and nodular lung disease under yearly surveillance. Her last PET scan 7 years prior to her index presentation was concerning for abnormal hyper-metabolic uptake in an upper right lobe cavitary lesion. Subsequently, she underwent endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) which ruled a neoplastic process but revealed a non-caseating granuloma. Extensive infectious workup at that time (i.e., AFB stains, and serial cultures of the sputum, bronchial lavage, and lung biopsy) did not yield any infectious culprit for the granulomatous pathology, particularly, mycobacterial, and fungal etiologies. The patient remained relatively asymptomatic for the interval 6-year period with fairly stable cavitary and nodular lesions appearances over the serial scans. The physical examination revealed a low body mass index (BMI) of 16.5, which was significantly reduced from the prior visit 1 year ago. The respiratory examination showed reduced breathing sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. An acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and she was commenced on an albuterol inhaler, a short course of prednisone, and oral antibiotics. However, the patient’s symptoms were not adequately controlled.\n\n【21】_Diagnosis_\n\n【22】A CT chest demonstrated an interval significant progression of the right upper lobe cavity lesion (3.2 × 1.7 cm) ( Fig. 2a ) from the prior exam (1.1 × 0.8 cm) which was nearly 1 year ago ( Fig. 2b ). The bilateral nodular lesions and advanced emphysematous bullous disease were relatively unchanged. A PET scan depicted no significant hyper-metabolic activity in the right upper cavitary lesion at this time. An interdisciplinary review of the serial CT images suggested a possibility of a chronic infectious process given the low metabolic activity of the lesion. Nevertheless, the possibility of lung malignancy remained a concern considering the patient’s high-risk status and the patient has been counseled about further invasive workup if needed. Sputum cultures grew _M. xenopi_ , which was identified by the MALDI technique. Sputum PCR was negative for _M. tuberculosis_ and MAC.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Axial images of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest demonstrating interval progression of the right upper cavitary over 1 year (horizontal arrows).

He also reported a chronic cough and intermittent sputum production. The patient was discharged from our hospital 2 days prior to his index presentation following a short-coursed admission with an acute exacerbation of COPD due to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. The patient had no increase in supplemental oxygen requirement at that admission. The patient improved with supportive management with analgesics, albuterol nebulizers, dexamethasone, and COVID-directed therapy (remdesivir). Notably, the patient had several admissions to the medical floor with acute flare-ups of COPD in the past few months. The patient is originally from Iraq and immigrated to the USA 10 years ago, but he denied any recent traveling outside the USA. Initial evaluation revealed a frail and underweight elderly patient (BMI of 16.5) with signs of acute respiratory distress. He was afebrile with sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 110 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute), and stable blood pressure. The lung examination was significant for decreased breathing sounds bilaterally and mild diffuse expiratory wheezing.\n\n【31】_Diagnosis_\n\n【32】Chest X-ray (CXR) showed stable reticulonodular and emphysematous changes with a volume loss in the left upper lung from scarring ( Fig. 3a ). CT chest demonstrated diffuse random-sized nodules with an ill-defined cavitary lesion in the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe, extending inferiorly into a more solid component along the pleura, which was seen in a previous CT chest that was performed 1 month ago ( Fig. 3b, c ). Further review of prior images revealed that the cavitary lesion was visualized 1.5 years ago on imaging performed at an outside hospital to rule out pulmonary embolism, but it has progressed in size during the index imaging. The patient was started on empirical cefepime and vancomycin, nebulizer, and dexamethasone for possible worsening bronchiectasis. An infectious workup revealed positive sputum for _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , but serial blood cultures remained negative. Urine antigens for histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis were also negative. Consecutive sputum cultures grew many AFB, which was identified as MAC. Sputum PCR was negative for _M. tuberculosis_ .\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** (a) Chest X-ray with the reticulonodular process and a loss of volume in the left upper lobe (horizontal arrow).

The parenteral antibiotic therapy was transitioned to levofloxacin upon discharge to complete a 4-week course.\n\n【36】_Follow-up and outcomes_\n\n【37】The patient continued MAC therapy with close follow-up with pulmonary and infectious disease services.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【39】* * *\n\n【40】The exact incidence of NTM-PD in the USA is not precisely known, as the disease is not mandatory reportable in most states \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【41】There are four distinct clinical syndromes described with various NTM species in humans \\[ 8 , 9 \\]; pulmonary disease, especially in elderly patients with chronic lung disease, is caused primarily by MAC, both globally and in the USA \\[ 1 , 2 , 7 \\], followed by _M. kansasii_ , particularly in midwestern regions of the USA \\[ 5 \\]. Less common species include _M. xenopi_ , which is more prevalent in Canada, southwest Europe, and the UK \\[ 4 \\]. Superficial lymphadenitis, commonly cervical lymphadenitis in the pediatric population, is largely caused by MAC and _Mycobacterium scrofulaceum_ ( _M. scrofulaceum_ ) \\[ 9 \\]. _Mycobacterium marinum_ ( _M. marinum_ ) and _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ ( _M. ulcerans_ ) are the principal pathogens for skin and soft tissue infections that are acquired through direct inoculation, and they may also cause surgical site infections \\[ 9 \\]. The disseminated disease is typically noted in severely immunocompromised patients (mostly caused by MAC) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【42】Our case series demonstrated NTM-PD in three elderly patients with COPD and significant smoking history, consistent with the literature reported above \\[ 1 , 6 , 7 , 9 \\]. Nevertheless, _M. xenopi_ was isolated in two out of three patients in this series, a finding that is not much in keeping with the epidemiological pattern of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA, where those patients were diagnosed \\[ 5 \\]. The reported patients had no history of recent traveling to regions where _M. xenopi_ is more prevalent.\n\n【43】The clinical presentation of MAC and _M. xenopi_ lung disease of our patients is similar to those in the literature \\[ 1 , 9 , 10 \\]. The symptoms of NTM lung diseases are nonspecific (i.e., dry or productive cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and occasionally hemoptysis) \\[ 1 , 9 \\]. They closely resemble the symptoms of the underlying lung disease, thus making clinical suspicion quite difficult \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【44】The clinical course of MAC is generally less progressive compared to mycobacterial tuberculosis \\[ 10 \\]. Extensive lung parenchymal destruction is often evident at the time of MAC diagnosis, partly because of the indolent nature of the disease \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Disseminated disease is usually associated with severe cell-mediated immunity deficiency \\[ 9 \\]. A less frequent variant of MAC lung disease is notably reported in older women without prior overt lung disease or smoking history, which is characterized by a right middle lobe or lingular infiltrate; referred to as the Lady Windermere syndrome \\[ 11 \\]. The least common MAC variant is described in relatively younger immunocompetent hosts with significant exposure to hot tubs \\[ 9 \\]. The latter variant is considered a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction to aerosolized MAC from hot tubs \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【45】_M. xenopi_ is a low-virulent NTM that emerged as an opportunistic pathogen for pulmonary disease and less commonly extrapulmonary infections (mostly osteoarticular infections) \\[ 12 \\]. A comprehensive review of 136 cases of _M. xenopi_ lung disease from a single tertiary center in France described three disease patterns; cavitary disease in patients with chronic lung disease, mostly COPD (as observed in our reported patients), acute infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts, and rarely solitary nodular disease in immunocompetent patients \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【46】A retrospective study of 74 patients from a single institution in Canada by Carrillo et al \\[ 2 \\] compared the radiological characteristics of the lung disease caused by MAC and _M. xenopi_ \\[ 2 \\]. The study noted that patients with _M. xenopi_ were relatively younger and more often had advanced emphysema and lung malignancy \\[ 2 \\]. MAC patients mostly had a nodular bronchiectatic pattern, followed by a cavitary pattern (which was noted in our MAC patient) \\[ 2 \\]. While the cavitary pattern tended to predominately occur in _M. xenopi_ infection, the majority of patients had variable patterns of random nodules, consolidation, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance, and ground-glass opacities \\[ 2 \\]. However, these imaging patterns were not statistically significant and were neither pathognomonic for MAC nor _M. xenopi_ \\[ 2 \\]. The cavitation process of _M. xenopi_ typically involves the upper lobes, as observed in the second patient with _M. xenopi_ infection \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【47】Interestingly, _M. xenopi_ infection was reportedly associated with lung malignancy \\[ 14 \\]. This suggested association was postulated by scar tissues that may potentially undergo a malignant transformation \\[ 2 , 14 \\]. Heavy smoking, as a risk factor for lung cancer, is also prevalent among _M. xenopi_ patients, which is an observation that may partly explain the coincidence of _M. xenopi_ and malignancy \\[ 14 \\]. In the review of Carrillo et al \\[ 2 \\], about one-fourth (25%) of patients with _M. xenopi_ had prior or concurrent lung cancer \\[ 2 \\]. The concern of lung malignancy was evident in our _M. xenopi_ patients, considering their suggestive clinical history and the suspicious radiological findings on initial presentation. A similar case reported by Fogla et al \\[ 15 \\] described an elderly, heavy-smoker, male patient who had an upper lobe cavitary lesion on imaging. Percutaneous needle biopsy and bronchial lavage did not yield neoplastic cells but necrotic tissues. The patient underwent a wedge resection because of a high malignancy suspicion; histology demonstrated caseating granulomas with positive AFP, and further molecular studies with 16S RNA confirmed _M. xenopi_ infection and ruled out typical tuberculosis \\[ 15 \\]. Nevertheless, the small possibility of concurrent lung cancer cannot be entirely ruled out in our presented patients.\n\n【48】Microbiological confirmation remains the gold standard to diagnose NTM-PD, as their clinical course and radiological findings greatly mimic typical mycobacterial, fungal, and neoplastic lung diseases \\[ 3 , 8 \\]. Specific diagnostic criteria were established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) \\[ 7 \\]. These criteria require at least two positive expectorated sputum cultures, a positive sputum culture from a bronchial wash or lavage, and a lung biopsy with histologic findings of mycobacterial infection (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) in the presence of a positive NTM culture \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【49】Nevertheless, positive sputum results should be interpreted cautiously as these NTM have variable virulence, therefore, they can be only transiently recovered from the respiratory tract without causing a progressive infection \\[ 9 \\]. In addition, NTMs may contaminate laboratory specimens, for instance, tap water (liquid or frozen) may contain NTMs that can potentially contaminate these specimens \\[ 9 \\]. Fortunately, highly accurate nucleic acid probes are becoming readily available for faster identification of NTM, including MAC and _M. xenopi_ \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【50】Management of NTM-PD remains challenging. As the infection is usually chronic, a multi-drug regimen is warranted, and there are no randomized comparative trials that evaluated the currently employed regimens \\[ 17 \\]. The ATS/IDSA treatment guidelines from 2007 include a combination of a macrolide with rifampin and ethambutol, which should be continued until sputum cultures remain negative for 12 months for MAC \\[ 7 \\], with the same guidelines being currently recommended for _M. xenopi_ \\[ 7 \\]. In contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines from 2017 recommend initial treatment with four medications including a macrolide, rifampin, and ethambutol combined with either a fluoroquinolone or isoniazid for NTM infections \\[ 18 \\]. These guidelines are based on limited evidence obtained from non-randomized controlled trials \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【51】Surgical intervention for NTM-PD is currently limited only to patients who failed medical therapy (i.e., remained sputum positive after 6 months of continued anti-tuberculous therapy), those who cannot tolerate various medications, and hosts with macrolide-resistant strains \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【52】**Conclusions**\n\n【53】This case series highlights NTM-PD as an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions. Interestingly, two of the NTM infections in our series were caused by _M. xenopi_ , a less frequent culprit of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA. The NTM infections masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients. The diagnostic criteria for NTM-PD established by the AST/IDSA should be followed to achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis to start anti-tuberculous therapy.\n\n【54】**Learning points**\n\n【55】NTM-PD is an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions.\n\n【56】NTM-PD can greatly mimic lung malignancy both clinically and radiologically, which may pose a diagnostic dilemma.\n\n【57】Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients.\n\n【58】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【59】The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Infectious Disease at Ascension Saint Francis Hospital for providing valuable input to this case series.\n\n【60】**Financial Disclosure**\n\n【61】The authors confirm that there is no funding to declare regarding the publication of this submitted work.\n\n【62】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【63】All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this case series.\n\n【64】**Informed Consent**\n\n【65】Informed consent was obtained from the patients to write and publish their cases with all accompanying clinical and radiological data.

Hemobilia occurs when there is a communication between a vessel and the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary system and is typically represented as Quincke’s triad: colicky abdominal pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage \\[ 2 \\]. The etiology of hemobilia includes iatrogenic trauma, accidental trauma, gallstones, inflammation, vascular malformations and tumors. Accidental trauma used to be the major cause of hemobilia. Currently, two-thirds of hemobilia are caused by iatrogenic trauma, which has been rapidly increasing with the frequent applications of percutaneous hepatic and biliary procedures such as liver biopsy and percutaneous biliary drainage \\[ 2 \\]. In contrast, non-traumatic hemobilia due to inflammation, gallstone, and vascular malformations are extremely rare and also difficult to be diagnosed compared to traumatic hemobilia. Pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery is one of non-traumatic hemobilia and as few as 22 cases have been reported \\[ 3 \\- 24 \\]. In most of these cases, the patients were treated by either primary cholecystectomy or transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) followed by cholecystectomy.\n\n【3】We report a case of hemobilia caused by psuedoaneurysm of the cystic artery which was successfully treated by performing TAE with metallic coils, without the following cholecystectomy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】A 71-year-old Japanese woman was sent to the Emergency Department (ED) at our institution, with a subacute onset of epigastric abdominal pain originating from the right upper quadrant. The patient denied a history of hematemesis and melena. Past medical history included hypertension and Parkinson’s disease. She has been suffered by Parkinson’s disease for more than 20 years. The control of this disease has been getting worse and she could hardly walk by herself. She has spent most of her time on wheelchair or lying in bed.\n\n【7】On admission, conjunctiva was slightly pale and icteric. Blood pressure was 90/56 mmHg, body temperature was 38.7 °C, respiratory rate was 20/min, and heart rate was 90/min. The epigastric region appeared full and was tender with palpation. There were no obvious peritoneal findings such as rebound tenderness. Rectal examination was negative for melena. She spoke in very soft voice and joints were stiff because of Parkinson’s disease. Laboratory data on admission showed that white blood cell count (7600/µL), hemoglobin (12.5 g/dl) and platelet count (16.6 x 10 <sup>4 </sup> µL) were normal. Liver function tests showed that total bilirubin (6.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphates (913 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (329 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (343 IU/L),γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (410 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (252 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (5.1mg/dl) were elevated. Coagulation tests were normal.\n\n【8】Although abdominal ultrasonography (US) was immediately performed at ED, it was not diagnostic because of difficulty to hold the proper posture due to Parkinson’s disease and excessive bowel gas. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed marked thickening of the gallbladder wall, which contained high density material. However, these findings did not suggest the presence of vascular abnormalities such as aneurysm ( Fig. 1 ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed two of approximately 15 mm sized circular signal defects in gallbladder in conjunction with dilatation of biliary tree and two or three 5 to 8 mm sized signal defects in the common bile duct close to the papilla of Vater ( Fig. 2 ). Radiologist suggested that there are possibly stones in gallbladder and common bile duct at this point. Based on the radiographic findings, differential diagnosis included acute cholicystitis, cholelithiasis, and choledocholithiasis at this point. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotics were started to treat this condition.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) Contrast-enhanced computed tomography shows thickening of gallbladder wall.

This was the first as well as only episode of hematomesis and melena during the entire clinical course. However, the amount of blood vomited was estimated at approximately 500 mL and the patient showed hypovolemic shock with low systemic blood pressure of under 80 mmHg and tachycardia of 100 /min. The patient was given 2 units of red blood cells transfusion and rapid ringer infusion for resuscitation. In the meantime, emergent upper endoscopy was performed and demonstrated a large amount of coagula in the stomach. No obvious site of bleeding was found in the stomach after removal of the coagula. Upper endoscopy was then advanced to the 2nd portion of duodenum demonstrating that a small amount of blood was suddenly spouted out from the papilla of Vater ( Fig. 3 ). This finding was observed only once during the procedure, although we kept on observing there for more than 30 minutes. At this point, decision was made to perform dynamic CT to evaluate the cause of hemobilia. The arterial and portal venous phases of dynamic CT showed the presence of approximately 12 mm nodular lesion at possibly inside the neck of gall bladder with an enhanced pattern parallel to the arterial phase in conjunction with the thickening of gallbladder wall ( Fig. 4 ). The nodular lesion, which was not detected on admission, showed no obvious extravasation of contrast agents into surrounding structures. These results suggested the presence of newly developed vascular pseudoaneurysm in conjunction with possible cholecystitis. Although the dynamic CT did not demonstrate any signs of active bleeding from the nodular lesion, patient was hemodynamically unstable and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed for the diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. At the time of DSA, therapeutic materials such as micro coils and gelform were ready to use for the treatment of unexpected bleeding. DSA through the hepatic artery demonstrated the presence of a pseudoaneurysm originated from the cystic artery without any extravasation of contrast agents ( Fig. 5a ). Although there was no sign of active bleeding into biliary tree, it was thought that the intermittent bleeding due to the rupture of pseudoaneurysm could cause hemobilia. The right hepatic artery was selectively catheterized, and one microcoil was then placed distal and the other one was placed proximal to the aneurysm to block the arterial inflow to the pseudoaneurysm. Prior to embolization, we confirmed that the sufficient blood supply to the right liver lobe was preserved through the left hepatic artery ( Fig. 5b ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** Endoscopy demonstrates blood oozing from the papilla of Vater (arrow)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Dynamic CT shows 12 mm nodular lesion at the neck of gall bladder with an enhancement pattern parallel to the artery (arrows).

Based on further assessment by anesthesiologists, decision was made not to proceed to any further surgical management such as cholecystectomy because of her severe co-morbidities, and also the patient refused to undergo surgery. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated the presence of stones in the gallbladder, and following the balloon dilation of the sphincter of Odd, small stones came out from the papilla of Vater. At a follow-up of 12 months, the patient was asymptomatic and satisfied with the outcome of treatment.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】* * *\n\n【22】Non-traumatic cause of hemobilia includes inflammatory conditions such as cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis, and malignancies. Twenty-two cases of hemobilia caused by pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery have been published in English literature. In most of these cases, abdominal US were performed as a primary imaging modality to screen the cause of abdominal pain. In 6 cases, pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery was suspected by color doppler US and followed by enhanced and/or dynamic CT, dynamic MRI, and/or angiography to confirm the diagnosis. Enhanced CT would be the second imaging modality to detect the pseudoaneurysm. Following the initial evaluation with abdominal US and CT, angiography was then performed in most of cases to visualize the vascular abnormalities such as psuedoaneurysm and 8 cases subsequently underwent TAE. Of 18 cases, in which gastrointestinal bleeding such as hematemesis or melena occurred, the blood from papilla of Vater was successfully observed in 6 cases under direct endoscopic visualization and hemobilia was confidently diagnosed. As the present case showed, the direct observation of hemobilia from papilla of Vater has been difficult to encounter, although it is crucial for the accurate diagnosis. Based on the diagnosis of hemobilia, 15 cases were treated with surgery, 3 cases with TAE followed by surgery, and 4 cases with only TAE. The 4 cases, which were treated with only TAE, were not complicated by gallbladder ischemia.\n\n【23】A pseudoaneurysm is a hematoma that is formed as the result of blood leaked from injured arterial wall. The hematoma develops outside the arterial wall so it is wrapped by the surrounding tissues. The exact mechanism to develop a pseudoaneurysm and the association between pseudoaneurysm and inflammatory process such as cholecystitis remains unclear. In the review of 16 cases of cystic artery pseudoaneurysm caused by cholecystitis, Akatsu et al \\[ 8 \\] assumed that the acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall may cause both ulceration of serosa and partial erosion of the elastic and muscular components of the arterial wall, thus leading to the formation and rupture of the pseudoaneurysm. The presence of gall stone may accelerate the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. Furthermore, arterial sclerosis due to hypertension is considered as a risk factor of aneurysm formation \\[ 25 \\] and weakness of arterial wall due to arterial sclerosis may also accelerate the formation of the pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【24】In the present case, the pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery was not detected by US, enhanced CT, or MRCP. One of the signal defects in gall bladder in MRCP could be the pseudoaneurysm, however angiography showed that the pseudoaneurysm was present at the different location, the neck of gall bladder. Although initial enhanced CT did not show any sign of vascular abnormalities, dynamic CT clearly demonstrated the presence of psuedoaneurysm two days after admission. The inflammatory process on gallbladder may be associated with the formation of pseudoaneurysm, which may be developed or enlarged after admission. On the other hand, initial enhanced CT was sliced every 10 mm meanwhile dynamic CT was sliced every 7 mm. The size of aneurysm measured by DSA was approximately 15 mm of diameter so that initial enhanced CT may have missed the initiation of pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【25】Although the typical presentation of hemobilia is represented by Quincke’s triad such as colicky abdominal pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the complete typical triad can be seen in approximately two-thirds of patients who are usually presented with abdominal pain followed by hematemesis or melena \\[ 7 \\]. In contrast, our patient was presented with jaundice and abdominal pain. It is possible that the gastrointestinal and biliary motility had been impaired due to the long-standing history of Parkinson’s disease \\[ 26 \\] so that the blood clots stayed longer in the common bile duct to represent the sign of jaundice first, and also in stomach and intestines to represent the late presentation of hematemesis and melena. On the other hand, abdominal US, especially color doppler US, has been recognized as a highly effective diagnostic tool for detecting pseudoaneurysms \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. However, previous reports have demonstrated that a pseudoaneurysm was detected with color-doppler US only in 6 of 22 cases. Similarly, these imaging modalities were not sufficient enough to make a diagnosis in the present case because of the posture limitation and excessive bowel gas probably due to Parkinson’s disease related impaired gastrointestinal motility.\n\n【26】In the present case, the patient was diagnosed with hemobilia confidently because the bleeding from the papilla of Vater was observed under direct endoscopic visualization by chance. If there was no chance to witness this finding, this patient would be diagnosed with acute gastric mucosal lesion, healed gastroduodenal ulcer, or any other cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, and undergo further re-intervention. It is noted that hemobilia should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding when no obvious bleeding site can be found by upper endoscopy, and further imaging modalities such as contrast and/or dynamic CT and angiography should be considered to assess possible vascular abnormalities. DSA can be a both diagnostic and therapeutic method for the management of vascular abnormalities. Endoscopy can be a diagnostic tool but it is almost impossible to treat hemobilia with endoscopic procedure.\n\n【27】Hemobilia due to rupture of pseudoaneurysm developed on the cystic artery can be treated by either cholecystectomy or TAE. Maeda et al. \\[ 15 \\] reported a case which was successfully treated by a “two-step” strategy consisting of embolization of the cystic artery followed by elective cholecystectomy. Whether cholecystectomy is required after successful embolization of cystic artery pseudoaneurysms remains controversial. Although the concern after embolization of cystic artery is the development of gallbladder ischemia, we assume that embolization of the cystic artery would not lead to ischemia of the gallbladder because it has been reported that the blood supply from gallbladder bed should be sufficient and collateral anastomoses with the epicholedochal artery may develop after embolization of the cystic artery \\[ 27 \\]. In our case, we decided not to perform cholecystectomy following TAE because of severe co-morbidities and patient’s refusal. Although cholecystectomy may not be required as far as there are no signs of gallbladder ischemia, the patient needs to be carefully monitored following TAE.\n\n【28】In conclusion, we report the case of hemobilia due to pseudoaneurysm originated from the cystic artery presenting with jaundice and upper abdominal pain followed by massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was successfully treated by TAE. Hemobilia, especially due to psuedoaneurysm of cystic artery, is extremely rare. The direct visualization of blood from the papilla of Vater is crucial for the definitive diagnosis, but is difficult to encounter. Therefore, hemobilia should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with unknown etiology and there should be low threshold to perform dynamic CT and angiography to assess the vascular abnormalities. Although the management of hemobilia due to pseudoanerysm remains controversial, non-surgical approach such as TAE could be a reasonable and definitive treatment option especially for high-risk patients who are not suitable for surgery.\n\n【29】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【30】Yoshihiro Komatsu and other co-authors have no conflict of interest.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This is due to the relatively protected position of these neural structures and their decreased accessibility to injury. It may be caused by anatomical abnormalities such as tumors, hematomas, surgical damage and trauma. Moreover, it can be damaged by metabolic insults such as diabetes mellitus, infection and paraneoplastic syndrome. Nevertheless, the most common cause of trauma resulting in lesion affecting the lumbosacral plexus is pelvic fracture \\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]. The incidence of lumbosacral plexopathies from pelvic fracture is about 9-46% \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\] whereas the incidence of lumbosacral plexopathies from femoral fracture is about 0.7% \\[ 6 \\]. The symptoms which are caused by compressing lumbosacral plexus vary according to the structures involved such as sensory disturbance and muscles weakness in an affected leg. Unfortunately, neurological assessment in acute phase is difficult to detect and is generally diagnosed during follow-up.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 17-year-old male became persistent of right foot drop and numbness along the leg for 3 months. He had history of motorcycle accident. The pelvic radiograph showed fracture of right femoral head ( Fig. 1 ). Computed tomography scan of both hips with 3D reconstruction revealed right femoral head fracture which was proximal to the fovea centralis: Pipkin fracture type II and hemathrosis in the hip ( Fig. 2 , 3 ). He underwent open reduction and internal fixation by plate and screw ( Fig. 4 ). He denied any systemic disease. An orthopedic surgeon firstly diagnosed his symptoms as right sciatic neuropathy. However, 3 months postoperatively, his symptoms were not improved and still had paresthesia at right leg and the dorsum of the foot. The electrodiagnostic study was asked to confirm and localize the lesion.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Pelvic radiograph: right femoral head fracture._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** CT scan 3D: Pipkin fracture type II in right hip._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** CT scan: hemathrosis in right hip._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Pelvic radiograph: S/P open reduction and internal fixation by plate and screw in right hip._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Physical examination revealed muscle atrophy at right leg.

Impaired pinprick sensation and temperature sensation at right lateral leg and dorsum of the foot were noted. Tinel sign was negative at right popliteal fossa and the fibular head. Deep tendon reflex at right ankle was absent.\n\n【15】Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography were conducted.

Needle electromyography showed increased insertional activity, variable of spontaneous activity and impairment of recruitment at right biceps femoris (long and short heads), gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, tensor fascia latae and tibialis anterior muscles. There were normal insertional activity and no sign of spontaneous activity at right rectus femoris and paravertebral L5 level muscles ( Table 2 ). This result was summarized to right lumbosacral plexopathies.

However, patients with femoral fracture may have suffered injury to lumbosacral plexus \\[ 6 \\]. Patients with lumbosacral plexopathies present frequently with foot drop and numbness or paresthesia in the lateral leg and the dorsum of foot which should be differentiated from sciatic neuropathy. Neurological findings of lumbosacral plexopathies include not only weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion but there also is variable weakness of the gluteus and hamstring muscles. The hallmarks of electrodiagnostic study for lumbosacral plexopathies are spontaneous activity in peroneal, tibial, sciatic, superior gluteal and inferior gluteal innervated muscles. The motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of an affected lower limb reveal diminished or no electrical response \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【23】This report showed lumbosacral plexopathies from uncommon cause: femoral fracture. The causes of lumbosacral plexopathies in this patient may be a result of high speed deceleration injuries sustained in vehicle accidents. Due to the relatively clinical presentations of lumbosacral plexopathies and peripheral nerve lesion, electrodiagnostic study is an important key for confirm diagnosis.\n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】Diagnosis of lumbosacral plexopathies is difficult to differentiate between a lumbosacral plexus and peripheral nerve lesion. When careful neurological examination is combined with an electrodiagnostic study, a number of lumbosacral plexopathies may be increased.

Impaction of the lower second molar is a rare condition, but when it occurs it may present a clinical problem for the orthodontist and oral surgeon. Unilateral impaction of the mandibular second molar is more common than bilateral impaction. They are found more often in men than in women and more frequently on the right side than on the left as a mesially inclined \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【3】During the last decade, the introduction of miniscrews for immediate loading has changed the clinical and biomechanical approach to the orthodontic problems. Gelgor et al \\[ 4 \\], Lee et al \\[ 5 \\], Park et al \\[ 6 \\], and Giancotti et al \\[ 7 \\] have shown the use of titanium miniscrews for immediate loading as an alternative anchorage system and discussed possible sites of insertion. Park et al reported molar uprighting by means of microimplant anchorage in patients with mesially tipped second molars due to the loss of the adjacent first molar \\[ 8 \\]. Using titanium miniscrews as absolute anchorage offers several advantages and can aid in achieving an optimal treatment outcome \\[ 7 \\]. Freudenthaler et al inserted 12 titanium bicortical screws horizontally as anchorage for mandibular molar protraction in 8 patients \\[ 8 \\]. The low frequency of mesially impacted second molars has kept the clinical significance of this anomaly quite low \\[ 9 \\]. Therefore, little information is available in the dental literature. Surgical treatment is often recommended \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【4】But, orthodontic uprighting may be a better alternative, with a lower risk to the tooth. The aim of this article is to describe our experience that is using of removable appliance with uprighting spring and miniscrew, respectively.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】A 15-year-old boy was referred for orthodontic consultation and treatment. Clinical examination revealed Class I interarch relationship ( Fig. 1a, b ). Examination of the orthopantomograph revealed the presence of all permanent teeth, including developing third molars. The mandibular left permanent second molar were tipped mesially and obliquely impacted under the distal bulge of the permanent first molars. The developing mandibular third molar buds were on top of distal roots of the second molars ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Pre-treatment cast photographs of a 15-year-old male patient (a, b)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【9】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Pre-treatment panoramic radiograph of the patient._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】The treatment plan was gaining of the tooth to dental arch. Under local anesthesia, the impacted mandibular left second molar was surgically exposed and the mucoperiosteum reflected just enough to expose the distobuccal cusp of the tooth. At the same time, the tooth was carefully etched, with due consideration for prevention of soft tissue injury. In spite of the difficulty in controlling moisture, a button was bonded and a ligature wire bended top of the button. Two weeks later, a removable appliance with an uprighting spring that aim of distal uprighting of tooth, was fixed mouth and used two months. The uprighting spring was made up of 0.8 mm stainless wire ( Fig. 3 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** The removable appliance with an uprighting spring._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】After using of uprighting spring, a mini screw made of pure medical titanium was used for buccal and vertical uprighting. The miniscrew had 1.8 mm diameter and 8 mm lengths (Dewimed, Tuttlingen). The screw was inserted under local anesthesia and implanted into buccal side of between the first and second maxillary left molar’s roots. When occlusal surface of second molar appear, a hook made 0.016 × 0.022’’ stainless wire was adhered. After initial healing of the soft tissue around the mini screw (after 1 week) an elastic chain (3/16, 4 oz.) was applied between the buccal mini screw and the wire on the occlusal surface of mandibular second molar ( Fig. 4 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** The buccal mini screw for extrusion of lower left second molar._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】The patient was scheduled for follow-ups every 2 weeks to control anchorage and the movements of the impacted teeth. The hook was changed according to movement of the tooth. After two months, elastic chain altered (3/16, 6 oz.).\n\n【19】5 months after the beginning of treatment, a satisfactory lower second molar inclination was achieved ( Fig. 5 ). At the eighth month, a corrected inclination of the impacted molars was obtained, and was confirmed on the post-treatment panoramic radiograph ( Fig. 6 ) and intraoral photograph ( Fig. 7 ). It was understood that there was no need any orthodontic treatment for this patient.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** The panoramic radiograph 5 months after the beginning of treatment._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 6.** The post-treatment panoramic radiograph of the patient._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【23】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 7.** Post-treatment intraoral photograph of the patient._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】The proper time to treat the impactions is when the patient is 11 - 14 years old, during early adolescence, when the second molar root formation is still incomplete and before complete development of mandibular third molars \\[ 9 \\]. In the present case, the patient was 15 years old, the second molar root formation was incomplete and the third molar was not completely developed.\n\n【28】Mesial inclination of the impacted mandibular second molar is much more common than distal inclination. In fact, most of the cases reported in the literature show the unerupted mandibular second molar mesially inclined in a oblique or horizontal position \\[ 3 \\]. It was reported inverted in only one case, with the crown directed toward the border of the mandible \\[ 11 \\]. There are many different treatment options in the literature \\[ 9 , 12 \\]. The significant advantage of orthodontic uprighting technique is the distal tipping and uprighting of the impacted tooth without the necessity of surgical assistance, bone removal or splinting. In the case presented two systems for uprighting were combined. One of them is removable appliance with uprighting springs for distal movement of the molars, another is miniscrew for buccal and vertical movement of it. By using this method, impacted molars will upright within 4 - 8 months.\n\n【29】Advantages of the method: 1), Because of the use of light and intermittent force will minimize the side effect on the anchor molars; 2), Although surgical uprighting of impacted mandibular second molar appear to be a quick and easy procedure, orthodontic uprighting techniques are more advantageous and offer a better long term prognosis with no adverse pulpal or periodontal risk to the tooth or supporting structures; 3), Using of removable appliance with uprighting spring provides distal movement of the mandibular second molar, especially. However, the elastic chain is fixed between the wire on the occlusal surface of mandibular second molar and miniscrew in upper jaw posterior area, transverse plane result in buccal tipping of impacted molar crown and lingual tipping of root of impacted molar and vertical plane result extrusion of the tooth; 4), The appliance eliminated the need for any application other teeth.\n\n【30】Disadvantages of the method: 1) This method is a complex to upright full impacted second molars; 2) A hygienic mouth was not provided by patient; 3) This method can be completely inefficient if the patient cooperation with removable appliance and intermaxillary elastics is poor.\n\n【31】In conclusion, with early diagnosis and recognation of the potentially developing impaction, practitioners are alerted to initiate adequate corrective measures. Second molar impaction is a very difficult case that requires proper clinical, radiological and biomechanical management and a good appliance selection for successful treatment results.\n\n【32】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【33】None\n\n【34】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The resulting aganglionic segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction \\[ 1 \\]. HD is usually a congenital disorder, occurring in approximately one in 5000 live births, with an overall male: female ratio of 3:1 to 4:1\\[ 2 \\], however, roughly 5% of HD cases are diagnosed in the adult population; it is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic constipation in these individuals \\[ 3 , 4 \\], and a common presentation is with volvulus of a colonic segment.\n\n【3】We present a case of chronic constipation with a clinical history and radiologic findings \\[ 5 \\] which mimicked Hirschsprung Disease diagnosed in the adult as described by case reports and series by others \\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\].\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】Our subject is a 65 years old male, skilled nursing facility resident, with a history of schizoaffective disorder and chronic constipation, with a recent admission to our institution one month prior with bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid volvulus. The patient was surgically managed by subtotal colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis with an uneventful hospital course and was safely discharged. On present admission, one month later, he returned with three episodes of projectile vomiting of food and bilious material. Review of systems was positive for constipation, chronic in nature for our subject, as well as nausea. Abdominal X-ray showed distended bowel loops with a non-specific pattern, given the patient's history a CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast was pursued ( Fig. 1 ), which showed massive dilation of the remaining rectum and Ileal loops filled with impacted stool. He was managed conservatively with rectal tube decompression of the bowel as well as an aggressive bowel regimen. The patient's presentation and imagery prompted us to review the literature and begin a workup for possible adult presentation of Hirschsprung Disease. Ano-rectal manometry demonstrated an absent recto-anal inhibitory reflex. From these suggestive findings we proceeded to perform a full thickness mucosal biopsy of the patient's remaining rectal mucosa, the gold standard diagnostic tool for HD \\[ 10 \\], which failed to show aganglionosis of the remaining rectal mucosa, therefore discarding Hirschsprung of our differential diagnoses.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Severely dilated rectum with impacted stool and fluid level._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】Our patient was treated symptomatically with an aggressive bowel regimen of stool softeners and bowel laxatives and he was again discharged safely to his skilled nursing facility.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Hirschsprung disease is a rare condition resulting in aganglionosis of the Meissner (submucosal) and Auerbach (myenteric) plexuses of the gut. In the majority of patients, the disorder affects a short segment of the distal colon, with a transition zone in the rectosigmoid colon. This condition was first described by Harald Hirschsprung in 1886 \\[ 11 \\]. The majority of patients with HD are diagnosed in the neonatal period \\[ 1 \\], and though adult onset HD was thought to be rare, Hirschsprung himself had suggested as early as 1900, that the disease was not confined to children and several cases of adult HD have been reported since then \\[ 12 \\]. About 5% of patients with less severe disease may not be diagnosed until early adulthood, most of them between the second and third decade of life, and are frequently misdiagnosed as chronic constipation \\[ 3 , 4 \\], these may not be truly diagnosed until an acute presentation with complications such as obstructive colitis, sigmoid volvulus or sub-acute obstructions \\[ 7 \\]. Several cases have been diagnosed after presenting with a volvulus of the gut \\[ 6 , 8 , 9 \\], likely due to an aganglionic segment of gut below the sigmoid colon and a freely mobile mesosigmoid \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【12】The above described clinical vignette in addition to manifest radiologic imagery similar to that described in the literature \\[ 5 \\] prompted the authors to consider Hirschsprung disease in the adult setting for this patient whose most likely problem is rather chronic constipation. Constipation is the most common digestive complaint in the general population \\[ 14 \\], with prevalence of 12 to 19 percent (average 15 percent) reported in most studies \\[ 15 \\]. It is of utmost importance to recognize and treat chronic constipation in a timely and effective fashion to avoid complications such as the ones described above. This can be especially relevant in patients with pervasive developmental disorders, psychiatric disorders, the elderly, or any other type of patient population which may not be able to express appropriately nor act upon such a common gastrointestinal complaint.\n\n【13】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【14】The authors state no conflict of interest for the crafting of this manuscript.

Moreover, liver test abnormalities may exist as a result of many diseases that occur coincidentally during pregnancy. The laboratory findings of each of these disorders are usually similar, ranging from elevated liver-related enzymes and cholestasis \\[ 1 \\]. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP) is a rare disorder with a prevalence of one in 1000 - 10,000 pregnancies. It is usually defined as cholestasis without other causes of biliary obstruction and liver dysfunction during the third trimester and, as a rule, it normally resolves following delivery \\[ 2 \\]. The ethiology of this disease has not been well established. One possible explanation is a gene variant of hepatocanalicular transport proteins and their regulators which affect the estrogen and progesterone mechanism \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【3】The diagnosis of IHCP is based on evidence of elevated serum bile acid concentrations (>11 mmol/L) and decreased glycine/taurine bile acid ratio (below 1.0) in connection with cholestasis and pruritis during the third trimester of pregnancy \\[ 5 \\]. To confirm the diagnosis, the coexistant diseases (e.g., viral hepatitis, autoimmune cholangitis, biliary tract disorders and systemic diseases) or medication use (e.g., herbal medicine) characterized by cholestasis should be promptly ruled out \\[ 6 \\]. HBe antigen negative pregnant patients with positive HBs antigen should be followed closely by means of ALT and HBV DNA testing and treated with antiviral agents once confirmation of hepatitis B flare during hypertransaminasemia is established \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【4】Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is a destructive autoimmune thyroiditis that begins within the first few months after delivery, 85% of patients with PPT have positive antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase typically begins primarily and may be followed by a hypothyroid phase. Abnormalities in thyroid function tests resolve in most patients \\[ 8 \\]. Very rarely, a flare of hepatitis B may be associated with IHCP. In such cases, a prompt diagnosis can be made hardly. Here we report the coexistence of IHCP with hepatitis B infection and the subsequent development of PPT and loss of hepatitis B antigen in a woman.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】A 29-year-old pregnant woman was referred to our hospital because of elevated liver-related enzymes. A diagnosis of hepatitis B had been made seven years earlier and she did not receive any therapy for Hepatitis B. She did not smoke, drink alcohol or use herbal medicine. The patient was born and lived in eastern Turkey. This was her first pregnancy and there was no history of abortion. Her mother had pregnancy-related cholestasis and died in her 60s. On physical examination, the vital signs were normal except for mild tenderness on her right upper quadrant with scleral subicterus.\n\n【8】Her blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg and she had a pulse of 90 beats per minute at a temperature of 36.6 °C. The patient’s hematologic values were within the normal limits. The laboratory results obtained were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase level, 125 U per liter (normal range, 0 to 42); alanine aminotransferase level, 225 U per liter (normal range, 0 to 47); alkaline phosphatase level, 700 U per liter (normal range, 42 to 140); gamma glutamyl transferase level, 350 U per liter (normal range, 5 to 60); and direct bilirubin level, 0.4 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0.0 to 0.4 mg per deciliter). The international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.0.\n\n【9】Her HBS antigen was positive but HBe and hepatitis delta antigens were negative. HBV-DNA level was 350,000 copies/ml. She tested negative for other causative agents of viral hepatitis. Autoimmune and metabolic liver disease markers were also negative. An ultrasonographic study of the abdomen revealed a viable fetus at 24 weeks of gestation and showed an enlarged liver which measured as 19 mm; the appearance of the liver was homogeneous, without gallbladder stones or biliary dilation. The pancreas was normal and there was no splenomegaly. Moreover, MRCP revealed no abnormality in the entire biliary tract as well as pancreatic duct. Medication at discharge included tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg/day with antipruritic skin gels. One month after discharge, she returned to the hepatology clinic due to worsening of pruritus especially during the night. When admitted for the second time, her HBV DNA level was negative but direct bilirubin levels as well as cholestatic enzymes were higher.\n\n【10】Her prothrombin time was normal. Serum bile acid concentration was measured as 47 mmol/L. A diagnosis of IHCP was made and while tenofovir disoproxil was continued, a treatment with UDCA (15 mg/kg per day) and topical emollients was started. Two weeks later, at a follow-up visit, the patient was comfortable, and her pruritus was resolved. Furthermore, levels of the conjugated bilirubin and liver-related enzymes were also normalized. Following the fourth week of delivery, she returned to the hospital due to inability to sleep and tremors.\n\n【11】Hormonal analysis revealed hyperthyroidism with higher CRP level and elevated titers of antithyroid antibodies. A thyroid ultrasonography showed paranchymal heterogeneity ( Fig. 1 ). On the basis of these findings, postpartum thyroiditis was diagnosed and a short course of beta-blocker was started. Four months later, a subsequent hypothyroidal phase developed and 0.05 mg of L-thyroxine daily was prescribed. Furthermore, 96 weeks later, loss of HBS antigen developed during tenofovir treatment. The patient is currently thriving in her normal medical state.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Paranchymal heterogenity on thyroid US._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】The case reported had a rare combination of different diseases. We considered firstly liver disorders occurring coincidentally with pregnancy such as a delta coinfection or a severe exacerbation of hepatitis B, since the patient had previously received a diagnosis of being a hepatitis B carrier, and the patient had HBs antigen and higher HBV DNA levels. Delta hepatitis was ruled out by a negative HDV RNA test. Diagnosing IHCP at the time of the patient’s initial presentation was done hardly because the moderate cholestasis can be seen in biliary disorders but it could also reflect a cholestatic variety of viral hepatitis \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【16】In this patient, co-morbidity, including autoimmune or metabolic liver diseases was also excluded by further biochemical and serologic methods. The therapy for hepatitis B in pregnant patients consists of nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. Tenofovir and telbivudine are listed by the FDA as pregnancy category B drugs \\[ 10 \\], of which the most commonly available is tenofovir disoproxil at a dose of 245 mg/day, which we used for the treatment of the discussed case.\n\n【17】Despite the evidence of treatment-related low levels of HBV DNA, moderately elevated transaminases and cholestatic enzymes and direct hyperbilirubinemia persisted and her pruritus worsened at the fifth week of the antiviral treatment. IHCP frequently causes cholestasis in the third trimester of pregnancy, with a mean presentation at 30 weeks gestation. Biochemical tests of patients typically show elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (two to four times the normal level) and conjugated bilirubin (< 5 mg/dL). Liver transaminases may also be elevated, but rarely higher than fourfold \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【18】Elevated levels of total serum bile acid concentrations are present in almost all patients with IHCP \\[ 5 \\] as was seen in our case. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 10 - 20 mg/kg per day) is the first-line treatment for IHCP \\[ 12 \\]. A cascade of persistent symptoms and biochemical features at the second admission were characteristic of IHCP, so we favored treatment with UDCA at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day. Symptomatic treatment for pruritus was also started. In this patient, reducing HBV DNA levels by maintaining tenofovir was a good therapeutic approach, so we continued the antiviral therapy.\n\n【19】PPT is an autoimmune disorder and develops within 2 to 6 months following delivery. Transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism may develop. High titers of antithyroid antibodies are almost always present. One of the hallmarks of PPT is a markedly depressed TSH level with a high free thyroxine level during the postpartum period. Hypothyroidism may develop in a minority of patients \\[ 13 \\]. TSH is a useful tool to detect postpartum thyroiditis and should be measured where possible in all patients post pregnancy. Therapy with levothyroxine sodium is indicated for patients with thyroid failure \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【20】Loss of serum HBS antigen is reported as final endpoint for the treatment of hepatitis B \\[ 15 \\]. In HBe antigen negative patients, tenofovir-induced loss of HBS antigen at week 48 was reported as 0% \\[ 16 \\]. At week 96, she also had a loss of HBS antigen with antibody seroconversion against hepatitis B surface antigen. In light of the presented case report, tenofovir disoproxil should be considered for the treatment of HBe antigen negative pregnant patients.\n\n【21】IHCP can also occur in pregnant hepatitis B patients. A high index of suspicion is necessary in order to diagnose IHCP, particularly in pregnant women who have a flare of hepatitis B. Furthermore, there may be a causal relationship between the IHCP and postpartum thyroiditis. These two disorders may share the same autoimmune ethiology.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This recognition not only identifies a sellar mass as a GH producing adenoma but expands the therapeutic alternatives. Sporadic reports in the relevant literature also describe “silent somatotroph adenomas” referring to adenomas that can be recognized as somatotroph adenomas’ by positive immunohistochemical staining for GH, but are not associated with clinical evidence of GH excess. Some of these adenomas are entirely silent, in that not associated with either clinical manifestations of GH excess or elevated serum concentrations of GH ad IGF1\\[ 1 \\- 5 \\]. Others are “clinically silent”; in terms of elevated GH and IGF1 serum concentrations but not accompanied by clinical manifestations of GH excess \\[ 2 , 6 \\- 14 \\]. The objective of this study was the data extracted in terms of histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of a silent somatotroph adenoma. Therefore, we reviewed clinical records and had the detailed analysis of the relevant morphologic information including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 22-year-old man presented in January 2011. 6 months before he started to have poor concentration, headache and recently he noticed visual acuity diminution. At physical examination there was right homonymous hemianopsia. Blood hormone levels were as follows: Growth hormone 0.5 ng/ml (normal < 5.0); insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) 274.9 ng/ml (48 - 255); prolactin 6.5 ng/ml (0 - 15); luteinizing hormone (LH) 2.5 mUI/ml (2 - 12); follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 1.7 mUI/ml (1 - 8); thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.0 mUI/ml (0.5 - 6.0), free thyroxin (T4) 1.0 ng/dl (0.8 - 1.8), and cortisol 14.9 mcg/ml (5 – 25). MRI disclosed a large tumor (6 cm ×6 cm) which occupied the sella, with invasion to the sphenoid sinus, left cavernous sinus and extension to the temporal lobe and suprasellar area, approximately 6 cm ×4 cm ( Fig. 1 A, B, C). There was hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the Foramen of Monro. He underwent a biventricular peritoneal shunt on February 7, 2011 and transsphenoidal surgery on February 22, 2011. Resection of the tumor in the sella was performed ( Fig. 1 D, E, F). At the immediate post operative period he presented with a seizure. CT disclosed obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography did not show vascular lesion and a VP shunt revision was done. He presented with right hemiparesis and aphasia probably due to vasospasm that improved during the following days. At 10 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day he complained of pain in the right leg. Right deep venous thrombosis was documented and an inferior cava filter was placed without complications. Postoperative MRI disclosed adequate resection of the tumor in the sella. After the pathology report of silent somatotroph adenoma an Octreoscan was performed that was positive ( Fig. 1G, H, I ). He started Octreotide 30 mg/month on April 2011. The last Octreoscan showed performed 3 months later showed 20% shrinkage in tumor size ( Fig. 1J, K, L ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Preoperative T1- weighed MRI with contrast enhancement (A: axial; B: coronal; C: sagittal.).

For immunohistochemistry the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method was used and antisera were directed against GH, PRL, ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH, as well as the alpha-SU of glycoprotein hormones. Methods of immunostaining, antibody sources and dilations have previously been described \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【10】Electron microscopy had also been performed for diagnostic purposes. For electron microscopy, tissues were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, processed through propylene oxide, and embedded in an Epon-araldite mixture.

Immunostainings demonstrated immunopositivity for GH in several unevenly distributed adenoma cells ( Fig. 3 ) and for PRL in occasional adenoma cells. Immunostaining were negative for ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH and alpha subunit. The Ki-67 nuclear labeling index using the MIB1 antibodies was estimated at 1%.

The roughly spherical nuclei had large dense nucleolus and very little fine granular heterochromatin. The cytoplasm contained well developed RER, less than abundant free polyribosomes, numerous small spherical mitochondria, and in many cells, a sizeable fibrous body consisting of a mixture of SER membranes and cytokeratin filaments ( Fig. 4 ). An obvious abnormality was the scarcity of the lean-looking inactive Golgi membranes usually noticeable only in cells without fibrous body ( Fig. 5 ). The peripherally located sparse minute secretory granules measure no more than 71 to 126 nm (mean: 87 nm).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** Typical tumor cells having large nucleus, prominent dense nucleolus, but very little heterochromatin (× 7000)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Electron micrograph depicting tumor cells containing collapsed inactive Golgi membrane, but no fibrous body was noted in Golgi area (×15000)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【24】* * *\n\n【25】Somatotroph adenomas in which there is laboratory and immunohistochemical evidence of GH excess in the absence of clinical manifestations of acromegaly were first reported in 1985 \\[ 6 \\]. It was observed that two women who had no clinical features of acromegaly but did have non-suppressible serum GH concentrations had pituitary adenoma that, after excision, showed immunohistochemical staining for GH. The term “clinically silent somatotroph adenoma” was first used 2 years later in describing three women with non-suppressible serum GH concentrations with no acromegaly and positive GH staining of the excised adenoma tissue \\[ 7 \\]. The largest previous series of clinically silent somatotroph adenomas described a total of 17 patients who had silent somatroph adenomas of which four were clinically silent \\[ 2 \\]. These four patients had no clinical manifestations of acromegaly but did have elevated basal serum GH concentrations that did not suppress after administration of glucose.\n\n【26】The explanation for the lack of clinical and laboratory manifestations of some somatotroph adenomas compared with the obvious manifestations in others, even though exhibit elevated GH and/or IGF-1 concentrations, is not clear \\[ 16 \\]. One of the possible explanations is a lesser duration of excessive GH secretion, but some reports describe these patients in whom excessive GH secretion has been properly documented for many years \\[ 11 , 18 \\]. The other explanation might be the ineffective secretion of GH or secretion of biologically inactive GH. These possibilities may explain by finding understandable elevation of serum IGF-1 in the patients with somatotrophinomas. On the other hand, in one series, due to 30% of patients with clinically silent adenomas had serum IGF-1 concentrations more than twice the upper limit of normal, the mean IGF-1 concentrations were higher in those patients categorized as classic and subtle than in those classified as clinically silent \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【27】So far, some genetic alterations has been documented which causing an increase in transcription, elevated mRNA levels, and an increased synthesis of the gene product \\[ 17 \\]. Moreover, human growth hormone genes were found to be hypomethylated in a somatotroph adenoma in contrast to nonadenomatous pituitary gland, suggesting that hypomethylation may explain the increased gene expression resulting in increased growth hormone excess found in some patients \\[ 17 \\]. Another possibility is that the tumors produced mostly an abnormal growth hormone that lacked immunoreactivity and biologic activity. A variety of growth hormones with restricted action has been reported \\[ 18 \\- 20 \\]. This data was not supported by in vitro studies. The adenoma cells may have secreted radioimmunoassay-able growth hormone in culture medium. The levels of growth hormone release initially were low in comparison with the endocrinologically active somatotroph adenomas. After several days, growth hormone release increased 10-fold, suggesting that growth hormone secretion may have been suppressed initially. After a week of culture, adenoma cells responded with increased growth hormone after GRH stimulation in vitro. It may be that the growth hormone mRNA translated in vivo to growth hormone synthesis in quantities necessary to significantly elevate serum growth hormone and cause acromegaly \\[ 21 \\]. Therefore, one or multiple steps of the formation or posttranslational processing of the gene might have been defective; these abnormalities may explain the clinical and biochemical silence associated with silent somatotroph adenomas.\n\n【28】In apparently silent somatotroph adenomas serum GH was within normal range, serum IGF-1 was elevated, GH positive cells were present and the patient was slightly acromegalic \\[ 22 \\]. In our case, unevenly distributed GH and local PRL reacting cells were demonstrated, unaccompanied by clinical manifestations of acromegaly, but only a mild IGF-1 elevation (274.9 ng/ml (48 - 225)) was present. Clinical data indicate that acromegaly develops slightly more often in males of middle age, whereas silent somatotroph adenomas are more common in females. The clinical significance of clinically nonfunctioning somatotroph adenomas is that in a certain percentage of patients, no other identifiable sellar mass is identified as a somatotroph adenoma unless just measurement of serum IGF-1 concentration.\n\n【29】Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) are widely distributed in various neuroendocrine cells; there are five subtypes of SSTR \\[ 23 \\- 27 \\]. Somatostatin analogs have been shown to directly inhibit growth hormone secretion and tumorigenesis in GH-secreting pituitary tumors through SSTR-2 and/or SSTR-5 \\[ 23 , 25 , 26 , 28 \\]. In some reports somatostatin has an anti-proliferative effect in pancreatic cells via activation of tyrosine phosphatase through SSTR1 \\[ 26 , 29 , 30 \\]. Additionally, it has an inhibitory effect on secretion of α-subunit and chromogranin from human non-functioning tumors \\[ 31 \\]. On the other hand, its effect on cell viability of human non-functioning pituitary adenomas is unclear \\[ 32 \\]. Following his Octreoscan which proved to be positive, our case received Octreotide for his medical treatment. However, the effectiveness of somatostatin treatment for silent somatroph adenoma is controversial. Therefore, both SSTR profile and drug efficacy definitely needs further clarification.\n\n【30】In summary, more work is needed to resolve the molecular occurrences responsible for the inconsistency between the diverse morphologic criteria and endocrine activity of silent somatotroph adenomas.\n\n【31】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

But in our patient the speed is unprecedented in which complete vena cava thrombosis (VCT) occurred within 24 h of insertion at the site of the IVCF and below. This complete VCT is a rare cause of acute refractory hypotension and a delay in its diagnosis resulted in high volume fluid resuscitation, high dose vasopressors utilization and early complication of phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD).\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 67-year-old man presented with a newly diagnosed stage T4aN3bM0 gastric adenocarcinoma. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and coronary artery disease with bypass surgery 3 years prior to this admission. He was employed as a park manager and an ex-smoker with a 35-pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use. There was no significant family history of medical illnesses. While awaiting elective curative intent surgery, he developed gastric outlet obstruction and melena stools. He was transferred to our tertiary center for an urgent subtotal gastrectomy. A repeat staging CT scan for the abdomen and chest 30 days after his initial CT scan revealed new findings of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The gastric outlet obstruction and the presence of extensive regional lymphadenopathy were also confirmed.\n\n【6】In preparation for his upcoming surgery and presence of new PE, an IVCF was inserted pre-operatively by interventional radiology via a right internal jugular vein access. Due to ongoing melena stools, heparin was not prescribed post-IVCF insertion. Bilateral lower limb ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A peripherally inserted central catheter was inserted 1 day prior to the IVCF placement and parenteral nutrition was subsequently started. Twenty-four hours after IVCF placement, the patient developed sudden-onset hypotension and diaphoresis, his heart rate was 125 beats/min, blood pressure was 60/40 mm Hg, and his oxygen saturation was unreadable. He had good air entry bilaterally, a soft non-tender abdomen, and denied chest pain or shortness of breath. The patient was given 1 L bolus of lactate ringer’s solution and transferred urgently to the ICU. The patient continued to be hypotensive in the ICU and required large volume fluid resuscitation supplemented with vasopressors, norepinephrine and vasopressin ( Fig. 1 ). A point-of-care echocardiogram performed in the ICU demonstrated a hyperdynamic left ventricle with no sign of right ventricular strain to suggest worsening PE. After initial fluid resuscitation with 8 L of crystalloid, the patient had a measured central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. After instituting vasopressor therapy, his CVP remained low at 5 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, with a stroke volume variation (SVV) between 33% and 55% consistent with ongoing hypovolemia.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Twenty-eight hours hemodynamic monitoring for mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg), heart rate (HR, beats/min), central venous pressure (CVP, cm H2O) and cumulative fluid resuscitation (L)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】During his first 18 h in the ICU, he received a total of 20 L of crystalloid; however, he remained refractory to weaning from norepinephrine (maximum 15 μg/min), vasopressin (2.4 U/h) and phenylephrine (200 μg/min). During these events, the patient remained chest pain free, alert and oriented, denying dyspnea, abdominal pain or confusion. His oxygenation was maintained on 2 L by nasal prong, and his heart rate was between 110 and 120 beats/min. His only complaint was that his legs were increasingly painful and swollen. He had no evidence of bleeding or worsening hematemesis. Nasogastric output was 4 L over the course of 24 h.\n\n【10】The patient was pan cultured, and given intravenous stress-dose steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible septic shock. An urgent abdomen/pelvis CT scan without IV contrast was performed, and reported as unremarkable. Throughout the night as he received repeated fluid boluses, his lower limbs became cool, edematous, and exceedingly painful. His pulses remained palpable. The next morning due to his worsening lower limb tenderness and pallor, plastic surgery was consulted to rule out compartment syndrome. His compartment pressures were 15 and 17 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O at the high end of normal. During morning rounds, the possibility of IVCF occlusion causing refractory hypotension was brought up. On re-examination of the abdomen/pelvis CT scan by the radiology consultant, a completely collapsed IVC above the IVCF was seen. The IVC below the IVCF was distended, as were the common and external iliac veins bilaterally concerning for extensive venous thrombosis ( Fig. 2a, b, c ). An urgent lower limb Doppler ultrasound confirmed extensive bilateral lower limb DVT. The patient was taken emergently to interventional radiology for catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A bilateral common femoral venogram confirmed extensive thrombus throughout both femoral, iliac veins and the entire IVC below the filter. The patient received catheter-directed tPA pulse sprayed via long infusion catheters placed bilaterally and underwent maceration of clot by spinning a 5 French pigtail catheter. An overnight localized tPA infusion was started via the 30 cm right and 20 cm left infusion catheters with overlap in the IVC. A modified systemic heparin infusion was also instituted aiming for an aPTT of 50 - 70 s consistent with local institution thrombolysis procedures. The tPA infusion was initially set at a total 2 mg/h which was reduced after 2 h instead at 6 h to 1 mg/h due to the onset of melena and hematuria from a traumatic Foley catheter insertion. After overnight tPA infusion, further pulse spray with tPA, mechanical maceration of clot with pigtail catheter and mechanical suction of clot was performed via long bilateral 12 French sheaths.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** (a) Patient IVC below IVC filter (arrow).

Due to blood loss during thrombolysis, the patient required transfusion of 4 Units PRBC. Twenty-four hours after initiation of thrombolysis, a recheck by interventional radiology revealed resolution of the right sided iliac and femoral clot, but ongoing left-sided common iliac vein occlusion that was likely more chronic, based on collaterals ( Fig. 3a, b, c ). The IVC continued to show a large non-occlusive thrombus in the filter itself but the remainder had cleared. The patient was continued on therapeutic intravenous heparin without further localized tPA and subsequently received surgical resection of his gastric cancer 8 days post-IVCF thrombus formation. He was transferred to the general surgery floor from the ICU with no recurrence of hemodynamic compromise during the remainder of his admission.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** (a) Post-IVC filter insertion, with no evidence of thrombus.

The patient’s SVV suggested hypovolemia and his hemodynamic indices would temporarily respond to fluid resuscitation; however; despite receiving more than 20 L of crystalloid, the improvement in hemodynamics was only transient. The patient was treated for possible severe sepsis, and other causes for his refractory hypotension were entertained. We also considered a diagnosis of vasoplegia, but the patient did not have any history suggesting treatment with antihypertensive medications, drug overdose, electrolyte disturbances such as severe hypermagnesemia, anaphylaxis, severe systolic dysfunction with LVEF < 35%, or chronic liver disease \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The CT scan showed evidence of significant IVC thrombus. Thus, given his bedside echo that did not support a diagnosis of massive PE, it became clear that his hypotension was due to reduced venous return resulting in markedly inadequate preload. The fact that such rapid and extensive thrombus formation occurred after IVCF insertion is unusual.\n\n【18】IVCFs are used to prevent PE in the presence or absence of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) \\[ 3 \\]. Often, IVCFs are used when there is contraindication to systemic anticoagulation and an ongoing risk for PE \\[ 3 \\]. In the short term, the benefit of preventing life-threatening PE is thought to outweigh the risk of new thrombus generation. One single center review found that the prevalence of VCT occurred in only 2.7% of patients \\[ 4 \\]. But a retrospective study examining the incidence of VCT after IVCF placement reported a 22% incidence over a median follow-up of 24 months, compared to 7% in the group who did not receive IVCF \\[ 5 \\]. The average time between IVCF placement and VCT was 6.4 months (range 2 - 26 months) \\[ 5 \\]. In most instances, VCT occurred after cessation of anticoagulation treatment and most were asymptomatic; however, two VCT-related fatalities presented with PCD and abdominal compartment syndrome \\[ 5 \\]. Also IVCF has been subject to one randomized controlled trial evaluating thrombosis rate reduction. A statistically significant reduction of PE at the 12-day mark was observed with IVCF insertion compared with anticoagulation alone; however, this effect was lost upon follow-up at 2 years \\[ 6 \\]. Furthermore, all patients in the study received anticoagulation, and in addition for those who received an IVCF had a significantly higher risk of recurrent lower limb DVT at 2-year follow-up, with no difference in 2-year mortality rate \\[ 6 \\]. It is known IVCFs are thrombogenic. One review reported IVC thrombosis rates of 3.6-11.2% and insertion-site thrombosis of 23-36% \\[ 7 \\]. In our patient, extensive thrombi formation from the IVCF to both lower extremities occurred after IVCF placement, as initial bilateral leg Doppler ultrasound on admission was negative. Our patient also had newly diagnosed, untreated gastric cancer. Malignancy is associated with an increased risk of VTE. A prospective database examining gastric cancer patients in a Korean center found a 2-year cumulative incidence of VTE after diagnosis of 3.8% in stage III patients \\[ 8 \\]. The 2-year incidence of DVT/PE was 0.8% for stage II-IV (M0) patients. DVT/PE was a significant predictor of earlier death in these patients \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【19】Our patient developed refractory hypovolemic shock within 24 h of IVCF insertion, which required large volume fluid resuscitation, which may have resulted in early PCD. PCD was first described in 1593 when DVT would result in venous gangrene \\[ 10 \\]. Historically it has a reported 20-40% mortality rate \\[ 10 \\]. Nearly 300 years later it is recognized as resulting from massive occlusion of large and small caliber veins \\[ 10 \\]. It is a rare complication of DVT thought to occur from a dysregulation between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Clinically, patients experience the acute onset of cyanosis starting distally, significant pain, edema and bullae, eventually resulting in loss of arterial pulses and sensation, paralysis, and venous gangrene, necessitating amputation \\[ 10 \\]. We suggest that in our patient, given his expeditious localized thrombolysis, thrombus maceration and aspiration, the severe symptoms and fatality of PCD did not occur.\n\n【20】The exact mechanisms and pathophysiology of PCD are still unclear. The most often quoted paper from 1967 examined the hemodynamics involved in massive peripheral venous occlusion in six anesthetized canines. This study found that within 6 h of sudden and extensive femoral and iliac vein occlusion, venous hypertension of the involved limb occurred. This led to elevated tissue pressures and extravasation of fluid from the venous system into the surrounding tissue due to disruption of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures. The ongoing fluid accumulation into the interstitial space increased tissue pressures and limb volume, and led to significant hypovolemia which briefly responded to fluid resuscitation. After 24 h of extensive venous occlusion, the hydrostatic pressure in two animals was 40 mm Hg and 52 mm Hg. Iliac flow was lost at that point and absent arterial pulse was also noted \\[ 12 \\]. It is postulated that initially venous collaterals are able to maintain adequate arterial tissue perfusion thus preventing tissue ischemia and gangrene. Progressively, arterial flow becomes more compromised, leading to loss of peripheral pulses, then peripheral limb ischemia and gangrene. Case reports have shown that patients can accumulate up to 6 - 10 L of fluid within their lower limb tissue within 5 - 10 days \\[ 13 \\]. Our patient’s worsening lower leg pain, pallor and edema suggest that venous hypertension and extravasation of fluid from his lower venous system occur, resulting in profoundly diminished preload and his seemingly refractory hypovolemic shock. This hypothesis is also supported by the immediate improvement in his hemodynamics once thrombolysis, clot maceration and removal occurred.\n\n【21】The treatment of extensive VCT and/or PCD includes surgical thrombectomy, percutaneous manual aspiration thrombectomy \\[ 14 \\], catheter-directed and systemic thrombolysis, which is most widely used \\[ 16 \\]. The first case using thrombolytics in the treatment of PCD was published in 1970 \\[ 15 \\]. More recently, thrombolytic therapy has been suggested to be curative of PCD compared to surgical thrombectomy. A prospective multicenter trial evaluated catheter-directed thrombolysis and found higher rates of clot lysis achieved with locally directed urokinase or tPA than anticoagulation alone \\[ 16 \\]. However, high rates of major bleeding (11%) prevent this option from being used widely \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【22】**Conclusion**\n\n【23】The placement of IVCF in a patient with known malignancy may greatly increase the risk for additional thrombus formation. But in our patient the speed is unprecedented in which complete VCT occurred at the site of the IVCF and below and its mechanism of causing refractory hypotension is rare. The consideration of PCD in a patient with refractory hypovolemic shock post-IVCF insertion with aggressive fluid resuscitation and worsening lower limb pain and discoloration remains a rare but important differential diagnosis.\n\n【24】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The benefits of reperfusion therapy and dual antiplatelet therapy have been clearly demonstrated \\[ 2 \\]. In the literature on perioperative use of antiplatelet agents is a warning signal when prescribed for secondary prevention after MI or coronary stenting. Besides, studies showed a high risk of MACEs if a non-cardiac surgery was performed early after coronary stenting especially less than two to six weeks \\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]. We present a case diagnosed as acute hemorrhagic and necrosis cholecystitis on the 7th day after coronary stenting for acute MI especially she has been receiving aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】A 66-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of palpitation and sweating for one hour after activities. She had a history of hypertension for 10 years and cerebral infarction for 5 years. Besides she received bowel resection for intestinal obstruction 30 years ago.According to the symptom, electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, the diagnosis was acute inferior, posterior and right ventricular MI \\[ 6 \\]. Emergency coronary angiography showed the proximal of right coronary artery occlusion completely and we placed a drug-eluting stent there. Then she was admitted to coronary care unit, where continuous infusion of tirofiban, a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor, (0.1 µg/kg/min) for 72 hours, oral clopidogrel (75 mg/d) plus aspirin (100 mg/d), subcutaneous fragmin 6150AXaIU/12 hours.\n\n【6】Six days later, she shivered violently and the body temperature rose to 39.4 °C. Laboratory test showed the leukocyte count of 13.36 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, the neutrophil account for 91.9%. On the 7th day, she shivered again with the temperature rose to 40.8 °C. Physical examination was normal except for right upper abdominal tenderness. Abdominal ultrasonography showed gallstone and acute cholecystitis ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Abdominal ultrasonography shows gallstone and acute cholecystitis: the size of gallbladder is 10.3 cm × 4.6 cm, slightly larger gallbladder with gallbladder wall thickening, and hypoechoic gallbladder._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the first choice for most cholecystitis patients \\[ 7 \\]. For severe acute cholecystitis, urgent management of organ dysfunction and severe local inflammation by cholecystectomy should be carried out \\[ 7 \\]. For this patient, surgery can remove the focus of infection fundamentally. Given she had suffered from acute MI 7 days ago especially she had been receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, she had a high risk of MACEs, bleeding and other adverse events during the perioperative period of cholecystectomy. Besides she received bowel resection 30 years ago, open cholecystectomy would be necessary. An emergency open cholecystectomy was performed that daywith no blood transfusion. The pathological conclusion was acute hemorrhagic and necrosis cholecystitis and inflammation of gallbladder surrounding tissues ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Microscopy (× 400) of histology of gallbladder shows a large number of neutrophils exudation in all layers of gallbladder wall with varying degrees of tissue necrosis, vascular congestion, neutrophils adherence and extensive hemorrhage in the gallbladder wall._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【11】After the operation, we prescribed fragmin 6150AXaIU/12 hours with no aspirin or clopidogrel. The drainage was 100 mL and 30 mL respectively on the first two days and the drainage tube was removed on the third day. One day later, clopidogrel (75 mg/d) and aspirin (100 mg/d) was reinstituted. She was discharged on the 8th day after operation without MACEs or surgery complications with a follow-up at the cardiology department for one year.\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】There is no literature about cholecystectomy early after acute MI. An increased risk of MACEs for non-cardiac surgery early after coronary stenting has been suggested and the most important reason is stent thrombosis \\[ 3 \\- 5 , 8 \\]. It is reported that the mortality was 32% in patients subjected to surgery less than 2 weeks from coronary stenting \\[ 3 \\]. Among the 40 patients, 2 of them underwent cholecystectomy with no MACEs. Wilson and associates found the increased risk persisted for 6 weeks and the mortality was 4.8% \\[ 4 \\]. Among the 207 patients studied, 2 of them underwent abdominal surgery less than 6 weeks and both suffered from MACEs. Reddy and Vaitkus reviewed all the 56 cases of coronary stenting with subsequent surgery, 8 developed MACEs with none when surgery performed after 6 weeks \\[ 5 \\]. Schouten and associates found in patients undergoing early surgery, discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period maybe a major cause of increasing in MACEs, mainly result from stent thrombosis \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【15】In conclusion, whenever possible non-cardiac surgery should be postponed to 6 weeks after coronary stenting \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Emergency surgery is an alternative method for acute MI patient accompanied by acute necrosis cholecystitis and sepsis. Further prospective clinical studies are needed to define whether surgeries can be performed safely with minimum interruption or continuous of antiplatelet therapy for acute MI patients.\n\n【16】**Grant**\n\n【17】No.\n\n【18】**Conflict of Interest**\n\n【19】The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【20】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The epidermis was not involved and was separated by a narrow Grenz zone. The neoplastic cells were reactive for CD4, CD56 and CD45RA and negative for CD20, CD3, CD8, TdT, CD34, and CD117.

Bilateral bone marrow biopsy was negative for neoplasm. Patient was treated with six cycles of pralatrexate and during his second complete remission underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant with BEAM (carmustine (BCNU), etoposide, Ara-C (cytarabine), and melphalan) conditioning. He remained without evidence of cutaneous disease at 160 days status post autologous stem cell transplant when he developed pancytopenia which prompted bone marrow biopsy that demonstrated progression to acute leukemia with 77% blasts along with circulating blasts in peripheral blood at 30 months since initial diagnosis of BPDN ( Fig. 1G, H ). By flow cytometric analysis, blasts were positive for CD4, CD7 (dim), CD56, CD33, CD117, HLA-DR, and TdT (partial) and negative for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD8, CD34, and myeloperoxidase.

The patient reported multiple other complications due to chemotherapy including bilateral humeral head osteonecrosis, bilateral distal femoral osteonecrosis, peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy, and a bowel perforation requiring partial resection and ileostomy. The patient was intermittently wheelchair bound on the basis of her hip pathology, superimposed upon the ataxia secondary to her peripheral motor neuropathy. Over the preceding months both hips had become persistently symptomatic with moderate pain on a daily basis, with a corresponding significant reduction in function and difficulty with ambulation.\n\n【3】On examination the patient demonstrated an ataxic gait with hyper tonicity of the lower limb musculature and a foot drop. X-ray and MRI evaluation demonstrated significant avascular segments of both femoral heads with articular collapse (Steinberg stage 5C right side, Steinberg 4C left) ( Fig. 1 ). Avascular necrosis of the left acetabulum was also noted. Surgical intervention for the hips was delayed due to the high risk of infection related to her ongoing chemotherapy and the presence of an ileostomy. Non-operative therapy included intravenous bisphosphonate infusions and symptomatic measures for analgesia.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** MRI of pelvis showing avascular segments of femoral heads (2008)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Upon review at 15.5 years of age, progressive collapse of both femoral heads was noted on serial radiographs. The patient at this time also reported increasing pain about the lateral aspect of her right knee with radiographic evidence of osteonecrosis of the lateral femoral condyle ( Fig. 2 , 3 ). Drill decompression of the lateral condyle segment was conducted; however, the right knee continued to deteriorate with increasing pain, progressive stiffness, instability, and mechanical symptoms. A knee X-ray five months after the decompression procedure demonstrated progressive collapse of the right lateral femoral condyle ( Fig. 4 ). Subsequent arthroscopy confirmed significant disruption of the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle, with the remaining articular surfaces remaining relatively well preserved. Arthroscopic debridement with removal of loose bodies was conducted as an interim measure. The right knee joint, however, remained persistently symptomatic and treatment by bulk osteochondral allograft was recommended.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** X-ray (weight-bearing) of AP and Lateral right knee (May 2010)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 3.** MRI of right knee showing areas of osteonecrosis (May 2010)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 4.** X-ray AP and Lateral of right knee post drilling procedure (Oct 2010)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】The patient, by now 17 years of age, also described increasing symptoms attributable to both hip joints. Chemotherapy had been ceased 16 months prior and no recurrence of leukaemia was detected on bone marrow aspirates. The ileostomy had been reversed and the peripheral neuropathy almost completely resolved. Considering the marked pain and significant disability resulting from the osteonecrosis of both femoral heads, bilateral total hip arthroplasty was also recommended.\n\n| **Surgical Technique** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【14】* * *\n\n【15】Preoperative imaging demonstrated the posterior and inferior aspect of the right femoral head was relatively unaffected by avascular necrosis with an overall shape potentially suitable for bulk osteochondral reconstruction of the lateral femoral condyle. A provisional surgical plan was made to proceed with right total hip arthroplasty and simultaneous osteochondral reconstruction of the right lateral femoral condyle, if the resected femoral head was judged to be suitable for auto-grafting. This procedure was preceded by left total hip arthroplasty by a direct anterior inter-muscular approach; however, the left femoral head was considered unsuitable for use in osteochondral auto-grafting on the basis of global articular surface damage.\n\n【16】Two weeks after left total hip replacement the patient underwent right total hip arthroplasty via a direct anterior intermuscular approach. Particular care was made during dislocation of the joint and resection of the femoral neck to avoid damage to the posterior and inferior portion of the femoral head. The femoral head was found to have undamaged cartilage surfaces in the inferior aspect with good quality sub-articular bone ( Fig. 5 ), and judged suitable to proceed with the proposed knee joint reconstruction procedure. A second surgical team prepared the graft while the total hip arthroplasty procedure was completed.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 5.** Right femoral head with undamaged cartilage on inferior aspect._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Exposure of the right knee was achieved through a mid-line incision and a medial para-patellar arthrotomy ( Fig. 6 ). The involved areas of the lateral femoral condyle were resected, resulting in a trapezoidal defect of 15 mm <sup>2 </sup> ; native bone was retained where viable, creating a vascular bed of cancellous bone ( Fig. 7 ). The trapezoidal shape of the resection facilitated primary stability of the bulk auto-graft; the graft was prepared to best match the shape of the osteochondral defect. The intact articular surface of the femoral head was unfortunately discontinuous, and the autograft was therefore harvested in two distinct sections ( Fig. 8 ). To reproduce the relatively elliptical contour of the distal femoral articular surface compared to the spherical femoral head, an incomplete osteotomy of the autograft fragments was conducted to the level of subchondral bone ( Fig. 9 ). The thickness of the auto-graft was maintained at a minimum of 10 mm throughout. After graft impaction and final seating, internal fixation was performed using multiple headless compression screws ( Fig. 10 ). Very satisfactory patello-femoral tracking and coronal plane stability of the knee was confirmed after completion of the procedure, prior to closure.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 6.** Exposure of lateral femoral condyle._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 7.** Resection of avascular bone from lateral femoral condyle._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【23】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 8.** Shaped autograft sections from femoral head._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【25】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 9.** Reproduction of the desired elliptical contour of the lateral condyle._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【27】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 10.** Fixation of the autograft into position using headless compression screws._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【29】  \n\n【30】Postoperative rehabilitation included immediate full weight-bearing on the left hip arthroplasty. The right knee and hip underwent a graduated program of protected activity with touch weight bearing for a period of six weeks, progressing to partial weight bearing for a further six weeks. Early knee range of motion exercises were permitted as tolerated without restriction. Seven weeks after the procedure both hips were pain free; the right knee demonstrated a 15° fixed flexion deformity, and flexion had returned to greater than 130°. At six months post surgery the knee exhibited full extension and flexion to 150°, with only a mild ache on prolonged walking.\n\n【31】At 12 months post-operative both hips remained pain free and radiographs demonstrated the hip implants were stable and well osseo-integrated ( Fig. 11 ). The Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) results improved from 37.4/100 (pre-operatively) to 100/100 (post-operatively), and the Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS) improved from 40/84 to 72/84. The right knee was causing only very minor and occasional discomfort about the medial aspect. There was no effusion and the range of motion was almost equal to the contralateral side, with full extension and flexion to 160° ( Fig. 12 ). The Knee Outcome Score (KOS) 12 months after the procedure was 113/125. On further physical examination the knee remained stable to varus/valgus stress, patellar tracking was unremarkable, and there was no demonstrable ligamentous instability. Radiographs of the right knee confirmed the bulk osteochondral autograft had united completely and remained viable, with no evidence of necrosis, loss of reduction, or change in position of the hardware ( Fig. 13 ). The knee joint surfaces appeared smooth, with a contour very closely approximating normal.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 11.** Postoperative AP pelvis x-ray._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【33】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 12.** Full extension and flexion of right knee._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【35】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 13.** Postoperative AP and Lateral right knee x-rays._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【38】* * *\n\n【39】This young woman initially presented with a polyarticular osteonecrosis as a complication of the chemotherapy used in the management of her acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). During the course of her management, she developed marked symptoms involving both hips and one knee after the articular surfaces of both femoral heads and the right knee lateral femoral condyle all collapsed, resulting in significant pain and disability. For this particular case a novel technique was employed, cognizant of the various limitations imposed by the number of joints involved, the nature and size of the lesions, the patients age, and the difficulties inherent in procuring a suitable fresh osteochondral allograft. We chose to reconstruct the articular surface of the knee using a fresh osteochondral autograft harvested from the ipsilateral femoral head during a simultaneous total hip arthroplasty, a technique we believe to be novel and unique.\n\n【40】After failing non-operative measures, management options would generally include arthroplasty, arthrodesis, and osteochondral grafting, either allograft or autograft. Multiple factors would influence this decision, including which joint is involved, the size of the lesion, bilaterality, the age of the patient, and the number of joints involved. Further factors may include specific considerations such as patient expectations, anticipated demands, and the surgeons training and experience.\n\n【41】In such a young patient the treatment options are further limited, and definitive reconstruction by joint arthroplasty may be considered less palatable. Total hip replacement is generally regarded as the most consistent and predictable arthroplasty, with the greatest potential for adequate longevity to warrant the considerable risks associated. In this patient the polyarticular nature, female gender, and bilaterality all precluded hip arthrodesis as an option, and we elected to manage her hip pathology with bilateral uncemented total hip replacements. Bulk osteochondral grafting of the lateral femoral condylar lesion was our preferred option.\n\n【42】In this case, fresh osteochondral auto-grafting enabled rapid osseous integration and articular surface reconstruction using living host cartilage, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome. Although uncommon, concurrent avascular necrosis of multiple large joints is occasionally encountered, and management options are particularly limited in young patients. We recommend this innovative method be considered in those patients who satisfy the criteria for bulk osteochondral grafting procedures where total hip replacement is also required.\n\n【43】While this procedure would be suitable to perform using any preferred surgical approach, we believe the use of an anterior inter-muscular approach has particular advantages in complex cases such as this to facilitate more rapid rehabilitation. In this situation, after 2 weeks our patient had recovered sufficiently from her left hip replacement to proceed with her combined right hip and knee procedure and safely mobilise touch weight bearing in the immediate postoperative period. Performing the right hip procedure by the anterior approach further assisted in her rehabilitation following her combined procedures.\n\n【44】Corticosteroids are used routinely as part of the chemotherapy treatment regimen for many neoplastic conditions, including ALL. Unfortunately, one of the recognised and established complications of this treatment is osteonecrosis, which can be particularly debilitating when it involves weight-bearing joints. In a prospective MRI study, Ojala et al \\[ 1 \\] reported development of osteonecrosis in 32% (9 of 28) of patients during treatment for ALL, although only four of those nine were symptomatic. The management of this condition poses particular challenges given the typical juvenile onset of ALL. Joint preserving strategies dominate management efforts, avoiding joint replacement whenever possible in patients so young \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【45】Werger et al \\[ 2 \\] reviewed eight patients who developed osteonecrosis during treatment for ALL and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and discussed the various management strategies available. Potential options for the knee included core decompression, cancellous bone transplantation (autologous or allogeneic) combined with collagen pads, bone substitutes, periosteal flaps, and osteochondral autografts harvested from the ipsilateral or contralateral knee. Two patients in this study also required concomitant hip replacements; however, use of the femoral head for osteochondral grafting was not employed. Fujita et al \\[ 3 \\] presented a case series of three young patients (18, 24 and 25 years) who all developed osteonecrosis of the knee secondary to steroid use for chronic renal conditions. All three underwent autologous osteochondral grafting to the affected weight-bearing surface, and two also underwent micro-fracture for treatment of chondral defects in non-weight-bearing areas. They reported satisfactory clinical outcomes with symptomatic improvement, and at two years post-operative both MRI and arthroscopy demonstrated viability and incorporation of the grafts.\n\n【46】Gortz et al \\[ 4 \\] have reported the largest case series of young patients with osteonecrosis of the knee related to corticosteroid use, managed by the use of fresh osteochondral (shell or plug) allografts to the affected femoral condyles. Their study cohort included 22 patients (28 involved knees) with an average age of 24.3 years (16 - 44). They reported promising results, with 18 of 19 surviving participants having a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms; only two of the 14 osteochondral allografts with long-term follow up demonstrated radiographic collapse. Three of their cases were later revised, with only one requiring a TKA at 78 months secondary to pain.\n\n【47】Multiple small case series \\[ 5 \\- 9 \\] have described the success of osteochondral autografts for treatment of osteochondral defects in the knee, including cases of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK), secondary osteonecrosis, or osteochondritis dissecans. As for other small osteochondral defects, osteochondral autograft plugs are harvested from the periphery of either the ipsilateral or contralateral knees. The recent literature review by Lieberman et al \\[ 10 \\] critically examined the evidence for various surgical procedures in treatment of osteonecrosis of the knee. The evidence is unfortunately limited, principally due to the paucity of available cases and the lack of randomised controlled studies. Core decompression was a successful technique, with better results achieved prior to collapse and with smaller osteochondral defects. Osteochondral grafting techniques employed in knees were successful both pre-collapse (0% failure) and post-collapse (8.2% failure). The success of this procedure in knees has not been replicated in hips, which typically continue to collapse and usually later require arthroplasty.\n\n【48】Having conducted a thorough review of the available literature, the technique we describe here appears to be unique. Harvesting the remaining intact articular surfaces of the femoral head during a simultaneous total hip arthroplasty for use as an immediate osteochondral autograft transfer to the knee has not been previously described. Although distinctly uncommon, this clinical scenario is not rare and we believe other patients may obtain genuine benefit from this novel treatment strategy.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】We have described here a unique case of successful management of lateral femoral condyle osteonecrosis by use of fresh femoral head autograft obtained during simultaneous total hip arthroplasty. To the best of our knowledge this paper reports on the first, and to date only, use of this innovative technique. The use of a fresh osteochondral autograft has a number of advantages; we recommend this technique be considered in those unusual situations where total hip arthroplasty is contemplated in patients also requiring bulk osteochondral grafting procedures to the knee or other large joints.\n\n【51】**Disclosure**\n\n【52】The author/s report that there is no conflict of interest regarding the material discussed in this manuscript.\n\n【53】Ethical approval for this paper was sought and approved by UnitingCare Health - Human Research Ethics Committee on 30/07/2013.\n\n【54】This procedure was conducted at St Andrew’s War Memorial Hospital, Brisbane, Australia on the 27th June 2012.\n\n【55】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It can be congenital or acquired. In obstetrics and gynecology, an AVM may be acquired either following treatment of miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, or following a cesarean section. When ruptured, AVM can lead to potentially life-threatening intractable hemorrhage. It is one of the extremely rare causes of PPH and presents great difficulty in recognition and initiation of correct treatment.\n\n| **Case Report** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【4】* * *\n\n【5】Our patient was a 40-year-old para 2 with a history of lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) in her first pregnancy. She had no other surgical or medical issues of note. Her current pregnancy had been uneventful with a planned elective repeat LSCS at 39 weeks. She presented in spontaneous labor prior to her scheduled surgery and opted for a trial of vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC). However, there was failure to progress beyond 6 cm dilatation and she underwent an emergency LSCS. The procedure was complicated due to intra-abdominal adhesions resulting in injury to urinary bladder which was repaired in layers. The blood loss during the procedure was average. The patient made good recovery and was discharged home on third day post-procedure with the indwelling urinary catheter _in situ_ . The catheter was removed 1 week post-procedure and patient showed complete recovery. However, she presented to the emergency department on day 25 postnatal with significant secondary PPH associated with an episode of hypovolemic shock. Following resuscitation, she underwent an examination under anesthesia (EUA). Suction evacuation of the uterus was done and blood clots along with a small amount of retained products of conception (RPOC) were obtained. The blood loss was estimated as 2.5 L and she received 4 units packed red cells, 2 units fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit platelets. She was also given uterotonics such as carbetocin, prostaglandin analogues such as carboprost and misoprostol along with intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid for control of bleeding. She received broad spectrum IV antibiotics due to the possibility of endometritis. Her bleeding settled and following a period of observation she was discharged on third post-operative day. A week following her discharge, she re-presented to the emergency department of our hospital with another episode of significant bleeding. On account of ongoing bleeding, she underwent another EUA and evacuation of uterus with a possibility of proceeding to a laparotomy and a hysterectomy as a last resort. The interventional radiologist was alerted as the possibility of uterine artery embolization (UAE) was also under consideration. There was minimal curettings obtained during the evacuation of uterus which was carried out under ultrasound guidance. A pelvic angiogram done showed profuse contrast extravasation and acute bleeding from the left uterine artery ( Fig. 1 ). A super-selective embolization of left uterine artery was performed. Post-embolization angiogram showed satisfactory results with no further contrast extravasation ( Fig. 2 ). Thereafter the patient recovered well and was discharged well after a week. Currently, 6 months post-embolization, she is under follow-up for irregular periods.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** Superselective left uterine artery angiogram showing gross contrast extravasation/pooling medially in the pelvis pre-embolization._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【7】  \n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** Post-embolization angiogram with catheter pulled back into the left IIA, showing no further contrast extravasation from the left uterine artery (uterine artery completely occluded with no opacification)._ |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| **Discussion** | ▴Top |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】PPH is one of the most important causes of maternal mortality and morbidity \\[ 1 \\]. According to the World Health Organization, it affects approximately 2% of all women in relation to childbirth and is the leading cause of maternal mortality in most low-income countries \\[ 2 \\]. According to the MBRRACE (UK) report of December 2014, from the year 2009 to 2012, obstetric hemorrhage in the UK accounts for approximately 10% of all direct maternal deaths \\[ 3 \\]. It has an overall mortality rate of 0.49 per 100,000 maternities (CI 0.29 - 0.78) and a case fatality rate for massive hemorrhage of approximately 1 per 1,200 women \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【12】PPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 h after birth \\[ 2 \\]. Severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1,000 mL or more within the same time period after birth \\[ 2 \\]. It may also be classified as primary and secondary \\[ 1 \\]. While primary PPH occurs within the period from delivery up to 24 h post-delivery \\[ 4 \\], secondary PPH occurs from the period between 24 h and 12 weeks postnatal \\[ 4 \\]. The most common causes include uterine atony and genital tract trauma while the less common causes include uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, infection or maternal coagulopathy disorders \\[ 2 \\]. Ruptured uterine AVM or pseudoaneurysm as a cause of intractable secondary PPH is an extremely rare phenomenon but should be considered and looked for in intractable PPH where other common causes have been excluded \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【13】Uterine AVM can be congenital or acquired, when it is also known as a “pseudoaneurysm” of the uterine artery \\[ 1 \\]. An acquired uterine AVM is characterized as a communication between the branches of the uterine artery and the myometrial venous plexus \\[ 6 \\]. It rarely affects nulliparous women without a history of uterine instrumentation or surgery such as evacuation of uterus, cesarean section, dilatation and curettage \\[ 6 \\]. Other than iatrogenic causes, pathologic processes such as infection, trophoblastic disease, and malignancies involving the uterus have also been found to be associated with acquired uterine AVM \\[ 6 \\]. In obstetric, there is another form of acquired AVM called pseudoaneurysm of the uterine arteries, which is more likely to be the cause in case of intractable secondary PPH \\[ 1 \\]. It is said that trauma to the uterine arteries during LSCS is commonly found to be associated with this type of vascular abnormality \\[ 1 \\]. The hypothesis is that it may be due to lateral extension of the lower uterine segment incision and failure to secure the apex during repair, thus leading to formation of a pseudoaneurysm \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【14】Uterine AVM has traditionally been diagnosed during laparotomy or during pathological examination of the uterus after a hysterectomy \\[ 7 \\]. The method of diagnosing uterine AVMs has traditionally been proved to be difficult \\[ 8 \\]. Typical diagnostic procedures such as pelvic examination, hysteroscopy and gray-scale ultrasonography have not been found to be adequately effective in diagnosing this condition \\[ 8 \\]. In recent years, Doppler ultrasound studies and focused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to be useful in diagnosing uterine AVM \\[ 9 \\]. It provides a non-invasive method of diagnosis of uterine AVMs \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. MRI is mostly helpful where there is doubt in diagnosis on ultrasonography and there is an aversion to invasive angiography \\[ 10 \\]. The current gold standard in diagnosing uterine AVM is by pelvic angiography which maps out the pelvic vascular anatomy \\[ 8 \\]. It also helps to identify the bleeder and its leading “feeder” vessels whereby selective embolization can be done at the same setting as a conservative treatment option \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【15】Historically, the main treatment for uterine AVMs has been hysterectomy \\[ 6 \\]. However, embolization is the preferred treatment with a high success rate of > 90% \\[ 5 \\], most commonly the uterine artery \\[ 1 \\]. It also serves as an alternative option for patients seeking to preserve fertility \\[ 6 \\] and major operative morbidity associated with a hysterectomy. However, it can be associated with complications including fever, neurological complications, puncture site hematomas, abscess, ischemic complications like vesicovaginal fistulas, endometrial atrophy, etc. \\[ 5 \\]. The effect of embolization on future fertility is still unknown and is a subject of research \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【16】In the case of our lady she had history of prior LSCS with last procedure performed approximately 4 weeks prior to her presentation with first of the recurring episodes of PPH. She had also undergone evacuation of uterus twice during the management of her PPH. We hypothesized that her uterine surgeries may have predisposed her to the formation of her pseudoaneurysm in her left uterine artery, a pathology which accounted for her presentation.\n\n【17】A review of literature shows that there are no known prevention measures for acquired AVM except for high clinical suspicion when a patient presents with intractable PPH with a background of recent surgical intervention, i.e. cesarean section \\[ 1 \\]. There must also be diligent care during surgical repair, i.e. cesarean section to reduce the risk of developing iatrogenic vascular abnormalities that may cause such rare intractable hemorrhage \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Uterine AVM as a cause of PPH unresponsive to conventional treatment methods is rare but can be potentially life-threatening. In the case of an intractable PPH, there should be high index of clinical suspicion especially in the presence of risk factors such as prior surgical intervention. Multi-disciplinary care involving interventional radiology team with use of selective UAE as treatment method should be considered should suspicion of uterine AVM arise, due to its high success rate and minimally invasive nature.\n\n【20】**Conflicts of Interest**\n\n【21】None.\n\n【22】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

She was started on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid treatment for a suspected upper respiratory tract infection. Five days after starting the previously mentioned antibiotic, she was consulted to us and transferred to our dermatology department. Her medical history was notable for appendectomy and pituitary gland tumor operation 3 and 5 years ago, and she had been treated with allopurinol for increased uric acid levels. Seven weeks after the initiation of allopurinol she had developed a skin eruption which began on the trunk and upper limbs and gradually disseminated for a couple of days. Physical examination revealed a generalized maculopapular exanthema, some of them with edematous follicular accentuation, periorbital edema and generalized lymphadenopathy ( Fig. 1a, b ). The patient was febrile (38.2 °C).\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 1.** (a) A generalized maculopapular exanthema on the trunk and upper extremities.

Liver function tests were abnormal with increased levels of AST (455 U/L, N: 0 - 35 U/L), ALT (565 U/L, N: 0 - 35 U/L), GGT (532 U/L, N: 0 - 50 U/L) and alkaline phophatase (346 IU/L, N: 30 - 120 U/L). There was an increase in serum creatinine (1.64 mg/dL, N: 0.50 - 9 mg/dL) and urea (89 mg/dL, N: 17 - 43 mg/dL) and decreased creatinine clearance (61.72 mL/min, N: 85 - 125 mL/min). Blood cultures, urine and stool cultures and nasal-throat swabs were negative for bacteria, protozoa or helminthic eggs. Serologic tests including syphilis, EBV, HIV and hepatitis B and C and antinuclear antibody were negative. Chest radiograhy was normal. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion 0.8 cm around left ventricle and abdominal sonography showed moderate hepatomegaly. The skin biopsy yielded mild acanthosis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the upper dermis ( Fig. 2 ). Allopurinol was immediately withdrawn, and systemic prednisolone 75 mg daily and antihistamines were initiated. The patient’s clinical appearance and laboratory abnormalities began to improve. The dosage of corticosteroids was gradually tapered and stopped as the clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved over 6 months in order to prevent a recurrence of the symptoms of the disease.\n\n| Click for large image | _**Figure 2.** H&E (× 20).

The mortality rate has been estimated at 10% \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. DRESS syndrome most commonly arises 3 - 8 weeks after exposure to the culprit drug. Our patient presented to the infection disease department 6 weeks after initiation of allopurinol. Fever often up to 38 - 40 °C and rash is the first sign seen in 90-100% and 90% of cases respectively \\[ 3 \\]. The face, trunk and upper extremities are initially affected and the eruption is usually macular erythema that becomes confluent. Swelling of the face, with a marked periorbital involvement is a warning to the diagnosis, occurring in about 25% of patients \\[ 4 \\]. Local or generalized lymphadenopathy is found in 70-75% of cases \\[ 5 \\]. Various hematologic abnormalities are observed including leukocytosis, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes similar to mononucleosis. Liver involvement is the most common visceral manifestation, after the lymphadenopathy. Hepatitis with elevation of liver transaminases is found in 51% of cases \\[ 2 \\]. Renal involvement is also reported in patients, being particularly evident in cases due to allopurinol \\[ 6 \\]. Our patient’s constellation of symptoms and course were consistent with the natural progression of DRESS syndrome. Severe organ involvement may develop, such as fulminant hepatitis, eosinophilic interstitial lung disease, interstitial nephropathy, pericarditis, myocarditis and pancreatitis, 1 - 2 weeks after skin eruption \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【13】The aromatic anticonvulsants, salazosulfapyridine, dapsone and minocycline are frequently associated with DRESS syndrome, but a variety of other drugs can induce this syndrome \\[ 1 \\].
