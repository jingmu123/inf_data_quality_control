It may be located on the right or left or both sides, depending on the level of the ductal damage. Various malignancies including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are associated with the occurrence of chylothorax . Thoracic spine fractures, anterior cervical spine surgery, neck surgery, cardiovascular surgery, thoracic tumor surgery and thoracic spine surgery as well as central venous line insertion are the more common causes for a thoracic duct injury . Nutritional deficiencies, respiratory dysfunction, dehydration and immunological dysfunction can be caused by large chyle leaks . Early diagnosis and treatment of traumatic chylothorax are crucial in avoiding these associated morbidities. We are reporting a rare case of a multi-trauma patient with a surgically treated thoracic spine fracture who developed chylothorax several days after his initial admission complicating his post-operative course.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 19-year-old man was referred to our neurosurgery department after a reported motor vehicle accident which resulted in a three column thoracic spine fracture and subsequent paraplegia. His initial clinical examination revealed bilateral chest wall tenderness to palpation, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, lower thoracic spine tenderness to palpation, a complete loss of motor function in his lower extremities and loss of sensory function below the level of T7. Patient also had a loss of his cremasteric and bulbar cavernous reflex, and he did not have rectal tone (ASIA A). The patient was intubated due to unstable breathing and low saturation. Reconstructed 3D computer tomography of his thoracic spine showed a fracture of T7 thoracic vertebrae and dislocation of T7 vertebra on T8 vertebra . Rib fractures, bilateral pneumothorax, and lung contusions bilaterally were also found. After the placement of chest tube thoracostomies, patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital where he stayed for 45 days . During that period of time, he underwent posterior stabilization of his unstable thoracic spine fracture. Patient was transferred to the neurosurgery clinic after his discharge from the ICU where his left chest tube had a daily bloody drainage of 100 mL. The right chest tube had been removed in the ICU. On the 50th day of his hospitalization and after the initiation of food uptake, the patient presented with milky white fluid excretion from his left-sided chest tube. Chest X-ray and thoracic CT revealed an enlarged fluid pleural effusion at the base of his left lung . Biochemical analysis of the pleural fluid revealed triglycerides of 276 mg/dL, total protein of 2,200 mg/ dL, and LDH of 2,555 units/L. These results confirmed the presence of chylothorax. Conservative management was decided with total parenteral nutrition, a low-fat and medium-chain triglycerides diet and maintenance of the left drainage. The closure of the major thoracic duct was achieved over a period of 2 weeks. The chest tube was then removed and patient was started on a regular diet. Follow-up chest X-rays did not reveal any recurrent pleural effusions. His pulmonary status remained stable and the patient was discharged in order to participate in a rehabilitation program after a 3-month period of hospitalization.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Chylothorax is a pathological condition with high mortality and morbidity rate . Chylothorax associated with thoracic vertebral injury was noted first by Krabbell in 1885 . Until today there have been described several cases in bibliography . Leturgie et al reported in 1979 a case of a patient with traumatic chylothorax in combination with a dorsal spine fracture . Chylothorax was recognized at the 13th day of patient’s hospitalization. Similarly, in all the other reported cases, chylothorax was noted immediately to several days after injury occurrence. In our case, chylothorax was noted 50 days after injury took place which is rarely documented in the literature. There is only one other case report in the literature in which chylothorax was described 20 years after a blunt thoracic trauma .\n\n【6】Generally, chyle extravasation could be caused by two major mechanisms. Chylothorax could be either a result of direct trauma to the lymphatic vessels in the chyle pathway or either the result of thoracic chyle duct occlusion. Clinical manifestations of chylothorax are: 1) hypovolemia due to large amount of chyle loss, 2) dyspnea, 3) malnutrition due to the loss of protein, fats and vitamins, 4) hyponatremia, 5) hypocalcaemia and 6) immunosuppression . Clinical suspicion of chylothorax exists when milky or white fluid is drained out of the thorax. This classical white appearance is also noted in pseudochylothorax . Lymphangiography could be used to identify the spot of the chyle leakage or blockage . Thoracentesis and laboratory analysis of the pleural fluid could lead to the diagnosis which is based on the presence of chylomicrons in the pleural fluid . The presence of chylomicrons could be also speculated with the measurement of fluid cholesterol and triglyceride levels . In recently published data near-infrared fluorescence imaging of thoracic duct and scintigraphy by orally administered 123 I BMIPP using SPECT/CT could reveal the chylous leakage .\n\n【7】Treatment of traumatic chylothorax is mainly conservative with chest drainage and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), followed by medium-chain triglyceride diet. This kind of treatment was supported by many authors with satisfactory results for their patients as chyle production reduced in a period of time of a few days to 3 - 4 weeks . In some cases octreotide can be administrated with good results for the patients . Surgical treatment should be followed only in the cases that chyle production is not reduced after the second to the third week of the conservative management. The goal of the operative treatment is the ligation of the thoracic duct as this was performed in a few cases in the literature .\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Traumatic chylothorax after a thoracic spine fracture is a rare pathological entity and it could be present immediately after trauma or more than a month after injury as in our case. Diagnosis is simplified through laboratory exams of the milky excreted fluid. Treatment is conservative for the majority of the patients with total parenteral nutrition followed by medium-chain triglyceride diet.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The normal habitat of C. tertium is the soil but it has colonized the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals as a commensal organism . In contrast to other Clostridia species, C. tertium does not produce exotoxins, and hence it is considered a low virulent organism that rarely causes infections in healthy humans . Most C. tertium infections in the literature were chiefly described among neutropenic hosts with hematological malignancies , followed by only a handful of non-neutropenic patients with liver cirrhosis  and intestinal mucosal damage due to various etiologies . Herein, we reported an unusual case of C. tertium bacteremia as a diagnostic culprit of underlying perforated diverticulitis in a non-neutropenic patient with moderately severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 66-year-old female with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, and schizophrenia was brought to the emergency department with fatigue and shortness of breath. She denied fevers or rigors, changes in quality or color of sputum, chest pain, or palpitations, but she reported dizziness. The patient endorsed one episode of black stool overnight, but she denied any history of acute epigastric pain, lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or recent bowel habits changes. The review of systems was not pertinent for any other positive symptoms. On initial evaluation, she appeared confused and ill-looking, with an oxygen saturation of 81% on room air that improved to 95% on 4 L/min oxygen. She was afebrile with a blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg and pulse rate of 100 beats/min. There were reduced breathing sounds over both lung fields with crackles and scattered wheezes. The systemic examination was unremarkable. The initial laboratory results are summarized in Table 1 . Nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was commenced on dexamethasone 6 mg injection daily and remdesivir as per institution-based guidelines for COVID-19. The patient passed a large amount of melena and became hypotensive to 90/65 mm Hg; she responded to 1 L of intravenous fluids bolus and was transferred to the intensive care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and non-invasive ventilation. Gastroenterology services recommended pantoprazole injections of 40 mg twice daily and an esophagogastroscopy (EGD) which revealed a bleeding duodenal ulcer that was controlled by epinephrine injection and bipolar cauterization.\n\n【5】On the third day of admission, the patient spiked a high-grade fever (38.5 °C) and became hypotensive to 80/55 mm Hg and tachycardic to 140 beats/min requiring vasopressors support. Blood cultures were obtained. Physical examination was positive for inspiratory crackles over the left lower lung zone and a vague generalized abdominal tenderness. Further evaluation was limited by the patient’s altered mental status. Chest X-rays revealed consolidation of the left lower lung lobe concerning for superimposed bacterial infection. She was commenced on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) per hospital-based local susceptibility patterns pending blood cultures results.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Two bottles of blood cultures obtained from day 3 of admission grew out anaerobic gram-positive bacillus on day 1 of incubation. Further identification on day 2 using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry isolated C. tertium . Following Clostridia isolation on day 4 of admission, intravenous vancomycin and clindamycin were added by the infectious disease (ID) team awaiting susceptibility results. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed to rule out a gastrointestinal infectious source in the setting of C. tertium bacteremia. The imaging depicted extensive free intraperitoneal gas  and thickened distal sigmoid colon wall with adjacent free fluids concerning for colonic perforation . There was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia.\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】Surgical consultation recommended an emergent laparotomy for primary sepsis source control. Operative intervention was performed on day 4 of admission that revealed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with localized peritonitis, and Hartmann’s procedure was subsequently performed. The patient remained on vasopressors support for 5 days postoperatively, and repeat blood cultures on day 3 and day 5 postoperatively continued to grow C. tertium . Most isolates were susceptible to meropenem, metronidazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient was switched to intravenous meropenem and metronidazole per susceptibility results. Histology of the resected colon biopsy confirmed perforated diverticulitis without evidence of neoplasia. The patient was continued on parenteral meropenem and metronidazole per the infectious disease team’s advice, and serial blood cultures on day 10 and day 14 postoperatively confirmed clearance of C. tertium bacteremia.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】The patient had a challenging postoperative course over 2 weeks. The course was complicated by difficult weaning from the mechanical ventilator due to intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) that necessitated a transition into tracheostomy. The patient was eventually transferred into a long-term acute care facility for ongoing tracheostomy care. She was discharged on oral metronidazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate for a further 2-week course, considering the delayed clearance of C. tertium bacteremia as recommended by the infectious disease team.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】C. tertium has been increasingly reported as a human pathogen over the last three decades , raising significant concerns of this commensal as an emerging infectious organism among certain high-risk populations . While the vast majority of C. tertium infections manifested as febrile neutropenia in immunosuppressed hosts with hematological malignancies who received chemotherapy , there are a handful of cases that documented C. tertium as the culprit pathogen even in non-neutropenic patients with various associated risks including end-stage liver disease (presenting as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) , and a variety of conditions leading to intestinal mucosal damage (such as inflammatory bowel diseases , infectious colitis , paralytic ileus , and perforated appendicitis with peritonitis that was complicated by a pyogenic hepatic abscess ). Additionally, there were individual isolated cases of acute bronchopneumonia in a patient who ingested glyphosate  and necrotizing fasciitis in a patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Table 2  summarizes the clinical presentation, possible risk factors, and susceptibility results of most of the reported C. tertium cases.\n\n【14】To the best of our knowledge, this reported case would be the first one to demonstrate an association between C. tertium and perforated colonic diverticular disease. Interestingly, the isolation of C. tertium from the blood cultures was the initial clue to an underlying, perhaps serious, gastrointestinal tract perforation in our critically ill patient who exhibited minimal peritonitic signs on the physical examination, presumably due to altered sensorium related to hypoxic respiratory failure resulting from COVID-19. The injury to the colonic mucosa likely led to translocation of C. tertium into the systemic circulation causing bacteremia, as being explained in other similar cases of C. tertium that were associated with a disturbed intestinal mucosal integrity .\n\n【15】It is worth mentioning that gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in several patients with COVID-19 per a recent pandemic literature . However, it remains unclear whether the COVID-19 worsens the risk of perforation of the pre-existing diverticular disease (as in our patient) or not. Additionally, this patient had received corticosteroids that may have masked the peritonitic signs and delayed the early diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. Our patient also suffered from poorly controlled diabetes which may have both compounded the risk of diverticular perforation and decreased the clearance of C. tertium bacteremia . All of the above discussed risks have probably accumulatively resulted in the occurrence of the septic shock due to C. tertium bacteremia that complicated perforated diverticulitis necessitating Hartmann’s operation to control the sepsis source.\n\n【16】It is interesting to note that C. tertium species were reportedly difficult to isolate from routine cultures , as these isolates are aerotolerant and only slowly growing when utilizing traditional culturing methods . The latter microbiological observation might have led to underdiagnoses in the past .\n\n【17】Furthermore, the identification of C. tertium species has been largely confused with Bacillus species and Lactobacillus species because of the similar culture’s growth patterns and micromorphology , which could have resulted in inaccurate identification and subsequently inappropriate antibiotics selection . Nevertheless, modern bacterial identification diagnostics, such as direct MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which was employed in our case and other two cases , have facilitated rapid as well as accurate isolation of C. tertium species, and therefore allowed selection of targeted antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility results, which is particularly vital in C. tertium cases, relative to the other Clostridia species, because of the reported resistance of some strains to many antibiotics, including the third and fourth generation cephalosporins . Moreover, molecular biology techniques (such as 16S rRNA sequencing) have also been used for the fast identification of C. tertium species .\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of C. tertium remains largely unclear as this organism is non-exotoxin-producing . It was theorized that the major four predisposing factors implicated in the pathogenesis of C. tertium were neutropenia, gastrointestinal mucosal injury with bacterial translocation, end-stage liver disease, and the recent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that may predispose to intestinal colonization with C. tertium . Many of the reported patients have had more than one risk factor , for instance, chemotherapy results in neutropenia that significantly diminishes the innate immune response to clear C. tertium bacteremia, and it also causes intestinal mucosal injury that potentiates translocation of C. tertium into the systemic circulation . Additionally, most neutropenic patients at the time of isolation of C. tertium had received broad-spectrum antibiotics, as empiric therapy for neutropenic fevers, which may have selectively favored intestinal colonization with C. tertium .\n\n【19】It has been recommended to treat C. tertium infections aggressively with targeted antibiotic therapy, despite being potentially a non-highly virulent organism with a relatively low direct mortality rate . One-month mortality rate following a blood culture isolation of C. tertium was reported to be 34% in the largest series of 32 cases with C. tertium bacteremia that was reported by Miller et al from Duke University Medical Center . Such high reported mortality was largely attributed to the advanced stage of malignancies and the burden of the associated medical comorbidities rather than C. tertium infection itself , suggesting that the latter infection could be a marker of underlying poor baseline status.\n\n【20】There are limited data on the standard duration of directed antibiotic therapy in the available literature . We employed a prolonged course of targeted antibiotics for C. tertium bacteremia clearance (i.e. 4 weeks) due to the persistence of Clostridial growth on one blood culture postoperatively, presumably attributable to the immunosuppressive status of our patient that resulted from poorly controlled diabetes and concurrent corticosteroids use.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】The authors described a rare case of C. tertium bacteremia as a marker of underlying perforated colonic diverticulitis in a non-neutropenic patient with COVID-19 that necessitated operative intervention for primary source control and an extended course of targeted antibiotic therapy to treat the Clostridial infection. Our case reaffirmed the available literature which suggested the presence of C. tertium bacteremia in non-neutropenic patients raises suspicion of an associated gastrointestinal tract pathology that should warrant a diagnostic workup to identify the infectious culprit.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】C. tertium bacteremia in non-neutropenic patients raises suspicion of an associated gastrointestinal tract pathology that should warrant a diagnostic workup to identify the infectious culprit.

It has been increasingly recognized as an emerging opportunistic threat specifically after open cardiac surgery and in immunocompromised patients .\n\n【2】The diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and an indolent course of the disease. It may present as pneumonia, endocarditis, implant-associated infection, hepatitis and chorioretinitis, as well as disseminated infection .\n\n【3】The pathogen is classified as MAC when cultured from blood and tissue samples. The species identification as MC is only possible using molecular genetic tests like the GenoType NTM-DR, a tool that also identifies genes responsible for some of the macrolides and aminoglycosides resistance mechanisms .\n\n【4】The current recommendations advocate that MC pulmonary disease should be treated with a three- to four-drug regimen, but recent evidence suggests disseminated infection may require four to five antibiotics depending on the severity of disease and patient risk factors, like kidney failure . The regimen should include a macrolide, rifamycin, ethambutol, and a fourth agent such as moxifloxacin. The addition of a parenteral drug such as amikacin when starting treatment is also recommended .\n\n【5】We describe a case of a confirmed disseminated MC infection in an immunocompromised patient, with documented treatment efficacy using a four-drug regimen.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 57-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of low-grade fever of unknown origin, night sweats, asthenia and severe weight loss. He was being followed in the hematology department due to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma previously in remission for 9 years, which had relapsed 1 year before. He had been treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP), and remission was confirmed again. He was expected to undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which was postponed due to the febrile illness.\n\n【8】Empirical antibiotic therapy was started with a slow clinical response, and without microbiological identification at the beginning. One month later, the patient developed subacute pneumonia and severe anemia, as well as a new-onset hepatosplenomegaly (20 cm and 27 cm, respectively).\n\n【9】Because a relapse of the lymphoma was suspected, the patient underwent liver and bone marrow biopsies, which showed no evidence of a hematological neoplasia. The liver biopsy identified a granulomatous hepatitis. After positive blood and bone marrow cultures, as well as a positive bronchoalveolar lavage culture, a disseminated MAC infection was diagnosed and the patient started treatment with clarithromycin, rifabutin and ethambutol (CRE).\n\n【10】After 2 weeks of therapy and due to clinical worsening, a fourth antibiotic was added, first amikacin for 2 weeks and subsequently linezolid for 3 weeks. Both had to be discontinued due to severe kidney injury and severe myelosuppression, respectively.\n\n【11】The antibiotic regimen (AR) was changed to CRE plus moxifloxacin, which was well tolerated, and the patient started to improve. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was then available and revealed sensitivity to the CRE regimen, with resistance described only for streptomycin (amikacin and moxifloxacin resistance were not tested). The blood and tissue cultures were negative for MC after 4 months of therapy.\n\n【12】After 6 months of therapy, the identification of MC was possible using the newly available GenoType NTM-DR, a molecular genetic test that also detected no mutations at the rrs and rrl genes (the former being responsible for some of the amikacin resistance and the latter for a potential macrolide resistance mechanism).\n\n【13】Although the infection was being treated, the autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that should have followed R-CHOP was postponed due do the MC-related symptoms. Without it, the chances of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma relapse were higher, and it happened after 12 months of the four-drug AR. A new chemotherapy regimen was being planned, but the patient died because of the lymphoma.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Unlike many previous MC infection reports, our patient did not have a history of cardiac surgery or related procedures. However, MC has been increasingly recognized as the cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Our patient was immunocompromised due to a hematological neoplasia and the subsequent R-CHOP treatment. Following remission of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he developed a MC disseminated infection.\n\n【16】As described in the literature, a four-drug AR was required, starting with CRE plus amikacin, later changed to CRE plus moxifloxacin due to amikacin-related kidney injury. The patient had a slow but gradual clinical improvement and the cultures were MC-negative after 4 months, confirming the efficacy of the four-drug AR.\n\n【17】The MC identification was possible using a molecular genetic test, the GenoType NTM-DR, which also excluded the existence of mutations for macrolide resistance in the rrl gene, complementing the AST results.\n\n【18】The usefulness of this case is the description of a rare cause of disseminated infection in an immunocompromised patient, with good response to the recommended four-drug treatment and species identification using a molecular genetic test. In immunocompromised patients with a fever of unknown origin, this should be one of the etiologies to be taken into account.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "863bb4ed-0615-4320-86cd-632d254c31b4", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is human herpesvirus type 4 (HHV-4) with double-DNA chain. It is a common pathogen that infects a large part of the world’s population . The transmission of EBV occurs mainly through oral secretions which make the infection highly spreadable, particularly in the first decades of life . For this reason, it is also called “kissing disease”.\n\n【2】It is estimated that over 90% of the population within the age of 35 is seropositive for EBV . It is reasonable to argue that childhood is a very affected age group in the most disadvantaged areas and in developing countries, while in the economically richest states, the first years of life represent a period of time with little diffusion of the infection .\n\n【3】In childhood, EBV infection is often asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, while in adolescents and adults, the appearance of the “mononucleosis syndrome” is more frequent, characterized by the presence of fever and general discomfort, pharyngodynia, tonsillar hypertrophy with characteristic fibrinous pseudomembranes covering the surface, and laterocervical lymphadenopathy (often involving the posterior lymphatic compartment of the neck). Mononucleosis is often accompanied by an asthenic syndrome which can last for several weeks .\n\n【4】Mononucleosis sometimes is characterized by a self-limiting character, although it is rarely associated with severe complications related to local aggressiveness or the systemic spread of the virus. In children, especially under the age of 6, we can find respiratory compromise due to marked adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy which sometimes leads to hospitalization . This episode occurs in about 5% of affected patients. According to Putukian et al, splenic rupture with particular risk appears in 0.1-0.5% of patients in the first 3 weeks of illness . This risk requires the abstention of physical activity during this period. Mononucleosis can also cause nephritis, myocarditis, hemolytic anemia, cranial nerve palsies and neuropathies, encephalitis and meningitis .\n\n【5】Now, we present the clinical case of a patient affected by infectious mononucleosis associated with bilateral eyelid edema, a rare manifestation of the disease. We also report a review of similar cases reported in the literature since 1952.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】The patient was 19 years old without any known allergies. He came to our clinic with suspicion of acute rhinosinusitis since he had had bilateral eyelid swelling, not painful, not hyperemic for some days and in a phase of progressive improvement . He also complained of mild pharyngodynia.\n\n【9】He reported that about 15 days before the appearance of eyelid edema, he had nasal obstruction and purulent rhinorrhea, intense pharyngodynia and odynophagia accompanied by high fever (40 °C). The patient had taken antibiotic therapy in that circumstance. At first, he was treated with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (orally, 1 g two times a day for 6 days), and subsequently with cefriaxone (intramuscular, 1 g a day for 6 days) with temporary remission of fever which reappeared a few days later with lower intensity (max. 38 °C).\n\n【10】Diagnosis\n\n【11】We subjected the patient to endoscopy of the upper airways and found clear external auditory canals, intact and rosy tympanic membranes, nasal septum in axis, hypertrophic inferior turbinates, free nasal foramina and recesses, free nasopharynx, normal oral cavity, and in oropharynx slight tonsillar hypertrophy with modest signs of acute inflammation. The glosso-epiglottic valleculae were free, and the piriform sinuses were free and distendable. The larynx was normal in morphology and motility. The cervical trachea was regular in appearance.\n\n【12】We then performed an ultrasound of the neck which showed the presence of multiple latero-cervical adenopathies of a reactive appearance with an elongated shape and preservation of the hilum. We found nothing significant in the thyroid and major salivary glands.\n\n【13】We diagnosed acute tonsillitis in progressive resolution associated with latero-cervical lymph node resentment. The endoscopic investigation allowed us to exclude acute rhinosinusitis as the cause of eyelid edema. The presence of sore throat and fever in the previous days and the presence at the time of the visit of modest signs of tonsillar inflammation, the finding of laterocervical adenopathies and the patient’s age, led us to suspect a form of infectious mononucleosis with possible Hoagland’s sign from disturbance of the lymphatic microcirculation and prescribed serological, blood chemistry  and urine tests, also aimed at excluding any common water retention syndromes, possible causes of eyelid edema (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndromes, liver disease, thyroid disease).\n\n【14】The results of the tests requested confirmed the suspicion of infectious mononucleosis. We also requested an internal medicine evaluation during which abdominal ultrasound (which did not show hepatic or splenic involvement) and an infectious disease evaluation were also performed.\n\n【15】Treatment\n\n【16】Based on what emerged, we started oral therapy with prednisone (25 mg daily for 3 days and 12.5 mg for the next 3 days) and probiotic mixture  for 1 month. The anti-inflammatory action of prednisone rapidly resolved the mild sore throat that still persisted at the time of our evaluation and contributed to the reduction of latero-cervical adenopathies. The patient no longer presented fever. We decided to resort to prednisone also for its anti-edema action in the hope of reducing eyelid edema. This however did not initially show a good response.\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The clinical picture progressively improved although eyelid edema persisted for 6 weeks.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Infectious mononucleosis is the most frequent clinical expression of EBV infection. It is mainly characterized by a symptomatologic triad characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis, and appearance of heterophile antibodies in serum .\n\n【21】In many cases, however, the infection can present an asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic course as well as begin or manifest during the course of the infection atypical symptoms.\n\n【22】Particularly interesting is the ocular involvement during the EBV infection with numerous possible clinical expressions. Librach in 1956 distinguished within a nucleus of patients affected by infectious mononucleosis two groups with different ocular manifestations . The subjects with neuro-ophthalmic manifestations belonged to the first group, while the subjects with ocular adnexa manifestations belonged to the second group. In his work, the author claimed that conjunctivitis was the most frequent ocular manifestation. Since then, numerous authors have described ocular involvement during EBV infection . Cases of hyperlacrimation, dacryoadenitis, dacryocystitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, keratitis and still uveitis, choroiditis, retinitis, papillitis have been described.\n\n【23】In 1952, Hoagland was the first to describe the case of eyelid edema in mononucleosis. This sign was named after its first observer and became Hoagland’s sign . He recognized this manifestation in a third of its patients with mononucleosis. However, this incidence does not appear realistic today as eyelid edema is a rare or even exceptional manifestation of the disease .\n\n【24】We performed a review of the cases of eyelid edema in mononucleosis reported in the literature since 1952. The scientific contributions were collected thanks to the PubMed search engine using as keywords: “Hoagland sign”, “ocular mononucleosis”, “eyelid edema mononucleosis”, “palpebral edema mononucleosis”, “dacryoadenitis mononucleosis”.\n\n【25】Table 2 shows the results of the research which confirm how this manifestation is very rare (28 cases described after the publication of the first case described by Hoagland in 1952) if we consider the very large diffusion of EBV infection in the population .\n\n【26】There are several hypotheses regarding the etiopathogenesis of this form of eyelid edema. The author agrees with Bass et al hypothesizing an impairment of lymphatic drainage as a possible causal mechanism of the manifestation and therefore supporting the association between eyelid edema and dacryoadenitis . According to other authors, the edema would be caused by a dacryocystitis due to the increase of B lymphocytes in the lymphatic tissues associated with the mucous membranes of the lacrimal glands .\n\n【27】Hoagland’s sign is usually temporary, and durations of a few days are predominantly described in the literature. In one case, the eyelid edema lasted for 8 weeks. In the case we described, the eyelid edema persisted for 6 weeks . This makes it the second most long-lasting case described in the literature. Edema can be unilateral or bilateral, generally not painful, without skin hyperemia or visual changes.\n\n【28】The finding of eyelid edema in a patient poses the difficult issue of differential diagnosis. In the case described, we carried out blood tests and urinalysis which allowed us to rule out an edematous syndrome of renal or hepatic origin. We then investigated thyroid function to rule out a form of myxedema or other thyroid disease. In the case described, the occurrence of a syndrome characterized by pharyngodynia, high fever and latero-cervical lymph node reaction led to the immediate request for a blood count and a search for anti-EBV antibodies which resulted positive. Not having found results compatible with edema in water retention syndromes in the required blood chemistry tests, we definitively made the diagnosis of mononucleosis with dacryoadenitis and Hoagland’s sign. For this reason, we have avoided ascertaining the other possible causes of eyelid edema (ophthalmological, allergological, serological investigations, brain magnetic resonance imaging and orbits).\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】EBV is the etiological agent of mononucleosis, a syndrome frequently found in otorhinolaryngological clinics and usually characterized by some characteristic symptoms and signs: fever, general malaise, pharyngodynia accompanied by tonsillar hypertrophy, lymphocytosis and latero-cervical adenopathies. In some cases, mononucleosis can present a serious course if associated with some severe complications such as nephritis, myocarditis, hemolytic anemia, cranial nerve palsy and neuropathies, encephalitis and meningitis. In some rare cases of mononucleosis, impaired lymphatic drainage of the lacrimal glands can lead to the development of eyelid edema known as Hoagland’s sign. The recognition of this manifestation can favor an early diagnosis in the early stages of the disease.\n\n【31】Learning points\n\n【32】EBV is a widespread virus that causes frequent, in many cases asymptomatic, infections. Mononucleosis is the most frequent clinical syndrome encountered during EBV infection. Rarely, the disease can cause dacryoadenitis and consequent eyelid edema which poses various difficulties in terms of differential diagnostics but also possible delays in the recognition of the infection. The exceptional nature of this sign is confirmed by the literature review that we have carried out since 1952 (the date in which this sign was first described) and which revealed 28 cases before ours.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It occurs usually in childhood and one of the well-known cardiac complications is coronary artery aneurysm which occurs usually after 1 - 2 years. Constrictive pericarditis (CP) occurs when the pericardium becomes fibrotic and thickens to impede normal cardiac function, either systolic or diastolic. It is not known if CP is a sequela of KD.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 21-year-old white male was referred to the emergency department by his gastroenterologist after an outpatient abdominal ultrasound obtained for elevated liver enzymes revealed ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. He had a background history of KD at the age of 8 years old that was treated with aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without any cardiac complications based on echocardiogram obtained after treatment; refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease being managed by a gastroenterologist and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus infections in the axilla treated with oral antibiotics with complete resolution. Upon presentation, he was noted to have bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, mildly elevated aspartate amino-transferase 48 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase 166 IU/L, total bilirubin 3.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.61, creatinine 1.34 mg/dL, with moderate blood on urinalysis. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute, low voltage and T-wave inversions in the inferolateral leads similar to previous EKG . Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler revealed patent arterial and venous blood flow, mild perihepatic ascites and large pleural effusions.\n\n【4】Further investigational tests were ordered as recommended by infectious disease, nephrology, rheumatology, cardiology which included but were not limited to erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, creatinine, phosphokinase, hepatitis panel, human immunodeficiency virus, complement levels, anti-glomerular membrane antibodies, Ebstein Barr virus (EBV)/cytomegalovirus (CMV)/Coxsackie virus serology, DNAse B antibodies, anti-nucleic acid antibodies, scleroderma antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies, anti-Sjogren’s-syndrome-related antigen A and B antibodies, Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G and M, QuantiFERON, C-ANCA, P-ANCA, RNP (ENA), and thyroid stimulating hormone. They were all within normal limits except for elevated EBV immunoglobulin G.\n\n【5】An echocardiogram was obtained which showed left ventricular systolic function is normal with an EF of 60-65%, Borderline pericardial thickening and hyper-echoicity with respiratory variation to mitral inflow and ventricular septal bounce suggesting constrictive pericarditis, with elevated right atrial pressure .\n\n【6】Patient also underwent thoracentesis with fluid analysis consistent with transudative fluid based on light’s criteria, negative for malignant cells. Patient was discharged with the instruction to follow up with cardiology and rheumatology however was lost to follow up due to changes in health insurance.\n\n【7】Patient did follow up with pulmonology who performed repeat bilateral thoracentesis for pleural effusions which were transudative on fluid analysis without malignant cells on cytology. Patient presented once more for recurrent pleural effusion 8 months later during which a repeat echocardiogram was done which showed preserved ejection fraction, findings consistent with constrictive physiology, septal bounce, dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respiratory variability, thickened and calcified pericardium . Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed large pleural effusions and mild pericardial thickening .\n\n【8】Patient was discharged home on torsemide for diuresis and pericardial anti-inflammatory colchicine with the recommendation that he might need a right and left heart cardiac catheterization and surgical pericardiectomy if he continues to retain significant fluid.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】CP results from fibrosis and subsequent loss of pericardial sac elasticity leading to limited movement of the chambers of the heart. It is most commonly idiopathic or caused by viral etiology (42-61%), following cardiac surgery (11-37%), radiation (2-31%), diseases of connective tissue (3-7%), infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (3-15%), other categories such as cancer, medications, trauma (1-10%)  etc.\n\n【11】Patients usually present with signs and symptoms of right heart failure and decreased cardiac output which include but are not limited to hepatic congestion leading to abdominal discomfort, peripheral edema, hepatojugular reflux, jugular venous distension, jaundice, dyspnea on exertion, pericardial knock, etc.\n\n【12】Initial workup for CP includes electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiograph and echocardiogram (ECHO) . One is likely to find nonspecific ST changes, tachycardia and low voltage (as seen in this patient), atrial fibrillation on EKG . A calcified ring around the heart on chest X-ray is most commonly seen in idiopathic causes of pericardial disease and according to a retrospective review is associated with longer lasting symptoms, likelihood of atrial arrhythmias and increased perioperative mortality . Echocardiogram is also useful in the diagnosis of CP. Some of the findings include septal bounce, no changes in venous return during inspiration, dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory collapse which were all seen in this patient.\n\n【13】KD is vasculitis common in childhood  which can result in cardiac complications such as aneurysms of the coronary artery, decreased contractility, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. The risk of CA aneurysm is decreased with the use of IVIG  which this patient received in a timely manner at the age of 8 years old. While KD can result in pericarditis and pericardial effusion in acute setting , there has been no direct causal relationship established between KD and CP especially in adults. One poster abstract that was presented at American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in 2017 did describe a case of CP as chronic sequela of undiagnosed KD . But not much has been published on the association between KD and CP.\n\n【14】The mainstay treatment of transient CP is symptomatic medical management with resolution of symptoms in some cases . In chronic CP however, pericardiectomy is the only definitive therapy . Early intervention has been shown to improve both early and late functional and survival outcome .\n\n【15】This case serves to illustrate the possibility of a new emerging cause of constrictive pericarditis. It also serves as a reminder for physicians and cardiologists to ask about signs and symptoms that might point to a background history of KD when CP is suspected in a patient presenting with right heart failure.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】This case showed CP in a young patient with history of treated KD. There is limited evidence in the literature on the association between the two diseases. More cases need to be published to establish this association. One should however consider CP as a sequela of KD in a young patient with no other etiology for the CP. It is possible that the same mechanism of inflammation in the coronary blood vessel that leads to coronary aneurysm also cause inflammation in the pericardium that leads to CP.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These drugs are superior in efficacy and survival benefit to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, the tumor becomes resistant to TKIs someday, and then progresses approximately 1 - 2 years after introduction of TKIs. Major acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs include T790M point mutation , overexpressed signaling of c-MET  and hepatocyte growth factor receptor . Transformation to other aggressive histological types such as small cell carcinoma is also one of minor resistant mechanisms .\n\n【2】Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma histologically consists of carcinomatous tumor and at least 10% of sarcomatoid tumor components . This tumor accounts for only 0.1-1.6% of all malignant lung tumors. It is highly resistant to chemotherapy and has unfavorable prognosis. However, it remains unknown whether EGFR-TKIs are effective against pleomorophic carcinoma harboring active EGFR mutation.\n\n【3】We herein report a case of possible resistance mechanism to EGFR-TKI by histopathological transformation from adenocarcinoma to pleomorphic carcinoma.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 65-year-old woman, a current smoker, visited our hospital because of persistent cough, back pain and enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node. The chest computed tomography detected a tumor in the left hilar portion .\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】She was diagnosed of adenocarcinoma (c-stage IV, c-T4N3M1b in the seventh edition of UICC-TNM classification) by trans-bronchial biopsy. The tumor was bronchoscopically visible at the left main bronchus. A L858R point mutation in the exon 21 was detected by the peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method (by LSI Medience Corporation, Tokyo). The histological specimen showed diffuse staining with mutation-specific antibody for L858R (clone 43B2 rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology, Massachusetts, USA) . Thereafter, gefitinib achieved partial response .\n\n【9】Twenty months after the initiation of gefitinib, when the tumor was already resistant to EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic chemotherapies, we performed re-biopsy from the intra-bronchial primary lung tumor in the left main bronchus. The tumor specimen showed pleomorphic carcinoma consisting of adenocarcinomatous component and sarcomatous component. Both components were positively stained with specific antibody for L858R point mutation . We did not detect T790M point mutation in the specimen by Cobas EGFR Mutation Test version 2 (by LSI Medience Corporation).\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】She started gefitinib in October 2014 and achieved partial response . However, we switched gefitinib to erlotinib 3 months after the initiation of gefitinib, because serum aspartate transaminase elevated up to 204 U/L. The primary tumor enlarged and we stopped erlotinib 9 months after the start of gefitinib. Thereafter, she received four cycles of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin and pemetrexed and subsequently three cycles of maintenance pemetrexed monotherapy. This cytotoxic regimen provided stable disease, but we found progressive disease in the primary tumor in the left lower lobe. Subsequent regimen of docetaxel monotherapy was discontinued because of enlarged primary tumor after the second cycles . At this time, we performed the second re-biopsy by bronchoscopy.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcome\n\n【13】Afatinib did not respond to the transformed tumor and resulted in progressive disease after 3 months of afatinib treatment. Thereafter, she received best supportive care alone, and died of cancer progression 23 months after the initiation of gefitinib.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】This case was interesting in that the pretreatment pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma, but post-treatment histology was pleomorphic carcinoma after progression to EGFR-TKIs. There were many case reports of pleomorphic carcinoma harboring active EGFR mutations at the diagnosis. However, to our knowledge, there were only three previous case reports in which, during the resistance process to EGFR-TKIs, the tumor had transformed histologically from adenocarcinoma to pleomorophic carcinoma  .\n\n【16】Our case suggested that transformation to more aggressive histological type, pleomorphic carcinoma, is a possible mechanism of drug resistance to EGFR-TKI. In our case, before and after EGFR-TKI and series of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, we bronchoscopically obtained tumor specimens from the same primary tumor. The histological comparison of these two specimens showed a change from adenocarcinoma to pleomorphic carcinoma. In the pleomorophic carcinoma obtained after EGFR-TKI, both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components retained EGFR L858R point mutation, but did not acquire T790M mutation.\n\n【17】A mechanism of histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to pleomorphic carcinoma may be various among cases. In a 65-year-old Japanese woman, transbronchial biopsy at diagnosis detected some spindle cells in the primarily adenocarcinomatous cells. Her autopsy specimens showed that the mutated EGFR immunohistochemically expressed only in the adenocarcinomatous component, but not in the spindle/sarcomatous components . In this case, heterogeneity of a main component of adenocarcinoma and a minor component of sarcomatous tumor in the original and primary tumor might be associated with resistance to gefitinib. In this speculation, sarcomatous tumor progressed against gefitinib, while adenocarcinoma component reduced by gefitinib. Thus, a main component might change from adenocarcinoma to pleomorphic carcinoma during gefitinib treatment. Another case of a 58-year-old Japanese man showed genetic heterogeneity of EGFR mutation status in the postmortem specimen. The sarcomatoid spindle cell component had both an exon 19 deletion and T790M point mutation of EGFR, while the adenocarcinomatous tumor component had only the exon19 deletion . The other 72-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in the primary lung tumor, but then encountered pleomorphic sarcoma in the femoral metastasis. Gefitinib managed to reduce her primary lung tumor and other metastatic lesions, but failed to control the femoral metastasis. The same types of mutations in EGFR (L858R) and TP53 (R181P) were genetically detected in both the lung and metastatic tumors . The latter two cases were similar to our case in that mutated EGFR expressed both in adenomatous and sarcomatous components. In a 60-year-old Japanese woman with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, EGFR L858R point mutation expressed both in separately microdissected specimens from adenocarcinoma and spindle cell components . According to the study by Chang, identical mutation of EGFR and p53 was observed both in carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in three of 42 patients with pleomorphic carcinomas . These findings suggested monoclonal histogenesis, which means that sarcomatous component is originated from carcinomatous component.\n\n【18】Our case included the following two limitations. 1) We did not evaluate next-generation sequencing and other possible resistant mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs, such as c-MET amplification, hepatocyte growth factor over-expression and K-ras mutation, because of time-related deterioration (more than 5 - 6.5 years after the first and second biopsy) and insufficient volume of the remaining biopsy specimens. 2) Our pathological diagnoses were based on tiny specimens obtained by transbronchial biopsy. Precise diagnosis of pleomorphic carcinoma requires larger specimen, but it is usually difficult to obtain it in advanced lung cancer.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】This case suggested that the transformation to pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma can be one of mechanisms of drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We report four new cases and describe clinical and pathological features of this entity.\n\n【2】Cases Report\n\n【3】Four patients with MTSCC of the kidney were diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 in Pathology Department, Farhat Hached hospital, Sousse, Tunisia. Data about clinical and radiological features as well as treatment modalities were extracted from medical records. Histological slides were reviewed and diagnosis of renal MTSCC was based on the criteria established by the WHO classification system . The 2002 pTNM (for pathologic Tumor Lymph Node and Metastasis ) classification system was used for pathologic staging .\n\n【4】The mean age at diagnosis was 50 years (range: 43 - 56 years). All patients were female without history of genitourinary or renal malignancy. Two patients presented with unilateral flank pain for 2 and 12 months duration. In 2 cases, tumor was asymptomatic and detected on ultrasonography. Imaging exploration (ultrasonography and computed tomography scan) showed a well-circumscribed renal mass  in all the cases (3 left-sided and 1 right-sided mass).\n\n【5】Radical nephrectomy was performed in two cases and partial nephrectomy in the two remaining cases. Macroscopically, tumors presented as solid grayish white well-demarcated unencapsulated nodules with foci of hemorrhage in 2 cases. There was no invasion in the surrounding perinephric fat or in the renal vein in the hilum. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm (range: 2.5 - 7 cm). The adjacent renal parenchyma was grossly unremarkable. The histological diagnosis of MTSCC was based on the criteria established by the WHO classification system. The microscopic analysis  showed epithelial elements separated by short fascicles of regular spindle cells. Epithelial elements arranged in microtubules and long cords in all cases. These tubules and cords were lined by cuboidal cells with no nuclear atypia. Mucinous change was evident in all cases particularly after alcian blue staining. No mitoses neither areas of necrosis were found. Immunohistochemical stains showed immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Adjuvant therapy was not performed. No recurrence or metastases have been detected during the follow-up period (mean: 31 months, range: 8 - 72 months). Table Isummarizes the clinical and pathological features and follow-up information of the four cases.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】MTSCC of the kidney is a rare and a recently described tumor. Until now, less than 60 cases have been reported . It occurs in adults, predominantly in women and is typically detected as an asymptomatic renal mass . Two of our patients had an asymptomatic tumor. On ultrasonography and computed tomography, the tumor is well-circumscribed and contained in the renal capsule. Grossly, MTSCC is usually a well-circumscribed tumor which presents as a single firm, homogenous, gray to brown mass at cut surface . All our cases had a well-circumscribed growth on computed tomography scan and on macroscopic examination. The histological diagnosis of MTSCC is based on the criteria established by the WHO classification system. The tumor is composed of cuboidal cells arranged in microtubules and long cords making abrupt transition to spindle morphology. These structures are arrayed in a mucinous or a myxoid stroma that reacts strongly with alcian blue . Nuclear atypia and mitoses are rare in both cuboïdal and spindle cells. Because of the presence of compact tubular architecture, focal papillations and mucin production, the MTSCC has some morphological similarities with papillary renal cell carcinoma particularly type 1 . This tumor can also be confused with the papillary renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid change, but in the MTSCC, spindle cells are arranged in parallel bundles with eosinophilic cytoplasm and low grade nuclei . Immunohistochemistry is not helpful in discriminating between papillary renal cell carcinoma and MTSCC and the morphological interpretation is still important in the distinction between these tumors. MTSCC of the kidney must also be distinguished from metanephric adenoma which shows cells having less cytoplasm and appears as a cellular blue tumor on microscopy; but the latter is usually negative for EMA and cytokeratin 7. The renal MTSCC has a relatively indolent behavior and the prognosis is favorable . In our cases, none of the patients developed recurrence or metastases with 31 months' mean follow-up. In summary, MTSCC of the kidney is a rare and distinctive subtype of renal cell carcinoma that must be differentiated from papillary renal cell carcinoma, especially with sarcomatoid change, which has a much poorer prognosis. Recognition of this histological variant is important because it can be mistaken for other neoplasm potentially resulting in suboptimal therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Bevacizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody which binds to and blocks the activity of all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Monoclonal antibodies, including rituximab, alemtuzumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab, have improved the treatment of various malignancies. Although generally better tolerated with less toxicity than conventional anticancer agents, monoclonal antibodies may cause infusion-related reactions like other infusional agents. The incidence of infusion reactions varies by agent, but severe events occur only occasionally, mostly with the first or second infusion. Although the exact etiology of infusion reactions remains unclear, they may arise via either IgE- or non-IgE-dependent mechanisms . Infusion reaction shows various symptoms: allergic reaction, arthralgia, bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, drug fever, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, hypotension/hypertension, nausea, pruritus, rash, tachycardia and bradycardia. However, bradycardia induced by bevacizumab-associated infusion reaction is a rare event, and its mechanism and precise incidence is still unknown. Here, we present a case of prolonged bradycardia induced by bevacizumab-associated infusion reaction in advanced metastatic colon cancer.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 71-year-old man complaining of bilateral leg edema and general fatigue for 4 months visited the Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital. He has no past history and allergic history. Laboratory examination revealed mild anemia, low albumin, mild liver dysfunction and high level tumor marker . Computed tomography (CT) was done to clarify the cause of the edema, which revealed that the patient was suffering from multiple liver and lung metastatic tumors. Thus, he underwent colonoscopy in order to detect the origin of the metastasis, which revealed advanced cancer in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy specimens showed tubular adenocarcinoma with K-ras mutation of G12S. Therefore, he was diagnosed as advanced sigmoid colon cancer with multiple liver and lung metastasis. After obtaining patient’s informed consent, 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4)/bevacizumab was started as a first-line therapy with admission. Operation was not performed prior to the chemotherapy, because there was not severe stenosis due to the colon cancer.\n\n【4】After being made of a central vein port, he underwent the first course of 80% dosed FOLFOX4/bevacizumab. He experienced grade-3 anorexia during this course, but spontaneously recovered. Three weeks after the first infusion of FOLFOX4/bevacizumab, he underwent the second course of FOLFOX4/bevacizumab with 60% dosed FOLFOX4. During this course, just after finishing infusion of bevacizumab, he felt severe thrill with chill and got fever of 38.1 °C. Since the symptom was diagnosed as an infusion reaction induced by bevacizumab, the chemotherapy was immediately ceased and treatment with steroid, and histamine antagonist (200 mg hydrocortisone sodium succinate, 5 mg d-chlorpheniramine maleate and 20 mg famotidine) was performed. His symptom disappeared soon after the treatment, and FOLFOX4 was resumed from the next day morning. However, his heart rate came lower below 50/min 5 h after the infusion reaction (his heart rate was routinely around 60/min ). Severe bradycardia (< 40/min) continues at least 9 h on the next day of the infusion reaction . There was no abnormality of electrolyte data on the previous day of the infusion reaction . The bradycardia did not accompany blood pressure reduction or any symptom such as loss of consciousness. Figure 3 shows the course of the treatment of the second course FOLFOX4 plus bevacizumab.\n\n【5】The third course of FOLFOX4/bevacizumab was started 2 weeks after the second course. From the third course, bevacizumab was infused in 90 min with premedication (13.2 mg dexamethasone, 5 mg d-chlorpheniramine maleate and 20 mg famotidine) in order to prevent the recurrence of the infusion reaction. Total of 18 courses of FOLFOX4/bevacizumab were able to be performed without any infusion reaction until his disease was diagnosed as progressive disease with CT.\n\n【6】Cardiac function was evaluated 3 months after the infusion reaction in order to assess the effect of the previous severe bradycardia. The 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed mild bradycardia (48/min) with first degree atrium-venticle block. Holter-electrocardiogram also revealed first degree atrium-venticle block with heart rate of between 40/min and 81/min. The echocardiography revealed normal ejection fraction of 64% and mild aortic regurgitation with normal wall motion.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Infusion reactions are the generic term for the acute characteristic harmful reactions commonly associated with monoclonal antibody treatment . Infusion reaction induced by bevacizumab is relatively rare. It was reported to occur in < 3% of patients during the first infusion of bevacizumab . Focusing on the symptom of bradycardia, the incidence was very low; 0.13% (4/3,109) of the patient experienced bradycardia induced by bevacizumab in Japan according to the interview form of bevacizumab in Japan .\n\n【9】In this case, mild bradycardia with first degree atrium-venticle block was observed even 3 months after the infusion reaction. Only one paper implied the relation between bevacizumab and bradycardia in PubMed , but the mechanism of the bradycardia induced by the infusion reaction and the reason why the bradycardia prolonged were still unknown. The exact mechanism responsible for infusion reactions to monoclonal antibodies is still not known. Monoclonal antibodies may interact with their molecular targets on circulating blood cells, tumor cells or effector cells recruited to the tumor site, thereby promoting the release of inflammatory cytokines, which can produce a wide range of symptoms such as bradycardia .\n\n【10】In summary, bradycardia induced by bevacizumab-associated infusion reaction is a rare event, but should be carefully followed up and observed with admission if necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "cb6559da-4393-4445-902b-95ab0f4e397a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common presentation of aortic valve disease in the Western world, with an increasing prevalence as the population ages . Nearly 4% of all adults 75 years of age or older have moderate or severe AS, which is characterized by a long latency period associated with high mortality after symptom onset . Although surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the definitive treatment of calcific AS, many patients do not undergo surgery because of prohibitive comorbidities. Three-year survival rates among symptomatic patients with severe AS who do not undergo AVR may be as low as 25% . Lately, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been suggested as a less invasive treatment for high-risk patients with AS . However, poor clinical status and anatomical restrictions could prevent TAVI performance. In these settings, balloon aortic valvoplasty (BAV) could be an alternative to provide temporary symptomatic and hemodynamic benefit . Here, we report a case of percutaneous BAV in a patient who developed cardiogenic shock and had clinical and technical contraindications to AVR and TAVI.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 74-year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of dyspnoea, associated with orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, extreme generalized edema and caquexy (BMI = 15.4 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), with repeated hospitalizations. He had history of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, stable coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, with a baseline serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, and previous coronary arterial bypass grafting surgery. Despite aggressive medical therapy, he remained in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV. Due to worsening of symptoms, the patient was hospitalized at our institution.\n\n【4】The initial electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block with normal heart rate.\n\n【5】A bedside echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. The aortic valve was heavily calcified and severely stenotic with a valve area of 0.7 cm <sup>2 </sup> , maximum transvalvular pressure gradient of 66 mm Hg and medium of 40 mm Hg .\n\n【6】The thoracic abdominal CT presented plaques with mobile thrombi in the descending aorta and inadequate valvular annulus size and shape for anchorage of percutaneous prosthesis .\n\n【7】Cardiac angiography demonstrated native arteries occluded and patent bypass graftings.\n\n【8】EuroSCORE and STS scoring system were calculated and registered rates of overall mortality of 33% and 42%, respectively. Due to the high surgical risk and technical inability to TAVI treatment, the multidisciplinary team recommended percutaneous BAV.\n\n【9】During the hospitalization, the patient evolved with clinical deterioration, and signs of severe cardiogenic shock, with oliguria and worsening of renal function, hypotension and finally to torpor, with no improvement with the use of endovenous inotropes. Thus, BAV was performed urgently. Interestingly, the patient presented immediate improvement in the hemodynamic status, an excellent recovery of mental status and renal function. This first procedure resulted in the reduction of maximum transvalvular pressure gradient of 100 to 50 mm Hg . The patient was discharged 7 days later. He needed a second BAV 3 months later, and again there was a reduction of maximum transvalvular pressure gradient of 35 to 20 mm Hg with attenuation of heart failure symptoms.\n\n【10】After 24-month follow-up, the patient remains on class II of the NYHA functional classification with improvement in general clinical status.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】AVR is the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic AS. AVR offers substantial improvements in symptoms and life expectancy . However, situations in which the valve replacement is unfeasible to perform, TAVI and percutaneous BAV are alternative options to selected patients. TAVI is a good alternative but it still challenges some problems, especially related to the high costs, technical difficulties in patients with diseased femoral access and also due to the size and shape of the aortic annulus of some patients, which may complicate the anchorage of the prosthesis and cause paravalvular leak, which is one of the greatest problems to clinical outcomes. Besides, atrio-ventricular blocks with the need of pacemakers are another frequent complication of this procedure. Of note, in developing countries, the high cost of the percutaneous prosthesis is a major issue that poses conflicts and difficulties to the indication to a substantial number of patients.\n\n【13】Percutaneous BAV is another treatment option to patients with severe AS with clear benefits, but with some other challenges. This technique was developed as a nonsurgical option in the 1980s . It was used to manage unstable and critically ill patients such as those in cardiogenic shock or refractory heart failure. As the number of very elderly patients with this disease increases, especially those in whom surgical options are not available, an effective and less invasive treatment of severe AS is essential. About one-third of patients with severe AS are not referred for valve replacement surgery because of the risks perceived by both patients and physicians. Furthermore, a consistent limitation for this therapy among younger patients with greater longevity was the high restenosis rate and the need for reintervention. BAV was thus found to be of limited utility for many of these patients who were acceptable candidates for AVR .\n\n【14】Although the literature shows that BAV is associated with serious complications in historical series, currently the rates of complications have decreased substantially . When executed by experienced hands, in order just to improve hemodynamic status, due to the fact that even little improvements in the orifice area turn into great improvements in the transvalvular gradient, this translates into lesser rates of severe complications. One special consideration of BAV is the fact that restenosis and clinical worsening with the need of a second BAV procedure may occur 6 - 12 months after the first procedure . Actually, some investigators have suggested repeated BAV because its results might also improve survival rates over a single dilatation, which might merit further evaluation in clinical trials .\n\n【15】As a consequence, all inoperable patients who are eligible for this procedure should receive it as soon as possible. Therefore, we can offer to most of these remaining no-option patients a low-cost and relatively safe procedure in experienced hands, associated with significant immediate hemodynamic and clinical improvement, and with an improvement in quality of life. Pain control and palliative service are an important part of medical care, and BAV might well fit within this area even in the era of TAVI .\n\n【16】Thus, BAV can be used successfully to improve the health of some nonsurgical patients with severe symptomatic AS. The use of BAV for palliation of symptoms has been undervalued in this difficult-to-treat patient group.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

High prolactin levels, secondary to a number of iatrogenic and medical conditions, may explain the cause for some of these idiopathic thrombi. In this paper, we report a case of hyperprolactinemia as a potential cause of pulmonary embolism (PE) and review the literature to elucidate the connection between high prolactin levels and increased thrombotic risk.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 68-year-old female presented with sudden onset of dyspnea on exertion and frontal headaches, mainly in the mornings. On physical examination, she was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Routine labs were positive for an elevated troponin. Imaging studies with an echocardiogram and computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest showed right heart strain and confirmed a diagnosis of sub-massive PE. She was then admitted to the hospital for initiation of anticoagulation and observation. A CT scan of the head performed for morning headaches showed a mass lesion on the right side of the pituitary fossa. Given imaging findings of a PE and a pituitary mass, additional laboratory studies were obtained. A hypercoagulable workup including levels of protein S, protein C, homocysteine, anti-phospholipid antibodies (e.g. lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein antibodies), prothrombin G20210A mutation, and factor V Leiden mutation was negative. Pituitary hormone levels obtained in existence of the pituitary mass were within normal levels, with exception to a markedly elevated prolactin of 270.9 ng/mL (4.8 - 23.3 ng/mL).\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Prolactin is commonly known for its effects on human milk production, but it also plays a key role in a number of other cellular processes. Prolactin acts in a cytokine-like manner to regulate cell cycle related functions such as growth, differentiation and apoptosis. These cytokine-mediated functions influence hematopoiesis and angiogenesis and are involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways . High prolactin levels caused by pituitary tumors, prescription drugs, paraneoplastic processes, hypothyroidism, and substances like marijuana may explain the cause for some cases of idiopathic thrombosis.\n\n【6】Although the data are somewhat limited, results have indicated that elevated prolactin levels may be associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Wallaschofski et al demonstrated higher prolactin levels in patients with thrombosis without an identified congenital or acquired hypercoagulable state compared to patients with a thrombus explained by a congenital and acquired hypercoagulable state and in healthy subjects. Based on this research, platelets express a prolactin receptor which plays a role in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. As evidenced by platelet aggregation studies, no clotting took place with prolactin alone and modest platelet aggregation was seen with ADP alone. However, when platelets were incubated with prolactin in combination with ADP, a cumulative effect was seen on platelet aggregation which was more pronounced than with each agent alone. In addition, more robust platelet aggregation was seen with increasing concentrations of prolactin. Furthermore, epinephrine co-stimulation of platelets exposed to prolactin and ADP induced marked platelet aggregation suggesting prolactin’s effect on the Gi-protein-coupled pathway associated with the P2Y12 ADP receptor .\n\n【7】In 2012, Stuijver et al reported results of a case-control study evaluating prolactin in relation to coagulation factors as a risk of VTE. This study demonstrated that patients with prolactin levels > 150 µg/L had a concomitant increase in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. Patients with prolactin levels in the 99th - 100th percentile (> 42.6 µg/L) had an increased risk of developing a VTE (odds ratio 1.4), compared to subjects with a prolactin level in the 0 - 1st percentile (< 3.4 µg/L) (odds ratio 0.8). These patients were more prone to developing pulmonary emboli rather than deep venous thrombosis with odds ratios of 1.8 versus 1.2, respectively .\n\n【8】In our patient, elevated prolactin secondary to a prolactinoma remained the most likely etiology of VTE given a negative history and workup for other causes. Literature investigating prolactin’s effect on ADP-mediated platelet aggregation along with clinical scenarios in which elevated prolactin is the only sound explanation for a venous thrombosis may make it a novel risk factor which should be evaluated following a patient history indicative of a prolactin derangement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These inflammatory diseases are associated with disabling pain, functional limitation and consequent impact on the quality of patients’ lives. Failure to treat them properly in a timely manner can lead to irreversible damage and permanent disability . Biologic therapy became a crucial part of the treatment approach. Each of them is catalogued according to its action target, and its benefit is reached at least partially to specific and targeted inhibition of key cytokines and cytokine pathways . They include inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), such as etanercept, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and non-TNF inhibitors including interleukin-1 (anakinra), interleukin-6 receptor (tocilizumab, TCZ ), CD80/86 (abatacept), and B lymphocyte (rituximab) .\n\n【2】Prior to the decision on the initiation of biological therapy, its harm must be weighed against its benefits for the patient with systemic disease. Fortunately, in general, TNF inhibitors are associated with low levels of infection associated with the use of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1 - 1.5) .\n\n【3】TCZ is a recombinant humanized interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as monotherapy or in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Clinical and post-marketing surveillance studies of TCZ indicate that infections are the most frequent adverse events . Most of the serious infections described are bacterial and viral, with no uncommon pathogens. Also, a longer disease duration, higher number of previous DMARDs and previous use of rituximab are identified as predictors of infection .\n\n【4】TCZ suppresses the production of proinflammatory acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which raises a major concern that infections may be detected later and with presenting misleading clinical pictures .\n\n【5】The authors report a patient with cerebral nocardiosis under TCZ and methotrexate.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】We present a case of a 71-year-old female, living in an urban area, who had a previous 17 years evolving-history of destructive rheumatoid arthritis. Important involvement of small and large articulations led to progressive increase and adjustment of medication with methotrexate and high doses of corticosteroids. Because the disease was still active and disabling after full dose of conventional DMARDs, biological treatment with TCZ was instituted in 2011, finally achieving remission with subcutaneous TCZ, 162 mg per week, associated with systemic corticotherapy, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine.\n\n【8】She presented in the emergency room after experiencing vomits, headache and dizziness for 4 days. Physical examination identified diplopy, horizontal nystagmus, right conjugated eye palsy, right dysmetria and occipital pain with anterior neck flexion. Computed tomography (CT) showed a nodular cortico-subcortical intraparenchymal right cerebellar hemispheric lesion, with a 4-cm longer axis, and irregular contrast captation in a ring enhancing pattern, associated with vasogenic edema, cerebellar parenchymal and brainstem deformation and right tonsillar descendence . Magnetic resonance confirmed a single right cerebellar lesion with marked diffusion restriction and aspects suggestive of cerebellar abscess. Surgical image-guided drainage was performed, with recollection of purulent exudate allowing microbiologic isolation of Nocardia sp. specifically Nocardia farcinica identified with molecular technique .\n\n【9】At this point, she was already under antibiotherapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (15 mg/kg IV per day) plus imipenem (500 mg IV per day), and since the patient had no other symptoms indicative of a primary local of infection, a full body CT was performed. It revealed multiple lung nodules, the largest with 5/6 mm of diameter; interstitial upper right lobe thickening; and small volume bilateral pleural effusion. Bronchofibroscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage microbiologic studies was performed but no isolation was obtained, probably because antibiotic therapy was already initiated. Despite that, the complete resolution of pleural effusion and interstitial thickening in a revaluation CT was suggestive of pulmonary nocardiosis, which is congruent with the fact that lung is the most common point of entry for nocardial infection.\n\n【10】The patient had a fast symptomatic relieve with surgical drainage and high dose systemic corticotherapy. Control imaging showed regression of the abscess and resolution of signs of edema and secondary mass effect, and the patient was discharge after 6 weeks of intravenous double antibiotherapy with imipenem and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and indication for maintaining oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim to complete a full year treatment for invasive nocardial disease.\n\n【11】At the 5 months post-discharge evaluation, the patient was still under oral antibiotic treatment, remaining free from neurological symptoms and normal CT scan , but with impaired functioning and quality of life secondary to arthritis reactivation. Corticoids and methotrexate were carefully reintroduced, under clinical and imagiologic tight surveillance, with partial response.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Nocardia species are ubiquitous bacteria that usually manifest as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts. It can be found in soil, organic matter and fresh and salt water. There are more than 50 species identified and at least 30 species are pathogenic, leading to a challenging taxonomy. Nocardia asteroids is the more implicated in human infection and includes N. asteroides sensu stricto, N. farcinica, N. cyriacigeorgica, N. nova, and N. abscessus .\n\n【14】These bacteria are usually responsible for infection in immunocompromised patients, but one-third of nocardia infections are in immunocompetent patients. Patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity are at high risk for infection, including those suffering from human immunodeficiency virus infection, solid-organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant and those receiving long-term treatment with steroids or other medications that suppress cell-mediated immunity . In fact, cellular immunity is central in controlling nocardial infection and abscess formation. Also, nocardial infection is a continuous trigger neutrophil recruitment for abscess formation, preventing successful clearance of infection .\n\n【15】The infection is acquired by inhalation or direct contact with the bacteria and consequent primary pulmonary or skin disease. Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common presentation. It can occur hematogenous dissemination causing extrapulmonary nocardiosis. Disseminated nocardiosis is defined as two or more non-contiguous sites of involvement that may or may not include a pulmonary infection .\n\n【16】The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common extrapulmonary location for nocardiosis and it could appear in the form of meningitis or brain abscess. It can present with nausea, vomiting, seizures, or alteration in consciousness, gradually or with acute presentation, usually does not exhibit symptoms such as fever, and it can be accompanied by other system infections .\n\n【17】Nocardial abscesses can be single or multiple and normally are located at supratentorial lobe but virtually can occur in any region of the brain . The definitive diagnosis of nocardial infection is obtained from specimen culture and microscopic examination. The bacteria normally grow on non-selective media routinely used but, in specimens containing mixed flora, nocardia colonies can be obscured by other rapidly growing bacteria .\n\n【18】Nocardia farcinica brain abscess has a high mortality rate, at least 50% in immunocompromised patients . The risk of CNS infection is higher for N. farcinica than for other species (from 15% to 30%) associated with high mortality rates. It seems to be more virulent and tends to disseminate more frequently . So, it is vital to identify specific nocardia species because many strains are multidrug resistant to antibiotics. Hence, because of this sensitivity, appropriate specimen collection and treatment are vital . In this case, an early diagnosis with prompt identification of nocardia species allowed an adequate antibiotherapy with a good result.\n\n【19】Nocardiosis is a complication in patients under biologic therapy. As reviewed, there are 10 cases described in literature, all under anti-TNF therapy . To our knowledge, this is the first described case of nocardiosis in a patient under TCZ. The randomized controlled trials of TCZ described several infectious, bacterial and viral mostly and only a few associated to opportunist pathogens. So, it is not reported an increased infectious risk with TCZ compared with placebo and the rate of serious infectious is in the range observed with other biologics . This case raises the concern about mechanism behind opportunist infection and how to reach an early diagnosis. With IL-6 suppression, it is expected a risk increase, once IL-6 and CRP pay an important role in acute phase response and action against different microorganisms. Consequently, infections are at risk of a late diagnosis because of the masking effect.\n\n【20】Despite the therapy with TCZ at the moment of infection, the reported patient had an actual and past of immunosuppressors that rise the cumulative risk of serious infection in association to a longer disease duration and previous use of rituximab which are identified as predictors of infection . The actual contribution of TCZ to infection susceptibility is yet to know, as its use experience rises.\n\n【21】Most clinical trials reported the safety of TCZ; either way, this case report highlights the importance of a cautious therapy decision and close follow-up during all treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although the ascending graviceptive pathway (GP) from the vestibular nuclei to the Cajal interstitial nucleus crosses the midline in the caudal pons, just above the level of the vestibular nuclei , its precise location remains uncertain in the rostral pons. Here, we describe two cases of BL with involvement of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) due to rostral pontine tegmentum infarction. The neurologic symptoms in these two cases are very useful for determining of the location of GP.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Patient 1\n\n【4】An 80-year-old man without contributory medical history suddenly presented with leftward BL, right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and left-sided hypalgesia and thermohypoesthesia in the territory of the maxillary as well as mandibular nerve in August 2012. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. Laboratory examination was within normal ranges. Chest X-ray finding was normal. Electrocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a small infarction in the rostral ponine tegmentum on the right side . Cranial MR angiography finding was normal. Two days of intravenous argatroban hydrate therapy 60 mg/day was initiated. Thereafter, 5 days of argatroban hydrate 20 mg/day underwent, the patient became gradually asymptomatic.\n\n【5】Patient 2\n\n【6】A 56-year-old woman with essential hypertension abruptly presented with rightward BL, left-sided non-paralytic pontine exotropia (NPPE) without alternating exotropia, and comitant skew deviation with left-sided hypertropia  in August 2013. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. Laboratory examination was within normal ranges. Chest X-ray finding was normal. Electrocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging demonstrated a small infarction in the rostral ponine tegmentum on the left side . Cranial MR angiography finding was normal. Under ozagrel sodium 160 mg/day, the patient became gradually asymptomatic within 7 days.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Yi et al  reported five cases of BL due to rostral pontine tegmentum infarction, and the direction of BL was to the side opposite the lesions in all cases. Moreover, because unilateral INO was observed in four of these five cases, the authors speculated that GP might run in the vicinity of the MLF . Tsuda et al  noted a case of BL with hypalgesia and thermophypoesthesia in the territory of all divisions of the trigeminal nerve caused by a rostral pontine tegmentum infarction, and stated that GP might run in the vicinity of the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons. In our present patient 1, in addition to leftward BL, right-sided INO and left-sided hypalgesia and thermohypoesthesia in the territory of the maxillary as well as mandibular nerve was caused by infarction in the right rostral pontine tegmentum. This neurologic finding denoted that GP might run in between MLF and the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons.\n\n【9】NPPE is defined as unilateral INO with exotropia of the contralateral eye . NPPE without alternating exotropia is caused by complete involvement of the MLF as well as incomplete damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) . On the other hand, comitant skew deviation may be induced by abnormalities in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum and thalamus, and is considered as a poorly localizing sign of posterior fossa dysfunction . However, because comitant skew deviation with INO frequently develops, it is considered that damage to the MLF may cause comitant skew deviation . In our present patient 2, in addition to rightward BL, left-sided NPPE without alternating exotropia, and comitant skew deviation were observed. These neuro-ophthalmologic findings suggested that GP might run in the vicinity of MLF as well as PPRF in the rostral pons.\n\n【10】In conclusion, we emphasize that GP may run in between the MLF and ventral trigemino-thalamic tract as well as in the vicinity of PPRF in the rostral pons, based on the neurologic symptoms of our two patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are mainly used for their purported health benefits and are thought to exert their beneficial effects with minimal adverse reactions. In countries such as China, South Korea, and Japan, herbal soups are used as critical emergency drugs in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic and complicated diseases . A previous study indicates that adverse effects of herbal preparations occur in 7.6% of cases and that most cases are of mild poisoning. Nevertheless, occasional cases of severe herbal poisoning, resulting in fatality, have also been reported . We present a case of life-threatening polymorphic and bidirectional ventricular tachyarrhythmias with left bundle-branch block that occurred after the ingestion of herbal decoction prepared from the root stocks of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient was a 48-year-old previously healthy female who was admitted to our institution with sudden onset of severe palpitation, tingling sensation all over the body (paraesthesia), weakness, dizziness, significant shortness of breath, chest tightness, and discomfort in the cardiac region. On admission, the patient had hypotension (blood pressure 76/46 mm Hg), was fully alert, and showed no signs of focal neurological or cerebellar disorders other than numbness in all limbs. Results of laboratory tests, including tests for liver and kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood biochemistry, were normal. Electrocardiography revealed bidirectional ventricular tachycardia and left bundle-branch block, with a heart rate of 187 beats/min .\n\n【4】Positive rehydration was initiated to restore the patient’s blood pressure level to normalcy. However, the patient showed signs of loss of mental alertness and decrease in rate of carotid pulse to around 30 - 40/min. Therefore, the patient was administered a bolus of 1 mg epinephrine and continuous chest compressions. Lidocaine was then administered as an intravenous bolus of 100 mg, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 2 mg/min. Ten minutes later, amiodarone (150 mg) was slowly infused for over 15 min. However, sinus rhythm could not be restored. Then, synchronized, biphasic direct current shock of 100 J was applied for cardioversion. With this, the patient regained consciousness, her blood pressure was 186/109 mm Hg, heart rate was 122 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 18 cycles/min. The electrocardiogram obtained thereafter was normal .\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Herbal soups have been widely used in Chinese medicine and are popular as health tonics among Chinese communities as good alternatives to conventional medicines. However, the safety and efficacy of herbal preparations have not been adequately evaluated, partly because of a lack of a thorough understanding of pharmacology of Chinese medicines, which makes their widespread use difficult .\n\n【7】Fuzi is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal formulation used widely since nearly 800 years. In Chinese medicine, it is used to dispel wind, remove dampness, relieve pain, and improve immunity and functioning of the nervous system. Clinically, it has been used to improve clinical microcirculation, heart failure, high blood pressure, and other diseases . The main adverse effects of Fuzi are cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. A previous study has shown that between 2006 and 2010, 123 male and 33 female patients were treated for aconitum poisoning after consumption of herbal soups and meals, with a high proportion of patients developing stroke and fatal arrhythmia (14.3%). Aconitine, mesaconitine, and hypaconitine are the main toxic principles in Fuzi, but the concentration of toxic elements in Fuzi is very low (less than 1%). It has been reported that aconitine is toxic at a dose of 0.12 mg and above and fatal at doses of 3 - 5 mg .\n\n【8】The toxic effects of aconitine are attributed to excitation of the membrane caused by increased Na <sup>+ </sup> inflow and subsequent inhibition by prolonged depolarization due to the increased Na <sup>+ </sup> inflow . In addition, the neurotoxic effects of aconitine include bradyarrhythmia and hypotension. Aconitine causes the release of large amounts of acetylcholine and stimulation of the vagus nerve, leading to compromised sinus node function; it may also directly inhibit the excitation of atrioventricular or ventricular ectopic pacemaker .\n\n【9】The symptoms in this case can be attributed to the consumption of a lethal dose of aconitine and the fact that patient did not cook the soup for the prescribed duration of 4 - 24 h, thereby leading to increased toxicity of aconitine.\n\n【10】Ventricular arrhythmia is frequently reported to be caused by aconitine, but bundle-branch block due to aconitine, as observed in this case, has rarely been reported. Since the number of cases reported is limited, the optimal treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachycardia caused by aconitine remains unclear; further, no specific antidote to aconitine has been identified. Studies have shown that amiodarone can effectively restore sinus rhythm in feline models of aconitine-induced atrial arrhythmia. Similarly, some surveys have shown that amiodarone can successfully restore sinus rhythm in cases of ventricular arrhythmias; however, the optimal dosage, method, and time of administration are unclear .\n\n【11】Thus, our case report shows that a combined treatment approach of amiodarone administration and application of synchronized, biphasic direct current shock can help manage aconitine-induced ventricular tachycardia. This may imply that combination treatment may be useful in such cases although multi-center, large-scale studies are necessary to confirm the most effective treatment protocol for aconitine-induced ventricular tachycardia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Translocations are the most frequently encountered in structural anomalies at 1/500 frequency. Translocations are divided into three sub-groups as reciprocal, centric fusion (Robertsonian) and insertional. Reciprocal translocations are formed by means of breakage in non-homolog chromosomes and the mutual change of location of the broken fragments. If after the translocation there is no loss of the fragments transmitted due to translocation or if a fragment is not added to the genome as an extra, this is called a balanced translocation. Reciprocal translocations do not mostly give phenotypic findings in event that they are balanced. However, phenotypic influence can be seen in the children of these individuals, subject to the partial monosomy or partial trisomy in the relevant chromosomes .\n\n【2】One of the reasons of most frequent application to Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology is short stature. The major reasons scope familial short stature, constitutional delay, systematic diseases, lack of nutrition and endocrine disorders . Chromosomal examination is required for cases whose reason cannot be detected and especially has a dysmorphic appearance.\n\n【3】In this study, a case which was applied to the Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology for due to growth and development delay in which balanced reciprocal translocation scoping the 16 and 22 numbered chromosomes in a cytogenetic analysis conducted in the Genetic Diagnosis Laboratory was detected.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Our patient was a 12-year-old boy who had applied to the Polyclinics of Pediatric Endocrinology due to underdevelopment and short stature which was observed in four years. It was seen in the detailed family history that there is no member having a similar complaint. The patient’s, who has a neuromotor development in accordance with his peers, body weight was measured as 23 kg (< 3% percentile) and height as 124 cm (< 3% percentile). The bone age of the patient, who was assessed as prepubertal, was determined as 9. The hemogram, liver and kidney functionalty tests, serum electrolytes, urine and stool examinations in the laboratory examinations were normal. No significant finding was observed during the examinations for endocrine, infection and malabsorption.\n\n【6】A genetic examination was requested to determine the reason of the short stature. It was determined that the patient had a 46, XY, t(16;22) chromosome constitution . The pedigree of the patient was issued and a chromosome analysis was performed his relatives, who could be reached, so as to determine the origin of the reciprocal translocation. It was determined that the patient’s mother (II-7) and the mother’s father (I-3) had the same chromosome constitution and the father, brother and sister had a normal karyotype . With the available findings, the patient was diagnosed with constitutional short stature.\n\n【7】Peripheral blood was taken under sterile circumstanced with a heparinised injector from each case for the chromosome analysis and the whole blood technique, which is the modified technique of the macro-culture technique developed by Moorhead et al. was applied . The preparations were stained with the Giemsa Banding Technique (GTG) and the chromosomes in the 30 - 50 metaphase plate was evaluated in terms of the numerical and structural anomalies and a karyotype was made from 25 banded metaphases. The cytogenetic analysis results were reported according to ISCN 1995 .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】It is expected that the breakages leading to the formation of balanced translocations do not cause great piece loss in the chromosomes, consequently, that there will not much gene loss in the person and no change will occur in the phenotype of the person. Nevertheless, apparently balanced translocations form a widespread type of chromosomal anomalies that can be seen both in patients that have an abnormal phenotype and healthy individuals that have not been influenced. Approximately one fifth of these anomalies, which are mostly familial, is de novo . The risk of finding abnormal phenotypes in individuals having de novo regulation is approximately 6.7% . There are balanced translocations holding different chromosomes associated with short stature or development delay are available in literature . Cytogenetically balanced reciprocal translocation is also observed in our case that has short stature exists. According to the literature data at hand, this case is the first balanced reciprocal translocation case scoping 16 and 22 chromosomes with structural short stature.\n\n【10】Finding the same translocation in our case’s mother and mother’s father, who have normal phenotypes, however both of them having a normal height during their childhood ages, makes our patient even more interesting. Along with complying with structural short stature with the available findings, we wonder what the final height will be.\n\n【11】Even under the best of circumstances, changes under 4 kb (kilobasis) cannot be analysed with chromosome analysis . The familial balanced translocation’s phenotypic affects can change due to imbalanced de novo regulations on a molecular level, uniparental disomy associated with translocationed chromosomes, disruption of genes located in the breakpoints, translocation indicating mosaicism in another tissue or modification of expression of the gene carried somewhere else in the genome . Hence, Baptista et al.  have stated that as a result of the study in which they have conducted the molecular cytogenetic analysis of breakpoints in balanced reciprocal translocation carriers by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array CGH methods, balanced reciprocal translocations do not bear imbalance in breakpoints in phenotypically normal patients and that the breakpoints in the translocations of patients, who are phenotypically abnormal, is mainly associated with cryptic imbalances. In addition to this, the mutations in the SHOX (Short Stature Homeobox) gene located in the pseudoaotomosal regions of the X and Y chromosomes’ short arms are held responsible of idiopathic short stature . In our case, a mutation that has occurred in the SHOX gene independently from reciprocal translocation may have also led too short stature. It was planned to research the translocation on a molecular level in our patient, however, the family has refused to this request to do socio-economic reasons. The answer to whether or not the translocation has left damage on a molecular level has not been found, however, the patient has been taken under periodic monitoring.\n\n【12】As a result, balanced reciprocal translocation may appear under a specific part of structural short statures. However, in order to give a healthy genetic counseling to individuals who have abnormal phenotypes such as short stature in which balanced reciprocal translocation is detected in the chromosome analysis, advanced molecular cytogenetic and molecular genetic methods should be referred to especially for the breakpoints regions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Unusual locations such as posterior mediastinum or lower neck (ectopic thyroid thymoma) have been described .\n\n【2】Thymomas are slightly more common in males and their prevalence increases with advanced age, reaching a peak during the seventh decade of life . Others have found a peak incidence during the sixth and seventh decade of life . Their clinical presentation and prognosis depend on histology and stage. Indeed, thymomas are a diverse group of epithelial neoplasms with a natural history spectrum that extends from indolent to lethal thymic carcinomas. A third of them are discovered serendipitously due to the frequent utilization of chest radiographs or CT for screening purposes or for imaging of other conditions. The remainder present clinically with symptoms due to invasion or compression of intrathoracic structures, distant metastases, or paraneoplastic syndromes . One third of thymoma patients will present with an invasive or advanced unresectable disease .\n\n【3】The coexistence of thymomas with numerous paraneoplastic syndromes and second primary cancers is well documented. Indeed, several studies have corroborated that thymomas are associated with one or more non-thymic neoplasms with a reported incidence rate of up to 33% .\n\n【4】In this context, we present a case of a voluminous thymic carcinoma extending to the thyroid region with neck node metastases. Interestingly, a thyroid papillary carcinoma was also concomitantly diagnosed.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 42-year old woman presented with a midline cervical mass and worsening dyspnea. She noticed that the lesion was rapidly growing. Past medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined mass in the thyroid gland area extending downwards to the thoracic inlet. Enlarged cervical and supra-clavicular nodes were also noticed. A contrast-enhanced CT-scan confirmed the aforementioned clinical findings, and additionally revealed that this heterogeneous, space-occupying mass, measuring 5.7 to 6.6 cm was encroaching the anterior mediastinum structures and displacing the trachea . Moreover enlarged paratracheal and prevascular lymph nodes were found. A total thyroidectomy with neck dissection was performed. Pathology of the thyroid revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma, but cervical node pathology was consistent with a thymic carcinoma (WHO type C) with neuroendocrine features. Cancer cells were positive for EMA, AE1/AE3, p53, TTF-1, NSE and Ki-67, cKit was also over-expressed in some cells, while staining for CD56, chromogranin and synaptophysin were negative. Hence, the coexistence of two neoplasms was established; an indolent thyroid cancer along with an aggressive stage IVb thymic carcinoma. Serum tumor marker NSE was 4.7 ng/ml (normal range 0 - 17 ng/ml) and CYFRA 21-1 was increased at 60.9 ng/ml (normal range 0 - 3.3 ng/ml). Further diagnostic workup including bronchoscopy and scintigraphy were negative. Given the neuroendocrine features of her thymic carcinoma, patient was initially treated with three cycles of cisplatin and etoposide without a response.\n\n【7】Three cycles of CAP-P regimen (cisplatin 50 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , adriamycin 50 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , prednisone 100 mg/day every three weeks) were administered. Treatment was well tolerated and produced an objective partial response after the 2nd cycle. At that time, adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended, but the patient declined further treatment. Three months later, she complained of headache. A brain CT showed several ring enhancing lesions that displaced the midline structures. Four of them involved the cerebral cortex bilaterally (right frontal, parietal, occipital and left parietal). A fifth lesion was located in the left cerebellum displacing the tentorium cerebelli. No herniation was noted. The patient received palliative cranial irradiation.\n\n【8】At 5 months post diagnosis, hepatic and bone metastases as well as local progression were evident. Patient died of disease progression 2 months later.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Thymomas represent a rare but also heterogeneous gamut of epithelial neoplasms with a natural history spectrum that extends from indolent thymomas to aggressive thymic carcinomas. Their clinical presentation depends on histology, stage and the existence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Increased tumor size and presence of calcifications is usually associated with invasive tumors of more advanced stage .\n\n【11】An association between thymomas and other extrathymic malignancies has been noted in several case reports and case-control studies as early as 50 years ago .\n\n【12】In a review of 598 patients with a thymoma diagnosis the additional, other than thymoma, cancer incidence rate was 17% . The Relative Risk of extra-thymic diseases was six times higher in patients with thymomas compared with patients with parathyroid adenomas who were used as controls.\n\n【13】In another series of 46 thymomas, four additional neoplasms (9%) were found . Papillary thyroid carcinomas accompanied with myasthenia gravis were found in two male patients. Notably, the thyroid malignancies predated the thymomas diagnosis by 1.5 and 9 years, respectively.\n\n【14】An evaluation of 136 thymomas diagnosed between 1957 and 1997 yielded 48 additional neoplasms in 37 patients (27%) . Eleven tumors were colorectal carcinomas followed by six cases of pulmonary tumors. Interestingly, five cases of thyroid tumors were registered. The fact that these tumors were often diagnosed prior to or concomitant with thymomas suggested that a predisposition to cancer may underlay the association rather than thymoma treatment .\n\n【15】In a case-control study the incidence of second tumors in 192 consecutive thymomas was compared with that of 1426 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) . Fifteen patients of the former group developed second primaries, mostly stomach adenocarcinomas followed by liver, lung and cervical cancers. One patient had a third neoplasm, but non-solid cancers were absent. None of them received chemotherapy, and in three of them the involved site was outside the radiation field. In the NPC group, only 27 (2%) second primaries were found. In 24 of them irradiation was delivered and four of second tumors occurred within this field. A statistically significant association between thymic and extrathymic neoplasms was evident (Overall Risk (OR), 4.28; 95% CI, 1.39 - 13.13, P < 0.05). Patient age was the only involved factor after multivariate analysis (adjusted OR, 1.06, 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.10, P < 0.05).\n\n【16】Recently, Gadalla et al. retrieved files for 668 thymomas from the Swedish Cancer Registry and compared them to 2,719 population-based matched controls in terms of risk for second cancers . Thymoma patients had two-fold excess risk for second cancers compared with the general population, most notably: non-melanoma skin cancer \\[Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) = 10.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 6.0 - 17.3\\], non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 6.8, 95% CI = 3.00 - 13.0), and cervical (SIR = 6.9, 95% CI = 1.4 - 20.1), endocrine (SIR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.3 - 12.0), and prostate (SIR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7 - 4.8) cancers.\n\n【17】In a study using SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results) data from the period between 1973 and 1998, and in which 733 patients with thymoma were identified and compared with the general population, a SIR of 1.5 (CI 1.2 - 1.9) was reported . A similar observed to expected ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.2 - 1.9) was reported in another report based on SEER data of a more extended period . These reports find excess risk for only a sub-set of cancer types such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma and digestive tract cancers. Nevertheless the number of individual cancer localization cases is small and no definitive conclusions can be made concerning this point. Moreover SEER data tend to under-estimate incidences as noted by the authors and this may be a cause of the difference of excess risk between these reports and reports from individual centers. SEER data could also under-estimate risk of second malignancies by including mainly cases of more malignant thymomas which, due to greater mortality, display less years at risk .\n\n【18】Few other case reports describe the asociation of thyroid carcinomas with thymomas . An additional feature in our case was thymoma positivity for transcription factor TTF1 (Thyroid Transcription Factor 1, otherwise known as NKX2-1, NK2 Homeobox 1). This is an antigen usually positive in thyroid and lung cancers but very rarely in thymoma . Nevertheless, TTF1 positivity is more commonly seen in thymic carcinomas with neuroendocrine features such as our patient .\n\n【19】A plausible pathogenic explanation of the association of thymomas with other cancers taking into account both the facts that associated cancers occur before, concomitant with or after the diagnosis of thymomas and are independent of thymoma treatments, relates to immunologic cancer surveillance. Thymus is an important organ for T cell precursors maturation into both cytotoxic and helper T cells as well as into T regulatory cells (Tregs). In this organ double negative (CD4-, CD8-) T cell precursors from the bone marrow interact with cortical and medullary thymocytes and are presented peripheral foreign and self antigens . Normally, during their maturation process they become double positive and finally single positive CD4 or CD8 T cells. Cells with auto-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) are deleted and only cells with TCRs recognizing foreign antigens are allowed to become functional cytotoxic cells. T regulatory cells with the CD25+, Foxp3+ phenotype are also produced and function to restrict immune responses and to keep in control in periphery cytotoxic cells with weakly auto-reactive receptors that have escaped deletion in thymus . In thymomas, neoplastic thymocytes may display impaired physiologic function and may be less supportive of the production of cytotoxic T cells with cancer antigen specificity or alternatively may favor production of Tregs antagonizing these cytotoxic T cells.\n\n【20】The association of thymic neoplasms with other cancers highlighted by our case report has two important implications for the optimal care of patients with these neoplasms. First a close lifelong follow-up and cancer screening is needed for these patients especially after successful treatment of thymic neoplasms. Second one has always to keep in mind that second cancers can present concomitantly with thymic neoplasms and thus clinical suspicion and a low threshold for obtaining additional biopsies is advisable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a69d3cb6-d38f-4866-9292-abf40e79eb2b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Described as inflammatory tumor of tendon , pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) got name due to macroscopically appearance: pigmented color, villi and nodules . This is inflammatory proliferative disease resulting from synovial cells . PVNS has progressive course similar neoplastic local expansion . In the advanced stages, synovial inflammation (pannus) can invade cartilage, bone, capsule with joint destruction . Recurrent synovial hemorrhages are transformed by phagocytes to extra- and intracellular hemosiderin deposits seen on MRI study as “blooming” artefacts (MRI gradient-echo) and on biopsy specimens . Nodular structure of histiocytic infiltrates with multinucleated giant cells, foam cells and dense fibrosis are common histologic findings . Despite very rare polyarticular disease (children), monoarticular involvement is predominant, when knee, hip and ankle are usually affected with pain, swelling and disability. Several forms of PVNS were described: diffuse intra-articular, localized intra-articular, giant cell tumor of tendon sheath and pigmented villonodular bursitis. Overexpression of M-CSF plays a pathogenic role in PVNS. The annual incidence estimated is 1-2/million persons/year . Mean age of the disease onset is 33 ± 13 years with no gender predilection. Histologically PVNS may mimic rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial carcinoma or epithelioid sarcoma. Malignant transformation of PVNS is extraordinary . Most cases of PVNS have translocations involving CSF1 located at 1p13 . We followed up a case with effective combined therapy for diffuse PVNS despite incomplete response to its components.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 41-year-old white woman, teacher, was suffering from recurrent right knee hemorrhagic inflammatory effusions for 2 years without history of trauma, data for blood dyscrasia, crystallopathy or coagulopathy. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections were helpful for several days only. Three diagnostic arthroscopy events showed massive diffuse synovial hypertrophy without bacterial growth of usual or fast acid pathogens. MRI and synovial biopsy disclosed high T-2 signals/inflammatory infiltrate with multinucleated giant cells and hemosiderin deposits . Diagnosis of diffuse form of pigmented villonodular synovitis was made and the patient was presented for open radical synovectomy, which was performed without complications. Nevertheless complete excision of inflammatory tissue the operated knee movements stayed limited  and US of the knee showed the synovitis residue, partially invading the quadriceps ligament . Due to US data and high rate of PVNS relapse (8-56%) for 5 years , we made decision about external beam radiotherapy . Photon beam irradiation (6 MV) through opposed anterior and posterior fields was given. The total dose was 20 Gy, delivered in 2 Gy a day, five times a week. The knee movement improved after radiotherapy  and synovitis reduced significantly by physical examination and US . Due to postoperative pain and the rest of synovial tissue on US study, pharmacologic therapy with salazopyrine 2 g/day and celecoxib 400 mg/day was added. For several weeks, the knee pain became episodic and further disappeared. Six months later, the patient feels healthy and continues to take salazopyrine permanently and celecoxib as needed.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Recent studies showed that anti-inflammatory therapy with anti-TNF biologics (infliximab systemic and etanercept intra-articular) and anticancer imatinib (tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of signaling cascade) may be helpful in management of PVNS . Large amounts of TNF-alpha were found in PVNS similarly to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). But synovitis of PVNS is considered as a secondary reaction to a neoplastic disorder. The pathologic mechanism for growth of hypertrophic villi in PVNS is different from synovial growth in RA. Synovial hyperplasia in PVNS might be due to upregulation of synoviocyte proliferation as represented by activation of telomerase, which is evident in the majority of tumor cell lines . That is why the treatment such as with TNF-alpha blockade did not reduce synovial tumor mass as measured by MRI but alleviated and stabilized synovial inflammation and joint effusion . However, treatment with imatinib showed MRI decrease in size of lesions in 50% of patients. Stable disease was observed in 33% patients. But patients showed progression after discontinuation of imatinib . From this point of view, it is not surprising that the first step in treatment of PVNS is considered to be radical synovectomy. We believe that open access may be more radical. It is similar principle of maximal removing of tumor tissue in treatment of other neoplasia for the best survival. But arthroscopic access was reported to be also successful . Despite synovectomy group of RA patients deteriorated more slowly than medication group, after 2-3 years, the group had the same pattern of deterioration . PVNS treated by synovectomy had also recurrence rate as high as 45% . However, the treatment of choice for PVNS is a complete synovectomy performed arthroscopically or through an open arthrotomy . The long-term success of surgery for PVNS, as with others tumor lesions, depends on the ability to excise the disease completely . The use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) following primary resection for high risk lesions may improve local disease control .\n\n【6】RT may be used as the primary treatment for diffuse intra-articular PVNS, but it is best used to augment surgery following incomplete resection of disease. RT may be instituted either by external beam or through intra-articular injections (yttrium-90, rhenium-186) . Initial and highly satisfactory experience with the injection of radioactive yttrium 90 to treat PVNS of the ankle joint eroded with time . Full thickness skin necrosis in two patients, development of draining sinus in third associated with chronic pain and severe chronic pain in other four patients urged recommendation to discontinue its use .\n\n【7】Several recent publications showed favorable effect of external beam RT as a postoperative treatment . The GCG-BD group conducted a pattern-of-care study to analyze the RT for PVNS . Thirty patients received postsurgical RT because of primarily incomplete resection, 11 patients as an adjunct after complete resections of recurrences or unclear resection status. The total doses ranged from 30 to 50 Gy (median 36 Gy), in 2 Gy a day. Local control was achieved in 95.1%, and 82.9% had no or only slight functional impairment.\n\n【8】In another report, eight patients with diffuse PVNS of the knee were treated with subtotal arthroscopic synovectomy followed by local adjuvant RT. Two weeks after surgery, RT was applied with a 15-MV linear accelerated photon beam. The total dose ranged from 10 to 39.60 Gy, with mean of 20 Gy divided on average into 10 fractions every 2 days in 20 days. The dose of radiation was determined based on the protocol of the RT service and used in accordance with the expected biologic effect. Only one patient was classified as recurrence after brief period of relief. Follow-up for a mean 8.6 years showed no arthritis progression, postoperative complications or RT late effect in seven patients. Two developed quadricipital muscle atrophy and one synovial effusion .\n\n【9】In another work, seven patients with diffuse PVNS underwent radical surgery and RT (30-50 Gy). No evidence of recurrence was found; one patient had persistent restriction of joint movement after surgery .\n\n【10】One more recent trial describes review of 23 patients after postoperative RT for PVNS . Nineteen patients had primary disease and 4 had recurrent disease with an average of 2.5 prior surgeries. After synovectomy (17 arthroscopic surgeries; 6 open), all 23 patients received 4-6 MV external beam radiotherapy with a median dose of 20  Gy in 10 fractions. Of these four patients, three received salvage synovectomy and regained local control. Twenty-two patients reported excellent or good joint function, and one who refused salvage synovectomy had poor joint function. None of the patient experienced significant radiation toxicity or secondary malignancy in a median F/U of 9 years. Low-dose (20 Gy) RT appears to be as effective as moderate-dose RT (35 Gy) .\n\n【11】Recent Egypt study demonstrated 12 patients with diffuse knee PVNS, which postoperatively (open anterior and posterior debulking) were treated with external beam RT (26-30 Gy) 5 fractions per week (2 Gy/fraction) 6-8 weeks after surgery with mean follow-up of 27 months. No evidence of local recurrence or joint destruction was noted on clinical and MRI studies. No complications of surgery or RT were recorded. The functional outcome of the involved joint in all patients was good according to Enneking’s criteria (postoperative score 85%) .\n\n【12】In another trial, 14 patients had undergone combined knee synovectomy and RT. The RT was applied in two fields with 1.2-1.5 Gy a fraction in 5 fractions per week to a total dose of 16-20 Gy. The combined therapy was used due to difficulties of complete removal of the affected synovial tissue even with total capsulectomy. During the follow-up period (6 months to 6 years), there were no recurrences of PVNS and occupational rehabilitation was attained in 87.5% of the patients .\n\n【13】Twenty-two patients with diffuse PVNS of the knee had been treated with combined arthroscopic synovectomy and postoperative external beam RT (total dose 26 Gy). Recurrence was found in three patients. Articular stiffness and residual edema were found in three patients, two of whom had persistent pain .\n\n【14】However, results of surgery and adjuvant therapy are not uniformly positive. Radiosynovectomy alone or in combination with surgery, compared with use of surgery alone, did not improve patient outcome in another publication . Nevertheless such single data, recurrent diffuse intra-articular PVNS is often treated with combined therapy. We compared a rate of relapse for diffuse PVNS after surgery with data of relapse after combined therapy (surgery + RT) from above mentioned reports. This resulted in 45% for surgical (arthroscopic or open) versus 6.9% for combined (surgery + RT) therapy of PVNS relapse for 2-5 years.\n\n【15】The limitations of most studies are its retrospective design, which may have introduced selection bias, and the small number of patients. Due to the low incidence of PVNS, it is difficult to perform large-scale prospective controlled studies.\n\n【16】Our case showed the residue of synovitis after radical open synovectomy by US control. The PVNS residual synovitis protruded quadriceps ligament . After RT, the focus of inflammation reduced leaving quadriceps ligament to be spare . We recommend US as valuable investigation for diagnosis of PVNS remnants after arthroscopic or open surgery.\n\n【17】Anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy may be helpful in management of postoperative and post-radiation period in patients with persistent inflammation and pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This bridge compresses the tunneled segment during systole, which remains clinically silent in most cases . Although usually asymptomatic in the majority of patients, symptomatic patients often require treatment . We report a case of a patient with MB with refractory angina despite medical management. After the patient refused surgical intervention, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed which was complicated with a perforation that was managed successfully with the help of a Graftmaster coronary stent graft.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 52-year-old Caucasian male presented to our facility complaining of a sudden onset of substernal chest pain, described as heaviness with radiation to his left shoulder and arm. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Patient had a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or recreational drugs. Family history was unremarkable. On physical exam, he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 119/83 mm Hg, pulse rate of 80/min and a respiratory rate of 18/min. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Initial troponin value was 0.369 ng/mL which peaked at 0.630 ng/mL. There were no acute ischemic signs on electrocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed a patent left circumflex artery and a patent dominant right coronary artery, 50% ostial lesion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and severe myocardial bridging of the mid-LAD with near total occlusion during systole . After discussion with the patient, he was discharged on medical management with antianginals. Patient persisted to experience exertional chest pain during follow-up in the next 6 months. In light of the refractory nature of his symptoms, he was advised a surgical intervention which he refused. Hence, he was scheduled for a PCI.\n\n【4】Intravascular ultrasound revealed a minimal luminal area of the ostial LAD at 4.4 mm <sup>2 </sup> and mid LAD at the bridging segment at 3.9 mm <sup>2 </sup> . A 2.5 × 12 mm Emerge balloon was placed across the myocardial bridging segment and inflated up to 6 atm for 15 s, thereafter, a 3 × 20 mm Promus Promier stent was placed across the mid-LAD and deployed at 11 atm for 15 s resulting in resolution of myocardial bridging and a significant improvement of the distal flow . Post-stenting dilation was carried out up to 19 atm for 10 s. The patient immediately started complaining of chest pain after the dilation. Post-intervention angiogram revealed a focal free perforation in the distal part of the stented segment with extravasation of contrast freely into the left ventricular cavity . A decision was made to immediately stent the perforation with a 2.8 × 16 mm Graftmaster coronary stent graft. Post-stent dilatation was carried out up to 19 atm for 10 s. Left coronary angiography after the deployment of the stent graft confirmed a successful repair of the perforation with an absence of contrast leak . Chest pain resolved over the next 30 min and the patient was symptom free at 1-month and 6-month follow-ups.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The prevalence of the MB has been reported to be 0.5-16% after coronary angiography while up to 50% following autopsy in one study  arguing for possible many undetected cases of MB during angiography. Nevertheless, computed tomography (CT) angiography showed superiority over angiography in revealing this anomaly. In a recent study, Teofilovski et al examined 96 cadaver hearts from adult individuals of both genders in Serbia, and it was found that MB is not rare in the examined sample and often associated with other congenital anomalies . Affected individuals are usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic presentations can range from exertional angina to rare acute coronary syndrome or even sudden death due to arrhythmias . Conservative medical management using antianginals is the initial preferred approach with special consideration to avoid nitroglycerin as it may aggravate the symptoms by intensifying the systolic compression of the bridged segment and enhances the retrograde flow in the proximal segments . However, in refractory cases, a percutaneous or surgical approach may be required. Interventional cardiologists are often apprehensive about a percutaneous approach due to high restenosis arte  besides the risk of potential life-threatening perforation which can be tricky to manage. The implement of the intravascular ultrasound helps to scrutinize the coronary anatomy and carefully select the appropriate balloon size to avoid the perforation risk to some extent . Traditionally, when perforations do occur, prolonged balloon dilation proximal to the site of perforation to prevent tamponade is the preferred approach, along with reversal of anticoagulation. However, with improving stent prosthesis, management of these perforations has been shown feasible with the help of covered stents. In our case, we successfully repaired the perforation with the help of Graftmaster coronary stent graft system (Abbott Vascular). The Graftmaster stent graft is indicated in repair of coronary artery perforation and is contraindicated in cases where treatment area is limited to allow full balloon dilation or placement of the stent graft. Previous cases have reported perforation of the bridged segment of coronary artery into the right ventricle and the pericardial space . We here report the first case of perforation of a tunneled coronary artery into the left ventricle. A repair of perforation was performed using a stent graft with good results.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】MB is not a rare anomaly as we used to think. Symptomatic myocardial bridging can often be refractory to medical management requiring intervention. Perforation is a rare complication if the bridged segment is percutaneously intervened and yet can be successfully repaired using a stent graft.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "10bfdc0d-b766-4099-b758-644274dbb57e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】At present, colorectal cancer is the third most lethal cancer in the United States and is the third most common type of cancer . The incidence differs from developed and undeveloped countries ; 134,490 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the United States on 2016. Patients can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, depending on the location or progression and may present with different clinical features. The diagnosis is usually made with screening colonoscopy on asymptomatic patients, while other patients are diagnosed after presenting symptoms such as hematochezia, iron deficiency anemia, changes in bowel movements, and abdominal pain. Also on emergency surgical procedures, tumor may be found . Uncommon presentations of colon cancer can mimic diverticulitis, and malignant fistulas on rectosigmoid locations and also can be seen as multiple abscesses on different areas of the gastrointestinal system .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The case was a 50-year-old woman, G3P3AO, with a past medical history of hypertension, major depressive disorder and hysterectomy in 2003. The patient does not have any toxic habits or family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease; the only history of malignancy is her mother who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 71. Patient’s first visit to emergency room (ER) was in August 2016 with symptoms that included suprapubic pain, flank pain and fever. The patient was managed with oral antibiotics for urinary tract infection and discharged home from ER. Three months later, the patient presented with similar symptoms, but this time, an abdomen-pelvis CT scan was remarkable for acute diverticulitis and was treated accordingly. Patient was discharged home after completing antibiotics and tolerating oral diet. Patient returned to ER on January 2017 with an acute abdomen, loss of appetite, fever, and nausea, and a CT scan with IV and PO contrast was repeated. The CT scan showed concentric thickening of the bowel wall with associated mural abscess, and fistulous connection between the sigmoid colon and vaginal cuff with rectal material on the vaginal cuff. Also a fistulous connection between the sigmoid colon and the left abdominal muscle was found. These findings were consistent with colitis and multiple fistulas; however, colonoscopy was recommended to rule out malignancy. Colonoscopy was performed 2 months later after receiving IV antibiotics and biopsy taken from the sigmoid colon was negative for malignancy. Patient’s symptoms worsened with active purulent secretions from abdominal wall and secretions of vaginal area that she described as fecal material. Patient was seen by gynecology service for evaluation of rectovaginal fistula, abundant fecal material was found at the vagina, and patient was referred to colorectal surgeon. Patient symptoms recurred by May 2017; however, this time, the patient developed new enterocolonic, enterocutaneous, and colovaginal fistula seen on abdomen-pelvis CT scan with wall thickening and stranding in mesentery. At this moment, Crohn’s disease was suspected and was transferred for inflammatory bowel disease specialist evaluation. Colonoscopy was repeated and a biopsy from a mass on the sigmoid colon was taken and pathology reported an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon .\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】A fistula can be defined as an abnormal connection between two body structures that are not supposed to be connected. The different fistulas can be classified in accordance to the different anatomic connections. External gastrointestinal fistulas result from connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin and drains to the outside part of the body and are called enterocutaneous. Internal fistulas do not drain through the skin and are connections between the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs. The origin and insertion is used for the nomenclature of each fistula .\n\n【6】Trauma associated with childbirth is the most common cause of rectovaginal fistula which was the first fistula that appeared in this patient. Tears of the perineum that extend to the bowel or procedures to facilitate delivery on prolonged and difficult labor can produce this type of fistula. Crohn’s disease is the second most common cause of inflammatory process on the gastrointestinal tract associated with the development of fistula and also abscesses are common complications of this disease. Malignancy and radiation therapy on the pelvic area can also predispose patients to develop fistulas. Finally, surgical procedures are other common causes .\n\n【7】The development of multiple abscesses and fistulas on adjacent parts to the colon is a common complication of Crohn’s disease and can also be associated with complicated infectious process along the gastrointestinal tract. This patient had a hysterectomy which is a known risk factor for the development of fistula; however, the hysterectomy was done 14 years before the appearance of the fistulas, suggesting that the surgical procedure was not the primary cause of the development of fistula and abscesses. Prolonged labor is also unlikely to be the primary cause of the development of multiple fistulas because patient time frame of last pregnancy exceeds more than 15 years and this presentation would have occurred earlier. Patient also had a diverticulitis that could result in the complications seen in this case such as multiple abscesses and rarely development of fistula. The patient persisted several months with multiple abscesses that probably led to the development of new fistula seen later. However, the rectovaginal fistula was present at the moment when multiple abscesses were found on the imaging studies. Crohn’s disease is another possible pathology associated with fistula and multiple abscesses were ruled out on two colonoscopies where tissue biopsy was taken.\n\n【8】In this case, the colorectal cancer of the sigmoid was diagnosed on the second colonoscopy. It is atypical due to patient age, negative family history, and initial presentation with rectovaginal fistula and multiple abscesses. From this case, we can learn that colorectal cancer can mimic other conditions such as Crohn’s disease or complicated infectious process and colon adenocarcinoma should be part of the differential diagnosis on patients presenting with fistulas and multiple abscesses. The symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical presentation can be very similar because the inflammation is the pathophysiology process of origin that can result from infectious process, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers are common laboratory findings seen in the three different pathologies. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, and changes in bowel movement can be seen in patients with either infectious process, inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. This case shows that colorectal cancer can present with atypical symptoms and workup should continue aggressively until a final diagnosis is made.\n\n【9】Inflammatory bowel disease can be related with extraintestinal manifestations that are not found in colorectal cancer. For example aphthous ulcers, ankylosing spondylitis, eye manifestations including uveitis and scleritis are not typically found on colorectal cancer. Some skin manifestations that can be found include pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and cutaneous vasculitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is not expected to be found in patients with colorectal cancer and is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease . However, it has been associated with hematologic malignancies such as IGA monoclonal gammopathy, leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma and on rheumatic disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis . These clinical findings are not found on all patients with inflammatory bowel disease; however, they can help with establishing the correct diagnosis. In the case of this patient, none of these extraintestinal manifestations were found. Anti- Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) can be found in patients with Crohn’s disease in comparison to colorectal cancer. Imaging studies in some cases can have apple core sign that is most commonly associated with colorectal cancer; however, in some cases, Crohn’s disease can also be found. Skip lesions and cobblestone appearance are found in colonoscopy on patients with Crohn’s disease. Colonoscopy findings in colorectal cancer can be variable depending on the stage of the tumor and size can limit the evaluation of the entire colon if the mass is causing complete obstruction. On biopsy histologic findings can be different in the case of Crohn’s disease. Non-caseating granulomas may be found with transmural lymphocytic infiltration. Colorectal adenocarcinoma histology can be variable depending on the stage and the degree of differentiation. The degree on gland formation is variable, and abundant glands are associated with highly differentiated and moderate differentiated tumors, which can be surrounded by tall columnar cells, and extensive necrosis with debris. Non-caseating granulomas are not found on colorectal cancer. These are differences in colorectal cancer and Crohn’s disease; however, Crohn’s disease increases the risk of colorectal cancer, so patients with Crohn’s disease that develop colorectal cancer can have characteristics of both conditions in colonoscopy and histology. Screening colonoscopy is different in patients with Crohn’s disease from normal population without history of colorectal cancer and is done 8 - 10 years after diagnosis every 1 - 2 years.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

While thyroglossal duct cysts are sometimes asymptomatic and frequently benign, some may present with symptoms and corresponding issues that may include potentially serious complications including infection or even, on rare occasions (approximately 1%) malignancy. Although the incidence of carcinoma within a thyroglossal duct cyst is quite rare, there have been numerous efforts to characterize and understand more regarding the etiology, histopathology, and treatment of this malignancy considering its variable development and presentation. As discussed in previous studies, carcinomas of a thyroglossal duct cyst have a frequent association (approximately 11-33%) with carcinomas in the thyroid gland (most frequently, papillary thyroid carcinoma) . As a result of this association, efforts must be taken to determine whether these tumors are metastasis from a primary thyroid cancer or whether this is a primary papillary carcinoma within a thyroglossal duct cyst. We are presenting a case report that is suggestive of a papillary thyroid carcinoma originating from a thyroglossal duct cyst.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Our patient is a 36-year-old male with a past medical history only notable for gout and kidney stones who initially presented with nearly a two month history of a midline mass that the patient originally noted upon self inspection. He denied dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, tremor, palpitation, heat or cold intolerance, constipation, diarrhea and reported that his energy level was adequate. His history is otherwise negligible other than a 10 pack year smoking history (discontinued five years previously).\n\n【4】His physical exam revealed the presence of palpable lymphadenopathy in bilateral levels two and three with a midline mass at the level of the hyoid bone that measured approximately 2 cm in diameter. His exam was otherwise unremarkable with vital signs within normal range and BMI of 31.7.\n\n【5】He had a CT scan that showed the midline mass approximately 2 cm in diameter and bilateral neck adenopathy. An ultrasound was then performed which revealed a normal right and left lobe of the thyroid that were completely devoid of nodules. Furthermore, a cystic mass (2.5 × 1.2 × 2 cm) was noted near the region of the hyoid bone. These findings led to a fine needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guidance. The FNA was positive for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Fine needle aspirations of the bilateral lymphadenopathy revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma as well . This FNA illustrates the typical features of papillary thyroid carcinoma which include, nuclear enlargement, clearing, elongation, grooves and pseudo-inclusions. These features are best seen on Pap stain as utilized in this particular image.\n\n【6】Due to the fact that the cystic lesion was noted to be in the region of the hyoid bone, this mass was suspected to be a thyroglossal duct cyst. The patient was then scheduled for the following procedure: total thyroidectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and a Sistrunk procedure.\n\n【7】Upon gross inspection of the thyroglossal mass, the patient was noted to have a tan-white, irregular lesion (1.5 × 1.2 × 0.6 cm) that was firm upon palpation. Intraoperatively, the patient was noted to have multiple cystic-appearing lymph nodes in levels 1 through 4 on the left. Some of the lymph nodes had a darkish hue to them. There was a large level 1 lymph node on the left which was adjacent to the presumed primary tumor, the thyroglossal duct cyst. The thyroid itself appeared unremarkable with a complete lack of masses.\n\n【8】Surgical pathology confirmed the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in the thyroglossal duct cyst  and five of seventy-one lymph nodes . The tumor was invasive with mild extension into the adjacent fibro adipose tissue.\n\n【9】This patient endured a rather long and complicated recovery in the hospital following this surgical procedure. He did well overnight initially with the two 15-French drains productive of serosanguinous output. On the second postoperative day, the patient was noted to have a milky output from the left neck drain - a chyle leak was suspected. The patient was started on a low fat diet and a pressure dressing was placed over the left neck. Following these measures, there was no notable improvement in the chyle leak. The patient was taken back to the operating room for a neck exploration. No definitive leak was found and a rotation flap of the sternothyroid muscle was utilized to sew over the thoracic duct - the sternocleidomastoid was also rotated in. The patient did well after the procedure and drain output dropped. However, two days following this procedure, the left neck drain began to have increased output which was again milky in appearance. The patient was scheduled for embolization by lymphangiogram. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful, as no distal lymph vessels were able to be canalized. CT surgery was consulted for thoracic duct ligation. The patient underwent video-assisted thorascopic surgery which was converted to an open mini thoracotomy for ligation of the thoracic duct. A chest tube was placed following this procedure. During this period, the patient was also started on TPN for nutritional support. The neck drain was subsequently removed. His diet was slowly advanced to a low fat diet. Once the low fat diet was started and there was no evidence of chylous leak, the chest tube was removed and TPN was discontinued. Patient was discharged home following twenty days of hospitalization tolerating a low fat diet, ambulating without any problems, and with the chyle leak controlled.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】During the fourth week of gestation, a thyroglossal duct arises from the medial thyroid anlage (first and second pharyngeal pouches). This duct forms as a diverticulum that subsequently travels from the ventral portion of the foramen cecum and usually courses anterior to the body of the hyoid bone although it may be posterior or through the bone. It travels through the midline neck to the position of the normal thyroid in the base of the neck by the 7th week. This tract usually atrophies and disintegrates by the 10th week of gestation. Although it is uncertain as to the potential etiology for the formation of a thyroglossal duct cyst, a post-mortem study involving 200 adults found the incidence to be approximately 7% .\n\n【12】In the pediatric population, the thyroglossal duct cyst represents the most common cause of a midline neck mass. Due to numerous reasons in patients of all ages presenting with a thyroglossal duct cyst - cosmetic, patient discomfort and inflammation/infection - the typical recommendation is to excise the clinically apparent cyst by means of the Sistrunk procedure . This procedure consists of a removal of the thyroglossal duct cyst, the central portion of the hyoid bone, and the thyroglossal duct all in continuity. The recurrence rate is less than 4% following this procedure .\n\n【13】Further procedures, such as neck dissection and total thyroidectomy, are typically only warranted for more extensive malignancies. Although a carcinoma within the thyroglossal duct cyst is rare (0.7-1%), it is important to be aware of this possibility in terms of how it may affect treatment. The necessity for expanding the surgery to include bilateral neck dissection and a total thyroidectomy is typically performed if there is evidence of lymph node, direct extension of the malignancy and/or intrathyroidal metastatic lesions (the latter two of which are indications for thyroidectomy and neck dissection). However, even in the presence of malignancy, the Sistrunk procedure will suffice for non-metastatic disease and for medically high risk patients . Fortunately, following this procedure when papillary thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma is present, the overall survival rate is at approximately 95.6% over a period of 10 years postoperatively .\n\n【14】Due to the accessibility of these midline masses, fine needle aspiration cytology, FNAC, is a rapid, safe, well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive procedure for initial evaluation. However, as discussed in a review of literature by Yang et al, a preoperative FNAC has shown to have poor true- and false-negative rates, at 53% and 47%, respectively . In contrast, according to Miccoli et al, patients that underwent a repeat FNAC resulted in 100% sensitivity and specificity in a group of nine patients subjected to this procedure, especially when performed under ultrasound guidance. Furthermore, other diagnostic techniques are typically unable to make a preoperative diagnosis (CT, ultrasound, scintigraphy) . Thus, based on these previous studies, workups of these midline masses benefit from an ultrasound-guided FNAC.\n\n【15】Despite the rare incidence of papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst, many efforts have been undertaken to further characterize proper workup, symptoms, and subsequent treatment and, as discussed above, significant improvements have been made. However, one important topic to address is the importance of recognizing whether this malignancy is within the thyroglossal duct cyst is primary or secondary to a metastatic tumor primary from the thyroid proper. This is important not only in terms of surgical treatment, but also in terms of prognosis .\n\n【16】The incidence of thyroid gland involvement in association with thyroglossal duct cyst papillary carcinoma has been shown to range from 11-33% . Typically, a metastatic tumor from the thyroid to thyroglossal duct cyst would indicate the necessity to perform a total thyroidectomy in addition to the Sistrunk procedure for treating primary papillary carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct cyst (in the absence of evidence of other malignancy - thyroid, lymph nodes, etc.). Furthermore, thyroglossal duct cyst papillary carcinoma has a much lower metastatic rate in comparison to a papillary carcinoma arising from the thyroid proper (7% and 87%, respectively) .\n\n【17】These two variable forms of presentation of this malignancy seem to have a different appearance pathologically. In fact, the diagnosis of a primary thyroglossal duct cyst papillary carcinoma requires the identification of malignant cells interspersed with normal ectopic thyroid in addition to the recognition of the duct wall or its remnant. The duct wall is usually lined by columnar cells. The combination of these features allows an additional means of differentiation of a metastatic papillary carcinoma arising from thyroid proper from the primary form of thyroglossal duct cyst papillary carcinoma.\n\n【18】Despite the relatively frequent association of primary thyroid involvement in addition to a thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma, our case likely represents the primary papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from the thyroglossal duct rather than a metastasis due to a number of reasons: the location of the lesion was high in the central neck (typical of a thyroglossal duct remnant), the lack of residual lymph node, the unencapsulated, stellate and irregular nature of the lesion (not consistent with a lymph node metastasis) and, most importantly, the lack of a primary lesion in the entirely submitted thyroid.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】By utilizing ultrasound-guided FNAC, we were able to obtain a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct cyst. This enabled an understanding of how to approach this patient in terms of treatment. Ultrasound-guided biopsy should be employed in order to characterize this neck mass prior to any form of treatment.\n\n【21】Furthermore, histopathology may allow a determination of whether this malignancy in the thyroglossal duct cyst is primary or due to a secondary metastasis from a thyroid malignancy - information which is useful in recognizing prognosis as well as for formulating treatment.\n\n【22】Summary\n\n【23】1). Papillary thyroid cancer can arise from a thyroglossal duct cyst. 2). Conventional ultrasound and fine needle aspiration techniques should be used when evaluating all neck masses, including those of thyroid or thyroglossal duct origins. 3). Society guidelines (namely, American Thyroid Association) can provide guidance in the proper diagnosis and management of well-differentiated thyroid cancers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Here, we report a very rare case of hemiataxia with ipsilateral sensory disturbance due to a pontine infarction.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 77-year-old man with essential hypertension abruptly complained of paresthesia in the left-sided upper and lower extremities in November 2013. Consciousness was alert. Blood pressure was 156/92 mmHg. The heart rate was 60/min. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial nerve impairment was not detected. In the upper extremities, Barre sign was negative. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was detected. Manual muscle testing on the extremities was all normal. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Paresthesia and decreased vibration sensation was observed in the left-sided upper and lower extremities. However, pain sensation, temperature sensation, topesthesia, joint sensation and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. In left-sided upper extremity, dysmetria, decomposition of movement and intension tremor were observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were slightly slow in the left side. In heel-knee test and shin-tapping test, dysmetria and decomposition of movement were observed in the left-sided extremities. Truncal ataxia was not observed. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Laboratory examination was within normal ranges. Chest X-ray finding was normal. Electrocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a localized infarction in the right-sided median zone of the middle pons . Cranial magnetic resonance angiography finding was normal. Under intravenous sodium ozagrel at 160 mg/day (anti-platelet agent), he became asymptomatic within 5 days.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Involvement of the medial lemniscus may induce paresthesia and disturbance of deep sensation in the contralateral limbs . Kim et al  noted four cases of hemiataxia with ipsilateral sensory disturbance due to pontine stroke. However, the etiology of hemiataxia was not referred . On the other hand, impairment of the cortico-ponto-cerebeller pathway may cause hemiataxia . To our knowledge, there has been only one reported case of isolated hemiataxia due to contralateral pontine infarction . Schmahmann et al  stated that upper extremity ataxia might be mostly correlated with damage to the ventral pontine nucleus, and lower extremity ataxia might be induced by impairment to the more lateral region than those for the arm in the middle and caudal pons.\n\n【6】In our patient, despite normal position sense, marked hemiataxia was observed. Therefore, based on neurological symptoms and cranial MRI finding, in addition to the medial lemniscus, the descending corticopontine fiber and/or pontine nucleus in the cortico-ponto-cerebeller pathway might be involved.\n\n【7】In conclusion, we emphasize that hemiataxia with ipsilateral sensory disturbance rarely results from infarction in the contralateral median zone of the middle pons.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0b7a2504-1cc3-48ba-ac85-40aba4370380", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Zoledronic acid is a potent intravenous (IV) aminobisphosphonate used in the treatment of osteoporosis, Paget’s disease of the bone, and multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors . The combination of its high affinity to hydroxyapatite and its potent inhibition of the key osteoclastic enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase translates into a yearly parenteral treatment regimen for osteoporosis. The parenteral route of administration circumvents the poor adherence associated with oral bisphosphonates and the potential gastrointestinal side effects. Combined with its high efficacy in reducing the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, zoledronic acid is a reasonable option for elderly patients with comorbidities and those who do not tolerate or absorb oral bisphosphonates .\n\n【2】Side effects associated with the use of zoledronic acid include a transient and self-limiting acute-phase reaction, in particular during the first administration, mild to moderate hypocalcemia, mild and transient renal impairment, and rare osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femur fractures . The majority of cases of hypocalcemia with zoledronic acid have been seen in cancer patients with bone metastases receiving a higher dosage and were mild or asymptomatic . Here, the author reports a case of severe symptomatic hypocalcemia following the administration of zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporotic fracture.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 69-year-old woman was referred for workup and treatment of hypocalcemia from the department of neurology. She presented with a tingling sensation all over the body, especially the face, hands and feet, and a feeling like being choked, which had been developing for 18 days after vertebroplasy about 3 weeks ago. She also had paresthesia of the whole body, particularly the face and abdomen, nausea, poor oral intake, and insomnia. She had acute back pain due to a compression fracture on the fourth lumbar spine vertebra and thus received vertebroplasty and neuroplasty at another orthopedic hospital 3 weeks prior to admission. She had no other specific medical diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension, or surgery in her past history, and was non-smoker and non-drinker. Her symptoms, which she had never experienced before, were too severe to maintain daily life at home. She was admitted for workup and treatment in the department of neurology. The patient’s clinical details were as follows: 155 cm, 57 kg, blood pressure 139/88 mm Hg, pulse rate 80 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and body temperature 36.6 °C. Her mental state was alert, and she had intact motor and sensory and hypoactive deep tendon reflex on neurological examination. She also showed a bilateral falling tendency and shuffled her feet along due to left knee pain when she was walking. Laboratory results were arterial blood pH 7.4, PCO <sub>2 </sub> 24, PO <sub>2 </sub> 111, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>- </sup> 14.9, O <sub>2 </sub> saturation 98%, leukocytes 7,390/μL, hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL, platelets 283,000/μL, blood urea nitrogen 16.1 mg/dL , serum creatinine 2.02 mg/dL (0.5 - 0.9), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25.96 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> , serum sodium 138 mmol/L , potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.1), chloride 104 mmol/L , albumin 3.7 g/dL (3.4 - 4.8), HbA1c 5.3%, free thyroxine 1.81 ng/dL (0.78 - 1.94), and thyroid stimulating hormone 0.2 mIU/L (0.25 - 4.0). Her serum creatinine level had been 1.72 mg/dL (eGFR 31.25 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ) 20 months prior when it was checked at our hospital for workup as a result of dizziness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no focal lesions and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) and gastrofundoscopy revealed small sized kidneys on both sides with prominent parenchymal wasting, suggesting chronic kidney disease and non-specific findings, respectively. On electrocardiography, the corrected QT interval (532 ms) was prolonged. Additionally, she had serum calcium 3.9 mg/dL (8.4 - 10.4), phosphorus 1.3 mg/dL (2.7 - 4.5), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) 434.4 pg/mL , 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) 5.8 ng/mL, 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) <sub>2 </sub> D) 11.94 pg/mL (19.6 - 54.3), and magnesium 1.0 mEq/L (1.3 - 2.1). She had carpal spasms, Chvostek’s sign, and Trousseau’s sign. Zoledronic acid was injected intravenously on the day after vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic fracture. She was soon taking IV calcium and phosphorus and then oral calcium and calcitriol replacement. Her symptoms improved slowly while taking oral calcium 1.8 g/day and calcitriol 0.75 μg/day and an infusion of calcium twice daily. The serum corrected calcium levels were 8.0 mg/dL without IV calcium replacement after 4 days, and she was discharged with oral calcium 1.2 g/day and calcitriol 0.75 μg/day. Ten days after discharge, her serum calcium levels were 9.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 1.6 mg/dL, and creatinine 2.42 mg/dL (eGFR 21.07 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ), PTH 40.1 pg/mL, 25(OH)D 13.3 ng/mL, 1,25(OH) <sub>2 </sub> D 93.19 pg/mL, and magnesium 1.5 mEq/L, and the dose of medication was reduced to oral calcium 400 mg/day and calcitriol 0.5 μg/day. After 10 days, she had no symptoms and serum calcium 8.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.0 mg/dL, and creatinine 2.44 mg/dL . She has been taking only calcitriol 0.25 μg/day with normal serum calcium levels without a calcium supplement and has been followed up by a nephrologist for chronic kidney disease.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Zoledronic acid represents a highly potent IV aminobisphosphonate that is effective in various benign and malignant metabolic bone diseases . Zoledronic acid has been commonly used because of its high potency and ease of administration . In the osteoporosis setting, its administration by IV infusion once a year virtually eliminates compliance issues and gastrointestinal side effects, thus leading to improved fracture protection and cost effectiveness . Although zoledronic acid is generally well-tolerated, the most common side effects include an acute-phase reaction, hypocalcemia, and renal toxicity . Some of these side effects can be minimized by adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, generous rehydration, and discontinuation of drugs that potentiate renal toxicity, such as diuretics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds .\n\n【7】The plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid are maximal at the end of the IV infusion, then rapidly decline to less than 10% in 4 h and to less than 1% 24 h after the infusion . About 61% of the administered dose is taken up rapidly by bone tissue with an increased turnover rate, and is then slowly released back into the circulation. The remaining 39% is excreted unchanged via glomerular filtration by the kidneys, with a long terminal elimination half-life of 146 h . Because zoledronic acid clearance is dependent on the patient’s creatinine clearance (CCr), its administration is not recommended in those with a CCr < 35 mL/min, although there is no need to adjust the dose in those with CCr ≥ 35 mL/min. It is also recommended that the IV infusion time be at least 15 min for renal safety . Zoledronic acid does not inhibit the P450 enzymes and has no known drug interactions; however, caution should be exercised in patients on potentially nephrotoxic medications .\n\n【8】Zoledronic acid potently inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and reduces the mobilization of calcium from the bones to the circulation . Therefore, its administration may lead to mild secondary hyperparathyroidism as a compensatory mechanism to maintain normocalcemia. Increased PTH prevents hypocalcemia by the renal reabsorption of calcium, the stimulation of osteoclasts to resorb bone, and increased 1,25(OH) <sub>2 </sub> D production leading to increased gastrointestinal absorption of calcium . Patients with vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, or renal failure may not be able to correct the hypocalcemia, which then becomes symptomatic . It is therefore important to ensure that patients about to be administered zoledronic acid are not vitamin D-deficient and that they have an adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D. If there are any concerns, it may be prudent to assay serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels. Bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia may be avoided or attenuated by the administration of vitamin D and calcium supplements . In addition, because magnesium is required for PTH release, hypomagnesemia may further increase the risk by inhibiting a compensatory increase in PTH secretion . Impaired renal function, vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and hypomagnesemia have known to be the significant risk factors contributing to bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia . Malnutrition or malabsorption, metastatic cancer, and simultaneous steroid injection have also been reported as risk factors of bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia .\n\n【9】This is a case of severe hypocalcemia after an infusion of zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis in a patient with coexisting but unrecognized severe vitamin D deficiency and impaired renal function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency could not increase 1,25(OH) <sub>2 </sub> D production adequately due to renal failure and severe vitamin D deficiency, leading to aggravated severe hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia by vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism improved shortly after phosphorus replacement intravenously, and hypomagnesemia also improved spontaneously without replacement after returning to a regular diet. Hypocalcemia in this case was not detected until about 12 days after the development of symptoms. However, serum calcium was not measured at the other hospital or in the emergency room 1 week before admission and for a few days after admission, although the measurement of serum calcium should be routinely performed nowadays. The patient underwent unnecessary brain and abdominal imaging and gastrofundoscopy. Due to the high incidence of vitamin D deficiency, the low accuracy of clinical risk factors to predict vitamin D deficiency, and the generalized measurement of vitamin D status, screening for vitamin D deficiency before the administration of zoledronic acid may be appropriate . It is prudent to measure serum 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH before starting treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with a high risk of developing symptomatic hypocalcemia. In addition, zoledronic acid should not be administered in patients with a CCr < 35 mL/min. Furthermore, high-risk patients should be monitored closely after the initiation of zoledronic acid treatment to detect and correct hypocalcemia and impaired renal function .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac thrombi often occur when conditions predispose to blood flow stagnation and are often found in the left atrium and appendage. The differential diagnosis of a cardiac mass includes thrombi, tumors, vegetations and variants of normal structures. The treatments of each of these are quite different. It is prudent that clinicians know what modalities to use to differentiate cardiac masses.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient was a 91-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and dementia who presented to the emergency room from her assisted living facility for vomiting, weakness and non-specific symptoms. The patient presented several days after she was discharged from the emergency room for one episode of coffee round emesis. During her prior visit, her vital signs and laboratory values were stable and her symptoms were under control allowing her to return to her assisted living facility. She then had a recurrence of vomiting, this time non-bilious and non-bloody in nature, which prompted her to be admitted to the emergency room at an outside hospital. Upon evaluation, she denied any angina, dyspnea or syncope.\n\n【4】Initially, her physical exam was significant for a temperature of 98.0 °F, blood pressure of 117/49 mm Hg, pulse rate of 77 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 22 respirations per minute, and she was saturating 100% on 2 L nasal cannula. The patient was alert, aware, oriented and not in acute distress. Her head was atraumatic and normocephalic. Her oral mucosa was moist and without lesions. Her neck was supple, no carotid bruits were appreciated and her neck veins were flat. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm and no murmur was appreciated. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there was no wheezing or rales appreciated. Her abdomen was soft and bowel sounds were present. There was no lower extremity edema appreciated.\n\n【5】Her initial laboratory data were significant for a sodium level of 137, potassium level of 4.5, chloride level of 108, CO <sub>2 </sub> level of 25, BUN level of 33, creatinine of 1.69, white blood cell count of 19.64, hemoglobin of 9.8, hematocrit of 29.9, platelets of 116, alkaline phosphatase level of 55, aspartate aminotransferase level of 16, alanine aminotransferase level of 19, and troponin I level of 2.95. The patient was also found to have hemoccult positive stool. A chest X-ray was performed which revealed cardiomegaly, normal pulmonary vasculature and a large 14.3 cm hiatal hernia. Her initial EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, without any ST-T wave changes. Because of her elevated troponin level, she was transferred to our institution to be evaluated by the cardiology service for further management of her non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.\n\n【6】The patient was started on medications for acute coronary syndrome given her elevated troponins. Her emesis was treated as an anginal equivalent as well. She received a 325 mg aspirin orally and was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg three times a day. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to evaluate her left ventricular function and her wall motion. The TTE revealed a low-normal ejection fraction of 50% with septal wall motion hypokinesis. Enlargement of the left atrium, right atrium and right ventricle was demonstrated. Her right ventricular systolic pressure was severely elevated at 93 mm Hg. A large, mobile thrombus was noted in the right atrium extending to the right ventricle. The thrombus was also noted in the left atrium and left ventricle extending across the aortic valve. There was also moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation noted by Doppler echocardiography . There were no previous echocardiograms at our institution for comparison.\n\n【7】The patient was treated as non ST-elevation myocardial version type one versus non ST-elevation myocardial infarction type two secondary to demand ischemia from sepsis. Along with the oral aspirin and beta-blocker, the patient was then started on anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin. The patient was also requiring anticoagulation as she had developed atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization with risk factors placing her at higher risk for thrombus formation. The patient did not have a history of documented atrial fibrillation in the past. She was started on antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia given her leukocytosis in the context of vomiting. Her renal function and leukocytosis continued to improve throughout her hospital stay. Because of the very large thrombus, surgery was considered but she was ultimately deemed not to be a surgical candidate. Angiogram was also considered for evaluation of her coronary anatomy for which the patient declined opting for medical management. She continued her coumadin for anticoagulation until she obtained therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels. The patient was then ultimately discharged back to her care facility.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】A cardiac thrombus is part of the differential diagnosis of a discovered cardiac mass. Clinicians must have a strong index of suspicion to search for a cardiac mass as the symptoms are quite variable if present and are also non-specific. Because the treatment modalities differ, a cardiac mass must be further differentiated if discovered. The incidence of cardiac thrombus has not previously been reported other than dated autopsy studies including Garvin who described a 34.4% incidence of intracardiac thrombi in consecutive autopsied patients who had died secondary to heart disease. Other similar studies have reported a wide variation of incidences of thrombi specifically in the left ventricle with lower incidences described in the right ventricle and right atrium . For most cases, thrombi are best described in the left atrium as this is a location of blood flow stagnation. The atrium chambers are under a lower amount of hemodynamic pressure and velocity compared to ventricles making these chambers more thrombogenic. The left atrial appendage, especially if the patient is in atrial fibrillation, is also a very common area for a thrombus to develop. If the patient exhibits any symptoms, they can vary from dyspnea to obstructive symptoms. Thrombi described outside the left atrium are more often found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular aneurysms. Due to the altered architecture in dilated and aneurysmal ventricles, they will endure lower velocities and pressures than normal chambers .\n\n【10】The differential diagnosis for a cardiac mass includes tumor, vegetation, thrombus and normal anatomical structures. TTE is portable, cheap and non-invasive, making it the preferred first screening test for a cardiac mass. Contrast can be added to delineate borders and assist in further classification. Echocardiography has many limitations in differentiating types of cardiac masses however. Several studies have described TTE as a modality to evaluate a cardiac thrombus with an overall decreased specificity and sensitivity especially in comparison to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). M-mode can sometimes add increased utility to echocardiography in detection of a thrombus; however, it is not very specific . Transesophageal echocardiograms can provide greater detail and are particularly useful for locating a vegetation. Compared to transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography has an increased specificity and sensitivity but is more invasive.\n\n【11】MRI provides advantages over echocardiography in distinguishing between thrombi, vegetations, tumors and anatomical structures. It offers increased sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation of a cardiac mass. Compared to echocardiography, MRI provides greater delineation of mass borders and can provide greater soft tissue characterization. MRI can more accurately detect size, degree of involvement, vascularity, lesion mobility, fat content, and the presence of central necrosis due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Locating a vascular supply is very important specifically in detecting tumors. MRI has been extensively studied in its ability to distinguish between types of cardiac tumors. The addition of gadolinium can provide further enhancement and more detail . Once a cardiac mass is detected, MRI is a great tool to help provide further characterization and is less invasive than surgery or biopsy.\n\n【12】Few cases have been described of large intracavitary masses. Starkey described a case of a cardiac thrombus which travelled across the tricuspid valve lying in the right atrium and right ventricle which was detected by echocardiogram. The patient received thrombolytics with IV streptokinase for this large thrombus. The patient eventually succumbed to a massive pulmonary embolism. They further describe that after investigating 2,000 autopsies, four cases of right ventricle embolism were reported as the cause of death, making it quite rare . Lee described a case of a 49-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with fluid overload. During diagnostic testing, she was found to have hyperechoic masses across the left ventricular apex and mitral annulus with a heterogeneous mass at the right atrium. They then used weighted MRI to help differentiate between cardiac masses, as they suspected the presence of multiple malignancies. After further differentiation, two of these masses were found to be thrombi and the latter was found to be a myxoma. After this discovery, heparin was started helping to dissolve two of the three masses. The tumor was excised and the patient made a full recovery .\n\n【13】We describe a case of an incidentally discovered intracavitary mass extending from the left atrium, across the mitral valve to the left ventricle and across the aortic valve. A thrombus was also visualized in the right atrium and right ventricle although it was unclear whether this was all one contiguous clot. In our literature review, we have yet to see such a thrombus described. As noted, right-sided thrombi have been reported to have a poor prognosis especially in the setting of hemodynamic compromise or right ventricular dysfunction . The patient did not have any risk factors for thrombi such as systolic dysfunction, ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, prosthetic valves, ventricular aneurysms or atrial fibrillation on presentation. She subsequently later developed atrial fibrillation during her hospitalization. The patient ultimately decided against surgery and was placed on anticoagulation prior to discharge. Clinicians should be aware of conditions that may predispose patients to large intracavitary thrombi and be aware of the poor prognosis. If a cardiac mass is found incidentally, contrast can be added to echocardiography or a more specific modality such as MRI can be used to further differentiate the structure. MRI can add contrast sequences to detect blood flow, which would not be present in the case of a cardiac thrombus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is usually well tolerated with mild-moderate side effects. As with any other chemotherapeutic agent, the effect is seen not only in the malignant clone of cells but also in the healthy cells leading to many of its adverse effects. As we continue to learn more about this novel agent, rare and some serious side effects are being reported. We hereby describe a case of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to sunitinib use for a patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma of allograft kidney with no evidence of metastatic disease to lungs.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 68-year-old man with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus who received a deceased donor kidney transplant four years ago was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma of the transplanted kidney, stage T3a N1M0 according to TNM staging for renal carcinoma with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. He underwent an allograft nephrectomy and was subsequently started on sunitinib at a dose of 25 mg daily on a 4 weeks on; 2 weeks off schedule. He tolerated it well with only mild nausea. Six months into his treatment with sunitinib, patient presented to the hospital with acute onset dyspnea of one day duration. He denied of fevers, productive cough or chest pain.\n\n【4】Examination revealed the patient to be in moderate respiratory distress. His pulse was 100 beats/minute, mean arterial blood pressure was 80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30/minute and oxygen saturation was 90% on six liters nasal cannula. There was no jugular venous distension. Auscultation revealed audible S1 and S2 without murmurs and coarse crackles in bilateral lung fields. Abdomen was nontender without rebound or guarding and no hepatosplenomegaly was appreciated. Mild pitting edema of lower extremities was noted.\n\n【5】Laboratory data revealed a white count of 8,400/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hemoglobin of 9 g/dL, platelet count of 147,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and normal serum chemistries. Arterial blood analysis revealed a pH of 7.36, arterial oxygen tension, 64 mmHg, Co2 tension, 38 mmHg. Chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities . Computerized tomographic images of the chest revealed bilateral ground glass alveolar opacities .\n\n【6】Patient was dialyzed for presumed fluid overload and was also started on broad spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Dialysis with ultra-filtration resulted in modest clinical improvement but the chest radiograph continued to show bilateral alveolar opacities. Blood cultures remained negative. The next day patient had an unexplained drop in hemoglobin from 9.0 g/dL to 6.3 g/dL. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed which revealed persistently bloody returns on sequential broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and the cultures and cytology remained negative. Sunitinib was held which resulted in marked clinical and radiographic improvement . Patient was weaned off supplemental oxygen. Sunitinib was withheld and alternative chemotherapy regimen was considered.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Sunitinib malate is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is usually well tolerated. Its effect is seen not only in the malignant clone of cells but also in the healthy cells leading to many of its adverse effects. Tyrosine kinase is a key enzyme utilized in many intracellular signaling pathways. Sunitinib targets receptors for platelet derived growth factors α and β and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) . The inhibition of these receptors plays a key role in reducing tumor angiogenesis, causing cell death and shrinkage of the tumor . It also inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases including stem cell factor receptor, FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor receptor. Due to its action on multiple receptors, a substantial clinical effect has been seen not only in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and GIST, but also in non-small cell lung cancer and other tumors . The adverse effects noted with sunitinib are due to its multi-receptor action affecting not only malignant tissues but healthy tissues as well. These include fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, hematotoxicity, stomatitis, hand- foot syndrome, nausea, skin problems, hypothyroidism, bleeding and abnormal heart function. Rare and serious adverse effects have been reported in isolated case reports. These include bowel perforation, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, hyperparathyroidism, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients treated for GIST) . There has been only one case report of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to sunitinib in a patient with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lung .\n\n【9】Alveolar hemorrhage has been reported as an adverse effect with the development of anti-angiogenic therapeutic agents. Fatal tumor-related bleeding in patients treated with bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic, recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF is well known . Sunitinib led to fatal alveolar hemorrhage events in two patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer in a phase II trial of previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer . Our case is unique as the patient did not have any evidence of lung metastasis but developed alveolar hemorrhage while on sunitinib. Vascular endothelial growth factor is one of the principal pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors and has a key role in endothelial cell growth and survival. VEGF coordinates proper development of the normal lung epithelium and vasculature. Inhibition of VEGF results in inhibition of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, decrease in the regenerative capacity of the endothelial cells causing endothelial dysfunction in the supporting layers of the blood vessels. The inhibition of VEGF is a possible mechanism involved in the destruction of normal lung tissue and subsequent alveolar hemorrhage.\n\n【10】Although these targeted therapies have drastically improved the prognosis of patients with advanced RCC, there is still much to be learnt about their optimal dosing and scheduling. The recently concluded EFFECT trial revealed superiority of 4/2 schedule over daily continuous dosing in regards to optimum therapeutic drug concentrations . With the increasing use of sunitinib in treatment of solid tumors, it is important to be aware of this potential adverse effect. Physicians need to be vigilant for alveolar hemorrhage in patients on sunitinib with or without evidence of lung metastasis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2d3f013c-f343-46e0-a995-020f852e3119", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Cardiac hemochromatosis is a rare and serious medical condition that is caused by excessive iron deposition in the heart. Although it may be presented late in women due to menstrual blood loss, men usually present with it earlier in the third or fourth decade of life with symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia. This is a case of a young patient presenting with heart failure symptoms with incidental elevated iron level in the body in the absence of common risk factors of heart disease.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We present a case of a previously healthy 32-year-old Hispanic man who presented with newly onset shortness of breath, orthopnea, intermittent palpitation and bilateral leg swelling and unintentional 10 pounds weight gain during the last month. He reported that his shortness of breath is progressive and he could not walk more than one block recently. He denied any recent chest pain, dizziness, syncope, fever, night sweats, recent hospitalization or travel history. The patient was recently diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was also told that he has abnormal liver functions when he received abdominal ultrasound for other reasons although he denied any history of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.\n\n【4】Upon hospital admission, blood pressure (BP) was 96/68, pulse rate 103, respiratory rate 18, and oral temperature 97.6 °F (36.4 °C) with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 97% and body mass index (BMI) of 25.50 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【5】On examination jugular venous distention was noticed with heart examination showing irregular heartbeats, normal S1 and S2, without murmurs or rub. Bilateral lungs crackles in the mid and lower lungs were heard in addition to bilateral leg pitting edema. He had normal hemoglobin level, mild elevated liver function test (LFT), and elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1,517. Iron panel showed a high iron level of 255 and low unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) of < 55, and transferrin of 214 with elevated ferritin of 7,049. Common hemochromatosis gene mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) were negative.\n\n【6】Chest X-ray showed pulmonary congestions with bilateral pleural effusions. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed new onset atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with transthoracic echocardiogram showing mild left ventricular hypertrophy with newly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (30-35%) in addition to diastolic dysfunction. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hepatic hemochromatosis with secondary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The patient was diagnosed with acutely decompensated heart failure secondary to hemochromatosis that was confirmed with cardiac MRI. Our patient was treated for heart failure and A-fib and started on weekly phlebotomy. His condition was improved significantly afterward.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The cornerstone of diagnosis of hemochromatosis relies on molecular diagnosis. The genetic heterogeneity of hemochromatosis is mediated by hepcidin-ferroportin interaction. Most cases of adult-onset hemochromatosis arise from single point mutation at position 282 (C282Y) of the hydration free energy (HFE) protein that results in the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine. It accounts for about 80% of hemochromatosis and is particularly common in northern Europe. It is also most common in whites, but extremely rare in nonwhites.\n\n【9】The second common mutation is characterized by the replacement of histidine by aspartic acid at position 63 of the protein (H63D). Its contribution to the clinical disease is minimal, except in compound heterozygosity with C282Y. Although other mutations were discovered, they are much less common as those below. Our patient, however, presented with C282Y and H63D negative mutations. Table 1 shows the most common etiology of iron overload in hemochromatosis .\n\n【10】Secondary hemochromatosis includes that secondary to iron-loading anemia (transfusion-related), such as in thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, sideroblastic anemia, diamond blackfan anemia, congenital dyserythropoesis anemia, chronic renal disease, end-stage renal disease, dialysis and post-stem cell transplant patients, and that secondary to dietary overload (African iron overload), due to increased diet with genetic predisposition.\n\n【11】The miscellaneous type includes fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, hepatitis B and C, alcoholic liver disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and aceruloplasminemia.\n\n【12】Pathologic iron deposition begins initially within the epicardium and extends towards the myocardium and then endocardium, which helps explain the preservation of heart systolic function until very late in the disease . Myocardial cell damage in hemochromatosis is mediated by production of reactive free radicals especially hydroxyl ions .\n\n【13】The initial symptoms are quite variable ranging from totally asymptomatic early in the disease to terminal irreversible heart failure symptoms in severely iron overloaded patients.\n\n【14】Patients often presented with exertional shortness of breath (as in our patient) as a result of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction secondary to restrictive pathophysiology. As the condition progresses to a dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic failure can happen and more symptoms develop .\n\n【15】Iron deposition in the conduction system can cause different arrhythmias with paroxysmal A-fib being the most common arrhythmia seen in iron-induced cardiomyopathy .\n\n【16】As the extent of iron deposition increases in atrium, supraventricular arrhythmias and first-degree atrioventricular blocks may happen, which correlates with the extent of disease . Left ventricular dilatation with systolic dysfunction predisposes to more frequent ventricular arrhythmias. As severe cardiac impairment happens, average survival is usually less than 1 year .\n\n【17】Hemochromatosis should be suspected due to positive family history, abnormal hepatic enzymes, endocrinopathies, or other organ involvement which are followed by measurements of ferritin level and transferrin saturation. A transferrin saturation of greater than 55% and a serum ferritin concentration of greater than 300 µg/L in men and greater than 200 µg/L in women make the diagnosis of hemochromatosis after exclusion of secondary causes of iron overload. Diagnosis of hemochromatosis nowadays relies on genetic testing. Testing for HFE and H63D mutations should be performed once iron overload conformed to differentiating hereditary hemochromatosis from hemosiderosis. Those patients who test positive for C282Y homozygote and the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote are considered at highest risk for the disease.\n\n【18】As iron overload proceeds, echocardiography may reveal ventricular diastolic dysfunction with cardiac dilatation and progressive evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy from myocardial damage .\n\n【19】Iron deposition in the heart tends to be patchy; therefore biopsies may miss the areas of deposition and provide a false negative result. Quantitation of liver iron can be obtained by measuring liver iron concentration (LIC) in the liver, which can be noninvasively measured using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), a very sensitive technique, but its use is limited by the very small number of available machines .\n\n【20】Alternatively, MRI is the only presently available noninvasive method with the potential to assess quantitatively myocardial iron load. It provides an accurate reproducible measure of left ventricular systolic EF that can be followed over the course of therapy. Non-iron overloaded hearts tend to be homogenous and relaxation time lasts for a longer duration. Hearts with iron overload, however, produce changes in MR signal intensity, which shortens the relaxation time and darkens the image more quickly. T2\\ method which stands for time constant decay of gradient echo in milliseconds is highly sensitive and specific for quantitation of myocardial iron deposition. As myocardial iron deposition increases, the relaxation time will be shortened. Thus, T2\\ will be shorter, and progressive decline in left ventricular EF will be noticed . Cardiac T2\\ value is useful in providing guidance through the course of treatment and assessing the time interval for monitoring of cardiac function .\n\n【21】Management of hemochromatosis is mandatory especially in symptomatic patients once iron level increases significantly to protect the heart and prevent liver fibrosis. Phlebotomy remains the most effective treatment that prevents organ damage and increases survival if started early during disease. The recommended protocol is to remove (one or two) 400- to 500-mL units of blood (approximately 200-250 mg iron in each unit) weekly, until serum ferritin level is less than 50 ng/mL and transferrin saturation less than 30% thereafter by periodic removal of blood.\n\n【22】Once iron depletion is reached, lifelong therapy with three to four phlebotomies per year maintains the iron store at an adequately low level. Improvements in cardiac function in hemochromatosis patients with cardiomyopathy and refractory arrhythmias have been noted with aggressive iron removal with phlebotomy, especially when started early in the disease process. Gonadal dysfunction and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus require lifelong hormonal replacement therapy.\n\n【23】At present, the only therapy alternative to phlebotomy for patients with anemia or severe cardiac disease is iron chelation to detoxify body organs. Patients can be managed with chelators like deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone with protocols that are similar to those established for secondary iron overload. Serum ferritin and urinary iron excretion are used to monitor the treatment efficacy. Erythropoietin has been used in selected patients to increase hemoglobin levels and to allow concomitant phlebotomy.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】The goal of this case report is to consider the possibility of cardiac hemochromatosis in any patient with unexplained heart failure with elevated serum iron especially in the absence of significant risk factors. Cardiac hemochromatosis is a potentially lethal but preventable disease. Imaging using MRI in addition to genetic testing has replaced liver biopsy which is restricted to patients who do not have an informative genotype or is used for prognostic evaluation in cases of severe iron loading. Frequent iron studies in addition to phlebotomy form the cornerstone for disease management. This case shows a rare and interesting young patient who was tested negative for the common mutations. However, diagnosis of hemochromatosis was established based on clinical, biochemical and imaging studies. This was confirmed by significant improvement in patient’s symptoms as well as his cardiac function with the most recent left ventricular EF being 54% after phlebotomy was initiated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The benefits of reperfusion therapy and dual antiplatelet therapy have been clearly demonstrated . In the literature on perioperative use of antiplatelet agents is a warning signal when prescribed for secondary prevention after MI or coronary stenting. Besides, studies showed a high risk of MACEs if a non-cardiac surgery was performed early after coronary stenting especially less than two to six weeks . We present a case diagnosed as acute hemorrhagic and necrosis cholecystitis on the 7th day after coronary stenting for acute MI especially she has been receiving aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 66-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of palpitation and sweating for one hour after activities. She had a history of hypertension for 10 years and cerebral infarction for 5 years. Besides she received bowel resection for intestinal obstruction 30 years ago.According to the symptom, electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, the diagnosis was acute inferior, posterior and right ventricular MI . Emergency coronary angiography showed the proximal of right coronary artery occlusion completely and we placed a drug-eluting stent there. Then she was admitted to coronary care unit, where continuous infusion of tirofiban, a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor, (0.1 µg/kg/min) for 72 hours, oral clopidogrel (75 mg/d) plus aspirin (100 mg/d), subcutaneous fragmin 6150AXaIU/12 hours.\n\n【4】Six days later, she shivered violently and the body temperature rose to 39.4 °C. Laboratory test showed the leukocyte count of 13.36 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, the neutrophil account for 91.9%. On the 7th day, she shivered again with the temperature rose to 40.8 °C. Physical examination was normal except for right upper abdominal tenderness. Abdominal ultrasonography showed gallstone and acute cholecystitis .\n\n【5】Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the first choice for most cholecystitis patients . For severe acute cholecystitis, urgent management of organ dysfunction and severe local inflammation by cholecystectomy should be carried out . For this patient, surgery can remove the focus of infection fundamentally. Given she had suffered from acute MI 7 days ago especially she had been receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, she had a high risk of MACEs, bleeding and other adverse events during the perioperative period of cholecystectomy. Besides she received bowel resection 30 years ago, open cholecystectomy would be necessary. An emergency open cholecystectomy was performed that daywith no blood transfusion. The pathological conclusion was acute hemorrhagic and necrosis cholecystitis and inflammation of gallbladder surrounding tissues .\n\n【6】After the operation, we prescribed fragmin 6150AXaIU/12 hours with no aspirin or clopidogrel. The drainage was 100 mL and 30 mL respectively on the first two days and the drainage tube was removed on the third day. One day later, clopidogrel (75 mg/d) and aspirin (100 mg/d) was reinstituted. She was discharged on the 8th day after operation without MACEs or surgery complications with a follow-up at the cardiology department for one year.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】There is no literature about cholecystectomy early after acute MI. An increased risk of MACEs for non-cardiac surgery early after coronary stenting has been suggested and the most important reason is stent thrombosis . It is reported that the mortality was 32% in patients subjected to surgery less than 2 weeks from coronary stenting . Among the 40 patients, 2 of them underwent cholecystectomy with no MACEs. Wilson and associates found the increased risk persisted for 6 weeks and the mortality was 4.8% . Among the 207 patients studied, 2 of them underwent abdominal surgery less than 6 weeks and both suffered from MACEs. Reddy and Vaitkus reviewed all the 56 cases of coronary stenting with subsequent surgery, 8 developed MACEs with none when surgery performed after 6 weeks . Schouten and associates found in patients undergoing early surgery, discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period maybe a major cause of increasing in MACEs, mainly result from stent thrombosis .\n\n【9】In conclusion, whenever possible non-cardiac surgery should be postponed to 6 weeks after coronary stenting . Emergency surgery is an alternative method for acute MI patient accompanied by acute necrosis cholecystitis and sepsis. Further prospective clinical studies are needed to define whether surgeries can be performed safely with minimum interruption or continuous of antiplatelet therapy for acute MI patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "94f25f19-0728-45fa-8fad-88f01a57ee9a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Stimulant drugs including methylphenidate (MPH) are the first-line treatment for school-aged children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To achieve euphoria, stay awoke and improve alertness, higher doses may be taken as misuse of the drug. The abuse of MPH among teenagers has become more common and increased death rates have been reported. Since its availability, MPH overdoses have been seen more commonly similar to overdoses with other amphetamine-like drugs . Widespread use of MPH raised serious concerns regarding abuse, toxic and possible life-threatening effects in pediatric patients. In 2004, 8,336 cases of MPH intoxication have been reported in the United States . Clinical manifestations of MPH intoxication especially include central nervous system and cardiovascular system findings. Although the clinical manifestations include symphathomimetic findings like irritability, agitation, palpitation, hyperreflexia, seizures, hypertension, hyperventilation and hyperthermia, it may also cause stroke, tics, toxic psychosis, Tourette’s syndrome and neuromuscular findings such as dyskinesia and paresthesia . However, hyperventilation due to MPH overdose is rare and carpopedal spasm associated with overdose of MPH has not been reported to date.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 10-year-old girl applied to our emergency department with agitation, crying and wandering complaints. She had received a high dose of MPH (11 MPH 10-mg tablets) two times higher than the daily maximum allowed dose 2 h before the admission (3.14 mg/kg). Her blood pressure was 126/83 mmHg, pulse rate was 114/min, respiration rate was 22/min and temperature was 37.1 °C. Her physical examination revealed tachypnea, palpitation, numbness in the hands and feet and carpopedal spasm. The initial blood tests revealed a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 17 mg/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 96 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1.08 mmol/L (N: 1.12-1.32), total calcium 9.1 mg/dl (N: 8.1-10.4), magnesium 2.1 mg/dL, glucose 93 mg/dL, phosphate 5.1 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase14 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase 25 IU/L. Blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.47, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 26 mmHg, pO <sub>2 </sub> 47 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> 29 mmol/L and base excess +1.2 mmol/L. Corrected QT time was measured as 0.47 s from simultaneously taken ECG (N: 0.31 - 0.44 s).\n\n【4】The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, gastric lavage was performed and 1 g/kg of activated charcoal through nasogastric tube was administered. The patient was treated with the paper bag ventilation and at the end of the first hour, her numbness and contraction began to resolve. At the fourth hour, the heart rate and blood pressure were in normal levels. The blood gas analysis showed pH 7.4, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 38 mmHg, pO <sub>2 </sub> 52 mmHg and HCO <sub>3 </sub> 23 mmol/L. Corrected QT time was measured as 0.41 s. The patient’s symptoms, clinical findings, blood gas analysis and ECG findings returned to normal 4 - 6 h after the initiation of treatment. Carpopedal spasm rapidly responded to paper bag ventilation and normalization of arterial carbondioxide levels. The patient was discharged in the second day of hospitalization with normal systemic examination findings and resolved complaints.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】MPH is the primary treatment of ADHD and exerts its efficacy through neurotransmitters including dopamine, noradrenalin, adrenalin and serotonin. Also, it is thought to be exerting its efficacy on hyperactivity through dopaminergic activity in the certain areas of the brain . A wide range of indications of the MPH make it the most commonly prescribed psychostimulant. Therefore, accidental or suicidal intoxications related with MPH have been increased dramatically. The present case was diagnosed as ADHD and had used MPH for 4 months.\n\n【7】After oral administration, MPH absorbed rapidly and almost completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentration is reached in 2 h. Clinical signs begin to appear 4 - 6 h after oral administration . The clinical findings in our case have emerged 5 - 6 h after the ingestion of the drug.\n\n【8】Clinical findings related with high doses of MPH resemble the overdose of amphetamine-like drugs. In addition to neurologic (headache, depression, abnormal movements or rigidity, paranoia and hallucinations), cardiovascular (hypertension, tachycardia and chest pain) and gastrointestinal (vomiting and abdominal pain) changes, hyperthermia, dysrhythmias and convulsions can be detected in some cases . However, there is no association between the severity of clinical symptoms and the dose of MPH intake . Foley et al  reported that exposures to MPH in children were accidental and most of them were asymptomatic. However, exposures to MPH in adolescent were intentional and half of them were asymptomatic. In some reports 80 mg  and 270 mg  MPH were found to be well tolerated. For this reason, determined toxic dose of MPH is unknown. In our patient ingestion of overdose of MPH at 110 mg caused cardiovascular and neuromuscular findings as toxicity.\n\n【9】A reduction in cerebral blood flow in the setting of hyperventilation, hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis may explain the neurologic symptoms associated with hyperventilation including paresthesias. Although there is no evidence that hyperventilation results in changes in total serum calcium levels, respiratory alkalosis may also trigger changes in ionized serum calcium levels with consequent binding of calcium to albumin, and it can result in paresthesias and tetany. Paresthesias and tetany in patients with hyperventilation are mainly secondary to decreased PaCO <sub>2 </sub> in the setting of respiratory alkalosis. Carpopedal spasm rapidly responded to paper bag ventilation and normalization of arterial carbondiokside levels .\n\n【10】Central nervous system stimulants can lead to hyperventilation. Blood pCO <sub>2 </sub> value decreases as a result of hyperventilation. These patients may present with very different clinical pictures including paresthesia and carpopedal spasm . The cause of paresthesia and spasms due to hyperventilation is unknown; however, it may be related with the decrease in ionized calcium due to alkalosis .\n\n【11】In conclusion, MPH is commonly prescribed for patients with ADHD and has become easily avaliable drug for children. Side effects of MPH are well known and possible findings in the event of poisoning and drug abuse should be recognized. It should be known that the patients can apply with spasm carpopedal and it can be treated easily with the paper bag ventilation. Respiratory alkalosis may trigger changes in ionized serum calcium levels which should be taken into consideration rather than total calcium level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Since it is a rare condition, it is generally reported as sporadic cases, most of which have been in children. Its significance is that it frequently presents as a case of ‘intestinal obstruction of unknown origin’. We, herewith, reviewed such a case of acutely obstructing interparietal hernia in an adult.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 30-year-old male had applied to another center with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and constipation, all of which were lasting for three days. The abdominal ultrasound (US) had demonstrated a mass pressing on the urinary bladder, which was thought to be a tumor originating from the bladder itself or from neighboring intra-abdominal structures. However, the cystoscopy had been normal, and revealed no signs of neoplasm or calculus. During his follow-up, the pain had become more intense, and physical examination showed signs of acute abdomen. The patient was referred to our department. At physical examination of the patient after admission, we detected abdominal distension with muscular guarding and rebound tenderness in all quadrants. The bowel sounds were hypoactive. His laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin 12.7 g/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hematocrit 36.4%, leukocyte 11,800/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 194,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , Na 135 mEq/L, K 3.8 mEq/L, Cl 102 mEq/L. His liver function tests were normal. We performed an abdominal US, which demonstrated distended intestinal loops in the abdomen, and a mass of edematous intestines located in the lower right iliac fossa. The computed tomography of the abdomen defined distended jejunal loops, and helical torsion of ileal segments located in the rectovesical fossa. The cecum and the rest of colon were normal in size. The characteristic helical torsion of ileum was interpreted as a sign of internal herniation, however its cause remained unclear .\n\n【4】The patient undertook emergency operation with a diagnosis of acute abdomen and incarcerated intra-abdominal herniation of unknown origin. Through a lower midline incision we explored the abdominal cavity. We found that a thirty-centimeter loop of ileum, about 80 cm proximal from the ileocecal valve, was incarcerated in a peritoneal recession in the anterior parietal peritoneum. The peritoneal sac enveloping the edematous intestine was located in the retromuscular space posterior to the right rectus muscle. The level of herniation was at about one-third ofthe distance from the symphysis pubis to the umbilicus. We could not determine whether the point of recession had any relation with the semicircular line. However, we did know that it did not pass through the transversalis fascia, and was definitely not a spigelian hernia. We considered that this was a preperitoneal type of interparietal hernia . We reduced the incarcerated segment of ileum, which was inflamed, edematous and patchy with ecchymosed areas . We resected this segment and accomplished an end-to-end anastomose. We pulled back the sac and excised it. We closed the defect with en bloc interrupted polypropylene sutures.\n\n【5】The patient had a remarkable recovery in the postoperative period, and was discharged on the 4th postoperative day. He was free of any symptoms at his follow-up at six months.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Bartolin first described interparietal hernia in 1661 . Its definition has not changed since then, however, three subtypes have been described recently. The three subtypes are preperitoneal (between peritoneum and transversalis fascia), interstitial (between transversalis fascia and transverse, internal oblique or external oblique muscles), and superficial (between external oblique and skin or within aponeuroses of the inguinal region) . Lower and Hicken  reported in their series, which is still the largest published one, that the interparietal hernias among all inguinal hernias should be as frequent as 0.01-1.6%. They also commented that the interstitial subtype comprised of 60% of the cases, while the other two subtypes occurred 29% each. It is reported that the interparietal hernia is predominant in males .\n\n【8】The interparietal hernias are frequently confused with inguinal hernias. The diagnosis is usually determined during the operation, as it was the case in our patient. Koot  discussed whether the interparietal hernias, which frequently presents with small bowel obstruction and appears at a level above inguinal ligament, are a rare variation of inguinal hernias. In the case of closed vaginal process and intact internal ring, the interparietal hernia should be considered as a preperitoneal type. If the hernia has past through the internal ring, it is then an interstitial hernia. However, its high incidence in children and adult males suggests a relationship between the etiopathogenesis of interparietal hernia and the embryological descent of the testis, an issue that is not fully understood.\n\n【9】The biggest problem with the interparietal hernia is that its preoperative diagnosis is seldom, if ever. The preoperative imaging techniques play a significant role in naming of the condition. The computed tomography (CT) is the method of choice in the differential diagnosis, which can exclude the presence of an obstructing tumor. However, it is reported that both CT and herniography are not successful in differentiating the different types of inguinal hernia . In our case the CT depicted very well that the mass was not a tumor, however it did not differentiate it as an interparietal hernia. It seems that the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive and specific in differentiating the inguinal anatomy . The intraperitoneal scintigraphy has also been utilized in the diagnosis of inguinal conditions . Although it is generally accepted that US does not yield in a definite diagnosis due to tissue factors , recent studies have reported successful results with the US in differentiating hernia types in the inguinal region .\n\n【10】We conclude that surgeons may sometimes come across with interparietal hernias either in the form of an odd inguinal hernia or as a case of acute intestinal obstruction of an unknown origin. Surgeons may reach to a correct preoperative diagnosis if they consider it when they have a case of unknown origin. The emergency approach to repair is straightforward once it is diagnosed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "abb22b47-7a54-405d-9dac-32d143bf6cbe", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Infectious endocarditis (IE) caused by non-HACEK Gram-negative (GN) (organism other than Hemophilus species, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Cardiobacterium hominis , Eikenella corrodens , and Kingella species) is extraordinarily infrequent, accounting for 1.8% of the total IE cases. Escherichia coli and Pseudomona aeruginosa (PA) are the most frequent bacilli of this group, with a prevalence of 29% and 22%, respectively . During the 80s and 90s, intravenous drug use (IDU) was the main cause of non-healthcare-associated right heart IE, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus and PA . During the last decade, the increase in the number of invasive medical procedures performed has constituted a rising and prevalent risk factor to develop IE caused by PA, being the origin of 55.6% of the IE cases analyzed by Lin et al  and 57% in Morpeth et al’s study . The latter only reports 4% of cases associated with IDU. We present the case of a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) who developed an IE caused by PA on this valve after a surgical resection of a malignant axillary myoepithelioma. In spite of optimal antibiotic treatment, secondary and repetitive septic emboli precipitated an urgent aortic valve substitution surgery. Notwithstanding the high mortality associated with this type of IE, caused by PA on a BAV , the postsurgical recovery was uneventful.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 53-year-old man, consumer of moderate doses of alcohol up to the year prior to admission and affected by psoriatic arthritis under treatment with monthly subcutaneous secukinumab, suffered from a malignant and recidivant myoepithelioma in his right axilla and arm, and underwent two surgeries, the first one 2 years ago and the latter a month prior to the current admission. After the last intervention, while admitted at the general surgery unit, he had some feverish peaks without any other associated symptomatology. Three sets of blood cultures were drawn and empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin was initiated. The physical examination exhibited absence of heart failure signs, rhythmic heart sounds and an ejective aortic murmur II/VI along with a protomesodiastolic aortic murmur. No abnormal neurological signs or skin lesions were objectified.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】Laboratory studies showed a normocytic and normochromic anemia with high levels of ferritin, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, thrombopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein, quantified in 226 mg/dL (normal values < 3 mg/dL). Troponin T was elevated to 161 pg/mL (normal values < 14 pg/mL). Urine culture was negative. An initial pair of blood culture and another control 1 week later were obtained, and in all of them, PA was isolated. The electrocardiogram showed a 70 bpm sinus rhythm without any alterations. The transthoracic echocardiogram exhibited a non-dilated left ventricle, with moderate hypertrophy, with preserved ejection fraction. BAV was calcified, with double moderate lesions . Given the poor ultrasound acoustic window as well as the high suspicious of endocarditis, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed, confirming the presence of BAV with ecodense and mobile images adhered to both cusps, suggestive of vegetations, measuring the largest 11 mm . Double moderate lesion of the BAV was confirmed . A total body computed tomography was performed, showing multiple spleen infarctions as a fundamental finding and dilatation of the aorta was ruled out. Once the surgical valvular substitution was performed, the native valve culture confirmed an acute IE caused by PA and the pathological anatomy showed neutrophil infiltration, fibrolymphocyte exudate and chondroid metaplasia .\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Antibiogram-directed antibiotic therapy with meropenem and tobramicin was initiated. However, in the presence of repetitive spleen infarctions and the vegetation size, an aortic valve substitution surgery was performed 12 days after admission and 6 days after the IE diagnosis was established, following the current clinical practice guidelines of IE . A bioprosthesis aortic valve Mosaic no. 23 was implanted and a 6-week antibiogram-guided antibiotic regimen was completed.\n\n【9】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【10】The postsurgical evolution was favorable and the patient was discharged after a month of admission with ambulatory follow-up and a home hospitalization regime for the antibiotic administration. Cultures prior to discharge were negative for PA. A screening transthoracic -echocardiography to look for BAV or dilatation of aortic sinuses and ascendant aorta would be suggested to his first-grade relatives .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】We present the case of a patient suffering from IE caused by PA on a BAV, which has rarely been reported . IE caused by non-HACEK germs is a rare disease with high mortality and morbidity rates . Despite gram-positive bacteria being the main IE etiology, the rising prevalence of infections caused by non-HACEK GN germs  has attracted attention because of their propensity to develop and spread antibiotic resistance, rising mortality and elevating the health expenditure . In a large multi-centric and international database, including 2,761 patients admitted between 2000 and 2005, only 49 cases (1.8%) were attributable to aerobic GN non-HACEK germs . The 57% of the IE cases of this series were healthcare-associated (HCA-IE) and only 4% were related to IDU. This reduction of the IDU, a known risk factor for the right heart community-acquired IE in the past years, has been related to a decrease of the parenteral drug abuse. In this review, Escherichia coli and PA were the more frequent non-HACEK GN bacilli, representing 29% and 22%, respectively, with 59% isolated on a prosthetic valve . Other authors have demonstrated this rise of the non-HACEK GN IE associated with HCA-IE, as well as the decrease of the IDU related. In a most recent review, carried out between 2005 and 2015, a total amount of 26 IE caused by PA were found: three of them were community-acquired, eight HCA-IE with a nosocomial origin and 10 non-nosocomial but HCA-IE-related. Five cases had not a conclusive origin, being the great majority, as our patient one, linked to a prior medical intervention. Native valves were involved in a 65.4%, not being reported any of them as bicuspid . To this day, the only case reported as BAV and IE causes by PA is the one published in 1991 . Systemic and cardiac complications occurred in a third and a fifth, respectively, of the cases . The non-HACEK GN IE represents 4-10% of the IE over native valves and 2-15% on prosthetic valves . In spite of the HCA-IE caused by PA, the low PA incidence, in comparison to other pathogens, makes the clinical characterization of this infection more difficult . Although our patient was not IDU, he presented some risks predisposing to infection: ex-alcohol consumer, being under immunosuppression therapy for psoriatic arthritis, did not know his BAV and, as previously referred, was twice intervened from malignant myoepithelioma, 2 years and a month prior to admission.\n\n【13】Non-HACEK GN IE, compared to gram-positive germs, has been related to a higher frequency of intravascular dispositive presence (29% vs. 11%; P < 0.001), a non-oral gastrointestinal or urinary main door (35% vs. 12%; P < 0.001), a non-dental invasive procedure on the 60 days prior to symptom initiation (38% vs. 19%; P = 0.002) and a higher in-hospital mortality rates (24% vs. 17%, although this last difference was not statistically significant, P = 0.190) . A bibliographic review of 40 cases of IE caused by PA in non-IDU people showed a global mortality rate around 64% .\n\n【14】A recent published article analyzed 3,028 IE cases from 31 Spanish hospitals (GAMES group), finding 54 patients with IE on BAV . The majority were men (n = 43, 79.6%), with a mean age of 43 years (interquartile range (IQR): 36 - 53 years) and low comorbidity rate. From the BAV patients group, only one had a non-HACEK GN bacillus (1.9%), with Streptococcus viridans being the most frequent IE responsible germ (35.2%) and the oral cavity being the main door (14.8%). The intracardiac complications and heart failure were frequent (50% and 40.7%, respectively). In our case, the initial high troponin T level suggested poor cardiovascular prognosis . Cardiac surgery was indicated in 75.9% and performed in 68% of the cases. The in-hospital mortality was 5.6%. The authors conclude that the patients with IE on BAV have a similar clinical evolution to those considered under high risk for IE prophylaxis, under the current recommendations , as well as they have more intracardiac complications compared to the low/intermediate risk and an increased need for surgery . Moreover, the prevalence of IE in the BAV population is 2-5%, significantly higher than the IE prevalence in the general population (1 - 3 per 100,000 people) . According to the indirect data, prophylaxis IE should be considered on this group of patients. In addition, first-grade relatives should undergo a screening transthoracic echocardiography to rule out this pathology given the potential complications associated . Although the microbiology and the ideal treatment for IE caused by non-HACEK GN are relatively unknown, the current recommendations suggest cardiac surgery and combined and prolonged antibiotic therapy as a reasonable therapeutical approach . When this combination is not performed, left-side IE shows higher mortality rates. In a current bibliographic review, Hagiya et al observed a mortality rate of 62% with antibiotic therapy alone, compared to a 31% when a combination of surgery and medical therapy was performed. However, there is certain bias increasing the mortality rate of the non-surgical group as cardiac surgery was denied to the high surgical risk patients . The actual consensus recommends a combined antibiotic therapy with a B-lactam (cephalosporin or carbapenems), and an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone for 6 weeks . Despite the combined therapy efficacy is controversial, it could be preferable given the possibility of antibiotic-resistant strains  and infectious disease experts should be consulted . Nevertheless, the great variability between the different observational studies design, the lack of long-term follow-up data and the surgical patients’ selection bias makes a limitation for taking definitive conclusions about the optimal treatment . Nowadays, the GAMES group are analyzing the IE caused by GN from a multi-centric, large national series, with data since 2009, which probably will provide some answers about the evolution and therapeutic approach to the patients suffering from PA IE.\n\n【15】As a conclusion of this report, here, we present the case of a 53-year-old man who was a consumer of moderate doses of alcohol up to the year prior to admission and affected by psoriatic arthritis under treatment with monthly secukinumab. He was not known to have a BAV and he developed an IE, caused by PA on this valve, after a surgical resection of a malignant axillary myoepithelioma. Antibiogram-directed antibiotic therapy was initiated. However, in the presence of repetitive spleen infarctions and the vegetation size, an aortic valve substitution surgery was performed with a bioprosthesis valve implantation 12 days after admission. Despite the high morbimortality of IE caused by this GN bacillus, the combination of an adequate medical and surgical approach resulted in a satisfactory evolution of the patient and he could be discharged from our hospital.\n\n【16】Learning points\n\n【17】HCA-IE, and specially those caused by non-HACEK GN germs, constitutes a growing entity, given the exponential increase on the performance of invasive procedures in the contemporaneous medical practice, even in patients with broad comorbidities and advanced age. This case pretends to draw attention to the prevalence of IE after invasive procedures and the need to consider a combined medical and surgical therapeutical approach given the high mortality rates and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains on this group. In addition, patients with BAV show a similar clinical evolution to those considered under high risk for IE prophylaxis and higher rate of intracardiac complications, supporting the need to consider the candidacy of this patient to antibiotic profilaxis when undergoing an invasive procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Presence of psychotic symptoms is also a risk factor for the development of PD dementia and mortality . Recently, new criteria for PD associated psychosis were proposed by an NIH-sponsored workshop. According to these criteria, the diagnosis of PDAP requires at least one of the following features: hallucinations, delusions, sense of presence and visual illusions, occurring with a clear sensorium and a chronic course . In a study patients 43% of 116 PD patients had either hallucinations or delusions, while 60% fulfilled the NINDS-NIMH criteria for PD associated psychosis .\n\n【2】These psychotic symptoms are likely to be induced by high doses of antiparkinsonian drugs, but they also can occur intrinsically . Presence of psychotic symptoms significantly alters prognosis .\n\n【3】The psychotic symptoms are often resistant to antipsychotics, and PD patients easily become intolerant to them . Thus, psychosis is an essential determinant of PD prognosis, and its management is one of the most critical issues in the management of PD. There are a few studies about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) use in PD psychosis and some other non-motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case of PD who had benefitted from ECT against psychotic and motor symptoms.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 42-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed as PD according to United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria  since 2008, attended to our clinic with a history of agitation, paranoid delusions and severe insomnia. He was on a treatment of Ropinirole 12 mg/day. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed no cognitive impairment, but just mild memory impairment comprising of secondary attention deficits without primary memory deficits. He had persecutive and paranoid delusions with no insight, and had depressive periods which were not long enough to be diagnosed as depression. His delusions were jealous type, believing that his spouse is cheating in the absence of evidence to support his belief. He also had visual hallucinations as vivid sensation of the presence of a man somewhere in the house. He also reported that he heard his wife had sexual intercourse with that man while the patient was sleeping beside them. Neurological examination did not demonstrate any resting tremor but moderate rigidity of both upper extremities. His axial rigidity was prominent. He also had bradykinesia and micrographia.\n\n【6】After the clinical evaluation, he was diagnosed as PD associated psychosis he was started on quetiapine 25 mg/day with a plan to increase the dose gradually up to 100 mg/day. For the control of mild depressive symptoms, escitalopram 10 mg/day was also added to his treatment. He was scored 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), 82 on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and 47 on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).\n\n【7】Ten days later, his psychotic symptoms worsened and eventually lead to hospital admission. His aggression got worsened and his homicide thoughts became more evident. He got a gun for punishing his wife. Upon his admission to the inpatient unit, his medication was gradually switched to clozapine 100 mg/day as the quetiapine dose tapered off. Escitalopram 10 mg/day and ropinirole 12 mg/day were continued and ECT planned. He received a total of five sessions of ECT, performed on an every other day basis with Thymartron System IV (Somatics, IL, USA). Bitemporal bilateral electrode placement was selected. Anesthesia induction was attained with methohexital 100 - 150 mg IV and succinylcholine 100 - 120 mg IV. Seizure threshold was determined using a dose titration schedule. His motor and psychotic signs showed significant improvement two weeks after. His escitalopram plasma level was found to be 38 ng/mL (15 - 80 ng/mL), clozapine and norclozapine plasma levels were 124.9/144.0 ng/mL (350 - 600 ng/mL). Even though the plasma levels of clozapine were below the therapeutic levels, it was not needed to change the dosage due to his near perfect clinical improvement. His scores on HYS, PANSS and BPRS were 2, 38 and 18 respectively.\n\n【8】Last follow-up appointment with the patient was 6 months after the last ECT and, his scores almost remained the same. Patient is still in our follow-up with planned clinical visits every 4 months.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Researchers are increasingly attending to and characterizing the non-motor symptoms of the disease such as depression, apathy, dementia, insomnia and psychosis . Thus, PD is no longer conceptualized as a sole motor disorder.\n\n【11】Previous studies have repeatedly shown that several clinical factors were associated with visual hallucinations and PD associated psychosis, most consistently found being dementia, a longer duration of PD, and/or an older age . In our case, age was extremely young, PD duration was 5 years and there was not any dementia. In this case dopaminergic treatment was suspected as the cause of the psychosis, but reduction on ropinirole dose or switching to another medication was not possible due to worsening of motor symptoms. He responded well to ECT for psychotic symptoms and motor symptoms.\n\n【12】Initial management of psychosis in PD requires exclusion of other organic causes of psychosis such as psychoactive substances, intoxication, medication side effects and endocrine disorders. Delirium should also be excluded if symptoms start acutely . In treatment of PD associated psychosis, anticholinergic medication and dopamine agonists should be reduced. But this dose reduction may worsen the motor symptoms. Risperidone and typical antipsychotics should be avoided due to their increased propensity to cause extrapyramidal side-effects and worsening of motor function. Generally atypical antipsychotics often used initially due to their low risk of extrapyramidal side effects. Quetiapine is usually relatively well tolerated, but it did not work in our case. Olanzapine is an effective choice but it can cause more adverse effects on motor function than quetiapine . Aripiprazole and ziprasidone were also suggested as effective and relatively safe treatment options in PD associated psychosis . Clozapine should be used cautiously in view of the risk of agranulocytosis and there is a mandatory requirement for blood monitoring .\n\n【13】In the literature, there are some studies demonstrating the role of ECT in controlling motor symptoms of PD. The first study describing the use of ECT in the motor symptoms of PD was published in 1947, and since then, it has been suggested in some case reports of patients with PD and comorbid psychiatric illnesses treated with ECT, showing secondary improvement of the motor symptoms . In a study of Usui et al, the authors mentioned about a course of ECT producing notable improvements not only in PD associated psychosis but also in the severity of PD. The findings of change in regional cerebral blood flow after electroconvulsive therapy suggested implications for dysfunction in the middle frontal region for patients with PD psychosis . In another case on a patient with PD and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). After the ECT, his OCD symptoms and mood improved . There are few studies on implementation of ECT on patients with deep brain stimulator (DBS), which offer additional evidence about the safety and efficacy of ECT in patients with DBS .\n\n【14】Although there is a case report with schizoaffective disorder and anticholinergic refractory neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism manifested a marked increase of parkinsonian symptoms and dystonia after ECT , the majority of the published articles suggested that ECT can be used to treat PD associated psychosis, depression, OCD and even though motor symptoms.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Psychosis in PD is common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. Psychosis is a risk factor for the development of PD dementia and mortality. ECT should be considered for PD patients with problems not responsive to medications. However, ECT can increase the risk of delirium, particularly in patients with cognitive impairment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "dc150006-14a9-40d8-8b81-70fa9be94dcc", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Esophageal pancreatic acinar heterotopia (EPAH) is an uncommon cause of dysphagia , and this entity is rarely reported in the literature . The heterotopic pancreas lacks any continuity with the main body of the orthotopic pancreas . Pancreatic acinar heterotopia is unusual in the esophagus, but has been more commonly described in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum . In general, patients with pancreatic acinar heterotopia are asymptomatic and as a result, most go undiagnosed. They have been discovered in 0.5-13.7% of autopsies , and 0.2-0.5% of laparotomies . For the cases in which patients develop symptoms such as dysphagia or abdominal pain, these symptoms are due to the mass effect and relative location of heterotopia to esophageal mucosa.\n\n【2】In any patient who presents with dysphagia and concomitant alarming symptoms similar to this index case, guidelines recommend the use of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the initial evaluation. This has diagnostic benefits such as distinguishing between a benign or non-benign cause, as well as therapeutic benefits through interventions such as esophageal dilation. In this case report, we present a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed with EPAH, after esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy, revealing the challenge of the symptom presentation and the appropriate diagnostic workup and management thereafter.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient was a 57-year-old man with known medical history of degenerative joint disease (DJD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic constipation who presented to the gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of difficulty swallowing. The patient reported a progressive worsening of this symptom over the preceding 4 months. He reported dysphagia to solids, further described as a sensation of food being stuck in his throat. He denied dysphagia to liquids. He endorsed associated abdominal pain characterized as an occasional burning sensation that was localized to the epigastric region. He also experienced 30-pound unintentional weight loss during the 4 months since onset of symptoms. He denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, odynophagia, hematochezia or melena.\n\n【6】He had history of a colonoscopy 1 year prior, which documented findings of internal and external non-thrombosed hemorrhoids, as well as a single tubular adenoma. He had a significant family history of colon cancer. Social history was significant for a 10-pack-year tobacco smoking history and alcohol use socially. His current medications included hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, lisinopril, gabapentin, acetaminophen, naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, atorvastatin and esomeprazole. He had no known allergies.\n\n【7】On presentation to the gastroenterology clinic, he had a body mass index (BMI) of 30.92 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and his blood pressure was 149/75 mm Hg, with other vital signs within normal limits. His physical examination revealed no acute abnormalities for his general, neurological, cardiopulmonary or musculoskeletal systems. In regards to his abdominal examination, he had benign findings including normoactive bowels sounds and a non-tender abdomen.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】His laboratory tests from a month prior to his gastroenterology clinic were reviewed. These included hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dL, white blood cell of 6.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, platelet of 160 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 7 mg/dL. All other values for hematology and metabolic panel were within normal limits.\n\n【10】Given the presence of alarming features associated with our patient’s dysphagia on this initial presentation, he was scheduled for an elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 2 weeks. He was also prescribed polyethylene glycol and psyllium for constipation.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】Follow-up EGD was completed 2 weeks after the clinic visit, and was significant for findings of an approximately 5 × 3 cm raised pink rubbery mass with overlying irregular mucosa at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. This was partially resected for biopsy . There was also irregular gastric mucosa visualized during the EGD and additional biopsy samples were taken.\n\n【13】The pathologist reported that histopathology of the GE junction biopsies revealed intestinal metaplasia and focal pancreatic acinar type tissue without dysplasia . Additionally, stomach biopsies revealed H. pylori and intestinal metaplasia with active chronic gastritis .\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】At the follow-up gastroenterology clinic visit after the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the patient reported complete resolution of his dysphagia. Review of systems was significant for improvement in constipation with the use of the medications as prescribed. For this visit, he was prescribed antibiotics for H. pylori infection and scheduled for continued surveillance.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Dysphagia, an upper gastrointestinal symptom, refers to the sensation of impaired passage of food from the mouth to the stomach that is caused by structural or neuromuscular conditions of the esophagus . It has been estimated to affect 8-22% of persons above 50 years of age, with a higher prevalence in nursing homes . The prevalence of dysphagia in adults at least weekly was previously found to be 3% for men and women . Based on the anatomical site of the esophagus that is primarily affected, dysphagia can be grouped as oropharyngeal or esophageal. The patient in this index case presented with esophageal dysphagia which may result from benign or malignant pathologies.\n\n【18】Benign causes of esophageal dysphagia include gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic strictures, esophageal rings, eosinophilic esophagitis, diffuse esophageal spasm, achalasia and hypomotility . It is important to exclude a premalignant or malignant etiology during the initial patient evaluation by conducting a thorough history and physical examination. The clinical suspicion for malignancy should be heightened by the presence of alarming features such as unintentional weight loss, dysphagia more for solids than for liquids, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, odynophagia, vomiting and onset age older than 50 years . The patient in this index case presented with dysphagia with concomitant alarming features of weight loss, dysphagia to solids and older age. This increased the urgency to rule out a non-benign etiology of his gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【19】Guidelines recommend an empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for patients who have esophageal dysphagia and reflux, the absence of the aforementioned alarming features . For patients who have alarming features on their initial presentation or who have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms after empiric PPI therapy, endoscopy is recommended . An EGD plays a diagnostic and therapeutic role in the evaluation of dysphagia. EGD allows for direct visualization of the esophageal lumen and stomach. Mucosal biopsies can also be taken for histopathology. It has been shown that EGD has a diagnostic yield of 54% when used in the initial evaluation of patients older than 40 years of age who present with dysphagia with associated heartburn, odynophagia or weight loss .\n\n【20】EGD in this index case revealed a raised area with abnormal mucosa at the GE junction. Histopathology was consistent with focal EPAH. EPAH refers to histologically confirmed pancreatic tissue, or pancreatic rests, located within the esophagus . EPAH lack any anatomic, neural or vascular connections to the main body of the orthotopic pancreas . EPAH has been rarely reported in the literature. Pancreatic acinar heterotopia has been more commonly found in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, with over 90% of previously reported cases occurring in the gastric antrum, duodenum, jejunum and ileum . Pancreatic acinar heterotopia, of any location in the gastrointestinal tract, has been incidentally discovered in 0.5-13.7% of autopsies , and 0.2-0.5% of laparotomies .\n\n【21】Though the exact pathogenesis of EPAH is not well-known, there have been suggested mechanisms. This includes theories such as the “migration theory” which supports an embryonic origin of EPAH. The formation of the pancreas begins at about 5 weeks into organogenesis when the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds, which arise from the duodenal aspect of the foregut, rotate and fuse together . It has been postulated that the detachment of branching pancreatic buds during rotation of the foregut gives rise to heterotopic pancreatic tissue . This may account for the prepyloric region, followed by other derivatives of the primitive foregut, being the most common location for these pancreatic rests . The stomach accounts for 25-38% of cases, followed by the duodenum and jejunum which account for 17-21% and 15-21%, respectively .\n\n【22】Uncomplicated heterotopic pancreatic rests present in the gastrointestinal tract do not typically cause gastrointestinal symptoms or manifestations. However, this pathology has been incidentally found in up to 24% of patients undergoing elective EGD for evaluation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms . On direct visualization with endoscopy, the involved area of esophageal mucosa may often appear normal . However, if the area of heterotopic pancreatic rest is large, it may then appear as a non-specific mass within the wall of gastrointestinal tract . The appearance has also been described as a submucosal lesion with an associated central umbilication . In regards to the radiological appearance, on computed tomography imaging, the heterotopic pancreas has been described as an oval intramural mass with an endoluminal growth pattern and micro-lobulated margins .\n\n【23】For the existing cases of EPAH reported in the literature, it is twice as common in men which is similar to the patient in this case . Further, it is usually discovered in the fifth or sixth decade of life which is also consistent with this case presentation of 57-year-old man . In most EPAH cases, the pancreatic rests are found in the distal third of the esophagus , and in our index case, the endoscopy revealed irregularities at the GE junction. One study demonstrated that when patients were divided into those with or without pancreatic acinar cells discovered on endoscopy, the patients with pancreatic acinar cells were slightly younger than the patients without (median 50 vs. 53 years; P = 0.009) . In patients younger than 18 years of age, it has been associated with congenital anatomic abnormalities of the esophagus such as esophageal atresia, esophageal duplication cysts, tracheoesophageal fistula or esophageal duplication . The patient in our case did not have any known congenital abnormalities of his esophageal anatomy on presentation and none were found on endoscopy.\n\n【24】Though symptoms are not usually associated with EPAH, they may occur secondary to a mass effect in large EPAH . Gastrointestinal symptoms may include dysphagia, the presenting symptom of this index case, as well as abdominal pain localized to epigastric or right upper quadrant region . However, the presence of dysphagia to solids only and unintentional weight loss were unusual clinical features. These symptoms usually suggest more sinister disorders of the esophagus such as malignant pathologies. Other symptoms that have been described in the literature from large EPAH include obstruction, intussusception and hemorrhage . Malignant transformation of EPAH is reported to be uncommon . The heterotopic pancreas is thought to be as susceptible as the orthotopic pancreas to premalignant changes such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia . However, to date, there has been only one reported case each of adenocarcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma arising from EPAH .\n\n【25】Management of EPAH has varied in the previously reported cases. Treatment options described in the literature have ranged from a conservative approach with clinical observation to a radical approach with surgical resections such as Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. A minimally invasive surgical approach with left video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was described in a case report in which the preceding esophageal biopsy specimens were non-diagnostic . Surgical modalities have been recommended when endoscopy or imaging does not provide a pre-operative diagnosis. In these cases, complete surgical resection allows for tissue diagnosis. For malignant EPAH radical excision has been recommended . Enucleation has also been described for benign EPAH. In our index case, the EGD with biopsy was diagnostic. There were no endoscopic or histologic findings of malignancy. Further, endoscopic resection was therapeutic given the resolution of patient reported upper gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【26】Learning points\n\n【27】This case presentation serves to highlight EPAH as an uncommon cause of dysphagia, which is a common upper gastrointestinal complaint. Resection of EPAH during EGD treated the mass effect and associated gastrointestinal symptoms that were experienced by this patient. Current knowledge about the management for EPAH is limited due to its rare occurrence. Surgical resection has been recommended but this index case supports the effectiveness of endoscopic removal of EPAH. The presence of intestinal metaplasia on histology raises the question of whether this finding is to be considered a benign or premalignant finding in patients. Continued surveillance with the patient in our case will allow for monitoring of symptoms, including any concerning for a malignant transformation. Continued research on the endoscopic findings and histological findings of EPAH may better characterize this condition and the likelihood of risks such as malignant transformation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These head and neck tumors are locally aggressive, with early recurrence and distant metastases. Imaging studies are essential for preoperative staging and surgical planning. The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 51-year-old man with a medical history of arterial hypertension, obesity and smoking presented to the Ear, Nose and Throat clinic (ENT) complaining of progressive left submandibular swelling of 10 years duration. No pain or neurologic deficits were present. A sonography was performed that showed a solid hypoechogenic mass of 3.7 cm diameter, hyperechogenic calcium deposits within, and supracentimetric lymphadenopathies in II and V ipsilateral ganglionic levels .\n\n【4】A neck-chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, revealing an expansive-infiltrative, heterodense solid mass on the left submandibular gland, that measured 3.8 cm in diameter. The mass displayed irregular contours with central hypodense areas following intravenous contrast administration, suggestive of necrosis and calcifications within. The mass was invading the ipsilateral medial pterygoid and platysma muscles. Lymphadenopathy was observed with hypodense center in the left II-V ganglionic level as large as 11 mm. In addition, CT revealed the presence of nodules in the liver suggestive of metastatic disease .\n\n【5】A biopsy was performed under general anesthesia revealing an SDC. The Head and Neck Tumor Board reviewed the case, and recommended surgical excision and neck dissection. The postsurgical biopsy confirmed the presence of an SDC with infiltration of adjacent structures and positive lymphovascular/perineural invasion. Immunohistochemistry tests were positive for androgen receptor (AR+), Cerb-B2, GATA 3 and CK7 and negative for P63, KHMW, CK5/6 and P40 .\n\n【6】Follow-up by The Head and Neck Tumor Board where it was staged as a T3N2M1 resulted in the recommendation of palliative chemotherapy. He received six cycles of carboplatin and taxol, showing good tolerance and clinical local improvement. At the end of the treatment, neck-chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations were performed, revealing the presence of progressive liver nodules, and thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine bone lytic lesions consistent of extensive metastatic disease . The patient was referred to the pain control and palliative care program.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Salivary gland cancers are rare, accounting for < 1% of all malignancies  and less than 5% of all head and neck malignancies. SDC accounts for approximately 0.2-2% of all salivary gland neoplasms. The first case of SDC was described by Kleinsasser et al in 1968 who described the distinct histologic similarity to ductal carcinoma of the breast, and was recognized as a distinct entity by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991 .\n\n【9】According to the 2017 WHO classification, SDC is an aggressive epithelial malignancy resembling high-grade mammary ductal carcinoma. It can occur de novo or as a carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma (CAxPA), the latter being a recent finding . “Low-grade SDC” and “SDC in-situ ” of the former WHO classification are now named low-grade and high-grade intraductal carcinoma (IDC), respectively .\n\n【10】The male to female ratio reported is approximately 3:1; in the fifth or sixth decades of life, with the average age of occurrence at 60 years, SDC is more common , more common in the parotid gland (78-83%), whereas submandibular location (12%) and minor salivary glands (10%) are rarely affected. SDCs are made up of ductal and cribriform structures lined with epithelial cells with marked cytologic atypia. A Roman bridge like appearance and comedo-necrosis are typically observed in SDC, which strongly resembles ductal carcinoma of the breast . The grading scheme that characterizes SDCs into four histologic patterns is as follows: sarcomatoid, mucin-rich, micropapillary and basal-like . The histopathologic diagnosis of SDC was based on hematoxylin and eosin stains and confirmed by immunohistochemical staining which have shown that SDC typically demonstrates epithelial markers, including cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) .\n\n【11】Clinically, SDC is now well recognized as an aggressive malignancy, frequently presenting as stage IV disease , present as a rapidly enlarging firm mass with a poor prognosis that is characterized by early lymph node invasion, distant metastases (brain, liver, adrenals, bone, skin and thyroid) (50%), high rate of local recurrence (50%) and ultimately a low survival rate, 3 years median . Perineural and lymphatic invasion, further indicators of a poor prognosis, are frequently present in approximately 57% to 69% and 61% to 70% of patients, respectively . Based on the study of SDC of the major salivary gland, tumor size > 3 cm and age > 50 years old have been proposed to be related to poor prognosis .\n\n【12】SDC is usually described as an ill-defined, infiltrative mass with frequent necrosis on CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images . The presence of calcification in an ill-defined salivary gland mass may be a good CT criterion that raises the possibility of SDC . MR imaging has widely been used for differentiation of benign and malignant tumors of the salivary gland. The lower the signal intensity on T2-weighted images, the higher the possibility of high-grade malignancy . According to Wang et al , an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value < 1.22 × 10 <sup>-3 </sup> mm <sup>2 </sup> /s was one of the criteria for predicting malignancy. Yabuuchi et al  reported that a short time of peak enhancement, < 120 s, and a low washout ratio, < 30% (type B), on dynamic MR images were useful criteria for the diagnosis of malignant tumor. The focus in SDC that shows gradual upward enhancement on dynamic MR images, low ADC value and hypointensity on short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T2-weighted images may be a clue for making a diagnosis of SDC and separating SDC from the more common malignant salivary gland tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma .\n\n【13】The treatment of choice is surgery according to the tumor site and its extent. Postoperative radiotherapy of 60 - 66 Gy was given when any of the resection margins was positive or equivocal and/or lymph node metastasis was pathologically positive . Chemotherapy is used for palliation in metastatic form of the tumor . Molecularly targeted therapy against HER2 protein with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies has been suggested to be contributive as a therapeutic target for patients with HER2/neu-positive SDC .\n\n【14】Tumor stage is an important indicator of overall survival and early cancer recurrence. The overall mean survival of these patients was reported to be approximately 36 to 56 months. The 5-year disease-free survival rates for stage I, II, III and IV SDCs were approximately 42%, 40%, 30% and 23%, respectively . Local recurrence occurred in 48% of patients at 17.4 months after initial treatment. Distal metastases arose in 48% after 29 months .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】SDC is a rare and distinctive neoplasm with an aggressive behavior such as regional nodal and early distant metastasis, local recurrence and significant mortality. Although CT and MR imaging findings are nonspecific, the presence of calcifications on CT scans, low ADC value and marked low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images may be radiologic features to suggest SDC. The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision and neck dissection; adjuvant radiation therapy is reserved for the extensive local infiltrative and lymph node invasion related to this malignancy (advanced form). HER2-targeted therapies may therefore be a novel and effective future treatment choice for certain SDC patients. Systemic chemotherapy is reserved for unresectable locoregional recurrence or where there are distant metastases for palliative management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "7a8d2cf8-05e9-41a2-9036-b2c165705349", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (PGNMID) is a rare entity caused by monoclonal deposition of IgG. PGNMID has similarities to immune complex glomerulonephritis (GN) on light and electron microscopy (EM); however, by immunofluorescence (IF), the glomerular deposits are monoclonal, staining for a single light-chain isotype and a single γ heavy-chain subclass, most commonly IgG3κ. This entity affects adults and most patients present with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hematuria with or without renal failure.\n\n【2】We report a case of a young healthy female patient who presented with proteinuria and a normal kidney function and was found to have monoclonal immune deposits on the kidney biopsy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 20-year-old young female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the office for evaluation of worsening bilateral lower extremity edema and a 32-lb weight gain over the past 2 weeks. The patient reported a viral prodrome consisting of fever and sore throat that started 2 weeks ago. She denied any dysuria or hematuria but complained of facial swelling.\n\n【5】Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, hear rate of 72 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, afebrile. Lung and heart examination was normal and there was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Abdominal exam was significant for hepatomegaly. Bilateral, three plus pitting lower extremity edema was present.\n\n【6】Her laboratory evaluation showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.3 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 17,250/mm <sup>3 </sup> (85% granulocytes), platelets of 378,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 27 mm/h. Urine analysis showed protein of 100 mg/dL, red blood cell (RBC) of 0 - 3/hpf, and white blood cell (WBC) of 3 - 6/hpf. Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 1,853.28 mg/g CRE, blood urea was 17 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, Na/K/Cl was 137/5.4/108 mEq/L, Ca/P was 8.5 mg/5.6 mg/dL, serum protein was 4.5 g/dL, and albumin was 2 g/dL. Her serum complements (C3 and C4) were normal and serum cryoglobulin was initially positive but turned out to be negative on repeated testing. Rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane were normal. Serology tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Mycoplasma antibody IgG was negative; IgM was 322. Quantitative Strep O was negative. CMV IgG and IgM were negative. EBV IgG was positive, and IgM was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and free light-chain assay were normal. Urine immunoelectrophoresis (UPEP) showed a total protein of 3,287 with no monoclonal proteins on immunofixation. On retroperitoneal ultrasound, kidneys were of normal size and echogenicity. Renal biopsy showed eight glomeruli with endocapillary proliferation and neutrophil infiltration but no crescent formation. Ultrastructurally, there were segmental to global subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits with no associated GBM reaction or spikes. Segmental global mesangial deposits and segmental subendothelial deposits are also seen. Moderate podocyte effacement is noted. These findings were consistent with diffuse proliferative GN with exudates features and IgG3 kappa deposits.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Dysproteinemia is characterized by excessive synthesis of Ig molecules or subunits, which may form paraprotein tissue deposits and produce an array of pathologic lesions, most commonly amyloidosis and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Several renal diseases are associated with dysproteinemias, among which those manifesting monoclonal glomerular deposits of IgG are relatively uncommon. Glomerular diseases associated with monoclonal gammopathies include multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal Ig deposition disease, type I cryoglobulinemic GN and amyloidosis. Of these, MM is the most commonly associated.\n\n【9】In 2004, Nasr et al reported 10 patients with an unusual form of glomerular injury caused by monoclonal IgG deposition that does not belong to a specific entity, which was termed PGNMID . On IF, the glomerular deposits were monoclonal, staining for a single light-chain isotype and a single γ heavy-chain subclass. Light microscopy (LM) exhibited endocapillary proliferative or membranoproliferative GN, and EM revealed granular electron-dense deposits, mimicking ordinary immune-complex GN. Clinical presentations included proteinuria in 100% of patients (mean 24-h urine protein 5.8 g), renal insufficiency in 80% (mean serum creatinine 2.8 mg/dL), and microhematuria in 60%. A monoclonal serum or urine protein was identified in 50% of patients, although none of them had evidence of MM or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【10】In a retrospective study done by Nasr et al in 2009, entitled “Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits”, 37 patients were studied, of which 60% were older than 50 years. This study represented one of the largest series of PGNMID .\n\n【11】On SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), seven patients had a monoclonal spike (M-spike) in both serum and urine, and four patients had an M-spike detectable in the serum only. The M-spike was detected at presentation in 10 of these 11 patients but not until repeat testing 3 years after presentation in the remaining patient. In all of these 11 patients, the monoclonal proteins in both serum and urine had the same heavy- and light-chain isotypes as the monoclonal Ig deposited in the kidney. IgG heavy-chain subclass analysis of glomerular deposits, performed in nine of the 11 patients, showed IgG1 in five patients, IgG2 in two, and IgG3 in two. Of the remaining 26 patients who had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE, four underwent serum free light-chain assay; of these, three were found to have normal κ:λ ratio, and one (who had glomerular monoclonal IgG3κ deposition) had an elevated κ:λ ratio. In our case, the patient had negative SPEP, UPEP, and IFE and serum free light-chain assay revealed normal kappa/lambda ratio.\n\n【12】At presentation, all patients had proteinuria. The mean 24-h urine protein was 5.70 g (range 0.36 - 17.00 g). Proteinuria was in the nephrotic range in 68.6% of patients, and 48.6% developed full nephrotic syndrome. Microhematuria was documented in 77.1% of patients. In our case, the patient had a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.36 mg/mg and had microhematuria persistent on repeated testing.\n\n【13】Regarding pathologic findings, the most common histologic pattern seen on LM was predominantly membranoproliferative GN characterized by diffuse and global double-contoured glomerular capillary walls (GCWs) with mesangial cell interposition and mesangial expansion by increased mesangial cell number and matrix. Most of these cases also showed endocapillary hypercellularity, including focal macrophage infiltration. The second most common pattern was predominantly endocapillary proliferative GN, characterized by endocapillary hypercellularity and leukocyte infiltration. IF identified staining of GBM for subclasses of IgG (IgG3-kappa being the most frequent type). In all cases, granular electron-dense deposits were confined to the glomerular compartment. The glomerular immune deposits were primarily subendothelial and mesangial. Subepithelial deposits were less frequent, and were segmental in most cases. In our case, LM showed an acute proliferative and exudative GN and EM showed glomeruli with endocapillary proliferation and neutrophilic proliferation and revealed subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits (EDD) as well as mesangial and subendothelial deposits. IF revealed monoclonal IgG3-kappa deposits.\n\n【14】In our case, the findings of acute proliferative and exudative GN  and the subepithelial hump-shaped  immune-type electron dense deposits on LM and EM, respectively, would be most characteristic of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (APIGN). Interestingly, the lack of hypocomplementemia would be somewhat unusual for APIGN, and the immunofluorescence findings of IgG kappa restricted deposits are also atypical. The presence of deposits of a single Ig class which is IgG and a single light-chain, kappa, and the absence of other Igs, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case .\n\n【15】In fact, the diagnosis of PGNMID is based on the following criteria : findings on kidney biopsy of GN with 1) glomerular immune deposits staining positive for heavy-chain IgG, with negativity for Inga and IgM heavy-chains, thus confined to a single Ig class; 2) positive staining for a single IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4); 3) positive staining for a single light-chain isotype indicating monoclonality; 4) predominantly granular EDD in mesangial, subendothelial and/or subepithelial locations by EM, resembling immune complex GN; and 5) no clinical or laboratory evidence of cryoglobulines.\n\n【16】The etiology of PGNMID is not fully established. The majority of patients do not appear to have or develop hematologic malignancies during the published follow-up period. A small percentage of PGNMID cases were associated with neoplasm or viral infections . In fact, there are 21 more patients with PGNMID that have been reported in the literature . One patient reported by Evans et al  with PGNMID with monoclonal IgG-κ deposits was found to have a follicular B-cell lymphoma infiltrating the kidney and expressing surface IgG-κ. That patient had a positive Bence Jones protein in the urine as well as a monoclonal IgM protein on serum IFE. None of the remaining 20 patients had any hematologic malignancy. In our case, the patient had no detectable M protein by SPEP/UPEP/IFE.\n\n【17】In regards to the clinical outcome of patients with PGNMID, prognosis is variable. For instance, most of the 16 patients with available follow-up data were treated with prednisone with or without other immunosuppressive agents. Five out of the 16 patients subsequently progressed to ESRD (31.3%). In the study by Nasr et al , on an average of 30 months of follow-up for 32 patients, 38% had complete or partial recovery, 38% had persistent renal dysfunction, and 22% progressed to ESRD. Correlates of ESRD were higher creatinine, percentage of glomerulosclerosis, and degree of interstitial fibrosis but not immunomodulatory treatment or presence of a monoclonal spike. In our case, the patient had a complete remission with prednisone therapy.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】In summary, we describe a unique case of PGNMID occurring in a young patient following a viral illness with spontaneous remission. The findings of an acute proliferative and exudative GN and the subepithelial hump-shaped immune-type electron dense deposits in the absence of hypocomplementemia, along with the presence of IgG kappa deposits, make the diagnosis of PGNMID most likely in our case. The pathophysiology of this disease is not well understood. Is PGNMID another form of post-infectious glomerulopathy in which an infection activates or induces a transient/acute monoclonal Ig formation?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1f718c01-dacf-414a-941f-6ddacc5cab46", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Although commonly practiced in the adult population, the use of spinal anesthesia in infants and children remains limited. Spinal anesthesia initially gained popularity as it was shown to be a suitable alternative to general anesthesia in the high-risk, former preterm neonate . In this population, spinal anesthesia was used instead of general anesthesia to limit the incidence of postoperative complications, especially apnea and postoperative respiratory dysfunction, which was noted following general anesthesia with halothane. However, its use decreased as the risk of apnea was shown to be limited with the introduction of the new volatile anesthetic agents, sevoflurane and desflurane . More recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of spinal anesthesia based on findings from animal models and retrospective cohort studies regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia during the neonatal period or infancy . Despite the lack of prospective trials to clearly demonstrate such issues, spinal anesthesia has been reintroduced as a means of avoiding general anesthesia during the potentially vulnerable time period of central nervous system development. Additionally, in patients with significant co-morbid conditions, spinal anesthesia may offer a safety advantage over general anesthesia for brief (< 90 min) surgical procedures. The authors report the use of spinal anesthesia during circumcision in a 19-month-old, 12.1 kg infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who had undergone hybrid palliation . The applications of spinal anesthesia in high-risk patients with co-morbid congenital heart disease (CHD) are reviewed, techniques are described, and potential adverse hemodynamic and respiratory effects are discussed with emphasis on the patient with palliated HLHS.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 19-month-old toddler (weight 12.1 kg) with HLHS (aortic atresia and mitral stenosis type) who had completed the stage I hybrid procedure and a comprehensive stage II palliation, presenting for circumcision due to phimosis. Medications at the time of surgery included enalapril 1.5 mg twice daily, digoxin 50 µg twice daily, and aspirin 40.5 mg daily. His aspirin was held for 7 days prior to the scheduled surgery. He had no known drug allergies and no new laboratory tests were performed prior to the procedure. Due to his extensive cardiac history and a history of the need for prolonged postoperative ventilation following his previous cardiac surgical procedures, the surgeon had a frank discussion with the family regarding the potential risks of this elective surgery and offered ongoing observation of the urologic condition. Despite this, the family still desired surgery. At this point, a discussion was held including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist regarding potential spinal anesthesia in an effort to avoid general anesthesia and airway instrumentation. The patient was deemed a suitable candidate, and the option was presented to the parents who consented to proceed with spinal anesthesia. On the morning of surgery, the patient was held nil per os (NPO) for 2 h for clear liquids and for 8 h for solids. The patient’s vital signs were blood pressure 104/61 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 85% on room air, and temperature of 36.3 °C. In the preoperative holding area, LMX <sup>® </sup> cream (4% topical lidocaine, Ferndale Laboratories Inc. Ferndale, MI) was applied to the lumbar area to minimize discomfort with the placement of the spinal needle. The patient was transported to the operating room and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. He was positioned in a curled sitting position. Using aseptic technique, a 1.5 inch, 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted at the L <sub>4-5 </sub> interspace. Free flow of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained and 1.2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (0.5 mg/kg) with epinephrine 1:200,000 and clonidine (1 µg/kg) was injected through the spinal needle. The patient was positioned supine and a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the right foot. Prior to surgical incision, the adequacy of the spinal blockade was confirmed by motor blockade of the lower extremities and absence of response to skin prick. During the procedure, the patient breathed room air with a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose solution in place. The oxygen saturation ranged from 80% to 85%. Due to slight irritability, a single dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg) was administered intravenously prior to the start of procedure. The patient’s heart rate prior to spinal anesthesia was 160 beats/min with a blood pressure of 100 - 110/60 - 80 mm Hg. After spinal anesthesia, the heart rate decreased to a nadir of 80 beats/min and the blood pressure ranged from 80 - 100/40 - 50 mm Hg. The patient tolerated the 30-min procedure without incident and was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. After meeting discharge criteria, he was discharged to home on the day of surgery.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】HLHS is a complex CHD characterized by abnormal development of left-sided cardiac structures, leading to inadequate systemic perfusion following post-natal closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) . Surgical management of HLHS has traditionally been approached with a Norwood procedure during the neonatal period . This involves extensive reconstruction of the aortic arch, thereby connecting the right ventricle with the systemic circulation and placement of a shunt to provide pulmonary blood flow. A more recent approach is the hybrid procedure, which combines interventional catheter-based stenting of the PDA to maintain systemic output, balloon atrial septostomy, and surgically placed pulmonary artery bands to limit pulmonary blood flow . The hybrid approach defers aortic arch reconstruction with the need for cardiopulmonary bypass until the stage II procedure, when the patient is 4 - 8 months of age . The proposed advantages of this strategy include improved hemodynamic stability after stage I and reduction in risk of brain and myocardial injury by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic arch reconstruction in the early neonatal period.\n\n【6】Infants with HLHS frequently have associated conditions requiring non-cardiac surgical procedures. Given the associated co-morbid CHD, there is an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality in this patient population . In general, elective surgery should be carefully considered in such a patient, and a well-informed discussion between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and parents should occur prior to proceeding. Despite such discussions, as was the case with our patient, families may still request surgical intervention.\n\n【7】In an effort to avoid the potential deleterious effects of general anesthesia, airway instrumentation, and the potential need for positive pressure ventilation, spinal anesthesia was chosen for our patient. Although first reported in a pediatric patient as early as 1899, spinal anesthesia never gained significant popularity in pediatric anesthesia, being used in the 1980s as a means of avoiding apnea following halothane anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is currently seeing a resurgence as an alternative to general anesthesia, as it may limit the potential deleterious long-term neurocognitive effects of inhalational and intravenous anesthetic agents .\n\n【8】Following the comprehensive stage II procedure on the hybrid pathway for patients with HLHS, the perioperative concerns include maintaining adequate pulmonary blood flow through the Glenn anastomosis. As pulmonary blood flow is passive, this is accomplished by maintaining adequate preload, avoiding increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, and limiting the use of medications with negative inotropic effects. Avoidance of prolonged NPO times, intravenous hydration while NPO, and fluid loading prior to anesthetic induction may be helpful in avoiding intravascular volume depletion. Endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and the use of positive end expiratory pressure may all decrease pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output in this setting . In our patient, we chose to use spinal anesthesia as a means of providing surgical anesthesia while avoiding the need for endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and the use of intravenous and inhalational anesthetic agents with potentially negative inotropic effects.\n\n【9】The obvious concern regarding the use of spinal anesthesia in this scenario is the potential for adverse effects on hemodynamic function. However, spinal anesthesia (even high blockade) has been shown to have limited effects on hemodynamic function in infants and children less than 6 years of age . Even deliberate high spinal anesthesia used for repair of PDA in neonates produced only a mild decline in blood pressure . Unlike the adult population, sympathetic blockade with hypotension rarely occurs. This has traditionally been attributed to the incomplete development of the sympathetic nervous system in infants . However, analysis of heart rate variability during the administration of spinal anesthesia in infants suggests that the reflex response to high spinal anesthesia is primarily due to diminished parasympathetic tone that offsets the blockade of sympathetic function . This has been supported by clinical studies of spinal anesthesia in infants demonstrating that only a small percentage of patients required treatment with intravenous fluids . In our patient, no clinically significant changes in blood pressure or oxygen saturation were noted after the administration of spinal anesthesia. The decrease in heart rate to 80 beats/min was likely from the administration of intravenous dexmedetomidine to provide sedation . Despite these data, the potential for hemodynamic changes should always be considered and appropriate monitoring be employed with ready access to resuscitation medications if needed. The potential safety of this approach is further supported by observational studies reporting no clinically significant reduction in blood pressure or oxygen saturation in high-risk infants with CHD during spinal anesthesia  . In these studies in infants and children with CHD, spinal anesthesia provided stable hemodynamic parameters without excessive hypotension requiring the administration of fluid or inotropic agents.\n\n【10】With the increasing use of spinal anesthesia in pediatric anesthesia, there have been several detailed reviews highlighting the important aspects of this technique . In the neonate or infant, the sitting position is generally preferred for spinal anesthesia. The head should be slightly extended to avoid airway obstruction. Superficial analgesia with a topical local anesthetic cream is recommended to prevent pain during needle insertion. While we prefer to avoid the use of sedative agents, other investigators have suggested the administration of midazolam or ketamine to provide sedation during performance of the procedure . At our institution, we prefer a non-pharmacological approach with a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose oral solution whenever possible. Furthermore, we generally place the intravenous cannula in the foot after spinal anesthesia has been initiated. In our practice, a 1.5”, 22-gauge spinal needle with a stylet is used. After the epidermis and dermis are punctured, the stylet is removed as there may be only a subtle pop as the intrathecal space is entered. Once free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is obtained, the local anesthetic solution is injected. We generally aspirate only at the end of injection to clear the hub of the needle of remaining local anesthetic solution. The two commonly used local anesthetic agents are tetracaine or bupivacaine, with dose ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg/kg. Higher intrathecal local anesthetic requirements in infants result from the larger per-kilogram volume of CSF compared to adults and proportionally greater blood flow leading to faster drug uptake. Although hyperbaric tetracaine solutions were previously used most commonly, many institutions, including ours, currently use isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%. These dosing regimens will provide approximately 90 min of surgical anesthesia depending on the dermatomes involved . The addition of epinephrine or clonidine may be used to prolong the duration of surgical anesthesia . After performing the spinal, the infant is placed in the supine position with care taken not to raise the legs above the body to avoid unintentional high block. Though this should not be required with isobaric solutions, we nonetheless observe this precaution as an added safety measure.\n\n【11】Absolute contraindications to spinal anesthesia include parental refusal, history of true allergy to the local anesthetic agent, ongoing systemic infection with bacteremia, clinically significant coagulation disturbances, and intracranial hypertension or hemorrhage. Reports in the literature have demonstrated a very low incidence of significant adverse effects with spinal anesthesia in neonates and infants. The relatively high failure rate of spinal anesthesia reported in the literature highlights the importance of developing a robust spinal anesthesia program to optimize successful outcomes for awake spinal anesthesia in these high-risk infants . With these caveats in mind, spinal anesthesia should be considered a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia in high-risk neonates and infants, especially those with co-morbid CHD. We also recommend effective communication between providers as well as the family to enhance the safety of this approach. This should include a well-informed discussion with the family and then physician-to-physician consultation to ensure proper preparation for such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

First found during an autopsy in 1708 , heterotopic pregnancy occurs in 1:30,000 of natural conceptions . With increasing usage of assisted reproduction, the frequency of heterotopic pregnancies was cited to be between 1:100 and 1:7,000 .\n\n【2】This rare obstetrics phenomenon carries a significant maternal morbidity and mortality due to the risk of ruptured ectopic pregnancy . Hence, early diagnosis and management of heterotopic pregnancy is crucial. However, the rate of early diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy has not increased since 1970 despite advances in medical knowledge and ultrasonography technique .\n\n【3】Health care professionals have been indoctrinated with the famous dictum by the French surgeon Henri Mondor  ‘Think Ectopic’ when assessing acute abdomen of pregnant women. However, when an intrauterine gestation is seen on ultrasonography, the dictum is not translated into heterotopic pregnancy.\n\n【4】Below is a unique case history of heterotopic pregnancy in a clinically stable patient with low risk factors which was picked up on thorough ultrasonography rather than on laparoscopy. This case report stresses the importance of a holistic approach and thorough ultrasonography in managing these patients.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】KH, a 22-year-old woman, presented to the gynaecological admission unit with a 7-week history of amenorrhea and a 2-day history of lower abdominal period-like pain. She denied any vaginal bleeding, shoulder tip pain, urinary or bowel symptoms.\n\n【7】She denied having had any previous sexually transmitted infections and had never used intra-uterine contraceptive devices or undergone fertility treatment. She had no history of any tubal or pelvic pathology, ectopic pregnancies or miscarriage. She was an ex-smoker. She was on cerazette for contraception which she said she took regularly. Her periods were irregular. She had a normal vaginal delivery in 2008.\n\n【8】Her past medical and surgical histories were unremarkable. She used no regular medications. She was allergic to penicillin.\n\n【9】On examination, she was tachycardic at 105 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 122 mmHg/62 mmHg. Her abdomen was soft with mild suprapubic and right iliac fossa tenderness. On bimanual examination, she had an 8-week size uterus with a tender right adnexa and positive cervical excitation tenderness. No adnexal masses were felt. Her cervical os was closed.\n\n【10】Her urine pregnancy test was positive. Her serum bHCG was 3892 mIU/mL. Urine dipstick showed no signs of urinary tract infection. Her haemoglobin was 13.7g/dL.\n\n【11】She underwent a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound scan which revealed a non-viable intrauterine gestational sac at 7+ weeks  as well as a large heterogenous mass with a yolk sac seen medial to the right ovary . Free fluid was noted in the pouch of Douglas .\n\n【12】A laparoscopic right partial salpingectomy and evacuation of retained product of conception was urgently performed which confirmed a right ampullary ectopic pregnancy. The serum bHCG after 48 hours fell optimally to 44.1 mIU/m. Urinary pregnancy test was negative after 2 weeks.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Early diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy is often challenging due to the lack of clinical signs and symptoms as well as diagnostic confusion with other early pregnancy issues .\n\n【15】A good history is important to identify risk factors for heterotopic pregnancy such as fertility treatment and tubal pathologies like pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis or previous tubal surgeries . Patients with previous ectopic pregnancy or patients who conceived while using intrauterine devices are also at risk .\n\n【16】The four common clinical signs of heterotopic pregnancies are abdominal pain, adnexal mass, peritoneal irritation and uterine fundus larger than menstrual dates . Vaginal bleeding occurs rarely in heterotopic pregnancy, compared to ectopic pregnancy .\n\n【17】Ultrasonography\n\n【18】Ultrasonography is routinely used in early pregnancy. Despite the advancement of transvaginal ultrasonography, identification of viable early intrauterine pregnancy before 5.5 weeks and ectopic pregnancy still remains challenging. Clinicians and sonographers tend to be lulled into a false sense of security when an intrauterine gestation sac is seen. This results in inadequate inspection of the adnexae and remaining structures during ultrasonography despite a strong initial clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【19】A review article in 2008  which analysed 6 studies showed that transvaginal ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 74-84% in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy with specificity between 84-99.9%. However, ultrasonography is operator dependent. A comparative review of 192 cases of heterotopic pregnancies in 2007  showed that only 1/3 of the cases was definitively diagnosed by ultrasonography pre-operatively like in this case study.\n\n【20】The only pathognomonic sign of heterotopic pregnancy is the simultaneous visualisation of extrauterine and intrauterine fetal pole with cardiac motion. This occurs in only 10% of cases . The ultrasound appearance of an ectopic pregnancy varies depending on location, gestation period, viability and presence of pelvic pathology.\n\n【21】However, there are a few features on ultrasonography associated with ectopic pregnancies. Firstly, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased with increasing amount of free fluid in the pelvis  due to a physiological response to distortion of the Fallopian tube or bleeding from the damaged ectopic pregnancy. Hence, presence of free fluid in pelvis should trigger a thorough inspection of the adnexae despite observing an intrauterine gestation. We should not too hastily attribute the intraperitoneal free fluid to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in patients on fertility treatment . Secondly, it is crucial to visualise the corpus luteum. In 70-85% of cases, ectopic pregnancy normally occurs on the ipsilateral side of the corpus luteum .\n\n【22】Ectopic pregnancy is normally visualised on ultrasound in 3 forms . In 58% of cases, the ‘blob’ sign, which is a heterogenous mass adjacent to the ovary but moves separately, is seen, 20% of cases show up as the ‘bagel sign’, which is a mass with hyperechoic ring around. The remaining cases present as a gestational sac with fetal pole like in this case study.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】A holistic approach and thorough ultrasonography is crucial in patients with high suspicion of ectopic pregnancy or in the presence of pelvic free fluid even when an intrauterine pregnancy is identified. A new dictum ‘Think ectopic. If intrauterine gestation is seen, think heterotopic’ needs to be adopted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

HIV infection is an independent risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis when the cell count is below 200 cells/mL and no retroviral therapy. We present a 49-year-old patient with history of HIV infection, in triple therapy with no detectable count and CD4 over 1,000 cells/mL, admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, fever, rapid clinical deterioration, an active rectal abscess, positive bacteremia and echocardiographic evidence of acute aortic endocarditis with severe insufficiency secondary to E. faecalis endocarditis. The aggressive medical and surgical treatment is emphasized and the role of underlying HIV infection is discussed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old Caucasian male with history of HIV infection (on triple therapy with no detectable counts and CD4 over 1,000 cell/mL), deep venous thrombosis, trigeminal neuralgia associated to Herpes zoster , rectal abscess and hepatitis C, was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea and an acute bacterial infection. He denied alcohol consumption and intravenous drug use, however, admitted to receptive anal intercourse.\n\n【4】On examination, the patient was awake, alert, oriented, no jugular vein distention, tachycardic, a systolic murmur I/VI was present and no hearable diastolic murmur, bilateral basilar rales auscultated and the rest of the exam was normal. His vitals were 89/52 mm Hg, heart rate 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 38.2 °C and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.\n\n【5】White count was 13.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL, MCV was 83.3 fL, platelets was 187,000/µL, pH was 7.38, PCO <sub>2 </sub> was 35 mm Hg, PO <sub>2 </sub> was 55 mm Hg, sodium was 136 Meq/L, potassium was 3.8 Meq/L, chloride was 101 Meq/L, CO <sub>2 </sub> was 24 mmol/L, calcium was 8.2 mg/dL, and albumin was 2.6 g/dL.\n\n【6】An echocardiogram was performed showing a mass on the aortic valve apparently consistent with vegetation with prolapsing of one of the leaflets of the severe aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension (77 mm Hg). Bilateral infiltrations were noted on chest X-ray. The chest CT scan revealed same bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in the lower lobes and in addition mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n【7】All the findings were consistent with endocarditis with severe aortic valve insufficiency and heart failure; therefore, aortic valve was replaced with a mechanical valve (20 mm Medtronic Bileaflet). The main surgical findings were a trileaflet aortic valve with a destroyed right coronary cusp and a large prolapsing vegetation ; another vegetation on the non-coronary cusp was noted without evidence of abscesses.\n\n【8】An aortic vegetation culture was done and it showed E. feacalis .\n\n【9】Postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed good prosthetic valve function with no paravalvular leaks, even though large bilateral pleural effusions persisted.\n\n【10】The patient’s hemodynamic status and symptomatology improved after the surgery and antibiotic treatment with vancomicin and gentamicin.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Infective endocarditis is caused by microbial infection of the endothelial lining of intracardiac structures causing persistent bacteremia, usually on one or more heart valve leaflets, but may involve mural endocardium, chordal structures, myocardium, and pericardium. Bacteria that have entered the bloodstream must be able to adhere to the damaged endothelium, exposed extracellular matrix or areas of fibrin deposition. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are the critical components of a successful management strategy .\n\n【13】In the past, HIV infection was associated with immunosuppression; however, in modern times, for patients with the appropriate retroviral treatment, HIV appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of endocarditis when the CD4 count is below 200 cells/mL. Our patient had over 1,000 cells/mL and no detectable viral counts, for that reason, this kind of infection would not be considered and the first possible diagnosis was community acquired pneumonia .\n\n【14】A wide range of microorganisms is associated with infectious endocarditis. The most common are Streptococcal species (40%), Staphylococcus aureus (28%), and Enterococci species (9%). Enterococcal bacteremia is a severe infection with 23-46% of mortality rate, and the most common complication is endocarditis (5-12%), representing the third cause of infectious endocarditis .\n\n【15】The Enterococcus species formerly classified as group D Streptococci is now defined as a distinct genus. These organisms are normal inhabitants of the GI and genitourinary tracts and may enter the bloodstream after manipulation of the colon, urethra, or bladder .\n\n【16】The clinical presentation of infective endocarditis is mainly fever (85-99%), with a duration that ranges from a few days to 2 weeks. In 18.9% of patients, there are peripheral lesions such as petechiae, subungueal hemorrages, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions and Roth spots but none of these findings were reported in the patient history .\n\n【17】The diagnosis of endocarditis can be done by the Duke’s criteria . The patient had three major criteria and one minor, therefore granting the diagnosis of endocarditis .\n\n【18】The transthoracic echocardiography is 40-63% sensitive. The transesophageal echocardiography is 90-100% sensitive, especially for detecting vegetations, identifying valve ring abscesses and pulmonary and prosthetic valve endocarditis. The electrocardiogram is not helpful for diagnosis but can show conductive abnormalities that suggest formation of a myocardial abscess .\n\n【19】In the case of the enterococcal endocarditis, medical treatment, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, should be given with cell wall-active agents that raise the permeability of the enterococcal cell wall and act synergically as to permit the aminoglycoside to have a bactericidal effect at a minor dose, thus reducing toxicity for the patient . This patient received treatment with vancomicin and gentamicin due to bacterial sensitivities .\n\n【20】There are specific indications for surgical treatment; if a valvular regurgitation led to acute heart failure (especially aortic valve involvement), the valve must be replaced, not responding to 7 - 10 days of medical treatment and sinus of Valsalva or septal abscesses . The patient was treated surgically because he developed acute aortic insufficiency and he was hemodynamically unstable.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Infective endocarditis by E. faecalis in this patient had probably a non-HIV-related etiology because of the adequate antiretroviral therapy that he was having. Most probably the rectal abscess could have been the source of the sepsis. Hepatitis C infection could have acted as an independent risk factor.

Elbow joint involvement is uncommon in PVNS . A unique case of a huge PVNS originating around the elbow joint that required upper arm amputation is presented, along with a review of the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 74-year-old woman presented at our outpatient clinic due to slight pain of the right elbow persisting for 5 months. She noticed a mass of the right elbow 11 years earlier, and she had a past history of undergoing tumor resection and flap surgery at another hospital 9 years earlier, and the mass was diagnosed as a giant cell tumor. On pathological examination, the margin of the resected tumor was diagnosed as intralesional resection. However, she did not go to the hospital postoperatively. On physical examination, there was a poorly mobile mass measuring 8 × 5 cm on the olecranon side of the right elbow joint. She had diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure, with a shunt on the right forearm. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this tumor around the elbow joint showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low to high intensity on T2-weighted images. After administration of gadolinium contrast, it was enhanced irregularly. A needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic examination showed a giant cell tumor resembling the pathological findings 9 years earlier, with no malignancy.\n\n【4】The tumor gradually grew larger and formed ulcers. The tumor was present almost over the entire circumference of the upper arm and invaded the humerus, with the shunt blood vessel in the right forearm. Therefore, it seemed that it was difficult to preserve the limb, and upper arm amputation was performed. Pathological examination showed invasive proliferation to the synovial membrane, osteoclast-like giant cells, proliferation of round cells, and hemosiderin accumulation between cells . In addition, lesions were continuous from the periosteum and proliferated invasively in the dermis. The histological diagnosis was PVNS. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. There was no recurrence of PVNS at the most recent follow-up 2 years after surgery.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】PVNS is a benign proliferative disorder of unknown origin forming nodular or villous changes in joints, synovial capsules, and tendon sheaths . PVNS is one of the benign tumors, so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors, and it is classified as diffuse type in tenosynovial giant cell tumor . It generally has an intra-articular origin, and it shows extensive involvement of the synovial membrane and capsule . PVNS with extra-articular extension is rare , and most have been reported to occur in the knee and hip joints . PVNS in the elbow is uncommon, with only 24 cases reported in the literature . Although a few cases of extra-articular giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath occurred at the elbow, there have been no reports of PVNS with extra-articular extension affecting the elbow joint .\n\n【7】If it is left untreated, the hypertrophic synovium and multiple soft-tissue masses may lead to continued pain, decreased range of motion, joint destruction, and osteoarthritis . Therefore, operative management, such as open excision or arthroscopic excision, is often required. The recurrence rate after surgical treatment has been reported to be 31-33%, and it is important to completely resect the synovial membrane . However, complete resection is difficult if it occurs within complex joints such as the elbow joint . To minimize the risk of recurrence, several studies have demonstrated a positive response with radiation therapy or adjuvant therapy . However, their effects are still controversial . There are no cases of PVNS that required amputation of a limb. PVNS must be carefully treated because of its invasiveness, though it is not a malignant tumor.\n\n【8】In conclusion, a rare case of PVNS around the elbow joint that required upper arm amputation was presented.

{"seq_id": "14af16f0-fe60-4e2a-8161-3e3a7eb7bbd0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  is a histiocytic disorder characterized by extreme immune deregulation and severe systemic inflammation. Patients commonly present with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) characterized by protracted fevers, bone marrow failure, splenomegaly and hemophagocytosis. Liver dysfunctions manifested as elevated transaminases and bilirubin are often present and can be life-threatening. Elevated ferritin, sometimes above 10,000 ng/mL, and depressed natural killer (NK) cell function are consistent features of HLH; however, the most specific parameter used to establish the diagnosis and follow disease activity is the serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor/CD25 (sCD25). Hemophagocytosis, although present and frequently pronounced in HLH, is not pathognomonic; infections, autoimmune disorders, lymphomas (especially of T-cell subtypes) and leukemias can be associated with hemophagocytosis phenomena without showing other HLH features .\n\n【2】Although HLH is traditionally classified as hereditary or acquired, a genetic defect is currently believed to increase the risk of acquiring HLH after certain triggers. PRF1 gene, first described in the pathogenesis and accounting for 20-40% of hereditary HLH, encodes for perforin, a pore-forming protein with a critical role in the cytotoxic function of NK cells and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells. Other gene mutations linked to familial HLH include UNC13D , STX11 , STXBP2 , Rab27a , SH2D1A , or BIRC4 . Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for these mutations commonly leads to HLH during the first 2 years of life. However, simple heterozygosity may predispose adults to HLH after specific triggers such as viral infections (Epstein-Barr (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and others), malignancies (lymphoproliferative disorders including B- and T-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;16) and rarely germ cell tumors or Ewing sarcoma), immunodeficiencies (HIV/AIDS, X-linked lymphoproliferative disorders, Griscelli and Chediak-Higashi syndromes), autoimmune diseases (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and adult Still’s disease) and solid organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) .\n\n【3】The underlying pathophysiology in HLH is the failure of homeostatic mechanisms to suppress activated macrophages, which abnormally propagate systemic inflammation and tissue damage through mechanisms of cytokine release (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ) and uncontrolled phagocytosis. The unrestrained macrophage activity also leads to a state of moderate immunodeficiency with consequences of increased rates of infections and malignancies .\n\n【4】According to the 2004 HLH guidelines, the diagnosis of HLH requires either the identification of one of the HLH mutations or fulfillment of five out of the following eight diagnostic criteria (clinical, laboratory and histopathologic): fevers, splenomegaly, cytopenias of at least two lineages, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytic activity, low-absent NK-cell activity, hyperferritinemia (> 500 µg/L) and elevated sCD25 (> 2,400 U/mL) .\n\n【5】HLH usually evolves into a rapidly fatal disease if left untreated. Based on two landmark studies performed mainly in the pediatric HLH population (HLH-1994/HLH-2004 protocols), the current treatment of HLH is a multidrug regimen comprising dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclosporine. In cases with central nervous system (CNS) disease or progressive neurological symptoms, intrathecal methotrexate is indicated . Allo-SCT may be considered for patients with familial, persistent, or recurrent disease .\n\n【6】Lymphoma-associated HLH (LA-HLH) is a rare disorder carrying grave prognosis. Both T- and B-cell lymphomas can cause uncontrolled systemic responses and be the trigger for secondary HLH. Factors including the complexity and overlap in their clinical manifestations can lead to a delay in the identification and recognition of both entities. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for LA-HLH .\n\n【7】Case Reports\n\n【8】We conducted a retrospective search of the tumor registry and pathology database at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital to identify adult patients with the combined diagnosis of lymphoma and HLH between January 2008 and July 2018, using Pathology Laboratory Information System (LIS) and natural language search. Data from nine identified LA-HLH patients were reviewed to gain further understanding of the clinical features and treatment outcomes of our adult population of patients with LA-HLH. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of both institutions.\n\n【9】The main clinical characteristics of our retrospective cohort are summarized in Table 1 and molecular analysis results are summarized in Table 2 . While most series demonstrated a male prevalence , our series has a female predominance (56%) similar to Yu et al . The median age of our cohort is 53 years (range 19 - 73), with 78% of cases of Hispanic origin corresponding to our geographic location. Lymphoma subtypes consisted of six T-cell/NK-cell neoplasms (67%): two peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), not otherwise specified (NOS); two EBV+ extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphomas; one EBV+, CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , PTCL, NOS; one EBV+, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder-anaplastic large cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase negative (PTLD ALCL ALK-); and three B-cell neoplasms (33%): one EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); two DLBCL, NOS. The clinical manifestations observed across all our nine cases included fevers, constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and cytopenias. In seven out of the nine cases, hemophagocytosis phenomena were established in tissue specimens collected either from the bone marrow or the affected organs. In most of the cases (except cases 1, 3 and 4), HLH and lymphoma were diagnosed simultaneously. In case 1, HLH was diagnosed concurrently with second lymphoma relapse, 36 months after initial lymphoma diagnosis. In case 3, HLH preceded the lymphoma diagnosis by a period of 12 weeks, while in case 4, HLH arose 13 weeks following the diagnosis of PTLD ALCL ALK-, these occurring 5 years following a kidney transplant. In our cohort, five out of the nine cases (56%) tested positive on Epstein-Barr encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) analysis, comparable to the series of Cattaneo et al and Han et al, reporting rates of 41% and 68% EBER-ISH positivity, respectively . In addition, the association between adult HLH and PTLD ALCL ALK- is not previously described in the literature .\n\n【10】In our series, four cases received the combination of HLH plus lymphoma therapies, four cases had lymphoma-directed therapy and one case was treated with a modified version of the HLH-1994 protocol. Overall, a total of five cases received the HLH regimens (HLH-1994/2004). The selected specific lymphoma therapies for each patient in this case series are illustrated in Table 1 . Three patients had refractory LA-HLH and entered hospice care. Two of them developed sepsis-related complications during the course of treatment leading to multiorgan failure and subsequent death, and a third patient succumbed 13 days after allo-SCT. Of the seven cases that were evaluable for lymphoma response (cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9), four (57%) of them achieved complete remission (CR), and three cases (43%) were refractory to therapy. Three out of the four cases that responded to treatment (CR) were alive with no evidence of recurrence at 10, 16 and 52 months as of last time contact.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】LA-HLH is a rare entity described in the medical literature to have an incidence rate of 0.9%, as illustrated by Machaczka and colleagues . Supplementary Material 1  summarizes the published series analyzing the characteristics and outcomes of LA-HLH. Even though our series is built on a demographic of mostly Hispanics, we did not find significant clinical differences in their disease manifestations and treatment outcomes as compared to the reviewed published series. Our experience in LA-HLH indicates that NK-/T-cell lymphomas constitute the most common associated lymphoid malignancy, which correlates with the up-to-date literature. The mean survival of our LA-HLH patient group is 356 days, whereas the survival of the T-cell lymphomas is found to be higher compared to the B-cell lymphoma subgroup; however, this is just an observation given the limitation of a small descriptive study.\n\n【13】In 2015, the Study Group on HLH Subtypes of the Histiocyte Society published consensus recommendations for the management of malignancy-associated HLH (MA-HLH) . Due to the lack of prospective trials, there is no explicit agreement on whether patients should receive HLH-directed therapy (dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclosporine), malignancy-focused interventions, or a combination of both. The conventional HLH protocols aimed at suppressing the overactive immune system have shown to improve survival in HLH cases. While treating the underlying malignancy seems natural, a 2017 consensus review from Daver et al  noted higher mortality rates when lymphoma-directed therapies were used alone, leading to a recommendation of a two-step approach: treating first the cytokine storm and T-cell proliferation with etoposide, corticosteroids, anti-thymocyte globulin and immunoglobulins followed by a lymphoma-directed therapy. Hence, merging HLH- and cancer-directed therapies, for instance, adding etoposide to the frequently used lymphoma regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP), or initiating HLH-directed therapy as a first step to gain control of the life-threatening HLH cytokine storm syndrome followed by malignancy-focused treatment are both acceptable strategies . Another suggestion from the Study Group is to add anti-B-cell therapy such as rituximab in EBV-positive lymphomas and consider allo-SCT consolidation for LA-HLH, which is linked to improved survival outcomes . Additionally, owing to the severe immunosuppressive state and high incidences of infectious complications, supportive measures such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and pneumocystis prophylaxis along with surveillance for secondary viral infections and reactivations (CMV, EBV and fungi) should be strongly advocated in the treatment plan. Finally, treatment should be decided on a case-by-case basis, contemplating each patient’s clinical condition, co-morbidities, underlying malignancy and potential drug toxicities . Relapsed or refractory patients may be rescued with DEP regimen (doxorubicin, etoposide and methylprednisolone) as per a Chinese report . Similarly, several case-reports/case-series have shown alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) and anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) to be effective salvage therapies . Recently, the FDA approved emapalumab (anti-interferon-γ monoclonal antibody) based on results from a pivotal multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial for patients with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease, or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy . Furthermore, ongoing trials are evaluating the use of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibitor ruxolitinib in HLH .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Herein, we describe our unique experience of an LA-HLH case series in a predominantly Hispanic population in South Florida. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the association between HLH and PTLD ALCL. LA-HLH is an aggressive disease with a complex clinical presentation. The diagnosis is challenging, often delayed, and prognosis is dismal in refractory scenarios despite the currently available rescue therapies. Future prospective studies focusing on early diagnosis, management and novel targeted molecules will hopefully further improve the outcomes of patients with LA-HLH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Typically it occurs in salivary, sweat, lacrimal and mammary glands, but incidentally can be found in soft tissues, bones and viscera . When this neoplasm presents in soft tissues close to organs, it might be incorrectly diagnosed as another primary tumors, which are more common for those locations. It leads to misdiagnosis contributing to errors in appropriate treatment. We report a clinical case of a retroperitoneal soft-tissue myoepithelioma (STM) which simulated a primary pancreatic tumor.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 39-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 1-month history of decreased appetite, mild abdominal pain and palpable epigastric abdominal mass. He was a lifelong nonsmoker with no significant past medical or family history. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large epigastric mass (14 × 11 × 11 cm) growing from the pancreas with dislocated stomach, duodenum and left-sided portal hypertension . Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) showed patchy tracer uptake of the tumor located in the pancreatic body and tail . There was no evidence of regional or distant disease and all blood tests were within normal limits. Upper endoscopy with transluminal ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Final pathology suggested pancreatic myoepithelioma.\n\n【4】The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy. Intraoperatively, there was tumor compression of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic vein junction with left-sided portal hypertension and severe inflammatory reaction of adjacent tissues. These findings were suspicious for malignant behavior of the neoplasm and led to technical difficulties. Complete removal of the mass required distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, with estimated blood loss 2,800 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.\n\n【5】Postoperative pathology revealed a well-defined multinodal neoplasm with chondroid stroma and monotonous spindle cells having a co-expression of CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S-100 protein . The retroperitoneal STM was adjacent to pancreas without true invasion. The multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a 3 - 6 months follow-up with imaging for 2 years and annual examination for the next 3 years.\n\n【6】At 15 months follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic without signs of malnutrition, malabsorption, or recurrence.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】This patient had retroperitoneal STM which was presumed to be a primary pancreatic tumor. Generally, myoepithelioma is a rare glandular tumor that is typically found in salivary glands . Rarely it occurs in soft tissues with predominant growth in head and neck, pelvic girdle and limbs, where it usually appears as a palpable subcutaneous or subfascial painful or painless mass . There are few reported cases of non-typical sites like orbit, mediastinum, abdominal wall, mesentery and ovary . Retroperitoneal space is an extremely uncommon localization for this tumor, described in single publications .\n\n【9】The diagnosis of STM may be difficult due to lack of specific clinical and imaging guidelines. Some authors consider that moderate enhancement and well-defined cystic component of tumor on both CT and magnetic resonance imaging may be representative imaging characteristics for STM . This is consistent with CT and PET-CT findings in our clinical case . However, these traits are not truly specific and seen in a variety of other neoplasms, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), as well as in sarcomas. Thus, a confirmed histopathologic diagnosis prior to treatment is needed to best guide clinical management.\n\n【10】Core needle-guided biopsy is the preferred diagnostic method for pancreatic tumors due to its high accuracy and low complication rate . The patient underwent upper endoscopy with transluminal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the tumor, which surprisingly confirmed benign myoepithelioma. Nevertheless, this preliminary diagnosis of STM seemed unlikely due to the uncommon localization and well-known difficulties of morphological evaluation.\n\n【11】Pathology examination of STM is challenging owing to microscopical diversity in cell morphology and types of stroma . However, several studies showed that well-circumscribed margins and multinodular growth of spindled and plasmacytoid cells with eccentric nuclei in myxoid, hyalinized or chondroid stroma could be hallmarks for this benign tumor . In contrast, myoepithelial carcinomas are characterized by infiltrative or destructive growth pattern and large cells with irregular and enlarged nuclei embedded in abundant extracellular myxoid matrix. Focal necrosis and large polyhedral cells can also be seen . In the demonstrated case, biopsy revealed a monotonous neoplasm with myoepithelial-type cells and structure that suggested pancreatic myoepithelioma. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of STM after assessment of a tumor with well-defined margins and multifocal growth of monotonous spindle cells with focal plasmacytoid morphology and cartilaginous differentiation . There was no histological evidence indicating that the STM originated from the pancreas.\n\n【12】Considering the challenges of STM microscopic evaluation, the immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis is critical for proper diagnosis. In two large studies, the most sensitive markers for these tumors were keratin AE/1-AE/3 or pan-keratin (expressed in 93% of cases), vimentin (100%), S-100 protein (85-87%), calponin (86-100%), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA, 63%) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 46%) . Other authors described co-expression of additional markers: cytokeratin CAM5.2 (93-100%), SMA (36-64%), muscle-actin-specific monoclonal antibody (HHF-35, 20-60%) and p63 (7-45%) . In our case, immunohistochemistry analysis showed diffuse tumor expression of CAM5.2, SMA and S-100 protein , but did not show expression of CD117 (c-kit) and CD34, which is consistent with IHC criteria of STM diagnosis. The two last markers are also important for differential diagnosis, as their presence is quite specific for GISTs .\n\n【13】Currently, the role of genetic testing in STM diagnosis is disputable although its molecular profile has been a subject of investigation over the last decade. The most recent data state that up to 45% of STM demonstrate Ewing sarcoma region 1 (EWSR1) gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis . Skalova et al have found the EWSR1 translocations to be present in 39% (20/51) of clear cell myoepithelial carcinoma specimens, but their cohort included only salivary gland carcinomas . In case of EWSR1-negative STM 38% harbor the rearrangement of pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) and a small subset of STM (9%) show fused in sarcoma (FUS) gene alterations . Thus, today the data are not sufficient to consider any genetic finding as a reliable diagnostic tool for STM . Therefore, our genetic counselors decided not to perform molecular testing in this patient.\n\n【14】The pretreatment diagnosis of STM in our clinical case remained controversial even after testing, since we saw a combination of benign (absence of invasion and metastases on CT, biopsy results) and malignant (tumor size, left-sided portal hypertension, patchy F-18 FDG uptake on PET-CT) clinical signs. Eventually, this case was considered as a pancreatic potentially malignant myoepithelioma requiring surgery. The tumor compression of SMV and splenic vein junction with left-sided portal hypertension seen during the surgery was suspicious for malignant behavior. Also, a severe peritumoral inflammatory reaction complicated visualization and made it impossible to determine whether or not the tumor was originally pancreatic. Considering the intraoperative findings and suspected malignant pattern of tumor, the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and lymph node dissection.\n\n【15】Surgical resection with complete removal (R0 status) is a preferable treatment option of STM. Incomplete resection significantly increases risks of recurrence even in benign myoepitheliomas . The vast majority of these tumors show a favorable prognosis and low incidence of distant metastases . Nonetheless, in rare cases STM can transform into malignant myoepithelial carcinoma when untreated . Behavior of myoepithelial carcinoma is much more aggressive: the local recurrence rate is 39-42% and development of metastatic disease occurs in up to 52% of patients . The tumor of the described patient was removed completely and assessed lymph nodes were negative for tumor tissue. Fifteen months after treatment, the patient had no complaints and signs of disease recurrence.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This case report demonstrates diagnostic and treatment challenges of a rare tumor with uncommon localization - retroperitoneal STM. We believe our clinical experience will help guide clinicians to the appropriate treatment and reduce the risk of undesirable patient outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

One technical difficulty is the cannulation of the biliary orifice from an altered position. We often need to adjust and optimize the angle of approach in difficult situations with postoperative adhesion and deformity using forward-viewing endoscopes without an elevator system . Reported success rates of cannulation when using a forward-viewing endoscope in Billroth II anatomy are only 81-87% . We experience particular difficulty passing a catheter and devices in patients who have biliary stricture or severe deformity, although biliary guiding is successfully achieved, because it is difficult to exert effective force on a catheter or device due to axis-mismatch and the instability of the endoscope.\n\n【2】We herein report a case using a double-guidewire technique to facilitate deep cannulation and stenting for biliary stricture in patients with altered GI anatomy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 70-year-old man underwent total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer in January 2016. Computed tomography revealed a low-density mass with dilatation of the biliary tract in February 2018 . ERCP showed a bending, meandering dilatation and a lower stricture of the common bile duct , which was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and insertion of a 5-Fr plastic stent (Zimmon Biliary Stent; Cook Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was performed. The patient then started chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.\n\n【5】In September 2018, he developed acute occlusive suppressive cholangitis due to stent occlusion. Therefore, we attempted to exchange the plastic stent. We reached and identified the major papilla that was swollen due to tumor invasion using a colonoscope (PCF-Q260AZI; Olympus Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). First, we tried to cannulate alongside the plastic stent using a wire-guided technique (VisiGlide 2; Olympus Co. Ltd.; and MTW; MTW Endoskopie, Wesel, Germany). However, it was impossible to optimize the angle of approach. We then extracted the plastic stent and inserted a guidewire into the intrahepatic bile duct . However, we were unable to pass the catheter due to severe stricture of the lower common bile duct and axis-dismatch between the bile duct and the catheter . Therefore, we inserted another of the same guidewire into the bile duct  and were able to easily pass the catheter into the bile duct , resulting in the successful insertion 7-Fr plastic stent (Zimmon Biliary Stent; Cook Medical) . No procedure-related complications were observed, and the postoperative course was uneventful.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】We were able to pass a catheter through a malignant biliary stricture and insert a plastic stent with the assistance of a double-guidewire technique in a patient with altered GI anatomy. A double-guidewire can reduce the curvature of the guidewire, straighten the axis and stabilize the endoscope, making it easier to exert direct, effective force on a catheter or devices. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the utility of a double-guidewire technique for deep insertion of devices while approaching the papilla from the caudal direction.\n\n【8】Although several devices, including rotatable sphincterotomes, a bendable-tip cannula and an S-shaped sphincterotome, have been developed to facilitate cannulation , devices to assist deep cannulation in patients with biliary stricture have not yet been reported. This double-guidewire technique requires no preparation of any special devices and is easily performed, as we can insert the second guidewire alongside the first one. Furthermore, it should be possible to use this technique during stenting for GI stricture and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided procedures.\n\n【9】In conclusion, this double-guidewire technique is useful and worth attempting for the deep insertion of a catheter and devices through biliary strictures in patients with an altered GI anatomy.

Its prevalence is unknown, probably < 1/1,000,000 . So far, only few families were reported in the medical literature, especially in the Middle East region . Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is characterized by various clinical symptoms including endocrinal dysfunction (especially diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism), ectodermal manifestations (such as alopecia, wrinkled facial skin, and anodontia), and neurological impairment (including extrapyramidal symptoms, intellectual dysfunction, psychosis, and sensory neural hearing loss) . Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is important to be considered in patients experiencing any combination of these aforementioned symptoms. Because of the heterogenicity of the disease phenotype, patients may present differently as regards the symptoms, the age at onset, the severity of manifestations and the disease course .\n\n【2】We report here another Saudi female with a history, clinical examination, and investigations suggesting the diagnosis of Woodhouse Sakati syndrome.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report a 52-year-old lady who was born to consanguineous parents (first degree parenteral cousins). She had normal developmental growth but her scholastic performance was poor due to perceived intellectual difficulties. Soon after her first year of school, she was dropped out. At age of puberty, the patient did not develop secondary sexual characteristics and she had primary amenorrhea.\n\n【5】At the age of 24 years, deafness evolved insidiously and the patient’s tympanometry revealed type C pattern in the right ear and type A pattern in the left ear with loss of acoustic reflexes at all frequencies. Nine years later, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus that presented with disturbed consciousness. At this time, full hormonal profile was recommended that confirmed diabetes mellitus, gonadal dysfunction, and revealed hypothyroidism. At the age of 46 years, she began to complain of insidious progressive visual dysfunction. After seeking medical advice, her fundus examination revealed bilateral optic atrophy.\n\n【6】During the fourth decade of life, she experienced psychotic manifestations in the form of auditory and visual hallucinations, delusion of persecution and disorganized speech. Auditory hallucinations were non-commanding and non-commenting in nature but mainly unrecognized voices or animal voices. Visual hallucinations were of animals, known and unknown people to the patient, but none were fearful or threatening. However, her delusion of persecution was occasionally tense and fearful to the patient in which she believed that her close brother as well as other unfamiliar persons was trying to kill her. She was diagnosed as schizophrenia and received olanzapine initially. The dose of olanzapine was optimized to 40 mg per day over approximately 7 years but with a remitting course and minimal improvement. Moreover, she was on other different medications as aripiprazole and lamotrigine. However, more recently and because of the minimal improvement in her psychotic symptoms and functioning, she was switched to clozapine as a last resort which was titrated gradually to 200 mg twice daily. Her delusions and hallucinations have been mostly controlled and her fears have been subsided.\n\n【7】Patient physical examination revealed alopecia totalis, loss of eyebrow hair, and eyelashes. Her secondary sexual characteristics were absent. She had no axillary or pubic hair, and breast hypoplasia. Her neurological examination showed resting tremor and peripheral neuropathy (mostly due to diabetes).\n\n【8】As regards the laboratory investigations, the patient’s hormonal profile revealed high TSH (5 mIU/L, normal 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L), low FT4 (7, normal 9.0 - 25.0), low FT3 (2.4, normal 3.5 - 7.8), high luteinizing hormone level (13 mIU/L, normal range 1.8 - 11.78 mIU/L), high follicle-stimulating hormone level (40 mIU/L, normal range 3.03 - 8.08 mIU/L), high Hb A1c (10.5%, normal 4% - 5.6%), normal ACTH (12 pcg/mL, 9 - 52 pcg/ml), normal cortisol (6 µg/dL, normal 10 - 20 µg/dL), normal growth hormone level (0.337 ng/mL, normal < 10 ng/mL), and normal prolactin (6.7 ng/mL, normal 2 - 29 ng/mL). These laboratory data are suggestive of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\n【9】Computed tomography (CT) of the brain  showed bilateral basal ganglia calcification with diffuse cerebral atrophy. Her electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow background activity. Her ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral optic atrophy, and her hearing assessment ensured loss of acoustic reflexes bilaterally. Type A and type C tympanometry were demonstrated in left and right ears, respectively. Nerve conduction velocity study revealed diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy.\n\n【10】The patient was tested for DCAF17 gene mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct consequence. DCAF17 gene maps to chromosome 2q31.1. The gene comprises 14 exons and encodes 520 amino acid proteins with “ATG”. Genomic DNA was used from this patient to amplify the 14 coding exons and the corresponding flanking sequences of the DCAF17 gene. The results of her genetic testing showed that she had homozygous disease-causing single nucleotide deletion (C.436delC) of frameshift mutation  in exon 4 of the gene DCAF17 gene.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Woodhouse Sakati disease is a very rare multisystem degenerative disorder that typically affects the neurological and endocrinological systems. It is considered one of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders . Our patient presented with classical features of the disease including neurological, endocrinal, and ectodermal symptoms . She had primary amenorrhea, with high FSH and LH level, suggesting hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. This type of hypogonadism was reported in some previous case reports . She also developed insulin dependent diabetes mellitus at her third decade which was a typical presentation in previously reported patients . Her thyroid profile revealed that she had thyroid dysfunction of peripheral origin, which is common in 30% of cases of Woodhouse syndrome . Prolactin and cortisol levels were within normal range. As regards the ectodermal manifestations, the patient developed alopecia totalis which was reported in almost all cases with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome . Additional symptoms included sensorineural hearing loss, visual impairment, extrapyramidal signs, delusion of persecution, visual and auditory hallucinations, and intellectual dysfunction.\n\n【13】Neurophysiological testing of this patient revealed demyelinating sensory motor polyneuropathy, which probably attributed to diabetes mellitus. Schneider and Bhatia reported similar peripheral neuropathy in their reported family . EEG revealed generalized slowing, but our patient did not have any seizures. As regards brain imaging, the CT brain of our patient showed bilateral basal ganglia calcification which was not reported before. The calcification seems to be idiopathic because her calcium profile was normal. Previous reported studies reported variable brain imaging abnormalities; some patients had variable abnormalities at deep white matter , whereas others had iron deposition in globus pallidus .\n\n【14】Being born to consanguineous parents and having a brother with the same condition suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance. Because defects in DCAF17 (OMM312515) are responsible for causing the disease, the patient was tested for mutations of this gene, and her genetic testing revealed homozygous disease-causing single nucleotide deletion (C.436delC) of frameshift mutation  in exon 4 of the gene DCAF17 gene. This mutation has been previously reported in patients with Woodhouse Sakati syndromes .\n\n【15】In spite of being rare, Woodhouse syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with combinations of neuropsychological, endocrinal, and ectodermal manifestations, especially in the Middle East and Arab world. To date, only few dozens of families were reported to have the disease, especially in Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Tunisia , Turkey , Croatia , India , and Italy . The cases reported have various clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic patterns. Thus, it is of importance to report and study the clinical presentation of different cases with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome to have a better understanding of the disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "4831bd81-8f1f-45a6-b75a-2b83c24bef4f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Minoxidil is an antihypertensive that works by directly dilating peripheral vessels. The agent produces vasodilation via a cyclic AMP-mediated effect on arteriolar smooth muscle, with little effect on veins. There have been associations with its use and cause and/or exacerbation of pericardial effusions . The purpose of this study was to investigate an adverse drug event and its associated black box warning of pericardial effusion. I hypothesized that minoxidil was the cause of recurrent pericardial effusion in a patient whom underwent a pericardial window. I reviewed multiple studies consisting of observational studies, prospective observational studies using search words such as “pericardial effusion”, “drug related pericardial effusion”, “minoxidil and pericardial effusion”, “minoxidil black box warning” in PubMed, UptoDate, and Journal of American Medical Association.\n\n【2】Although the cause of the pericardial effusion in the patient discussed here is uncertain, malignancy, uremia, MI and autoimmune disease were ruled out. It is important to note that despite undergoing a pericardial window, the effusion did not resolve until minoxidil was discontinued.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, abdominal aortic aneurysm, polycystic kidney disease status post right nephrectomy, sick sinus syndrome status post St. Jude pacemaker placement and diet controlled diabetes, presented to the emergency room secondary to elevated blood pressure reading greater than 200/100 at home. He reported medication compliance, except for his minoxidil, which he had not taken for 1 week. Patient also reported sharp, non-radiating chest pain exacerbated by movement. He stated that he had experienced chest pain similar in quality in the past, and that he did not believe his current pain to be cardiac in origin. Patient was admitted to the cardiac service and his minoxidil, as well as his other home medications were restarted. Blood pressure returned to baseline. A chest X-ray was obtained at the time of admission and showed enlargement of the cardiac pericardial silhouette with clear lungs and no evidence of consolidation or effusions. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was found to be 987 and a two-dimensional cardiac echo was obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion with some signs of early tamponade physiology: diastolic right atrial collapse (< 50% of diastole), mild respirophasic variation (< 25% mitral inflow variation) and dilated non-collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC), although the patient was hypertensive at the time . A consult was placed to cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of a pericardial window. The following morning the pericardial window was performed and approximately 550 cc was evacuated. Fluid was sent for cytology and cultures. Cytology was negative for malignancy and there was no growth of microorganisms. A pericardial biopsy was obtained without evidence of tumor or inflammation. Serum histone Ab, anti-DS DNA, SS-B, and SS-A were negative. C3 and C4 were within normal limits, as was myeloperoxidase AB and proteinase AB. Patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for observation. He remained stable with blood pressures well controlled. He was discharged home with a refill of minoxidil.\n\n【5】Nine days later, the patient returned to the emergency room with reported shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and increased chest pain. Repeat two-dimensional echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated a large, free flowing pericardial effusion, circumferential to the heart with moderate atrial chamber collapse. Ejection fraction was estimated to be 55%. There was evidence for increased right ventricle-left ventricle interaction demonstrated by respirophasic changes in tricuspid velocities. Features were consistent with mild tamponade physiology. A large residual pericardial effusion was identified. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for recurrent pericardial effusion. CT angiogram of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolus, but significant for a large pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left. Right thoracotomy was performed, as well as a pericardial window and biopsy. The patient’s systolic blood pressure was increased by 10 mm Hg upon drainage of the pericardial collection. Cytology was non-revealing as was cytometry. The patient’s creatinine throughout the hospital course ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 with appropriate urine output and a BUN of 11 - 28. Minoxidil was discontinued at that time due to high suspicion that the medication was the culprit for the recurrent pericardial effusion . Repeat echo on post operation day 7 of pericardial window showed the estimated ejection fraction to be in the range of 55%. Compared to prior transthoracic echocardiogram, there was interval resolution of large circumferential pericardial effusion. There was a small loculated inferior effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Minoxidil is a direct acting vasodilator used for the treatment of hypertension. Side effects observed with the drug are peripheral edema (7%), pericardial effusion with tamponade (3%), pericardial effusion without tamponade (3%), angina pectoris, heart failure, pericarditis, rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and sodium and water retention. Patients with renal impairment are at higher risk for developing pericardial effusions, although this adverse effect has been documented in patients with normal renal function as well. The exact mechanism behind pericardial effusion in patients taking minoxidil is not clearly understood. Pericardial effusion in minoxidil-treated patients has been attributed to uremia, as well as the salt and water retention consequent of the vasodilatory effect of the drug. Review of the literature suggests that pericardial effusion is uncommonly observed in patients treated with minoxidil unless accompanied by cardiac or renal failure.\n\n【8】The patient reviewed in this case had underlying renal disease; however, renal function during hospitalization was within normal limits and at his baseline. His creatinine on discharge was 1.2, with a glomerular filtration rate of greater than 60, despite having a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease. Literature has hypothesized that the increased incidence of minoxidil-associated pericardial effusion is higher in the renal disease population due to their susceptibility for uremia and salt and water retention; however, that did not appear to be the explanation for our patient’s adverse effect. Although the cause of the pericardial effusion in the patient discussed here is uncertain, malignancy, uremia, MI and autoimmune disease were ruled out. It is important to note that despite undergoing a pericardial window, the effusion did not resolve until minoxidil was discontinued, underlying the importance of acknowledging the link between minoxidil and pericardial effusion .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This is due to the relatively protected position of these neural structures and their decreased accessibility to injury. It may be caused by anatomical abnormalities such as tumors, hematomas, surgical damage and trauma. Moreover, it can be damaged by metabolic insults such as diabetes mellitus, infection and paraneoplastic syndrome. Nevertheless, the most common cause of trauma resulting in lesion affecting the lumbosacral plexus is pelvic fracture . The incidence of lumbosacral plexopathies from pelvic fracture is about 9-46%  whereas the incidence of lumbosacral plexopathies from femoral fracture is about 0.7% . The symptoms which are caused by compressing lumbosacral plexus vary according to the structures involved such as sensory disturbance and muscles weakness in an affected leg. Unfortunately, neurological assessment in acute phase is difficult to detect and is generally diagnosed during follow-up.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 17-year-old male became persistent of right foot drop and numbness along the leg for 3 months. He had history of motorcycle accident. The pelvic radiograph showed fracture of right femoral head . Computed tomography scan of both hips with 3D reconstruction revealed right femoral head fracture which was proximal to the fovea centralis: Pipkin fracture type II and hemathrosis in the hip . He underwent open reduction and internal fixation by plate and screw . He denied any systemic disease. An orthopedic surgeon firstly diagnosed his symptoms as right sciatic neuropathy. However, 3 months postoperatively, his symptoms were not improved and still had paresthesia at right leg and the dorsum of the foot. The electrodiagnostic study was asked to confirm and localize the lesion.\n\n【4】Physical examination revealed muscle atrophy at right leg. Surgical scar at lateral of the thigh was detected. Motor power of right iliopsoas, quadriceps, hamstring, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius were grade 4 all whereas motor power of right tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius were grade 0 all. Impaired pinprick sensation and temperature sensation at right lateral leg and dorsum of the foot were noted. Tinel sign was negative at right popliteal fossa and the fibular head. Deep tendon reflex at right ankle was absent.\n\n【5】Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography were conducted. NCS showed no electrical response at right sensory superficial peroneal and motor peroneal nerves . Needle electromyography showed increased insertional activity, variable of spontaneous activity and impairment of recruitment at right biceps femoris (long and short heads), gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, tensor fascia latae and tibialis anterior muscles. There were normal insertional activity and no sign of spontaneous activity at right rectus femoris and paravertebral L5 level muscles . This result was summarized to right lumbosacral plexopathies. Therefore, ankle foot orthosis which helps to easily walk was ordered to the patient.\n\n【6】Two months later, there was some improvement in right tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles but paresthesia in right leg was unchanged.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Most common neuropathy from femoral fracture is sciatic neuropathy . However, patients with femoral fracture may have suffered injury to lumbosacral plexus . Patients with lumbosacral plexopathies present frequently with foot drop and numbness or paresthesia in the lateral leg and the dorsum of foot which should be differentiated from sciatic neuropathy. Neurological findings of lumbosacral plexopathies include not only weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion but there also is variable weakness of the gluteus and hamstring muscles. The hallmarks of electrodiagnostic study for lumbosacral plexopathies are spontaneous activity in peroneal, tibial, sciatic, superior gluteal and inferior gluteal innervated muscles. The motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of an affected lower limb reveal diminished or no electrical response .\n\n【9】This report showed lumbosacral plexopathies from uncommon cause: femoral fracture. The causes of lumbosacral plexopathies in this patient may be a result of high speed deceleration injuries sustained in vehicle accidents. Due to the relatively clinical presentations of lumbosacral plexopathies and peripheral nerve lesion, electrodiagnostic study is an important key for confirm diagnosis.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Diagnosis of lumbosacral plexopathies is difficult to differentiate between a lumbosacral plexus and peripheral nerve lesion. When careful neurological examination is combined with an electrodiagnostic study, a number of lumbosacral plexopathies may be increased. Therefore, clinicians should carefully assess femoral fracture patients who have sensory disturbance and weakness in an affected leg not only for sciatic neuropathy but also lumbosacral plexopathies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "259348f3-58aa-4dd4-95b3-c05a5c82c4ec", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Ovarian torsion is the total or partial rotation of the adnexa around its vascular axis. Venous or lymphatic blockade could result in potentially massive enlargement of the ovary caused by continued arterial inflow to the ovary without venous outflow. Eventually, if undiagnosed and untreated, arterial stasis can lead to hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis of the ovarian stroma. The risk of ovarian torsion rises by 5 fold during pregnancy. Incidence is 5 per 10,000 pregnancies . Its most common cause in pregnancy is a corpus luteum cyst, which usually regresses spontaneously by the second trimester . Ovarian torsion, therefore, occurs most frequently in the first trimester, occasionally in the second, and rarely in the third . Recurrence rate of torsion was 19.5% in pregnant women . Ovarian fixation is an alternative method to cystectomy for preventing recurrence . The aim of the study is to present a case of maternal adnexal torsion at the 9th gestational weeks, and its laparoscopic management with prophylactic detorsion suture.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 22-year-old, gravida 3, spontaneous abortion 2, pregnant woman at her 9th weeks of gestation, presented to the emergency department with acute onset of excruciating pain in the left and right-abdominal quadrant. She reported no vaginal bleeding or discharge, nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, or constipation. Her general and gynecologic history was noncontributory.\n\n【4】Physical examination showed she was diaphoretic. Her vital signs were unremarkable for a blood pressure of 120/85 mmHg and a pulse of 88 beats/min. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable right lower quadrant mass below the level of the umbilicus, with voluntary guarding but no rebound or peritoneal signs. Pelvic examination revealed a 10-week sized soft uterus, with a closed cervix, and a tender 10-cm right adnexal mass.\n\n【5】Laboratory results were normal. Transvaginal sonography performed at the examination room visualized a normal fetus in utero with a gestational age of 9 weeks. In the right adnexa, a large, 10 cm х 6 cm edematous ovary was seen. The left ovary appeared normal, and some free fluid was seen in the cul-de-sac. With color flow doppler small cystic masses periferally located at the right ovary and some vascular flow were identified at the perifery of the ovary. With a presumptive diagnosis of ovarian torsion, the patient was brought to the operating room, where general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were carried out. Laparoscopy was performed with a standart 10 mm main trochar at the umblical level, and two satellite 5 mm trochars at the inguinal regions. On entry into the abdominal cavity with a main trochar at the umblicus, a congested 10-cm right ovary was found to be twisted around its adnexal pedicle 2.5 rotations . After untwisting the ovarian pedicle, the ovary returned to its normal color and showed no signs of hemorrhage or necrosis. Since the patient was pregnant the luteo-placental hormonal mileu was probably still acting, so the ovary was not incised. Oophoropexy was performed with a no 0 polyglactin 910 suture material with blunt needle to fix the ovary to the ovarian fossa with peritoneal serosal intracorporeal suturing technique. The patient recovered without problems and was discharged on the first postoperative day. The remainder of her pregnancy was unremarkable.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Expedient surgery is a requisite treatment for ovarian torsion. The decision to proceed to surgery during pregnancy is somewhat complex, since the well-being of both mother and fetus must be taken into account. The risk of any surgery to the pregnancy will depend on the gestational age. In the first trimester, when ovarian torsion most often occurs in pregnancy, the risk of fetal loss is the smallest with modern anesthetic techniques. For years, the treatment of choice for ovarian torsion was salpingooophorectomy. Conservative treatment appears to be warranted to preserve fertility, even for adnexa that initially appear nonviable and purple or black in color. A major consideration is whether the surgery can be performed by laparoscopy or by laparotomy. In the nonpregnant patient and during the first trimester of pregnancy, ovarian torsion can usually be approached laparoscopically.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Diagnosis of ovarian torsion can usually be made on the basis of the characteristic clinical presentation in conjunction with ultrasound evidence of a unilaterally enlarged adnexal mass. Treatment options are limited to surgery, either by laparoscopy or laparotomy, the former becomes more difficult in pregnancy but should be the treatment of choice if experienced surgeon and equipment is available. Theoretically cystectomy in early pregnancy may detoriate the corpus luteum function, so ovarian fixation may be more preferable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This rare cutaneous condition appears cellulitic, lacks systemic involvement, does not respond to antibiotics, requires a high degree of clinical suspicion to diagnose, and is managed most effectively with oral corticosteroids. With the increasing threat of antibiotic resistance and importance of anti-microbial stewardship, it is imperative to correctly differentiate cellulitis from non-infectious cutaneous conditions, employ a comprehensive differential diagnosis for erythematous plaques, and understand when to perform a skin biopsy to aid with diagnosis. We present a case of Well’s syndrome in a patient admitted to our observation unit for “recurrent cellulitis”.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Presentation\n\n【4】A 28-year-old man presented with suspected recurrent right forearm cellulitis. The patient had had four episodes of pruritic, edematous, erythematous plaques on the arms and neck over the past 3 months. Each episode lasted for 7 - 10 days and was in a different location. He was treated successfully with antibiotics, but this episode developed while on clindamycin. He had a history of HIV managed with daily emtricitabine, tenofovir, and rilpivirine. His recent CD4 count was 1,204 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> with an undetectable viral load. He was started on IV cefazolin in the emergency department and admitted to the observation unit.\n\n【5】Assessment and diagnosis\n\n【6】On admission, he had a temperature of 36.8 °C, blood pressure of 134/77 mm Hg, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On his right forearm and inner upper arm, there were several warm erythematous slightly edematous plaques . Laboratory analysis was significant for a white blood cell count of 15,200/uL with 80.4% neutrophils and 5% eosinophils. As the patient’s rash did not improve on antibiotics, dermatology was consulted and a biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed perivascular and interstitial infiltrate with numerous eosinophils and neutrophils, and prominent superficial papillary dermal edema suggesting a diagnosis of Well’s syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) . The patient was successfully treated with anti-histamines and topical corticosteroids.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】When a physician is challenged with a case of cellulitis that does not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy, non-infectious etiologies must be considered. After a thorough history, physical, and diagnostic workup has been completed, skin biopsy with histopathology, culture, and direct immunofluorescence may be the only diagnostic option left to secure a diagnosis. In our case, we considered arthropod assault, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, contact dermatitis, Wells’ syndrome, dermal hypersensitivity reaction, urticaria, erythema migrans, toxin-mediated erythema, cellulitis, and drug reactions. Thrombophlebitis, gouty arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, panniculitis, toxic erythema of chemotherapy, angioedema, and foreign-body reactions represent diseases that commonly masquerade as infectious cellulitis as well .\n\n【9】Eosinophilic cellulitis, also known as Wells’ syndrome, was first described in 1971 by Dr. Wells as a recurrent granulomatous dermatitis with eosinophilia . This rare cutaneous condition lacks systemic involvement, does not respond to antibiotics, requires a high degree of clinical suspicion to diagnose, and presents with peripheral eosinophilia in only about 50% of cases . Cutaneous findings appear cellulitic and most typically present with erythematous plaques preceded by pruritis, but blisters, bullae, or nodules may also be seen. Resolution of the lesions occurs in 2 - 8 weeks and may result in hyperpigmentation and skin atrophy resembling morphea . Acute histology reveals tissue edema and a dermal eosinophilic infiltration in a perivascular pattern, while subacute to chronic histology reveals the classic “flame figures” composed of bundles of collagen coated with eosinophils . As flame figures have been associated with other conditions such as Churg-Strauss, spider bites, parasitic infections, follicular mucinosis, and herpes gestationis, a clinical-pathologic approach is required to confirm the diagnosis. Well’s syndrome may be associated with infectious diseases, arthropod assault, malignancy, immunologic disorders, thimerosal-containing vaccines, or medications, but a specific etiology and pathogenesis has not been determined. A literature review of 32 cases of idiopathic eosinophilic cellulitis in 2012 concluded that oral steroids achieved the highest rate of resolution and were 92% effective. In these patients, oral prednisone was typically given 2 mg/kg for 1 week and then tapered over 2 - 3 weeks. Topical steroids and oral anti-histamines were less effective. As recurrence occurs in up to half of cases, treatment of the underlying associated condition (if determined) is imperative, and alternate day low dose prednisone may be indicated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "88e5e90a-fbce-4c21-8833-565afa58f5db", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Rhinosporidiosis is a rare chronic granulomatous disease, caused by the parasite Rhinosporidium seeberi . It typically manifests as vascular polyps that arise from the upper respiratory tract. The disease is commonly found in the anterior nares, the inferior turbinates, septum and floor of the nasal cavity; however, it can also affect extranasal sites including the oral cavity, trachea and uvula . Rhinosporidiosis is usually a result of direct traumatic inoculation with the organism. Trauma from surgery has also been cited as potential mode of transmission . The disease progresses with local replication of R. seeberi and results in hyperplastic growth of host tissue and associated local immune response .\n\n【2】The disease is prevalent mainly in Indian subcontinent , and remains quite rare in the United States . As such definitive guidelines regarding surgical and medical treatment are poorly covered in the literature. Although rare in the United States, immigration from areas of the world where it exists increases the likelihood that the practicing head and neck specialist may encounter such disease entity in their practice. Familiarity with surgical and medical therapy will afford a more systematic approach for treating patients. We report a case of recurrent rhinosporidiosis in a Bangladeshian male affecting the nasopharynx, who presented with globus pharyngeus and dysphonia and underwent surgical resection with the use of the Harmonic™ scapel. We report our clinical outcome.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 41-year-old male from Bangladesh, with a 20 pack year smoking history, first presented to our office, 4 years ago, complaining of hoarseness and a “feeling of a lump” in his throat that was progressive. At the time a nasopharyngeal lesion was identified and biopsied with a pathology consistent with rhinosporidosis. The nasopharyngeal lesion was then surgically removed, using a combination of #15 blade scapel and electrocautery, uneventfully. The patient presented a week later for his first postoperative follow-up, and his symptoms had much improved. We planned to have him followed up with our infectious disease collegues for further postoperative treatment; however, he was lost to follow up; until recently he presented to our office with similar complaints as he did 4 years earlier.\n\n【5】On examination, a flesh-like, reddish, exophytic and lobular mass was seen to occupy most of the oropharynx. The mass had a pedicle that stemmed from the nasopharynx, which suggested it to be its origin. The rest of his oral cavity was unremarkable. His trachea was midline, thyroid gland was normal and there were no cervical lymphadenopathy noted on palpation. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy was performed which confirmed the origin of the lesion to be arising from the posterior wall of the upper nasopharynx. The pedicle was roughly 3 cm in width. Further evaluation with a CT scan demonstrated a midline mass that appeared to be lobulated in the nasopharynx . Given his symptoms and the size of the lesion, a decision was made to proceed with surgical resection.\n\n【6】In the operating room, general anesthesia was induced after endotrachael intubation via fiber optic. Excision of the nasopharyngeal mass was performed transorally. With the patient in the supine position, self spreader was placed to open the mouth. Two #14 rubber catheters were placed through both nostrils in order to retract the soft palate. This maneuver exposed the root of the tumor in the nasopharynx. The Harmonic™ scapel was used to transect the lesion at the base of the pedicle, in its entirety. Surrounding tissues were noted to be intact without evidence of local trauma. Furthermore, inspection through the nose disclosed no evidence of nasal component.\n\n【7】On gross pathology, a moderalely firm, flesh-like mass was excised . Microscopic evaluation identified sporangia and endopores  demonstrating a granulomatous reaction with eosinophilia . Final pathology is consistent with rhinosporidiosis with chronic inflammation and giant cell reaction. His postoperative course was unremarkable. Follow-up evaluation 6 months later with fiber optic laryngoscopy demonstrated no local recurrence, despite not using postoperative dapsone.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】We present a rare disease entity that the practicing head and neck surgeon may encounter, in light of immigration to the United States from the Indian subcontinent. The mode of treatment for rhinosporidosis has widely been anecdotal with little literature to support it. Wide local surgical electrocauterization of the base of the lesion is the treatment of choice . Additionally, systematic dapsone may be prescribed for 1 year to prevent recurrence, as its mechanisnm has shown to arrest the maturation of sporangia and promote fibrosis in stroma . There is a greater paucity of literature for the treatment of recurrent disease.\n\n【10】Surgery is effective at removing the lesion; however, resection with electrocautery can potentially cause localized tissue trauma that potentiates the possibility for innoculation . This may potentially explain the recurrence in our patient, as his initial surgical resection was with the use of electrocautery. It is unlikely that he had de novo innoculation of new spores, as the patient had not traveled outside of the country during that time frame and the parasite is not known to be spread between humans through casual contact . While he presented to our office after 4 years, the mass had been growing for couple of years prior. However, his symptoms had been manageable, hence his reluctance to seek medical help.\n\n【11】The patient had an uneventful surgical resection with the use of the Harmonic™ scapel. The Harmonic™ scapel has been described in the literature to have superior hemostasis while preserving the integrity of local tissue . We believe that it played a key role in the lack of recurrence despite the patient’s non-adherence to postoperative dapsone treatment.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】With increased immigration from regions where rhinosporidiosis is endemic, knowledge of the disease and treatment is paramount. In this case report, in an immigrant from Bangladesh, the identificaiton of recurrent rhinosporidiosis re-emphasized the importance of combined surgical and medical treatment to decrease local recurrence. However, pathogen as well as pathophysiology of this disease entity needs to be further elucidated in order to provide more effective and directed therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

A study reported by Tositti et al  found that while hyperamylasemia is relatively common in patients with acute gastroenteritis (10.2 % of 507 consecutive patients), overt pancreatitis in these patients was a rare occurrence. Elevation of pancreatic enzymes without mention of overt pancreatic inflammation has been reported in association with Campylobacter jejuni infection in a small number of patients . To our knowledge, only a single case of acute pancreatitis with imaging evidence of pancreatic inflammation has been reported previously . We report a case of acute pancreatitis with computed tomography (CT) evidence of pancreatic inflammation associated with C. jejuni enteritis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 62-year-old male presented with a history of loose stools, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and rapid weight loss. He had abdominal pain and tenderness centered in the epigastrum but had a non-surgical abdomen. He denied black or bloody stools. His past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, glucose intolerance, pancreatic insufficiency, and cholecystectomy. Temperature was not elevated. No significant postural changes in blood pressure were noted, but pulse increased from 67 to 90 going from supine to standing.\n\n【4】Laboratory findings included a serum amylase level of 358 U/L (normal range 28 - 100 U/L) and lipase level of 637 U/L (normal range 16 - 63 U/L). Sodium and potassium were normal. BUN was 25.0 mg/dL (normal range 6 - 23 mg/dL) and creatinine was 1.50 mg/dL (normal range 0.4 - 1.3 mg/dL). Peripheral white count, hematocrit and platelets were normal.\n\n【5】The patient was admitted to the hospital and a CT scan of the abdomen was performed, which showed evidence of mild, acute pancreatic inflammation. No cause of pancreatitis was identified. He was treated with supportive measures including IV fluids and nausea and pain medications. Amylase and lipase levels improved daily. Because diarrhea persisted, a stool culture was performed and yielded C. jejuni . The patient’s improvement by the time culture results were available was satisfactory enough that he was not started on antibiotics.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Common manifestations of C. jejuni enteritis are diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramps, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, chills and sweats and gross blood in stool. In a study involving 188 hospitalized patients with C. jejuni enteritis, pancreatitis (as determined by elevated serum amylase or lipase values) was found in 11 patients . The mechanism responsible for elevated amylase levels in bacterial enteritis is not completely understood and may be the result of several different mechanisms. It has been reported in the case of campylobacter cholecystitis that the organism can gain access to the biliary tract . Immune or perfusion injury may also be involved in some patients. It is possible that patients with and without imaging evidence of inflammation in reports of C. jejuni associated pancreatitis simply represent a continuum of very mild to more severe disease. However, there are patients who do appear to have elevated pancreatic enzymes without typical symptomatic or imaging evidence of pancreatitis as pointed out by Tositti et al. It seems likely that these are cases of hyperamylasemia without pancreatitis per se. In this setting, hyperamylasemia associated with bacterial enteritis might be analogous to the occurrence of elevated amylase that sometimes happens with nonspecific bowel injury such as in bowel obstruction or perforation.\n\n【8】This case is an example of the infrequent occurrence of pancreatitis in persons with C. jejuni enteritis. At least one case of pancreatic edema associated with C. jejuni enteritis has been reported previously .

{"seq_id": "660d7ad6-8c29-4fa7-9128-d5facb385475", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Epilepsy is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by recurrent and generally unprovoked seizures. Genetic factors may play an important etiologic role in epilepsy, especially in patients with refractory epilepsy. Over the past years, there has been increased interest in and ability to identify genetic mutations in various genes causing epilepsy. The KCNH2 gene encodes the Kv11.1 protein, which involves the pore-forming subunit of a rapidly activating-delayed rectifier potassium channel . Mutations of the KCNH2 gene result in a disorder that is classified as a “channelopathy” as it involves control of the transmembrane movement of a cation. These channels are expressed in cells throughout the body, but are highly concentrated in the central nervous system (CNS) and the heart. In the CNS, the channel is involved in the normal regulation of neuronal function and cortical physiology, thereby explaining its pathologic role in epilepsy. Additionally, the proteins encoded by the KCNH2 gene are involved in phases 2 and 3 of the cardiac action involving cardiac repolarization. Patients harboring this gene mutation may be at risk not only for seizures, but also abnormalities in cardiac repolarization leading to lethal arrhythmias. We present an 11-year-old girl with a KCNH2 gene mutation who required general anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of her evaluation for non-convulsive status epilepticus. End-organ involvement of KCNH2 gene mutations and channelopathies are presented, previous reports of anesthetic care for these patients are reviewed, and options for anesthetic care are discussed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】We present an 11-year-old girl who presented for an MRI of the brain as part of the evaluation for non-convulsive status epilepticus. Her past medical history consisted of mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder with accompanying intellectual impairment requiring substantial support (level 2), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. She was in her usual state before presentation to the emergency department with abnormal head movements, blank stares and abnormal behavior. The symptoms used to occur every month for the last 1.5 years and tend to subside on their own. On that very day, her mother noted her sitting in abnormal body positioning and the symptoms continued to get worse. This was associated with fluctuating mental status throughout the day with acute worsening of grimacing, eyelid fluttering and urinary incontinence.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】A primary diagnosis of non-intractable absence epilepsy with status epilepticus was made based on electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG revealed occasional 1 second, diffuse spikes and poly-spikes with slow wave discharges. With the EEG findings being consistent with atypical absence epilepsy and her clinical presentation, treatment was started with ethosuximide and zonisamide. The co-existing autism and atypical absence epilepsy prompted further genetic testing and the decision to proceed with imaging including an MRI of the brain. Genetic workup revealed a mutation in the KCNH2 gene and she was scheduled for an MRI of the brain under general anesthesia. The patient had no previous surgery or anesthetic exposure. Family history was negative for seizures, syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden/unexplained death.\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Preoperative evaluation for an MRI under anesthesia revealed an unremarkable physical exam and normal serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, complete blood count, and hepatic function. Due to the presence of the KCNH2 mutation and hence the possible presence of abnormal KCNH2 \\-encoded potassium channel resulting in both epilepsy and a predisposition to arrhythmias, consultation with cardiology was obtained and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed. The ECG was normal with a QTc of 424 ms (normal QTc for this age group being 370 - 450 ms). The patient was held nil per os for 6 h and was transported to the MRI induction room where standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were placed. Inhalation induction was achieved with sevoflurane in 100% oxygen followed by placement of a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter. Propofol (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and a size 2.5 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (inspired concentration 2-2.5%) in air and oxygen. Dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) was administered for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Vitals signs were stable throughout the MRI. Total intraoperative fluids included 300 mL of lactated Ringer’s. After completion of the MRI, the LMA was removed. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A repeat ECG was again normal with a QTc of 437 ms.\n\n【9】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【10】The patient’s postoperative course was unremarkable. She was discharged home with arrangement for cardiology follow-up. Her clinical course since discharge has been unremarkable with no further seizures.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】A channelopathy is as an inherited disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding for transmembrane ion channels, their subunits, or associated proteins. The ion channels regulate the transmembrane movement of cations including potassium, sodium, and calcium in various tissues throughout the body. They are highly concentrated in the CNS and the cardiac muscle and as such, their dysfunction can result in seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. The presence of these channels and their dysfunction in these two separate tissues explain the association of sudden death in patients with epilepsy syndromes as well as the occurrence of seizures in patients with repolarization defects and cardiac arrhythmias. These associations occur as primary pathologies in the separate systems rather a secondary occurrence following a primary event (seizures following cardiac arrest from an arrhythmia or seizures resulting in hypoxemia and cardiac arrest) .\n\n【13】Although identification of the number of genes known to cause ion channelopathies has increased over the past 30 years, three genes ( KCNQ1, KCNH2 , and SCN5A ) account for the vast majority of patients with these disorders . KCNH2 gene mutation has been linked with various electrophysiologic alterations of repolarization including long QT syndrome (LQTS) type 2, brugada syndrome, and short QT syndrome . KCNH2 gene mutations are also potentially linked to cerebral ion channelopathies, causing epilepsy, sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS), and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) . Therefore, epilepsy and these alterations in repolarization, manifesting as LQTS, may be unified under a single etiology, an ion channelopathy, manifesting in both the CNS and the heart.\n\n【14】During the perioperative care of patients with a KCNH2 gene mutation, considerations may involve the associated seizure disorder as well as the potential for cardiac arrhythmias. Preoperative management to limit the potential for perioperative seizures includes optimizing and confirming therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to the surgical procedure. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s nil per os status with subsequent intraoperative dosing as needed . Alternative routes of delivery may be required when enteral administration is not feasible during the perioperative period. When selecting specific agents for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in patients with an underlying seizure disorder, there is limited evidence-based medicine . Although clinical seizure-like activity and even occasional spike and wave activity on the EEG has been reported with sevoflurane, these effects generally occur only when the inspired concentration is rapidly increased during anesthetic induction . Specific agents such as etomidate or methohexital may activate the electroencephalogram and have the potential to augment seizure activity. However, in general, the inhalational and intravenous anesthetic agents including the barbiturates, benzodiazepines, propofol, ketamine, and the inhalational anesthetic agents are anticonvulsants and have been used to treat status epilepticus .\n\n【15】Cardiac involvement and clinical manifestations in patients with KCNH2 gene mutation include sudden death or syncope related to cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, predominantly due to LQTS. Patients with a family history of previous sudden unexplained death, syncope, or cardiac arrhythmias may require a more thorough cardiology evaluation prior to anesthetic care. In our patient, given the lack of a concerning family history, and a normal QTc on the ECG, we decided to proceed with anesthetic care. QT prolongation can be acquired (related to metabolic disorders or medications) or originate from a genetic disorder (LQTS). The normal range of the QTc varies by age and gender, with the QTc being slightly longer in females. Prolonged QTc is defined as > 450 ms in males and > 460 ms in females. With increasingly longer QTc values, the probability of a patient having an LQTS-causing mutation increases as does the risk of lethal arrhythmias.Perioperative care of patients with a prolonged QT interval involves avoidance of medications and conditions that may further prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to anesthetic care.Furthermore, rapid access to the defibrillator is suggested and when clinically feasible, defibrillator pads should be placed prior to anesthetic care in patients with a prolonged QTc. In our patient, as we were providing anesthetic care for MRI, the defibrillator was located in zone 2 in the event that it was needed. The potential implications of various anesthetic agents (inhaled and intravenous) and recommendations for perioperative care in patients with a prolonged QT interval have been reviewed elsewhere . In our patient, we chose to keep intraoperative care relatively simple using sevoflurane and propofol. We chose not to use ondansetron for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting given its potential impact on the QT interval. A repeat ECG was obtained, which revealed a normal QTc again, following anesthetic care prior to discharge home.\n\n【16】Learning points\n\n【17】The KCNH2 gene encodes a protein component of the pore-forming subunit of a transmembrane potassium channel. This channel plays an essential role in phases 2 and 3 of the cardiac action potential involving cardiac repolarization as well as being expressed in various parts of the central nervous system where it regulates neuronal function. Mutations of the KCNH2 gene result in a disorder that is classified as a “channelopathy”. These channels are expressed in cells throughout the body, but are highly concentrated in the CNS and the heart. Patients harboring this gene mutation may be at risk for seizures and abnormalities in cardiac repolarization leading to lethal arrhythmias. Anesthetic care is impacted by the potential for both seizures and QTc prolongation. Anesthetic care should be tailored to avoid perioperative medications and scenarios that may increase the risk of seizures and further prolong the QTc.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is considered a rare cause of infections in humans . Most of the reported infections, whereas G. morbillorum has been isolated as a causative pathogen, were infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, and deep visceral abscesses . However, there are only a handful of cases in the current literature that has documented G. morbillorum as a primary organism causing necrotizing soft tissue infections . In this report, we present a rare case of a necrotizing perineal soft tissue infection caused by G. morbillorum in an elderly diabetic female patient with a history of long-standing Crohn’s disease who underwent a recent colonoscopy with rectal polypectomy. This case highlights G. morbillorum as the culprit organism of necrotizing perineal soft tissue infections and raises concerns for this commensal organism as an emerging virulent pathogen in high-risk patients.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】An 87-year-old Caucasian female patient was brought to the emergency department with recurrent fevers and worsening perineal pain for 2 weeks. She denied recent bowel movements changes, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, or melena. She had no cough or shortness of breath. The patient denied any urinary symptoms. The systemic review was not contributing to her presenting complaints. Past medical history was significant for poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease diagnosed 18 years ago, status post-right hemicolectomy for perforated ileocolic disease, chronic secretory diarrhea secondary to bile acids malabsorption, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension. Her regular medications included mesalamine, metformin, glipizide, amlodipine, and omeprazole. Notably, the patient underwent a recent surveillance colonoscopy performed 3 weeks prior to her presentation, which was largely unremarkable apart from a small hyperplastic polyp in the lower rectum that was removed with a cold snare. Serial random colonic and ileocolic anastomosis biopsies were negative for any dysplastic or neoplastic changes.\n\n【5】Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing patient who was febrile to 38.8 °C, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 95/65 mm Hg. The abdomen was soft and non-tender to examine. The perineal examination was remarkable for a necrotic-looking blackish eschar over the left ischioanal region with profound cellulitis changes. No palpable crepitus or bullae were evident. Digital rectal examination revealed no internal rectal induration. The systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 17.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference 3.0 - 11.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 75 mg/dL (reference 1.5 - 7.0 mg/dL), hyponatremia of 128 mmol/L (reference 133 - 144 mmol/L), hypokalemia of 3.4 mmol/L (reference 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L), and a normal serum creatinine level. Serial blood glucose levels were averaging 350 mg/dL (reference 70 - 110 mg/dL) with a hemoglobin A1c of 9.0% (normal < 5.7%). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis revealed soft tissue gas within the left ischiorectal fossa with no evident local fluid collection or abscess formation . There were neither signs of rectal perforation nor fistulous communication. In addition, there were no features of active Crohn’s colitis. The extra-luminal gas was presumed as a result of a necrotizing perineal soft tissue infection. The patient was commenced on broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and clindamycin) as per hospital-based guidelines for necrotizing soft tissue infections that were generated from local antibiotics susceptibility patterns. The patient underwent an emergent debridement of the perineal necrotic tissues to a base of viable tissues. There was no evidence of a visible communication of the deep wound cavity with the rectal wall. An intraoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a grossly normal rectal mucosa.\n\n【8】Two sets of blood cultures that were obtained at the time of admission grew Gram-positive cocci in chains within the first day of incubation. Subsequent cultures grew only G. morbillorum that was confirmed by direct matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry from the positive blood culture bottles. There was no growth noted in the aerobic bottles after 5 days of standard incubation. Considering G. morbillorum bacteremia, echocardiography was warranted to rule out concurrent infective endocarditis, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for valvular vegetations. The deep perineal wound cultures also grew G. morbillorum.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】The patient underwent a series of daily wound dressings, and a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing was applied in situ to enhance wound healing. The patient remained afebrile for 3 days post-debridement with continued parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics. Repeat blood cultures on day 4 postoperatively were negative for any bacterial growth. The isolated strain of G. morbillorum was pan-sensitive to most antibiotics, except metronidazole. The patient was transitioned to oral clindamycin and amoxicillin as per susceptibility results with a plan to complete at least 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy as per infectious diseases consultation. Optimization of glycemic control was achieved.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】The patient was eventually discharged on day 12 post-operatively into a skilled nursing facility for wound care. A 4-week follow-up at an outpatient clinic revealed a well-healing wound.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】G. morbillorum is a part of the commensals of the oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts . It was first described as Streptococcus morbillorum, then Peptostreptococcus morbillorum , and then it was eventually classified to the current genus in 1988 based on 16S RNA analysis . G. morbillorum has been more frequently isolated in recent years  owing to advances in laboratory detection techniques such as MALDI-TOF, which was employed in our patient, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), particularly in the setting of culture-negative infections , and sequence analysis of 16S RNA .\n\n【15】Human infections due to G. morbillorum are an uncommon occurrence, but they have been well described in the literature with certain predisposing factors . The most reported infections were infective endocarditis, affecting both native and prosthetic valves, which were usually encountered in the setting of post-endoscopic G. morbillorum bacteremia, poor dental hygiene, various immunosuppression states (such as diabetes mellitus and steroids use), and intravenous drug use , pleural empyema, which was likely related to possible aspiration of oropharyngeal contents , septic arthritis , spondylodiscitis , brain abscess , retropharyngeal abscess , lung abscess , and mediastinitis with mediastinal abscess complicating mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm .\n\n【16】Nevertheless, necrotizing soft tissue infections due to G. morbillorum are rather a rare entity , as per our literature review of the available English medical literature; only five cases of soft tissue infections were identified where G. morbillorum being isolated as a causative pathogen . Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these cases. It is worth mentioning that G. morbillorum is difficult to isolate in cultures , which may partially explain the rarity of published cases in the current literature .\n\n【17】This reported patient had a multitude of possible risk factors for a necrotizing perineal soft tissue infection by a commensal gastrointestinal organism such as G. morbillorum. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is a well-documented immunosuppressive condition that is associated with significantly reduced clearance of bacteremia and delayed wound healing . A long-standing Crohn’s disease has certainly posed a risk for G. morbillorum bacteremia in this patient, as it has been observed that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are generally at significantly higher risks of gastrointestinal organisms’ bacteremia than the general population , this risk may be explained by many postulations that include, for instance, alterations of the gut barrier function of the inflamed intestinal epithelia, which leads to increased mucosal permeability and subsequently bacterial translocation, malnutrition-associated immune dysfunction, and surgically related complications such as colonic perforation and fistulas formation . Furthermore, age was found to be an independent risk of IBD-associated bacteremia, as a recent large retrospective study published by Goren et al reported that 1.3% of hospitalized IBD patients had bacteremia; those patients were mostly above the age of 65 years , in keeping with our reported patient’s characteristics.\n\n【18】In addition, the recent colonoscopy with rectal polypectomy may have also contributed to G. morbillorum-associated necrotizing perineal infection in the reported patient. Although there were neither features of a rectal perforation nor fistulous communication on both contrast-based CT imaging and intraoperative sigmoidoscopy, a possibility of micro-perforation cannot be entirely ruled out, and alternatively a subtle rectal perforation could have occurred, resulting in G. morbillorum translocation to the perirectal soft tissues in the setting of diabetic immunosuppression. The latter assumption is supported by the isolation of G. morbillorum from the deep perineal wound cultures.\n\n【19】Interestingly, G. morbillorum bacteremia has been a culprit for a diagnosis of an underlying colonic adenocarcinoma . The association between colonic cancers and certain gastrointestinal organisms’ bacteremia (S. milleri, S. agalactiae, group G streptococci, and Clostridium septicum) is well known . This association could be attributed to a tumor-induced disruption of the gut barrier that potentiates the translocation of colonic bacterial flora . Some authors presently advocate for screening for colonic adenocarcinoma in patients with G. morbillorum bacteremia of unknown source . Notably, our patient’s recent surveillance colonoscopy was negative for neoplastic lesions in the setting of a long-standing Crohn’s disease.\n\n【20】Most isolated G. morbillorum species in the literature were generally sensitive to most antibiotics, but metronidazole , in line with the strain isolated in our patient. At present, penicillin G and ampicillin are considered of choice for extra-abdominal Gemella infections . However, resistance to penicillin has been increasingly reported in recent years . Most reported cases of G. morbillorum endocarditis responded to a 4- to 6-week course of a combination of penicillins and aminoglycosides . In penicillin-allergic patients or those with penicillin-resistant strains, vancomycin as monotherapy or in combination with erythromycin or rifampicin has been employed with a satisfactory outcome .\n\n【21】Learning points\n\n【22】Our case provides evidence of G. morbillorum as the culprit organism of a post-colonoscopy necrotizing perineal soft tissue infection in a diabetic patient with Crohn’s disease.\n\n【23】The reported case raises concerns of this commensal organism as an emerging virulent pathogen in high-risk patients.\n\n【24】The authors proposed that a combination of a long-standing Crohn’s disease and recent colonoscopy with rectal polypectomy could have predisposed our patient to G. morbillorum bacteremia with perineal sepsis in the setting of diabetic immunosuppression.\n\n【25】Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether G. morbillorum is acquiring increased virulence that would lead to novel pathogenesis of soft tissue infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "bab7d5dd-8bdd-415e-aa64-b9f0bc0f1596", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are formed against the NMDA-type glutamate. The disorder was first reported in 2005 in a cohort of four young women who presented with psychiatry symptoms, altered mental status, hypoventilation, and memory deficits with coincidental ovarian teratomas . It is postulated that the pathogenesis is the result of the effects of autoantibodies against NMDA receptors throughout the body. These auto-antibodies are formed in response to the neuronal tissue in the ovarian teratomas. The disorder has been most commonly reported in young African-American women between 18 and 35 years of age . It is the second most common cause of immune-mediated encephalitis, after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis .\n\n【2】Patients typically evolve into a state of unresponsiveness with disturbances in motor and respiratory function after an initial presentation with psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration . Prior to the identification of the exact pathogenesis of this immune-mediated process, many of these patients were erroneously diagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental health issues. The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical symptomatology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis, and delta or theta activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Confirmation of the diagnosis is now possible by the demonstration of specific antibodies in the CSF against the NMDA receptor . Treatment typically involves plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, as well as chemotherapy and surgery if a tumor is present.\n\n【3】Given the associated changes in central nervous system function and its association with abdominal teratomas, anesthesia is frequently required for radiological imaging or surgery. We present an adolescent with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis who required anesthetic care for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. End-organ involvement and its impact on perioperative care is discussed. The interaction of the anesthetic agents that target the NMDA receptor and its potential impact on anesthetic care are reviewed .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for retrospective review, and publication of a single patient case report is not required by the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio). At the time of the procedure, the patient was an 8-year-old, 28 kg male, scheduled for an MRI of the brain due to fatigue, altered mental status, abnormal shaking movements, and seizure-like activity along with fever and vomiting. His current medical history included seizures, chronic pain, and anxiety, along with a recent diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with confirmation by the identification of antibodies in the CSF against the NMDA receptor. The patient had been previously treated with immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab. There was no past surgical history. The patient had no known drug allergies. Current medications included cyproheptadine and oral nystatin.\n\n【6】General physical examination revealed a normal thyromental distance and a Mallampati Class I airway. The physical examination and preoperative vital signs were unremarkable. The anesthetic plan, risks, benefits and alternatives to general anesthesia were discussed with the parent and informed consent for general anesthesia was obtained. The patient was held nil per os for 8 h, was transported to the MRI suite, and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) monitors were placed. Anesthesia included the administration of a bolus dose of propofol (1 mg/kg) through an indwelling peripheral intravenous access followed by a propofol infusion at 150 µg/kg/min. Additional medications included ondansetron (3 mg). Intraoperative fluids included 200 mL of lactated ringers. The MRI, which lasted approximately 60 min, was completed with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. Following completion of the MRI, the patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). His postoperative course was unremarkable. He was discharged to the inpatient ward from the PACU.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The NMDA receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel responsible for synaptic transmission and plasticity. In anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, there are antibodies against the NR1-NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively . The auto-immune process leads to accelerated destruction of the NMDA receptor and a decrease in their surface density. This ultimately leads to decreased synaptic NMDA-R-mediated currents and decreased glutamatergic synaptic function . This reversible loss of the current and synaptic dysfunction is the pathogenesis of the central nervous system effects including memory loss, behavior irregularity, psychosis, and cardiorespiratory changes including arrhythmias and hypoventilation.\n\n【9】As with any anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough preoperative examination and identification of end-organ effects of the disease process. Of primary concern is the potential for cardiovascular and respiratory involvement. Cardiovascular involvement may include cardiac dysrhythmias (most commonly tachycardia) and blood pressure instability (most commonly hypertension), as a result of autonomic dysfunction . These episodes have been labeled “paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity or PSH” . Autonomic dysfunction may also manifest as abrupt episodes of bradycardia or asystole and hypotension. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be indicated for patients who are manifesting these clinical signs. Postoperative hemodynamic and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring may be indicated based on the intraoperative course. Medications to treat hemodynamic instability and PSH should be readily available including beta adrenergic antagonists, antihypertensive agents, anticholinergic agents, epinephrine, and vasopressors (phenylephrine).\n\n【10】Also of concern is the significant central nervous system (CNS) involvement including psychosis, agitation, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration. This may limit patient cooperation and mandate sedation or general anesthesia for non-invasive procedures including radiologic imaging as was required in our patient. Preoperative management strategies to limit the potential for perioperative seizures include optimizing and confirming therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to the surgical procedure. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s nil per os status with subsequent intraoperative dosing as needed . Alternative routes of delivery (intravenous or rectal) may be required when enteral administration is not feasible. Consultation with the neurology or pharmacology service may be helpful to determine dosing conversion from enteral to intravenous administration or to guide intraoperative redosing. Another intraoperative issue is the potential for intraoperative hyperthermia related to the autonomic instability of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. During general anesthesia, blunting of the normal thermoregulatory mechanisms and peripheral vasodilatation with increased heat loss place pediatric patients at a greater risk of hypothermia than adult patients . This concern generally holds true even during MR imaging when radiofrequency radiation emitted by MRI scanners can be absorbed by the patient as heat energy, creating an increase in body temperature . However, given the potential for alterations in body temperature (both hypothermia and hyperthermia), intraoperative temperature monitoring, in accordance with ASA guidelines, is suggested . Significant intraoperative hyperthermia may require investigation and differentiation from more serious conditions such as malignant hyperthermia .\n\n【11】CNS involvement may also impact upper airway control and the patient’s ability to clear upper airway secretions thereby placing these patients at risk for aspiration. Based on the patient’s CNS involvement and nil per os status, techniques to limit the risk of aspiration during anesthetic induction including rapid sequence intubation, and airway control with endotracheal intubation may be indicated . Given the limited upper airway involvement of our patient, we chose to provide deep sedation with a propofol infusion without airway instrumentation for MR imaging.\n\n【12】Postoperative respiratory failure related to upper airway control, altered central control of ventilation, and impaired clearance of pulmonary secretions may also occur, leading to postoperative respiratory insufficiency. These problems may be exacerbated by the residual effects of anesthetic agents, the surgical procedure, poor cough effort, and the use of postoperative opioids for pain management. These effects may be minimized by the use of short acting agents for sedation and general anesthesia such as propofol, desflurane or remifentanil. As the patient’s cognitive state allows, incentive spirometry may improve postoperative respiratory function. Non-invasive techniques of respiratory support such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) may be used to facilitate postoperative tracheal extubation . Depending on the severity of the patient’s end-organ involvement, postoperative monitoring of respiratory function may be required .\n\n【13】The NMDA receptor, along with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are the two main receptors postulated to be involved with the mechanisms of general anesthesia . Given the involvement of the NMDA pathway, avoidance of medications that act directly through these receptors is suggested  . Ketamine binds to the phencyclidine binding site of the NMDA receptor and inhibits glutamate triggered calcium influx. The mechanism of action of ketamine is similar to the pathogenesis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis thereby explaining the similarity of ketamine’s clinical features with the clinical features of the disease itself . Volatile anesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane result in a 50% depression of NMDA receptor-mediated currents when used at levels close to the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration. Although these agents enhance transmission through the GABA transmission, they also inhibit both NMDA-gated currents and NMDA-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Similar effects are noted with propofol thereby leading to indirect effects on the NMDA system .\n\n【14】To date, there are a limited number of reports regarding the anesthetic care of patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis . The majority of these reports have noted the safe and effective use of the general anesthetic agents including propofol and desflurane, neuromuscular blocking agents including vecuronium and rocuronium, and opioids including fentanyl, remifentanil, and hydromorphone. However, Lapebie et al noted the anecdotal and temporal association of sevoflurane and propofol with worsening of the neurologic status including seizures in a 24-year-old woman with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis related to an ovarian teratoma . Anecdotal experiences by two separate groups of investigators have suggested the potential for an exaggerated effect of propofol on blood pressure with hypotension in these patients . It has been suggested that there may be decreased anesthetic requirements related to the effects of the disease process on the NMDA system. Other factors that may impact perioperative care include the treatment paradigms including use of immunosuppressive agents, long-term administration of corticosteroids, and plasmapheresis. We would suggest avoidance of agents that have significant and direct effects on the NMDA system . In severe cases, the use of benzodiazepines and opioids which have no known effects on the NMDA pathway may be preferred. Additionally, dexmedetomidine with its novel mechanism of action may offer an additional option for sedation during MR imaging, although its potential to cause hemodynamic effects including bradycardia must be considered .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "006ec8d4-31cb-43a7-9097-43e31b381711", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Lactobacillus species are commonly known to colonize the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract , but they are not part of the normal skin flora . They are also found in dairy products, certain fruits and vegetables and are employed as probiotics and in manufacturing fermented foods . They have been reported, albeit uncommonly, as a cause of clinically significant infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts . They are microaerophilic, non-motile and non-spore forming, gram-positive rods which are catalase and oxidase negative . Lactobacillus species are rarely pathogenic in humans but have been identified in a variety of infections including dental caries, infective endocarditis, vascular graft infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, liver abscess, splenic abscess and bacteremia .\n\n【2】Risk factors for developing Lactobacillus infections include neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressive conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, transplant, selective bowel decontamination and invasive abdominal or respiratory procedures . Infections caused by Lactobacillus may be underreported in the medical literature because of the failure or reluctance to recognize it as a true pathogen . Polymicrobial or mixed infections have been reported in 39% to 87% with streptococci, anaerobes, Candida species, enterococci and gram negative bacilli as frequent co-infecting pathogens . Patients with lactobacillemia diagnosed within 48 hours of admission are more likely to have polymicrobial bacteremia than patients with nosocomial lactobacillemia . We describe a rare case of pyelonephritis caused by Lactobacillus acidophilus in a female patient subsequently diagnosed with high grade urothelial carcinoma.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 63 year old, African American female presented with fever and right flank pain radiating to her right groin. She first felt these symptoms three days prior to presentation with gradual worsening. Her pain was aggravated by movement and was associated with urinary urgency, rigors and nausea. She noticed that her urine was foul-smelling and appeared cloudy. Her past medical history was significant for uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy and a remote history of cholecystectomy. She also had a history of severe allergy to penicillin. Four months ago, she developed right-sided obstructive urolithiasis with hydronephrosis requiring placement of a right lower ureteral stent. She received a two week course of levofloxacin after stent placement.\n\n【5】On admission she had a temperature of 38.2 °C, with a pulse rate of 105 beats per minute and blood pressure of 134/68 mmHg. Physical examination revealed right flank and costovertebral angle tenderness without signs of peritonitis. Laboratory tests showed the following: leukocyte count of 16,500 cells/ml (89.6% neutrophils, 12% bands) and hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dl. Urinalysis revealed numerous leukocytes, 5 to 9 red blood cells with a positive leukocyte esterase reaction and was nitrite negative. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was initiated empirically after obtaining blood cultures. Computerized tomography scan of her abdomen and pelvis revealed mild worsening of right hydronephrosis with increased perinephric stranding. Renal flow studies were consistent with right-sided hydronephrosis.\n\n【6】The following day, the patient underwent cystoscopic removal of the right ureteral stent, which was found to have visible calcifications. A new mass was discovered in the lower part of the ureter and was biopsied. A higher right ureteral stent was placed to relieve current obstructive hydronephrosis. Urine culture revealed > 10 <sup>5 </sup> colony forming units/ml of Lactobacillus species. Two blood cultures obtained initially on admission subsequently grew gram positive bacilli later identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus . Intravenous clindamycin was added to ciprofloxacin. The patient’s condition improved and she was discharged from the hospital on clindamycin and ciprofloxacin with a follow-up appointment in the urology clinic. Preliminary blood cultures at the time of discharge were negative, but one out of two blood cultures was later noted to grow L. acidophilus . Tumor biopsy results subsequently revealed high grade urothelial carcinoma.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Lactobacillus bacteremia of renal origin is rarely described in the medical literature. In a review of 55 patients with Lactobacillus bacteremia, only 6 patients had underlying urinary tract infection as a clinical manifestation . Furthermore, pyelonephritis from Lactobacillus is even more rarely reported. We found only 3 reported cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia with pyelonephritis . The first case described pyelonephritis in a patient with nephrolithiasis, who underwent nephrectomy and antibiotic treatment with subsequent full recovery . The second report described emphysematous pyelonephritis in a diabetic patient with dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease and also had a history of breast cancer and liver cirrhosis. This patient was managed with antibiotics and a nephrectomy was performed. However, the patient died from sepsis and complications from multiple comorbidities . A third report described pyelonephritis in a female patient with a history of follicular lymphoma of the breast and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was found to have hydronephrosis from a stone in the left distal ureter. She responded to antibiotic therapy and did not require surgical removal of her left kidney .\n\n【9】Our patient had significant underlying risks for developing Lactobacillus bacteremia and pyelonephritis. Her remote history of uterine cancer and subsequent diagnosis of urothelial cancer rendered her immunocompromised. In addition, she had a history of obstructive hydronephrosis with urological manipulation and placement of stent (foreign device) four months prior to her admission. She received antibiotics on a previous admission, conceivably another risk factor for Lactobacillus sepsis. Since Lactobacillus is a normal commensal bacterium of the urinary system, compromise to the integrity of the ureter could have placed her at significant risk for bacteremia and sepsis. The combination of her clinical presentation of sepsis and pyelonephritis, with three blood cultures and one urine culture positive for Lactobacillus acidophilus (and lack of any other growth) was our criteria for diagnosis of Lactobacillus bacteremia rather than contamination of blood cultures from genitourinary flora or transient mucosal tissue-based bacteremia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Lactobacillus bacteremia and pyelonephritis in a patient with a primary urological malignancy.\n\n【10】Lactobacillus species are associated with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and several investigators have reported vancomycin resistance in Lactobacillus . The frequent use of vancomycin in hospitalized patients might explain this pathogenic feature of Lactobacillus in this patient population . Early literature recommends the use of combination therapy with penicillin or another β-lactam agent with an aminoglycoside for synergy . In view of our patient’s severe allergy to penicillin, this approach was not possible. A review of 85 cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia showed that antimicrobial susceptibility is species-dependent . All isolates had low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin and clindamycin. MICs of vancomycin were > 256 µg/mL for all species except Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus acidophilus which tend to have lower MICs . Lactobacilli are variably resistant to the cephalosporins and quinolones, which are therefore not recommended . Most reports recommend combination therapy based on susceptibility results, especially for endocarditis and other deep-seated infections .\n\n【11】Given the unusual and variable sensitivities, susceptibility testing is of utmost clinical importance . Most automated systems do not identify Lactobacillus at a species level . This might jeopardize outcomes due to species specific variations in antibiotic susceptibility. Molecular analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene is an accurate method of species identification . The mechanism of vancomycin resistance is not fully known but might be due to altered peptide sequences leading to weakened vancomycin binding, or antibiotic exclusion from the target sites by the cell wall . Some have also reported the possibility of plasmid-mediated resistance. Mortality varies from 26% to 44% in different reports, but is generally accepted to be due to rapidly fatal underlying or co-morbid conditions rather than the direct virulence of Lactobacillus .\n\n【12】Lactobacillus should be a suspected pathogen in patients with bacteremia due to gram-positive bacilli whose condition does not improve with vancomycin therapy . Currently, there is no gold standard for susceptibility testing of Lactobacillus isolates and no guidelines for interpreting test results . Erythromycin, penicillin, clindamycin, aminoglycosides, and imipenem are considered antibiotics of choice and combination therapy has been noted in most studies . Lactobacillus should be considered as a pathogen when it is isolated (in the appropriate clinical setting) from at least two blood cultures or in one blood culture along with another source of infection, especially when the host has one of the predisposing conditions mentioned above . It must also be appreciated that although direct mortality from Lactobacillus bacteremia might be low, its occurrence might indicate the presence of an ominous underlying condition and thus poor long term prognosis .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The syndrome may also be accompanied by neck stiffness, fever, raise of inflammatory indices, chronic neck pain, spinal cord compression or be asymptomatic . As the plain radiographs are often clear , CT scan is considered as the “cornerstone” for the diagnosis of syndrome , which is usually treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and corticosteroids . We present a case of a 73-year-old patient who was diagnosed with this rare syndrome, after a fall of a height of approximately 2 m and cervical spine injury. We also perform a brief review of the literature to shed light onto this rare clinical entity.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 73-year-old man sustained a cervical spine injury after a fall of approximately 2 m height. The patient was transported to the local hospital, where the clinical examination showed that he suffered from moderate neck pain with slight disturbance of cervical spine mobility. Neurologically, he was diagnosed with incomplete tetraplegia and was found to have 3/5 strength in his upper extremities, 2/5 strength in his lower extremities, normal sensation and reflexes, normal bladder and bowel function. Plain X-rays of the cervical spine could not clarify the cause of the patient’s neurological status . The patient had been operated 12 years before due to larynx cancer and had a tracheal tube since then. He did not suffer from any other significant comorbidities and had not sustained other injuries from his fall. His Glasgow coma scale was 15/15.\n\n【4】He was transferred to a tertiary spine center for further investigation. A CT scan of the cervical spine was performed, which was negative for fracture or dislocation, but, on the other hand, revealed a periodontoid calcification, indicative of CDS . The patient denied any previous symptoms of neck pain, stiffness or neurological compromise. His MRI did not show any damage to the spinal cord or soft tissues. He had no fever but his WBC count and CRP were slightly elevated. Since he was admitted to hospital, course of corticosteroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) was started and he began to improve neurologically. After a few days he was dismissed with the instruction to use a cervical orthosis for 6 weeks and take common analgesics occasionally. At his follow-up, he was completely clear of signs and symptoms, so the cervical orthosis was discarded. Since then, 4 years after his accident, he has not complained for recurrent pain or functional impairment of his cervical spine.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】CDS was first described in 1985 by Bouvet et al, who recognized it as a clinical condition characterized by acute neck pain, accompanied by calcification around the dens of C2, due to the deposition of crystals of hydroxyapatite or calcium pyrophosphate . The syndrome is more common in the elderly, particularly women after the age of 60 . Its clinical presentation includes acute neck pain with concomitant neck stiffness and possibly fever, while the inflammatory markers are often elevated . It may be found in up to 5% of adults over the age of 70 who present to hospital due to neck pain . The syndrome may not often give clinical manifestations, or may cause chronic neck pain or even spinal cord compression . Also, it has been reported that calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition in and around atlantoaxial joint may cause fractures of the odontoid process .\n\n【7】The differential diagnosis of the syndrome includes mainly meningitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, diskitis, tumor, abscess and giant cell arteritis . Interestingly, the majority of patients with CDS have suffered from symptoms of pseudogout in other joints , a fact that supports that most commonly the syndrome is caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease . The etiology of this deposition is unknown, but it seems to be associated with increased levels of pyrophosphate in joints due to increased breakdown of adenosine triphosphate, while also genetic factors (gene ANKH) seem to be involved . However, other authors presented case series in which there is no correlation of CDS and crystal deposition in other joints . In CDS, periodontoid calcification, which is the principal finding in diagnostic imaging, is believed to be caused by deposition of crystals in the fibers of transverse ligament of the atlas . Nevertheless, there have been reported cases where such calcifications are noted in patients with neck pain that suffered from systemic diseases, such as seronegative spondyloarthropathy, systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis . Furthermore, high calcium levels in the blood, as in hemochromatosis and hyperparathyroidism, are thought to predispose to the syndrome .\n\n【8】The gold standard for the diagnosis of the CDS is CT scan , because usually plain radiographs fail to highlight the periodontoid calcifications . The CT findings persist for about 3 months after the relief of symptoms of the syndrome .\n\n【9】The prognosis of CDS is generally considered as good, but in the literature there is lack of long-term studies of the natural history of the disease and is unknown whether the patient experiences neurologic impairment more frequently with the progress of time .\n\n【10】The treatment principally includes the use of NSAIDs and colchicine, which usually leads to a rapid clinical recovery , although in some cases NSAIDs did not cause clinical improvement and, on the other hand, corticosteroids were proven effective . In the literature there are cases where spinal cord compression, atlantoaxial instability and myelopathy due to periodontoid calcium pyrophosphate deposits were treated by cervical decompression .\n\n【11】Our case is characterized by the fact that the patient presented an incomplete quadriplegia after a cervical spine injury, but the only finding after the diagnostic imaging was a periodontoid calcification, indicative of CDS. In the literature, we found only one case report, in which this syndrome led to quadriplegia (after clivus destruction) and the patient sustained a posterior surgical decompression and spinal fusion, without, nevertheless, neurological recovery . Up to date, it is not clear if CDS, which was diagnosed incidentally during the investigation of cervical spine trauma, is associated with the neurological status of the patient.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】CDS is a clinical entity that includes neck pain with possible stiffness, fever and raise of inflammatory markers , but it may also be asymptomatic or accompanied by spinal cord compression . Our patient’s temporary incomplete quadriplegia, not explained by the investigation that was performed, in combination with the incidental finding of CDS, compose an interesting case, characterized by its rarity and difficulty in interpretation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "bfb33291-0fb0-4c3e-acc1-0283d384ca83", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Over the last four decades, advances in the supportive care of immunocompromised patients have contributed to a significant decrease in infection-associated morbidity and mortality . Previously, several clinical studies identified risk factors for anorectal infection in immunocompromised patients . Generally, anorectal infections in immunocompromised patients can be successfully managed with antibiotic therapy and local care alone . Surgery, however, is needed if there is evidence of progressive infection or systemic disturbances, as is the case in patients who exhibit hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy (also known as portosystemic encephalopathy) presents with confusion, altered level of consciousness and coma, usually as a result of liver failure, which may ultimately result in death. Far less commonly, perirectal cellulitis may also cause hepatic encephalopathy as a result of NH3 drainage from the rectal venous plexus to systemic circulation . To our knowledge, however, there has been no report of hepatic encephalopathy caused by an anal fissure in an immunocompromised patient with AML. In this article, we report a case of successful surgical rescue for a patient presenting with hepatic encephalopathy due to an anal fissure in a patient with AML.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 23-year-old woman presented to our hospital complaining of easy fatigability, fever of about 7 day’s duration and anal pain. Physical examination was remarkable for ecchymosis of her arms and legs, and an anal fissure. Hematologic studies showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 107,900/µL, Hemoglobin (HgB) of 11.0 g/dL, Platelet count of 30,000/µL, a protholombin time of (PT sec) 14.5 sec Fibrinogen of 249.0 mg/dL, Fibrin degradation product (FDP) of 28.0 µg/mL. Liver function tests showed total bilirubin, asparate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) levels were of 0.6 mg/dL, 26 IU/L, 42 IU/L, and 22 IU/L respectively . Based on an extremely high WBC count, we suspected new onset leukemia and subsequent bone marrow aspiration was performed. The WBC differential revealed that blasts accounted for 92.4%, consequently acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M1 was diagnosed. In addition, the FLT3/ITD mutation was detected on genetic analysis. Combination chemotherapy with Idarubicin (IDR) and Cytarabin (Ara-C) was immediately initiated and within 4 day’s of admission her WBC count was dramatically reduced to under 500/µL. Blood cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on cefepime (CFPM). Her chest X ray and cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen (C7HRP) were both negative, but she continued to complain of anal pain and discomfort. E. Coli was detected in her blood cultures and the IV antibiotics were changed to meropenem (MEPM) based on the sensitivity results. However, anti-microbial therapy alone was not successful as our patient became increasingly confused and was disoriented to time and place. This corresponded to Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy as described by the West Heaven Criteria . Head computed tomography (CT), chest X ray, and arterial blood gas examinations were unremarkable. Blood examination revealed that NH3 was elevated to 235 µg/dL, AST and ALT levels were 40 and 148 IU/L respectively, and the PT was 16.5 sec, Alb was 3.0 g/dL . We were suspicious that the anal fissure had progressed to perirectal celluliti and was the cause of her hepatic encephalopathy and E. coli bacteremia. The patient then underwent a whole body CT scan which showed did in fact reveal perirectal cellulitis without abscess formation and no other abnormalities . The following day her hepatic encephalopathy worsened to Grade 3 and we decided that the patient need immediate surgical rescue. The patient subsequently underwent a diverting end-sigmoid colostomy, with drainage of the perirectal cellulitis under a general anesthesia. In addition, were peatedly irrigated the rectum with amikacin enemas. Right after surgery, blood tests revealed the highest yet level of NH3 at 325 µg/dL. We continued the amikacin enemas and started lactulose. Soon after surgery the NH3 dropped precipitously and leveled off. At the same time, her level of consciousness improved and she became completely coherent without signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The E. Coli sepsis resolved  with intravenous MEPM 2 g/day for 16-days duration. She has now completed the 4th consolidation chemotherapy and she is currently awaiting bone marrow transplantation.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】A classification of hepatic encephalopathy was introduced at the World Congress of Gastroenterology 1998 in Vienna. According to this classification, hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided in type A, B and C depending on the underlying cause . Those with severe encephalopathy (Grade 3 and 4) are at risk of airway compromise due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. In such situations, transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as an intensive care unit, and airway control is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (for example, aspiration or respiratory failure). The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy depends on the suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C). Generally, hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure or have suffered from various venoocclusive disorders . In most cases, this resolves either spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion, about 5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms . Hepatic encephalopathy sometimes occurs in leukemia patients due to hepatic infiltration classified as type A hepatic encephalopathy . In this case, however, hepatic encephalopathy was classified as a subtype of type B. The patient’s liver function remained almost within normal limits even after AML induction chemotherapy. Her AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were slightly elevated, but soon plateaued at around 40, 150 IU/L, and 1.2 mg/dL respectively, serum Alb somewhat dropped to 3.0 g/dL, andthe PT remained steady at 16.5 sec. Viral panels did not reveal any evidence of HBV, HCV, or HIV infections . CT scan did not show any hepatic infiltration which was also proved on her later clinical course. Although, it remains that elevation of ALT indicated a certain amount of liver dysfunction which seemed to be primarily due to the side effect of chemotherapy, however it is quite hard to consider around 150 IU/L transaminase as the reason of hyperammonemia. We therefore concluded, there were no signs of acute liver failure. It seems that the perirectal cellulitis produced large quantities of NH3 which subsequently entered the systemic circulation via the middle and lower rectal veins and through the rectal venous plexus despite the absence of portal-hypertension. Moreover, without abscess formation the NH3 was shunted systemically as there was nowhere for it to collect or drain . This is what ultimately resulted in our patient’s type B hepatic encephalopathy. Interestingly, according to the previous investigations of anorectal complications in leukemia and other cancer patients, the single most important risk factor for anorectal infection is an absolute neutropenia (defined as less than 500/µL), and the majority of patients who develop perirectal infections have underlying hematological malignancies . These studies illustrate that the majority of anorectal complications can be successfully managed with antibiotic therapy and local care alone. However, about 15%of patients with leukemia and 35% of patients with all cause malignancies require surgical intervention, most commonly secondary to an anorectal abscess. Most of these procedures were simple incision of and drainage of the abscess with only a minority of cases requiring debridement and diverting end-sigmoid colostomy . Generally indications for surgery include extension of cellulitis, increasing pain, the presence of fluctuance, or failure of conservative medical management. In this case, it was important to surgically control the ever-increasing level of NH3 and to treat the worsening perirectal cellulitis thus preventing even further complications. As occlusion of the rectal vasculature does not seem to be a viable option a diverting sigmoid colostomy is the procedure of choice to treat life-threatening hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, it is also essential to use lactulose and amikacin enemas.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】In general, it is of vital importance to understand that in immunocopromised patients even an anal fissure could lead to life-threatening hepatic encephalopathy. Moreover, it is also vital not to hesitate to perform a sigmoid colostomy if medical therapy fails, although the introduction of amikacin enemas and lactulose, all together could be a factor to attribute the clinical improving. As a result of this report we would like to make clinicians more aware of hepatic encephalopathy due to anal fissure as this condition, although rare, is entirely treatable, and when recognized and managed appropriately will lead to improved survival rates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b7248d5e-fefd-4fe5-9302-f2a6043b299c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is aimed to induce multiple follicular growth. Oocyte maturation for IVF cycles is commonly induced by hCG (as surrogate of natural LH surge). Following LH surge, the resumption of meiosis occurs about 18 hours later and achievement of second metaphase occurs within 28 to 38 hours . After ovarian stimulation (and probably due to multifollicular development) some oocytes collected for IVF cycles are arrest at the GV o MI stage at the time of retrieval despite COS and a correct administration of hCG . However, it is unusual to have a complete failure of oocyte maturation after COS, especially in presence of normally growing follicles.\n\n【2】Empty follicle syndrome (EFS) is a condition of uncertain etiology in which no oocytes are retrieved from apparently normally growing ovarian follicles with normal estradiol levels after ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Several hypotheses as to the background of EFS after hCG triggering of final oocyte maturation in gonadotropin stimulated cycles have been summarized elsewhere recently . In genuine EFS, dysfunction of the folliculogenesis seems to be the most plausible etiology .\n\n【3】Since the mid-90s -following the availability of GnRH antagonist for clinical practice- the use of a bolus of GnRH agonist (GnRHa) for final follicular maturation has been explored in many clinical scenarios . Among the advantages suggested for GnRHa as trigger agent are: the induction of a more physiological way of triggering resembling a natural cycle (release of LH and FSH); higher number of oocytes MII collected  and OHSS prevention. More recently, Shapiro et al described the so-called “dual trigger” which involves the triggering of final oocyte maturation using a combination of a GnRHa together with a low-dose hCG for IVF cycles  for OHSS high risk patients under COS.\n\n【4】Levran et al   described 8 cases of oocyte maturation arrest and more recently Beck-Fruchter et al   described EFS treatment including a complete review of the literature. However, our group is not aware of any publication showing both anomalies: oocyte maturation and EFS occurring in the same patient as in the case described herein.\n\n【5】We report a case of primary infertility in which four consecutive IVF attempts yielded immature oocytes or EFS. Finally at a fifth attempt the use of hCGr + GnRHa (dual triggering) for final follicular maturation resulted in a successful live birth.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 37-year-old woman with a 3-year history of primary infertility was referred to our IVF unit for unexplained infertility. She underwent a thorough infertility investigation without any abnormal findings identified. She was in good general health and with no family history of infertility. No history of exposure to any medications for other medical conditions during or prior IVF, she also did not have past exposure to environmental or occupational toxicants and/or excessive X-ray radiation. She had a normal female kariotype (46, XX) and normal levels of day 3 FSH (6 UI/L), LH (3 UI/L) and estradiol (28 pg/mL) levels at first IVF attempt. Her husband’s sperm showed: volume 2.5 mL, count: 16 mill/mL, motility 40%, 20% of normal morphology.\n\n【8】The patient underwent COS according to our routine IVF program. In brief, long GnRH agonist protocol (leuproreline acetate 0.1 mg/day) (Procrin®; Abbott S.A. Madrid, Spain) followed by rFSH 200 - 250 IU/day (Gonal-F®; Merck-Serono Laboratories; A. Madrid, Spain). Ovarian response was monitored by endovaginal scanning and rhCG (Ovitrelle® Serono Laboratories; A. Madrid, Spain) was given when there were at least 2 follicles > 16 mm of maximum diameter. The serum E2 was measured on the day of hCG administration. Oocyte retrieval was scheduled 36 hours after triggering at 1st attempt, while on 2nd to 4th attempts the hCG-oocyte retrieval interval was prolonged to 40 hours. Finally, at 5th attempt, an antagonist flexible multiple dose protocol was used, starting Cetrotide®; (Serono International S.A. Geneva, Switzerland) 0.25 mg/day when the leading follicle was 14 mm in diameter; final follicular maturation was done using Ovitrelle® (Serono Laboratories; A. Madrid, Spain) plus triptoreline 0.2 mg (Decapeptyl®, IPSEN PHARMA S.A. Barcelona, Espana) via abdominal subcutaneous route at the same moment but using different zones for administration and the oocyte pick up scheduled for 36 hours later. While in the initial four attempts there were no oocytes or only MI oocytes collected, at 5th attempt 8 oocytes were retrieved. Assuming an unexplained “oocyte factor” four oocytes were striped of cumulus cells for the ICSI procedure whereas the others were inseminated using conventional IVF. Five good quality embryos  were obtained on day +3 (3 from ICSI and 2 from IVF); 3 embryos (1 from ICSI and 2 from IVF) were transferred under ultrasound guidance. Two surplus embryos were frozen. Luteal support was as usual using micronized progesterone 600 mg/day (Progeffik® EFFIK Laboratories, S.A. Madrid, Spain). The patient conceived and delivered healthy baby (3,700 g) at term by vaginal route.\n\n【9】Stimulation and laboratory finding are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Oocyte maturation arrest is a complex problem not clearly understood; only few cases showing a complete oocyte maturation failure has been reported previously, still the exact incidence remains unknown . Failure to resume meiosis in vivo may arise at one of the following three levels:  absent or incomplete LH surge;  derangements in the signaling mechanisms from the surrounding cumulus cells; and  intrinsic oocyte factor . Specifically, metaphase I arrest is suggested to occur due to (a) when collected, oocytes still did not attain the full competence to mature; (b) this arrest may result from the absence of meiotic recombination, which, under normal conditions, occurs in pachytene stage; and (c) may be in an inability of oocytes to produce the key cell cycle regulating factors . EFS is also a condition of uncertain etiology. The incidence of EFS after hCG triggering in IVF patients has been estimated to be about 2-7% . The so called “genuine EFS” is presumably related to intrinsic ovarian factors and an altered folliculogenesis .\n\n【12】In the natural cycle the responsiveness of the preovulatory follicle to gonadotropins is maximum, especially (but not only) to luteinizing hormone (LH) that triggers granulosa wall dissociation and cumulus expansion as well as oocyte nuclear maturation . Nonetheless, we must remember that the oocyte itself do not respond to FSH and LH exposure  since oocytes lack gonadotrophin receptors ; hence, the stimulation of meiotic resumption by gonadotrophins occurs via their actions on the surrounding somatic cells rather than on the oocyte itself . Finally, we may assume that any failure (possibly at the biochemical level) in the signaling mechanisms controlling the interaction between cumulus cells and the oocyte may cause oocyte maturation arrest or lack of cumulus expansion/granulose cells dissociation, which -at least in animals models- correlates with the outcome of oocyte maturation .\n\n【13】Interestingly, the protocol used in cases previously reporting MI arrest was the long protocol . The same happened in our case, the fourth initial attempts were conducted under the long agonist protocol. At the biochemical level, granulose lutein cells have showed a different pathway modulation of the FHS-induced kinases in agonist versus antagonist cycles ; hence it is logical to assume that the type of protocol may influence intrafollicular environment and oocyte maturation pathways and may contribute in some cases to abnormal oocyte development. However, other findings challenge this hypothesis, for example EFS cases are described in both agonist and antagonist protocols and also when GnRHa are used for triggering . So the influence of the type of protocol to EFS or oocyte maturation arrest remains still inconclusive, but not negligible.\n\n【14】In the natural cycle, the resumption of oocyte meiotic maturation and ovulation process is controlled by the midcycle secretion gonadotrophins by the hypophysis; this pre-ovulatory gonadotrophin surge is thought to be the primary stimulus by which oocyte maturation is reinitiated . In vivo, this surge lasts about 48 hours. In ART a bolus of hCG is commonly used as a surrogate of the midcycle surge LH. There are, however, important differences; the half-life of hCG is much longer (days) than that of the natural cycle (hours); but, and more importantly for this case, the natural midcycle also includes a FSH peak which is known, -among other functions-, to promote nuclear maturation of the oocytes. In a GnRH antagonist cycle a bolus of a GnRHa can be administered, as an alternative to hCG for the induction of an endogenous mid-cycle surge (the flare up effect), consisting of both LH and FSH. It has been demonstrated that is as effective as hCG for inducing a correct final follicular maturation ; moreover the duration of the GnRHa surge, is closer to that of the natural cycle . However, as seen in the majority of IVF cycles this FSH surge is not always needed, as hCG can efficiently act as a surrogate of LH in promoting final follicular maturation. However, we may assume that in some patients, like our case, this FSH surge may promote an adequate resumption of meiosis or optimize the signaling within cumulus cells preventing the occurrence of EFS and also inducing oocyte maturation until MII stage. Clinical evidence of this statements are provided by medical literature, for example some cases of EFS are solved by changing the trigger agent to GnRH agonist , furthermore, the retrieval of more mature oocytes after GnRHa triggering observed in IVF cycles supports a possible beneficial effect of the mid-cycle FSH surge on oocyte maturity .\n\n【15】Optimal levels of hCG for a final follicular maturation are still not defined; in the present case hCG levels were not measured, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility of false or borderline EFS. However, in view of previous bad results after hCG trigger in this patient; we may assume that a GnRHa trigger alone at fifth cycle may have resulted in a adequate oocyte maturation, but, in this case a high response was not expected so we proceed with the dual triggering concept with the knowledge that the introduction of hCG in usual doses will not suppose OHSS risk for this patient, on contrary, the addition of hCG would bring LH activity for luteal support to over count the luteolitic effect seen after GnRHa triggering, strategy that is important for a normalization of pregnancy rates after GnRHa trigger as described recently .\n\n【16】In the present case, it is likely that the reason for both EFS and meiotic arrest lie within the cumulus-oocyte complex. Among the findings supporting this hypothesis are: first of all, the repetitive nature of cycle results, on second place the diagnosis of primary infertility which seems to be a typical profile in this cases as described by Levran et al  (seven out of eight of his cases presented primary infertility); also, cycle development was normal showing good follicular development as well as the observation of normal steroidogenesis the triggering day all of which represent normal LH effects, also the ovarian pick up were reported as ease procedures. This hypothesis is line with previous findings which supports the concept of dysfunctional folliculogenesis as the background of EFS in IVF patients (Castillo et al, 2012). Hence, it is possible to assume that a more physiologic induction of final follicular maturation in terms of gonadotrophin surge duration and/or the addition of natural FSH/LH activity directly from de hypophysis may optimize the signaling mechanisms from the surrounding cumulus and the oocyte, resulting -at least for this case- in adequate oocyte retrieval and maturation.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Although we still do not know the exact pathophysiology of these syndromes, and more research on the physiologic pathways controlling oocyte maturation is needed before the exact mechanisms of the defects interfering with meiotic competence can be determined; the favorable result in the present case gives additional idea for treatment and provides a feasible option to patients with EFS or repetitive immature oocyte syndrome, in the form of a simpler antagonist protocol combined with a more physiologic form of final follicular maturation trough a FSH plus LH surge induced by a bolus of GnRH agonist. Final conclusions should wait for the proof of the approach with more cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Listeriosis can be clinically divided into noninvasive and invasive forms. Invasive listeriosis usually develops in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity , while noninvasive listeriosis is either asymptomatic or presents as acute self-limited febrile gastroenteritis in immunocompromised hosts .\n\n【2】Invasive listeriosis has a wide clinical spectrum. It exhibits central nervous system (CNS)-specific tropism and is associated with high mortality . Meningitis is the most common symptom of CNS listeriosis, while brain abscess is rare . Most cases of Listeria brain abscess occur in patients with underlying hematological malignancies or in those receiving solid organ transplants . To date, only 70 cases of Listeria brain abscess have been reported in the literature .\n\n【3】To the best of our knowledge, Listeria brain abscess in patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis has not been previously reported. Here, we report a case of Listeria brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus in a 61-year-old man with crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital because of intermittent fever, shaking chills, and progressive lethargy since the past 4 days. He had developed bloody stools 4 days before admission owing to consumption of a substantial amount of refrigerated foods several days before disease onset. Two years ago, he had biopsy-proven crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease stage V, requiring hemodialysis. The patient discontinued dialysis after 8 months because his renal function improved with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and maintenance therapy with 20 mg prednisolone/day. Approximately 12 h after arrival, the patient developed shaking chills and high fever (38.7 °C) again. Two sets of blood samples were collected. Initial physical examination was noncontributory. His initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,400/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 93%; lymphocytes, 4%; and monocytes, 3%), low hemoglobin level (8.7 g/dL), and impaired renal function (blood urea nitrogen, 147 mg/dL and creatinine, 5.0 mg/dL). His chest radiograph was unremarkable. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed superficial gastritis with no signs of recent bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy up to 15 cm was normal. The fever subsided after the administration of an antipyretic, and the patient was referred to the Gastroenterology clinic from the emergency department on the same day.\n\n【6】Three days later, he was re-admitted to the emergency department because of fever (38.3 °C), chills, and lethargy. Because L. monocytogenes was isolated from the 2 sets of blood cultures collected during his first visit, ampicillin with renal dose adjustment (2 g every 12 h) plus gentamicin (60 mg every 24 h) were administered parenterally, and the patient was then admitted to the medical ward.\n\n【7】On arrival, his blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature were 183/90 mmHg, 100 beats/min, 20 breaths/min, and 37.8 °C, respectively. His conjunctivae were pale with anicteric sclera. His neck was supple without jugular venous engorgement, bruits, or lymphadenopathy. He had a regular heart rate without murmur. Lung auscultation revealed no wheezing or rales. His abdomen was soft with normal active bowel sounds, while the liver and spleen were not palpable. On neurological examination, he was alert and well oriented. His higher cortical function and cranial nerve and motor system examination were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were equal and plantar reflexes were flexor. Sensory examination and coordination were normal as well.\n\n【8】The next morning, however, our patient went into a coma. Brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe, a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of the occipital horns . Brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus was highly suspected. Urgent external ventricular drainage was recommended by emergent neurosurgery consultation, owing to a rapid decline in the patient’s mental status. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was found to be slightly turbid in appearance and under high pressure during surgery. Ventricular CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis (WBC count, 115 cells/mL) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 78%; lymphocytes, 22%) and red blood cells (622 cells/mL). The CSF protein concentration was elevated (321 mg/dL; reference range 10 - 45 mg/dL), and the CSF glucose concentration was 55 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose level was 204 mg/dL). CSF gram staining and cultures were negative. On day 3 after admission, our patient’s blood pressure dropped and despite management, his condition continued to deteriorate and he eventually died on day 4.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】In retrospect, long-term steroid use in our patient suppressed his cell-mediated immunity and increased his susceptibility to listeriosis . In our patient, the steroids may have masked the symptoms and signs of Listeria , delaying its diagnosis.\n\n【11】L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod that has been recognized as an emerging foodborne pathogen since the 1980s . Its main mode of transmission is contaminated food. After entering the host via the gastrointestinal tract, L. monocytogenes can survive and spread intracellularly without extracellular exposure to humoral immunity . Thus, cell-mediated immunity is the host’s primary defense mechanism against L. monocytogenes infection.\n\n【12】Invasive listeriosis most frequently presents as primary bacteremia, CNS infections, maternal-fetal/neonatal infections, or localized infections . Meningitis is the most common form of CNS listeriosis, while rhombencephalitis  and brain abscess are rarely detected.\n\n【13】Brain abscess occurs in approximately 10% cases of CNS listeriosis . Most cases of Listeria brain abscess occur in patients with underlying hematological malignancies or in those receiving solid organ transplants . Listeria brain abscesses are usually single and located in the frontal and/or parietal lobe. Involvement of the subcortical gray matter has been observed in one-fifth of the affected patients . Listeria brain abscess is associated with positive blood culture in 85% patients and concomitant meningitis in nearly 25% patients . The high rate of positive blood culture suggests that the pathogenesis of Listeria brain abscess is secondary to spread .\n\n【14】Axial non-contrast brain CT of our patient revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe, a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of the occipital horns . The most likely differential diagnoses could be brain abscess with intraventricular rupture, primary or metastatic tumor with subacute or old hemorrhage, and resolving hematoma. Although brain contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive in lesion differentiation, this modality could not be applied to our patient because of his rapid clinical deterioration and severe renal dysfunction. However, the differential diagnoses could be narrowed down based on the clinical course, positive blood cultures, ventricular CSF study, and location of the lesion, making Listeria brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus the most likely diagnosis. Even though gram staining of the CSF and CSF bacterial culture were negative in our patient, Al-Khatti et al diagnosis of Listeria brain abscess, presenting with frontal hypodensity on the initial brain CT scan, in which the pathogen was isolated only from the blood cultures drawn at the time of admission, supports our diagnosis .\n\n【15】Our patient acquired L. monocytogenes probably by consumption of refrigerated foods several days before disease onset, and developed bloody stool. Although diarrhea associated with Listeria gastroenteritis is usually non-bloody, bloody diarrhea has been reported in 3% patients . Listeria gastroenteritis is self-limiting in most cases; however, invasive listeriosis can occur if bacteremia presents. The factors determining the transformation of self-limiting listeriosis to the fatal invasive form include virulence factors produced by the pathogen, number of pathogens ingested, and host immunity .\n\n【16】The incidence of listeriosis in Taiwan remains unknown. Recently, 2 retrospective single-center studies in Taiwan reported that the incidence of listeriosis has increased from 2005 to 2008 . Although the main reason for this increase remains unclear, most affected patients had predisposing factors that lowered their immunity, such as malignancy, renal failure, and type II diabetes mellitus.\n\n【17】The treatment choice for Listeria brain abscess is high-dose ampicillin (2 g every 4 h) for at least 6 - 8 weeks and serial monitoring by MRI or CT . Gentamicin was administered in our case for its synergic effect. For patients allergic to penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice. Third-generation cephalosporins are ineffective against L. monocytogenes. Surgical drainage had been indicated if the abscess is > 2.5 cm or is located in the deep brain matter, and it can facilitate correct identification of the infectious pathogen . Although ventricular drainage with intravenous and/or intrathecal antibiotics are recommended in ruptured brain abscess with hydrocephalus and ventriculitis , no definitive therapeutic regimens for intraventricular rupture of Listeria brain abscess have been reported in the literature.\n\n【18】In conclusion, Listeria brain abscess in patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis is uncommon, and long-term steroid treatment in such patients may increase the risk of opportunistic infections. The prognosis of Listeria brain abscess is poor with intraventricular rupture. Early diagnosis in patients undergoing long-term immunosuppression therapy is challenging. Thus, clinicians should consider the possibility of CNS listeriosis in patients presenting with rapidly progressing CNS manifestations that appear after acute gastrointestinal illness, and should provide adequate antibiotic therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

EGPA is typically characterized by a prodromic history of allergic asthma, sinusitis and nasal polyposis for many years, followed by an eosinophilic phase hallmarked by peripheral eosinophilia and organ involvement, and a vasculitic phase with clinical manifestations due to small-vessel vasculitis .\n\n【2】Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in EGPA is much less frequently reported than peripheral neuropathy in the literature, but it is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality . Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment are mandatory when EGPA is associated with cerebral involvement.\n\n【3】We describe a patient with transient cerebral ischemic attack and delirium heralding the vasculitic phase of EGPA.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 76-year-old Italian woman with a history of asthma, sinusitis, mild renal insufficiency and arthralgias was admitted in Stroke Unit of San Donato Hospital in Arezzo (Tuscany, Italy) with acutely developing aphasia, ataxia and delirium. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 14. She was outside recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment window. The patient was afebrile.\n\n【6】Laboratory data at admission revealed C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.7 mg/dL (normal value (NV) < 0.5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 51 mm/h (NV 2 - 30), fibrinogen 461 mg/dL (NV 150 - 450), creatinine 1.35 mg/dL (NV 0.50 - 1.20) with a glomerular filtration calculated by CKD-EPI was 38 mL/min, and mild proteinuria was 30 mg/dL (NV < 15) in urinalysis. Complete blood count showed a significant increase of eosinophils (11%), with abnormal blood cell count , hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL (NV 11.7 - 16), with normal TSH (1.55 mUI/L, NV 0.20 - 4.20) and complement.\n\n【7】She had some risk factors for stroke: cholesterol 299 mg/dL (NV < 200), with non-HDL 221 mg/dL (NV < 130) and homocysteine 34.2 μmol/L (NV 0 - 15). Moreover, she was treated for hypertension.\n\n【8】In anamnesis 6 months before she underwent rheumatological visit for her symmetrical arthralgias associated with recurrent fever. She was treated with a low corticosteroid dose (8 mg of methylprednisolone) with suspicion of polymyalgia rheumatica. The corticosteroid therapy was effective on arthralgias and fever, and the follow-up was recently interrupted.\n\n【9】Brain computed tomography (CT) at admission showed diffuse cerebrovascular disease and excluded cerebral hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of diffuse small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in basal nuclei and periventricular white matter with no acute focal lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and paranasal maxillary sinuses non-erosive polyposis .\n\n【10】CT-angiography showed bilateral but not critical internal carotid arteries stenosis. The diagnostic approach for ischemic stroke failed to reveal a definite etiology, and she was treated with clopidogrel 75 mg for secondary stroke prevention.\n\n【11】The patients was, therefore, admitted in neurorehabilitation unit, a post-intensive unit of the same hospital, with dysarthria, with moderate cognitive impairment (memory loss, disorientation), and ill-defined but symmetrical pain and weakness in her legs and ataxia, unable to walk. The rheumatologist noted the peculiar facies of the patient that showed a saddle nose acquired deformity, and mild exophthalmos . The patient and her parents confirmed that such deformities were observed progressively after repeated sinusitis, about 10 years before. Moreover, she told that in the past she was also admitted in a pneumologic clinic to treat severe asthma and sinusitis (clinic documentation was unavailable).\n\n【12】The rheumatologist re-evaluated the complete anamnesis of the patient and the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, or relapsing polychondritis was then suspected.\n\n【13】Indirect immuno-fluorescence showed a p-ANCA pattern. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the positivity of myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA) at 17.87 UI/mL (NV < 5). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) resulted negative. Abnormal level of total IgE was also noted 1,355 UI/mL (NV 0 - 100).\n\n【14】The patient underwent laryngoscopy that excluded subglottic narrowing. Echocardiography excluded cardiomyopathy, endomyocarditis, valvular heart disease and pericarditis.\n\n【15】Chest X-ray revealed diffuse and symmetrical interstitial pulmonary disease with a restrictive pattern of functional tests .\n\n【16】An EMG confirmed a mixed motor and sensory axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\n【17】A comprehensive anamnestic and clinical examination permitted to diagnose EGPA on the basis of American College of Rheumatology  criteria . The diagnosis was probable, as the patient fulfilled five of the six criteria at the time of present admission or anamnestic (asthma, eosinophilia > 10%, polyneuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, paranasal sinus abnormality). Furthermore, based on the elevated serum titer of p-ANCA and total IgE and nose chondritis, the patient was diagnosed as having EGPA, although biopsy was not performed.\n\n【18】On the suspicion that the patient had a vasculitic CNS involvement, the patient was given 32 mg of methylprednisolone orally every day, and with gradual tapering. Weakness and pain in both lower extremities improved slowly but continuously, and she became much less confused with 2 weeks of treatment. The patient was discharged after about 1 month on 8 mg methylprednisolone daily. Inflammatory reactant was negative. She was able to walk with mild assistance, without relevant speech or cognitive impairment.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】EGPA is a systemic, small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis that occurs in several organ systems, but it rarely affects the CNS .\n\n【21】Involvement of small intracranial vessels is more likely to result in transient cerebral ischemic attack, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, and CNS involvement of EGPA may cause significant morbidity and mortality . Because of the rarity of CNS involvement, and in particular as first presentation of the vasculitic phase, the suspicion of such rare vasculitis in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease can be challenging .\n\n【22】An Italian long-term follow-up study of 38 patients affected with EGPA did not report case of CNS involvement, and the recent study of the French Vasculitis Study Group cohort reported a 5.2% . CNS involvement in EGPA seems to be more frequent in Asian patients than in Caucasian .\n\n【23】However, the presence of high titer of ANCA hallmarks the vasculitic disease complications, as some large studies demonstrated that ANCA were positive in among 30-40% of EGPA patients and that ANCA-positive patients more frequently had peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis, purpura and CNS involvement (which are due to small-vessel vasculitis) . Thus ANCA should be tested in patients with cerebrovascular disease associated with systemic inflammation or eosinophilia and anamnestic asthma.\n\n【24】The present case illustrates that EGPA is a risk factor for multiple cerebral infarctions and should be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with cerebrovascular disease symptoms, systemic inflammation and asthma with hypereosinophilia.\n\n【25】Early detection of this condition and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy can lead to improved systemic and neurologic function and prevent long-term disability.\n\n【26】In conclusion, CNS involvement of EGPA is very rare, but it may cause significant morbidity and mortality. EGPA should be suspected, and ANCA should be tested in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease associated with systemic inflammation or eosinophilia and anamnestic asthma or sinusitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In patients who present with superficial bleeding such as petechia, purpura, ecchymosis, mucosal and skin hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and thrombocyte functional disorders are among important reasons that predispose to hemorrhage whereas in patients who present with hemorrhage into deep tissue such as muscle, joint and central nervous system, the important reasons that predispose to hemorrhage include von Willebrand disease and other coagulation factors .\n\n【2】Munchausen by proxy syndrome (MBPS: disease by proxy) is a special form of child abuse. It is the case when a disease develops in a child due to the parent or the caregiver. The children are taken to the doctor several times for these symptoms and are subject to unnecessary interventions . In the literature, situations such as recurrent vomiting episodes, apnea attaches, administration of drugs by the caregiver, recurrent hypoglycemia attacks specially after the use of insulin and drug intoxications have been reported . Additionally, cases have also been defined who presented with symptoms including recurrent hematuria, hemoptysis, ear and gastrointestinal system bleeding, who were identified to have no pathologies as a result of many laboratory studies performed to investigate predisposition to bleeding and other etiologies and were diagnosed with MBPS .\n\n【3】To draw attention to this topic, we would like to present an MBPS case of an 8-month-old girl, who presented due to recurrent nose, ear, eye and gastrointestinal system hemorrhages and on whom no pathologies were identified in the laboratory examinations performed.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 8-month-old female patient presented to our hospital due to hemorrhage in ear, nose and stools that had been going on for a few days. She was reported as having intermittent hemorrhages in the nose, ear and eye for 2 months, and blood started to be seen in her stools and vomit; no pathologies were determined as a result of her pathological studies. In her anamnesis, it was seen that she was born in normal term with a weight of 2,750 g and she stayed for 5 days in the incubator. In terms of her family history, there were no particularities other than the history of bleeding in the nose and mouth of her mother during pregnancy. At physical examination, her body weight was 7,600 g (10 - 25 p), height 70 cm (10 - 25 p), head perimeter 43 cm (25 p), fever 36.8 °C, pulse rate 136/min and respiratory rate 24/min. Her general condition was good, she was lively-active and interested in her surroundings. There were coagulums on the outer part of her ear and front part of her nose. The external ear canal and tympanic membrane were normal. There were no active hemorrhages. Similarly, no hemorrhage sites were identified in the inner part of the nose. The eye examination was performed since intermittent bleeding in the eye was described, and the examination result was normal.\n\n【6】In full blood count, the white spheres measured as 10,600/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL, hematocrit 28.9%, MCV 69.2 fL, RDW 16.3%, RBC 4.42 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /µL, platelet 404,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; renal and hepatic function tests had normal results. The platelets were abundant and clustered in the peripheral blood smear test. Prothrombin time was 13 s; activated partial thrombo-plastin time was 29.3 s; fibrinogen was 462 mg/dL. The results of full urinalysis, occult blood in stool and ferritin tests were normal. The bleeding time test result was 4.5 min. Furthermore, it was seen that the results of the collagen-epinephrine test conducted with PFA-100, the collagen-ADP test (104 s and 97 s, respectively), dissolution of coagulum in 5 molar urea and factor-13 antigen level were within normal limits.\n\n【7】It was seen that the symptoms were repeated in the follow-ups and the repeated laboratory tests were persistently normal. MBPS was considered. It was observed that the baby had no symptoms of hemorrhage upon separation from the mother. Therewith, consultation from a psychiatrist was asked for from the parent. During the interview conducted with the parent, it was learned that there was a problem between the mother and the mother-in-law and that was the reason why the mother resorted to this method. Following the psychiatric examination and tests that the mother underwent, signs that supported the MBPS were identified and the mother was scheduled for follow-up. The patient was discharged after being scheduled for control visits at related departments.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Asher diagnosed a group of adult patients, who went from one hospital to another causing several surgical interventions to be performed on themselves with the Munchausen syndromes . For MBPS, it is known that a caregiver of a child voluntarily attributes signs of fabricated or artificial disease to the child. In the most frequently observed type of MBPS, the person who attributes the disease to the child is the mother who has marital problems or psychiatric problems . In the case of our patient, it was learned that the mother had problems with the mother-in-law who was living in the same house; therefore, the mother resorted to this way in order to get away from the house and attract attention.\n\n【10】With MBPS, the child suffers from damage as a result of the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures or the disease triggered by the parent. This disease should be considered in the presence of unexplainable signs in the child and if these signs appear only when the child is with the parent. The aim here is not to harm or punish the child, but to point out to the importance of the parent . Our patient also presented to different health institutions many times with history of repeated, multi-site bleeding and several studies were performed on her. Furthermore, the most important sign supporting the diagnosis was that the bleeding signs disappeared when the mother was drawn away from the child.\n\n【11】Persons who have behavioral problems trigger severe health problems such as causing anemia by collecting blood from themselves or from the person they care for, causing hypoglycemia by injecting insulin, transmitting microorganisms to his/her body via injection, opening the wounds in the surgical site following surgery in order to adopt the role of a patient and to attract attention . Furthermore, presentations in a wide spectrum have been reported including allergic disease, fever, dermatitis artefacta, bacterial infections, osteomyelitis, epilepsy or neurological disorders, gastrointestinal system disorder, renal disease, artiPersons who have behavioral problems trigger severe health problems such as causing anemia by collecting blood from themselves or from the person they care for, causing hypoglycemia by injecting insulin, transmitting microorganisms to his/her body via injection, opening the wounds in the surgical site following surgery in order to adopt the role of a patient and to attract attention . Furthermore, presentations in a wide spectrum have been reported including allergic disease, fever, dermatitis artefacta, bacterial infections, osteomyelitis, epilepsy or neurological disorders, gastrointestinal system disorder, renal disease, artificial bleeding, apnea, cardio-pulmonary arrest and death .\n\n【12】In addition to the above-mentioned clinical symptoms, MBPS cases may also present due to repeated bleeding complaints. The bleeding symptoms that may be seen in these patients may be in the form of hemoptysis, gastrointestinal system bleeding, vaginal hemorrhage, hematuria, bleeding from the eye and ear or easy bruising/ecchymosis . Tufekci et al  identified in their study that there were symptoms of repeated hemoptysis, hematuria, bleeding from the nipple and bloody tear; however, there were no laboratory findings to account for this clinical picture according to all laboratory studies. During the detailed psychiatric examination, the mother was observed to suffer from an Axis I disorder. Tsai et al  demonstrated in their study that the reason for recurrent hematuria could not be found in spite of several laboratory studies in the sisters who were respectively diagnosed with the basal membrane disease and epithelioid angiomyolipoma; however, the tandem DNA analysis conducted on the urine showed that the blood pertained to the mother. In our patient, all the laboratory examination results were normal in spite of the fact that bleeding symptoms were defined in many organs such as eye, ear, nose and gastrointestinal system. It was seen that all the symptoms disappeared after the mother was distanced from the baby.\n\n【13】MBPS is seen relatively frequently; however, it may be overlooked if it is not considered and it may cause many invasive interventions on the baby, and it may even cause the death of the baby in some instances. Therefore, MBPS should definitely be considered in differential diagnosis for children who have strange and unexplainable symptoms. Thus, it would be possible to prevent several unnecessary studies, wrong treatment deliveries and unneeded hospitalizations and to prevent waste of labor, cost and time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Sixteen percent of patients with acute CIDP (A-CIDP) experience rapid deterioration within 8 weeks followed by a chronic course, while 6-16% of treated patients with GBS have one or more deteriorations after initial improvement that is typically described as treatment-related fluctuations (TRFs) . Here we report a case of a 49-year-old male patient with A-CIDP presenting with apparent GBS.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old male was admitted to the hospital on November 1, 2012 for syndrome of weakness in the facial muscles and progressive loss of sensation that began in his upper limbs and progressed distally. One day prior to admission, the patient suffered weakness in his legs, and walked slowly with an unsteady gait. He also presented with slurred speech and dysphagia. According to the patient, he had intermittent diarrhea for a month before the onset of the syndrome.\n\n【4】Physical examination findings and electromyogram (EMG) characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The patient developed mild dyspnea on his second day of admission. On day 3, a lumbar puncture was performed and the results showed increased protein content .\n\n【5】The patient was initially diagnosed with GBS, stage II hypertension (moderate to severe), and viral hepatitis. Owing to financial constraints, the patient could not afford gamma globulin replacement therapy or plasma exchange. He opted for steroid treatment instead. He took methylprednisolone (60 mg orally once daily) for 5 days followed by tapering of the dose by 5 mg every 2 days. The patient was given an intramuscular injection of vitamin B1, B12 and mouse nerve growth factor. His symptoms improved progressively, and the lower limb muscle strength recovered to the point where he could carry heavy loads with a normal gait. The patient’s speech returned to normal, and his dysphagia and dyspnea subsided. The sensation in all his limbs was normal. He had intermittent sensation loss on his back. He was discharged after 8 days, while still taking a daily dose of 50 mg methylprednisolone, 100 mg vitamin B1, and 500 μg methylcobalamin. The dose of methylprednisolone was gradually reduced until cessation by 5 mg every 2 days.\n\n【6】Fourteen weeks after the first episode, the patient drank 10 mL of alcohol. He experienced slurred speech, weakness in his lower limbs, and inability to walk. He was readmitted to the hospital on February 1, 2013.\n\n【7】Physical examination findings and EMG characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . On day 5, the patient underwent lumbar puncture. The results showed increased protein content . Examination for anti-ganglioside antibody spectrum 2 (GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b) was negative (Euroimmun). Based on his clinical features and disease progression, the patient was differentially diagnosed with A-CIDP. He restarted taking 60 mg methylprednisolone daily for 5 days followed by weaning of the dose of methylprednisolone by 5 mg per week. He received an intramuscular injection of vitamin B1, B12 and mouse nerve growth factor. Three weeks after this admission, the patient’s symptoms had improved. His speech was nearly normal. Bilateral peripheral facial palsy had partially recovered without leaking of his breath when he blew his cheeks. He could walk slowly. The patient was discharged from the hospital while still taking methylprednisolone which was gradually tapered until cessation by 5 mg per week.\n\n【8】Eight weeks after the second episode, the patient manifested recurrent symptoms for the third time. He suffered limb weakness and slurred speech. He was able to stand but could not walk, and he had shortness of breath. Two weeks after the recurrent symptoms, he was readmitted to the hospital. Findings for physical examination and lumbar puncture are summarized in Table 1 . The patient was given pulse methylprednisolone treatment. Two weeks after the pulse treatment, the clinical manifestations had improved. His speech returned to normal. He had atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle in both hands. His upper-limb muscle strength was graded 5-, and lower-limb muscle strength was graded 4+. The symptom of hypalgesia had not improved. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after the treatment and he was followed up as an outpatient. One year after his discharge, the patient’s status was updated by a follow-up phone call. According to his description, he was able to perform daily chores and routines, his strength was slightly weaker than normal, and no other abnormality was reported.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Ruts et al  suggested A-CIDP should be suspected when a patient with GBS deteriorates after 9 weeks from the onset or when deterioration occurs three or more times. In this case, the patient’s condition deteriorated over 14 weeks after the first onset and the deterioration occurred three times; hence, he was diagnosed with A-CIDP according to the key diagnostic features described by Ruts et al . In addition, Dionne et al performed a retrospective review on 30 patients with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and 15 patients with A-CIDP and revealed that infectious prodrome was rarely correlated with A-CIDP; patients with A-CIDP were more likely to have prominent sensory signs rather than motor signs. In their studies, 53.3% A-CIDP patients presented with signs of sensory ataxia, impaired vibration perception, and stocking-glove hypalgesia, which was consistent with the symptoms experienced by our patient. Nevertheless, Dionne et al also reported that patients with A-CIDP were less likely to have autonomic dysfunction, facial weakness, or need for mechanical ventilation . Ruts et al performed a prospective longitudinal study on patients with GBS-TRF and with A-CIDP in order to distinguish these two diseases in the early phase of disease. Their results revealed, at all time points, A-CIDP group was less severely affected than GBS-TRF group in level of weakness and severity. A-CIDP patients did not need artificial ventilation, had significantly less cranial nerve dysfunction, and tended to have more CIDP-like electrophysiologic abnormalities. In Rut’s study, only one out of eight A-CIDP patients appeared cranial nerve dysfunction (VII). However, in this case, our patient had facial weakness in the first and second episodes, and mild respiratory muscle weakness in the first and third episodes; hence, our patient was an A-CIDP case different from those cases reported in the previous literatures.\n\n【11】Early recognition of A-CIDP in patients with apparent GBS is clinically difficult, but important because it can lead clinicians to initiate steroid therapy. While A-CIDP requires maintenance therapy after the initial response to steroid treatment, adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy is commonly used to lower the steroid dose, thereby reducing side effects .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

With so many unknown variables involved, it is very unpredictable what further complications are expected, including the management of patients with immunomodulatory treatments and steroids . The difficulty, in this case, increased due to the subsequent bacteremia and fungemia that were caused by rare pathogens. These pathogens are Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Candida dubliniensis . Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE is rapidly emerging around the world with a high case fatality ratio because of the minimal treatment options available . Candida dubliniensis , on the other hand, has also been reported mostly in immunocompromised patients with oropharyngeal infections and rarely in the bloodstream . In this case report, we present a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, and treated with immunomodulatory therapy, including baricitinib and dexamethasone, who was later found to have Candida dubliniensis and Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE in the bloodstream. No other case has been reported so far.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 67-year-old morbidly obese and quadriplegic man who has a very extensive past medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and hepatitis C, who was sent from a skilled nursing facility with respiratory distress, which started about 1 day before admission. On arrival in the emergency room (ER), he had a pulse of 122, respiratory rate of 44, blood pressure of 95/45 mm Hg, temperature of 36.9 °C, and saturating at 78% in room air. On physical exam, his Glasgow coma score was 7, responding only to painful stimuli, he was in severe respiratory distress, using accessory muscles, and had bilateral crackles on auscultation. He was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, and then transferred to the medical ICU. A COVID-19 RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was done, which came back positive, and he was treated with the standard care at the time for COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, vitamin C, and zinc). Two days later, the patient was extubated and placed on a 50% Venturi mask. His evolution was marked by the persistence of hypotension and worsening of respiratory distress with increasing oxygen requirements and worsening imaging exams. Due to the worsening of the respiratory status of the patient and increasing reports on the benefits of dexamethasone and baricitinib, he was given dexamethasone 15 mg intravenously (IV) for 5 days and baricitinib 2 mg for 5 days. On day 17 of admission, 4 days after completion of baricitinib and dexamethasone, the patient became hypotensive, tachycardic with a blood pressure of 91/52, and heart rate of 115 while on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) saturating at 96%. We noticed a marked increase in his white blood cell count from 9.2 to 18.1 k/µL on this day . Blood and urine cultures were done, and he was started on IV fluids and empirical antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\n【4】Blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE . Because meropenem showed an intermediate sensitivity, antibiotics were switched to meropenem/vaborbactam. Subsequent blood cultures still grew Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE on three consecutive cultures drawn on three different days. Seven days after starting meropenem/vaborbactam, the blood cultures became positive to Candida dubliniensis twice on two consecutive blood cultures drawn on two different days. He was then started on IV micafungin 100 mg, which he received for 10 days and then switched to oral fluconazole for 14 days. Meropenem/vaborbactam was discontinued 14 days after the first negative blood culture. His repeat blood cultures and COVID-19 were negative and he was discharged back to his skilled nursing facility.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that affects human cells by spike glycoprotein binding to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) . With over 20,000,000 confirmed cases and 736,000 deaths, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc across the globe. The incubation period of the virus ranges from 3 to 21 days , after which most patients present with either mild non-specific symptoms or severe pneumonia with multiorgan dysfunction .\n\n【7】With the surge of COVID-19 patients in March 2020, New York, the epitome of the disease at that time, also observed a surge in blood cultures . However, this surge of blood cultures showed that those infected with COVID-19 had lower rates of bacteremia. But respiratory co-infections were high and often a significant cause of mortality . Commonly isolated respiratory co-infection organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Hemophilus influenzae . Due to the increased mortality with concomitant bacterial infections with the previous influenza pandemic, a systematic review found about 7% of COVID-19 patients had co-infections and mostly patients in the ICU . Our case had a positive blood culture to a very resistant bacteria called Klebsiella pneumoniae- CRE and Candida dubliniensis , which is the only case associated with COVID-19 reported so far. CRE in particular was labeled an “urgent threat” in the 2013 and 2019 antibiotic resistance threats in the USA reports by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .\n\n【8】Candida dubliniensis is also a very rare organism, mostly found in oropharyngeal infections in immunosuppressed individuals . The presence of this organism in the blood culture of our patient suggests underlying immunosuppression, which needs to be explored. This immunosuppression could be due to the use of baricitinib and dexamethasone in our patient , or it could suggest immunosuppression caused by COVID-19 not yet demonstrated.\n\n【9】With the increasing evidence of the presence of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm and high levels of IL-6 being associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, treatment with immunomodulatory therapies like baricitinib and steroids like dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality . The use of baricitinib in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was proven to cause immunosuppression; the most frequent infection associated with this was herpes zoster . With the use of baricitinib and dexamethasone in combination in the management of COVID-19 patients, they tend to become more immunosuppressed, and therefore, susceptible to many infections.\n\n【10】Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE has a very low sensitivity profile to most antibiotic categories and is very challenging to treat . One drug combination that shows universal coverage against beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including those with extensive drug resistance, is aztreonam and ceftazidime/avibactam . However, our patient had resistance to aztreonam and ceftazidime, which made it even more challenging to treat. Even though it had intermediate sensitivity to meropenem alone, we used it in the combination of meropenem/vaborbactam as the only available choice of treatment. The high case fatality ratio of this organism is due to the very resistant properties.\n\n【11】It is very rare to have fungemia due to Candida dubliniensis without any immunosuppression. This is why, despite the short period of immunomodulatory treatment in our patient, the discovery of Candida dubliniensis in two consecutive blood cultures is most likely because of the relative immunosuppression. For the treatment of Candida dubliniensis , treatment options vary per Infectious Disease Society guidelines. Currently, it is recommended to use echinocandin with fluconazole being an appropriate alternative . However, some reports have shown resistance to fluconazole and must be taken into consideration . Follow-up blood cultures should be taken until a negative result is achieved, and at this point, treatment should subside 2 weeks later. Our patient was treated with micafungin for 10 days, with repeat blood cultures which came back negative, and he was then discharged with an additional 2 weeks of oral fluconazole.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】In this case, we were able to present a patient with multiple comorbidities infected with COVID-19 whom we treated with baricitinib and dexamethasone for 5 days, who developed Klebsiella pneumoniae \\-CRE and Candida dubliniensis in blood cultures. The use of immunomodulators might have caused relative immunosuppression, hence increasing the susceptibility of the patient developing rare bloodstream infections, therefore, increasing the complexity of the management of COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It more frequently metastasizes to the stomach lobular carcinoma than ductal. Symptoms of metastatic gastric cancer are similar to those of primary gastric cancer . The differentiation between these two is essential regarding the treatment options. Therapy for metastatic gastric cancer is mainly systemic with chemotherapy and hormones, whereas surgical intervention is applied in limited occasions , such as gastric perforation. Perforated gastric cancer accounts for less than 1% . Resulting peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that mandates emergency laparotomy. Depending on the findings, surgical procedure varies from single closure with or without omental patch to gastric resection.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 81-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital suffering from epigastric pain and vomiting. From her medical history, she had a palpable mass of the left breast, for which she was aware but it was left untreated for 7 years. Five days before her admission, she had abdominal CT scan negative for free air or fluid collections. After being admitted to the internists for 1 day, she was referred to us for a surgical opinion. Clinical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Conducted CT scan of the chest and the abdomen showed bilateral invasive breast cancer and pneumoperitoneum . The patient underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy which revealed a large perforation of the stomach, 3 - 4 cm in greater diameter, located on the anterior wall of the antrum. In palpation, a solid mass occupying the antrum was noticed. A R1 antrectomy with Billroth II gastrointestinal reconstruction was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen indicated extensive metastatic infiltration of the gastric wall, arising from malignant epithelial neoplasm with morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics compatible with invasive breast cancer (most probably lobular) . In particular, metastatic neoplasm invaded the serosa, muscularis and mucosal membrane of the gastric wall. The surgical margins were infiltrated from metastatic disease. Postoperative recovery lasted 2 weeks due to moderate respiratory complications that were treated successfully. The patient was referred to the oncologists for further treatment. Six months postoperatively, the patient is alive, under chemotherapeutic regimen and oncological consultation. Her general medical condition is good, without needing any reoperation.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The most frequent primary malignant lesion that metastasizes to the stomach is breast cancer, followed by renal cell cancer . Invasive lobular breast cancer is the histological type that spreads to the gastrointestinal tract more often than invasive ductal . Usually, there is a dissemination of the disease at the time of diagnosis of gastric metastasis from breast cancer . Moreover, in cases of perforated gastric cancer, there is peritoneal contamination additionally to the advanced malignancy. Therefore, the poor general condition of the patient is a limitation for curative surgical resection, in form of total or subtotal gastrectomy, which would offer much better prognosis and survival rate of the patient . Unfortunately, gastric resection can be performed in selected cases only. In most cases of gastric perforation from metastatic cancer, simple closure with omental patch is applied, although a high rate of reperforation occurs. In our case, the defect at the stomach was large enough to be closed by simple suture or omental patch. The patient was stable enough and tolerated a quickly performed partial resection of the stomach.\n\n【6】As gastric perforation with resulting peritonitis represents a life-threatening condition that needs immediate surgical intervention, the choice of the best applied procedure should be based on every time patient’s comorbidity and hemodynamic status as well as on surgical findings and expertise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "f686c231-a013-43f1-985d-ca1daba29e94", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have eclipsed warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as venous thromboembolism (VTE) . This is largely due to decrease in the intracranial bleed as well as simplified dosing and perioperative management along with predictable pharmacokinetics with DOACs compared to warfarin . While hemorrhagic complications remain the most common adverse effects, the prevalence of drug reactions in patient on anticoagulants has been estimated to be between 0.01% and 7.5% . As DOACs are increasingly utilized over time, several spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions have become apparent in the recent pharmacovigilence systems. Early recognition of these drug reactions such as drug eruptions, vasculitis and angioedema to DOACs is critical to allow for timely management and treatment of symptoms as well as to prevent more severe adverse events such as limb ischemia, amputation or death . We aim to describe rivaroxaban-induced urticaria and angioedema. In the same patient case, we further report cross- reactivity to dabigatran manifested as significant cutaneous reaction. The institutional review board of SALEM Veterans Health Administration Hospital determined that this case report does not meet the definition of human-subject research or exempt research, therefore review and approval by the IRB or R&D Committee was not required for this activity. Verbal consent was obtained during routine clinical care encounter which was then documented in the medical records along with the use of images provided by the patient in this case report.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 63-year-old African American man with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, aneurysm of iliac artery and prostate cancer presented to the emergency room (ER) with chief complaint of back pain rated as 9 on 10 on pain scale. Patient was being followed by outside oncologist for ongoing radiation therapy since December 2018. Patient also reported experiencing decrease in appetite with some nausea, taste alterations and > 8% weight loss over 2 months. Patient had no known drug or food allergies. Patients’ risk factors for VTE include obesity (body mass index (BMI), about 40.31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), chronic tobacco use, increased age (> 60 years) and driving for long periods of time. Chest computed topography (CT) scan revealed right lower lobe pulmonary embolism with associated opacity and atelectasis. Upon admission, patient’s liver function tests (LFTs) were within normal limits. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed low hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (elevated).\n\n【4】Patient was placed on intravenous heparin drip. Inpatient medications included ondansetron, hydrocodone prn for pain, and ketorolac for muscle relaxation. He also received one dose of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone on day 2 of hospital admission. At this time, patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, thereafter to be continued as 20 mg daily. Patient was discharged on day 11 and consult for pharmacist-led anticoagulation clinic was placed. On day 23, patient called the primary care provider to report that he developed generalized urticaria that appeared every couple of hours. These reactions were intermittent and self-limiting that usually appeared 1 - 2 h after taking rivaroxaban and were not specific to an area of body and moved across different areas of patients’ body. Patient also reported to have swollen hands. Some symptoms such as itching associated with rash were alleviated with the use of diphenhydramine 50 mg 2 - 3 times a day; however, no relief was reported with the swelling in his hands. Patient denied any changes in soap, detergents or intake of new food items. Patient was on low residual diet for recent small bowel obstruction. No new medications were started since the hospitalization other than rivaroxaban. Patient was instructed to continue rivaroxaban at this time along with diphenhydramine for symptom relief by the primary care provider and advised to call in case of worsening symptoms.\n\n【5】On day 25, patient woke up with generalized urticarial with erythema (raised plaques also known as wheals), swollen hands and feet. This quickly progressed to angioedema manifested as shortness of breath, bronchospasm as well as swelling of tongue and face and was immediately taken to ER at nearby hospital. These symptoms were confirmed based on the medical chart documentation by ER physician. The causality assessment is not very accurate due to lack of availability of serum biomarkers/immunoassay tests. Patient was discharged from the ER with prescription for 5 days of prednisone 20 mg. CBC was within normal limits; however, differential count was not checked. LFTs were not available for assessment either.\n\n【6】At the time, the patient was switched to dabigatran 150 mg twice daily as he could not afford to travel 2 h for international normalized ratio (INR) check and refused to take warfarin. On day 36, 10 days after dabigatran initiation, patient called the anticoagulation clinic pharmacist to report that 10 - 15 min after ingestion of dabigatran, he experienced rash with hand swelling. Patient denied swelling of lips, tongue or throat as well as shortness of breath or wheezing. Upon examination by medical provider, patient was confirmed to have developed pruritic morbilliform exanthamas eruptions on his elbows, axillae and lower extremities accompanied by swelling of hands . Patient had repeat LFTs and CBC which were all within normal limits. Laboratory abnormality if present would have been likely shadowed due to prednisone use. Patient continued to use diphenhydramine 2 - 3 times per day that provided some relief with the rash but did not help with the swelling. Patient was seen at the anticoagulation clinic for further management and providing counselling on available anticoagulation therapy options. With the help of social worker, patient was approved to have his labs done at a nearby hospital to avoid commuting long distance for INR monitoring. Patient was provided in depth education and was switched to warfarin with enoxaparin bridge on day 40. Patient’s cutaneous manifestations as well as swelling of extremities resolved 1 week after the drug discontinuation. At day 50, patient’s INR was 3 and enoxaparin was discontinued. Patient has remained stable on warfarin since then and continues to deny any skin reactions or swelling. Patient was assessed against Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale for both rivaroxaban and dabigatran.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Currently 62% of all oral anticoagulants prescribed are DOACs in patient with AF according to one large commercial insurance plan . Anticoagulants-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in the literature . With superior risk-benefit profile and simpler dosing regimen, DOACs are being increasingly utilized over warfarin . Angioedema is characterized by localized rapid swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous or submucosal tissues of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract manifested as swelling of oral cavity, tongue or larynx leading to life-threatening airway obstruction and death . A variety of adverse drug reactions including angioedema (three of the 22,222 DOAC-treated patients) have been reported in the patients taking DOACs in the pivotal randomized clinical trials . Currently there are at least two published case reports that specifically link rivaroxaban with angioedema . According to the monograph, the incidences of cutaneous reactions reported in the clinical trials were: blisters (1.4%) and pruritis (1.8%) . Overall incidence of cutaneous manifestations and anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock associated with factor-XA inhibitors reported is < 0.1% . In one of the case reports of rivaroxaban-induced angioedema, patient experienced generalized urticarial, erythema, severe pruritus and angioedema of orbital area and lips along with shortness of breath an airway obstruction. The drug was promptly discontinued, and patient was managed with supportive oxygen, IV antihistamines and methylprednisolone . In another case report, rivaroxaban-induced hypersensivity syndrome manifested as rash, and hepatic cytolysis was reported along with histopathological evidence of spongiotic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytes and eosinophilic infiltrates. The authors suggest that the causative effect of rivaroxaban can be established with more certainty in this case than other cases . According to the eHeathme database of 137,932 people who experienced side-effects to rivaroxaban, about 88 patients (0.06%) report experiencing angioedema. Patients who are older than 60 years of age, female, who have been taking the drug for less than 1 month, who are on concomitant aspirin and have past medical history of stroke seemed more prone to experiencing angioedema. Of note, the risk of experiencing angioedema is 80% in the first month and is reduced to 0% after 5 years of initiating rivaroxaban . Dabigatran-induced morbilliform exanthamas has been reported as the most common drug reaction. Patients have reported to have isolated or diffuse pruritic, palpable purpura on trunk and limbs which resulted in discontinuation of dabigratran. In both cases, patient was switched to warfarin. The reaction resolved in 5 - 7 days after dabigatran discontinuation. It is pertinent to note that in most of the cases, the drug reaction was not confirmed using serum biomarkers for allergic reactions or skin testing neither were the patients re-challenged .\n\n【9】Our case study provides an advantage over previously published case reports as we not only report rivaroxaban-induced urticarial and angioedema but also the evidence of cross-reactivity to dabigatran. This can provide further information to the clinicians when considering alternative treatment in the patients who develop adverse drug reaction to one of the agents in the drug class. Initially dabigatran was chosen assuming its difference in pharmacodynamics compared to rivaroxaban. It would be useful to see if patients in this scenario can benefit from using apixaban. In our case, since the patient had experienced adverse drug reaction to two out of three available DOACs at our facility, it was decided not to challenge patient with apixaban.\n\n【10】Well-documented case reports are essential component of post marketing safety surveillance; however, they typically suggest a probable reaction based on the Naranjo score and are inadequate for making causal inferences . A recently published cohort case-crossover study by Connolly and colleagues, aimed to quantify the association between DOACs and angioedema relative to warfarin in AF patients who were drawn based on study eligibility from three different databases. This cohort reported 249 incident angioedema events among 267,681 DOAC users and 281,143 warfarin users with an average follow-up of 89 days. The hazard ratio for metanalysis of the results from three different databases comparing any DOAC versus warfarin was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 - 1.2). The odds ratio for association between warfarin and angioedema in the case-crossover design was 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 - 1.21) based on 431 cases. This study did not observe a large relative increase in the angioedema rate comparing DOACs with warfarin. These findings seemed to suggest a much smaller increase in risk as compared to the previously published case reports and the pivotal trials . There have been at least four cases of hypersensitivity reaction case reports published with rivaroxaban, and six case reports associated with dabigatran; however, there were not many reported cases with apixaban until recently . Two patient cases were identified that reported adverse drug reactions associated with apixaban. In one case, patient experience cutaneous adverse drug reaction secondary to apixaban leading to cessation of the medication . In the other case, patient experienced angioedema with significant laryngeal edema without presence of urticaria or pruritis .\n\n【11】With a score of 7 out of possible 13 points on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale  for rivaroxaban and 8 points for dabigatran , causality between rivaroxaban/dabigatran and the observed clinical events are deemed probable in our patient case . We believe that our case report can help highlight the rare adverse drug reactions associated with the DOACs to create vigilance and help with prompt intervention by clinicians.\n\n【12】Implication on clinical practice\n\n【13】Early identification and treatment of these drug reactions is critical in avoiding escalation to morbidity and mortality. Well-documented case reports that provide further clinical evidence and increase awareness amongst the clinicians treating patients with DOACs specially with the rapid increase in its use are important.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】In this report, we have described a case of rivaroxaban-induced urticaria and angioedema manifested by severe pruritic rash, swelling of tongue and face as well as shortness of breath and bronchospasm. We further provide evidence of possible cross-reaction to dabigatran which in our patient manifested as morbilliform exanthamas along with swelling of hands. The pharmacologic mechanism by which DOACs might lead to angioedema is unclear. Further evidence to establish presence or absence of cross-reaction to apixaban may provide useful information in guiding clinical decisions when treating patients on DOACs who provide challenge for warfarin use. Additionally, use of skin patch testing at different concentrations to all factor-Xa inhibitors under direct medical supervision can also be considered given the severity of reaction to the suspected agent. Furthermore, use of immunoglobulin E specific testing may confirm the causal relationship between DOACs and these adverse drug reactions. DOACs are structurally different and the manifestations developed also differ in pathologies. Hence future studies are necessary to explore the implications on clinical practice in patient developing adverse drug events to one of the DOACs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Males are likely to get it but the rate of survival is higher in females. They are more frequently found in Caucasian people than Afro-Americans. Of the patients, 20-25% are metastatic when they are diagnosed and one-third will have a tumoral relapse within 5 years of diagnosis regardless of adequate treatment .\n\n【2】PNETs show a similar histology, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics as Ewing’s sarcomas .\n\n【3】Patients with these tumors have been treated according to protocols designed for rhabdomyosarcomas using vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with ifosfamide and etoposide .\n\n【4】In the literature, the pelvic localization is very rare; 35 cases have been reported by Burgers et al .\n\n【5】In this report, we describe a rare case of a pelvis PNET.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 37-year-old woman was sent in by her gynecologist for an asymptomatic abdominal mass on the right side of the uterus randomly discovered after a non-progressive pregnancy of 8 weeks. Her medical history consisted of a postpartum phlebitis and a miscarriage (G5P3 patient). An abdomino-pelvic scan showed the uterus and bladder pushed horizontally to the right by a heterogeneous mass presenting both liquid and solid appearance with arch-like calcifications. The tumoral size is of 10 cm. The pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an egg-like shape taking up the right side of the pelvis, with polycyclic outlines and a very heterogeneous matrix. There was no modification with a gadolinium injection. A coelioscopy was performed to take histological material. The pathological diagnosis of PNETs was made based on the presence of a tumoral proliferation composed of small round or spindle-shaped cells with a small amount of cytoplasma. We observed also a fibro-vascular tumoral stroma and any tumoral necrosis. The immunohistochemical (all antibodies and revelation system were those of Dako <sup>® </sup> ) cell phenotype was positive for CD99 and vimentin and negative for CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, protein S100, desmin, CD3, CD20, estrogenic or progesterone receptors and alpha inhibin. The proliferation marker Ki-67 was very high at 80%.\n\n【8】Molecular biology using fluorescence in situ hybridization was positive for translocation t(11;12)(q24;q12) (EWSR1 22q12 break (Kreatech <sup>® </sup> )).\n\n【9】Any metastasis was revealed by positron emission tomography (PET) or classical radiology (chest X-ray).\n\n【10】Biologically, the liver and renal functions were normal and NSE was elevated (96.3 ng/mL).\n\n【11】The patient was treated by a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE) protocol for six cycles. After two and four cycles, the PET scan showed a considerable reduction in size (4.8 cm) and in metabolic intensity of the tumoral mass. We saw stability after six cycles. The patient then had surgery (increased colpohysterectomy but incomplete resection due to the mass infiltrating the near totality of the psoas muscle). The tumor continued growing. The patient became symptomatic 2 months later with diffuse abdominal pains. Two adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatments by vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide (VAI) were then undertaken with worse clinical and hematological tolerances. After palliative care, the patient died 1 month later.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】PNETs are a group of rare tumors. Their annual incidence is 2.9 per million population .\n\n【14】Stout first described PNET in 1918 .\n\n【15】Their understanding has significantly advanced over the last 25 years. They have a wide distribution of primary tumors sites, related to their supposed neural origin .\n\n【16】On microscopy, they appear as a monotonous collection of small round, darkly stained cells leading to the differential diagnosis with a rhabdomyosarcoma and a neuroblastoma. Fortunately, PNETs are characterized by a certain number of specific translocations of the EWS gene which is found on the chromosome 22 classifying these tumors in the PNET family/Ewing sarcoma. Over added molecular anomalies often occur during the progression of the illness such as the p53 or the p16 mutations .\n\n【17】Because of their large size, their numerous distant metastases, their poor radiosensitivity and their incomplete surgical resection, pelvic PNETs often show a pejorative prognosis. Burgers et al described 35 cases (15 boys and 20 girls aged between 3 and 31 years). Twenty-four of these patients showed any metastasis in time of the primary diagnosis. All were treated by chemotherapy associated for 31 with radiotherapy. Moreover, four patients had surgery. Five patients developed metastasis (pulmonary and skeletal). The pulmonary metastases were operated on followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy. Patients treated only by radiotherapy showed intra-thoracic relapses. Skeletal metastases were developed in cases treated by radiotherapy first and chemotherapy.\n\n【18】The difference of the 5-year survival without progression between patients without and with metastasis was 19% and 40%, respectively .\n\n【19】Polychemotherapy and surgery were the basis of the treatment of PNETs. Polychemotherapy uses five drug approaches: vincristine, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and doxorubicin. Complete surgical excision reduces drastically the risk of local relapse but does not prevent metastatic spread .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Survival of patients with PNETs on a single location has considerably increased with the arrival of modern chemotherapies as the target therapy but also with new surgical techniques by coelioscopy. Prognosis for patients who already have a diffuse illness or who have no response of the initial treatment remains worse.\n\n【22】A better comprehension of signals may be a future path in the treatment of these rare tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The prevalence of EA is about 1 in 50,000 to 200,000 with no gender predilection and it accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart disease . It is estimated that approximately 5% of the patients survive beyond the age of 50 years .\n\n【2】The clinical presentation varies widely from asymptomatic to severe symptoms according to the degree anatomic variation and heart failure. Severe disease leads to fetal or neonatal death . Mild forms are often undiagnosed until adulthood due to its benign course and survival has been reported until the ninth decade .\n\n【3】We present the case of a patient in whom this rare congenital heart malformation was only diagnosed in adulthood in the context of the investigation of recurrent acute stroke manifestations. Discussion of the problems associated with this disease and its treatment is supported by an up-to-date literature review.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old man presented to the Emergency Room at our hospital complaining of sudden episodes of right-sided hemiparesis and hemi-hypoesthesia lasting less than 30 minutes and occurring three times within the last 24 hours. Additionally he reported increasing exertional dyspnea in the past few months.\n\n【6】He was a former intravenous drug user and had a 24 pack-year smoking history. Besides methadone maintenance treatment, he was not taking any other medications. He had a “heart murmur” and “respiratory problems” known since childhood without further investigation. At the age of 43 he was admitted in another hospital due to stroke and discharged from the ward with a left side hemiparesis from which he fully recovered. No clinical data was available from that admission. His family history was negative for congenital heart disorders.\n\n【7】At the Emergency Department, his neurological examination was unremarkable. He had a blood pressure of 164/110 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. A grade 3/6 holosystolic heart murmur was heard at the left sternal border; he had a positive jugular venous distension (5 cm), no lung rales or peripheral oedemas, and liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin with an estimated span of 10 cm. He had no cyanosis, clubbing or any other signs of respiratory failure.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray suggested a right-sided heart enlargement and lung congestion . Laboratorial results showed an elevated BNP value (539.3 pg/mL; normal value < 100 pg/mL) and a mild cholestatic pattern of liver dysfunction. The biomarkers of myocardial ischemia, lipid profile, homocysteine levels and the autoimmunity panel were normal and screening tests for syphilis, HIV, HBV and HCV were negative.\n\n【9】The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with right atrial abnormality, QS pattern in DIII and aVF, and poor R-wave progression on pre-cordial leads.\n\n【10】Computed tomography scan of the brain showed multiple ischemic lesions and moderate atrophy of the brain and cerebellum .\n\n【11】The patient was admitted into the Stroke Unit for further investigation and treatment.\n\n【12】A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severe right atrial aneurismatic dilatation and abnormal asymmetric tricuspid valve with an apical implantation of the septal leaflet (8.1 cm/m <sup>2 </sup> ), with a sail-like structure and severe dilation of the annulus, with dysplastic and redundant leaflets, aneurismatic wall of the interatrial septum with a radium of 10 -11 mm, with abnormal septal movement; pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 44 (24 +20) mmHg, resulting in severe right heart failure; passage of agitated saline contrast from right to left chambers suggested an interatrial communication . Additionally, a two-dimensional colour-Doppler transesophageal echocardiogram unveiled a 2 mm interatrial communication, with a discrete right-to-left shunt, during systole and early diastole, at the anterosuperior portion of the septum .\n\n【13】These echocardiographic findings were compatible with Ebstein’s abnormality and raised the hypothesis of a paradoxical embolic event due to the evidence of an interatrial communication. Doppler ultrasonographic study ofcarotid, vertebral, transcranial, and extremities vessels was unremarkable.\n\n【14】The patient was treated with warfarin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. After clinical stabilization he was submitted to a complex heart surgical treatment that involved ventricule plasty of the heart and reconstruction of the triscuspide valve.\n\n【15】The post-operative course was favorable. One year later, the patient presented mild exertional dyspnea with no additional complaints. Echocardiogram revaluation showed mild tricuspid insufficiency, with no stenosis of the valve ring, with mild compromise of the right ventricle function, and a left ejection fraction of 65%.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Ebstein’s anomaly is a malformation of the right heart characterized by an apical displacement of both the septal and the posterior tricuspid leaflets, exceeding 20 mm or 8 mm/m <sup>2 </sup> in adults . As a consequence, the right heart may be divided in three components including the true right atrium, the functional right ventricle (RV) and an intervening zone that is anatomically ventricular but functionally right atrial (atrialized RV)  The thin wall of the atrialized RV may result in an aneurysm between the anatomic tricuspid annulus and the apically displaced posterior leaflet . Almost eighty percent of the EA patients have an interatrial communication and various additional cardiac abnormalities are often present .\n\n【18】The cause of EA is not well understood. The occurrence of families with EA suggests the possibility of defects in genes contributing to malformations of the tricuspid valve and it is thought to implicate a multifactorial genetic trait  Others have proposed the EA gene might be located in the chromosome 9 . Nongenetic causes such as intrauterine lithium exposure and intrauterine infections have been pointed out .\n\n【19】The clinical presentation depends on the age at presentation, anatomic severity, hemodynamics, and degree of right-to-left interatrial shunting, if present . The most commons symptoms in adults are exercise intolerance (dyspnea and fatigue) and symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmias. Patients with mild apical displacement and normal function of the tricuspid valve may remain asymptomatic and survive to the ninth decade has been reported . However, patients may die or become symptomatic at any age. At the extreme of marked tricuspid leaflet displacement, severe regurgitation, elevated right atrial pressures, and significant right-to-left interatrial shunting through an interatrial communication may develop and manifest as right-sided heart failure . Palpitations secondary to atrial tachyarrhythmia are present in 20 to 30% of cases due to the dilated right atrium, the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or a concealed bypass tract . Paradoxical embolism or brain abscess are important death causal factors, mainly in patients older than 50 years.\n\n【20】Doppler echocardiography is the method of choice for the diagnosis of EA and associated heart defects and stratification of the degree of anatomic and functional defects . Echocardiographic measurement of the ratio of the combined area of the right atrium and atrialized right ventricle to that of the functional right ventricle and left heart in a four-chamber view at end-diastole has been used for classification into four different grades with increasing severity . Our patient had a grade 3 EA. Right-to-left shunting of blood through defects of the interatrial septum are best visualized by color flow imaging or agitated saline contrast. Echocardiography has largely obviated cardiac catheterization. Cine MRI may also be helpful in providing a better assessment of both right and left ventricular size and function when echocardiography images are limited and to address areas of delayed myocardial enhancement after administration of contrast agents . These areas suggest scarring or fibrosis and can occur in myocardial infarction and in a variety of other disorders, such as inflammatory or infectious diseases of the myocardium, cardiomyopathies, cardiac neoplasms, congenital or genetic cardiac conditions, as well as after cardiac interventions .\n\n【21】Recurrent transient ischemic attacks may be caused by embolic processes in approximately 25% of the ischemic strokes . Paradoxical embolus is a rarely diagnosed cause of arterial ischemia and is considered the major cause of cerebral ischemic events in young patients . It is usually described in association with a patent foramen ovale in the context of cryptogenic strokes . Due to the frequent presence of an interatrial communication (atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale ) patients with EA are at risk of paradoxical embolization, cerebral ischemic attacks, brain abscesses and sudden death . The embolus can originate in veins of the lower extremities, in pelvic veins, in an atrial septal aneurysm, or from a clot around the edges of a patent foramen ovale . However in many cases the embolic source in not identified, such as in our patient.\n\n【22】Indications for heart surgery have included symptoms, deteriorating exercise capacity, New York Heart Association functional class III or IV heart failure, cyanosis, paradoxical embolism, progressive cardiac enlargement, severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and atrial of ventricular arrhythmias. Observation has been recommended for asymptomatic patients with low normal exercise tolerance, no right-to-left shunting, and only mild cardiomegaly . Operative repair usually includes tricuspid valve reconstruction with plication of the atrialized portion of the right ventricle (and correction of co-existing congenital septum defects or aneurism), utilizing tricuspid valvuloplasty or replacement .\n\n【23】Patients with EA should only be repaired by surgeons with an interest in and experience with congenital heart disease, ideally with specific experience in this operation. Every effort should be made to preserve the native tricuspid valve . Since each heart with EA is different according to the anatomical variability, numerous techniques of repair have been described . Recent surgical techniques developments may extend classical surgical indications to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients in order to prevent complications such as arrhythmia and ventricular dysfunction .\n\n【24】In conclusion, the presented case underlines the possible late presentation of Ebstein’s anomaly in adulthood as recurrent brain ischemic attacks. Ebstein’s anomaly can remain undiagnosed until adulthood if the right ventricle is hemodynamically well functioning. Stroke may occur due to paradoxical embolism by an interatrial communication. Heart surgical treatments usually considered when patients become symptomatic. However, recent surgical techniques may allow an efficient “preventive surgical treatment” in asymptomatic patients at an earlier stage of this heart malformation.\n\n【25】Consent\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\n\n【27】Abbreviations\n\n【28】EA: Ebstein’s anomaly; IAC: interatrial communication; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8b526da5-e68a-4d80-a203-dc74f65be6bc", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】6p25 is a rare, yet clinically identifiable disorder that results from the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 6. The breakpoints may be at various loci along the sixth chromosome including 6p22.2, 6p23, 6p24.2, and 6p25.1 . Deletions can be categorized as terminal (breakpoints within the 6p24-pter region) or interstitial (breakpoints within the 6p22ep24 region) with varying phenotypes resulting depending on the site of breakage and deletion . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis has helped to confirm the location of the deletion with terminal deletions being more common than interstitial deletions or complex rearrangements .\n\n【2】Commonly associated defects with the interstitial deletions include a short neck, hand abnormalities, structural eye abnormalities, central nervous system (CNS), renal, and cardiac defects while common defects with the terminal deletions may involve ocular involvement of the anterior chamber of the eye (bilateral hyperopia), iris dysplasia, hypoplastic irides, megalocornea, sclerocornea, as well as other end organs resulting in hearing loss, cardiac malformations, hypertelorism, mid-face hypoplasia, and low set ears . Developmental delay has been described in all cases.\n\n【3】CNS involvement may include cystic spaces within the periventricular white matter, white matter abnormalities, Dandy-Walker variant, hydrocephalus, cerebellar and posterior fossa malformations including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and enlargement of the cisterna magna, and agenesis of the corpus callosum . Given the multiple congenital anomalies in various organ systems, anesthetic care may be required during surgical correction or palliation. We present a 4-year-old girl with a sub-telomeric 6p25.3>6p24.3 deletion who required anesthetic care for placement of growing rods to treat progressive scoliosis. The literature involving these patients was reviewed, end-organ involvement was discussed, and options for anesthetic care were presented.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of a single case report. The patient was a 4-year-old 14.5 kg young girl who presented for growing rod placement for early onset scoliosis of the thoracolumbar region. Her past medical history was significant for sub-telomeric deletion of 6p25 with the specific deleted region being 6p25.3>6p24.3. Birth history included a term birth via cesarean section at an outside hospital. Birth weight was 3,210 g with APGAR scores of 8 and 9. During the immediate neonatal period, a low oxygen saturation (80-82%) was noted with the need for supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula as well as a loud murmur on auscultation. She was transferred to our institution for evaluation of hypoxemia, a heart murmur, and abnormal facies. Echocardiogram revealed tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Chromosomal analysis obtained due to the dysmorphic facies revealed the chromosomal deletion syndrome. Additional past medical history included bilateral sensorineural hearing loss for which she was fitted with hearing aids as well as the need for speech and language delay. Her past surgical history was significant for TOF repair at 4 months of age with ventricular septal defect closure, transannular patch, partial pulmonary valvectomy, infundibular resection, and patent foramen ovale closure. Additionally, bilateral ear tube insertion and auditory brainstem response had been performed previously. She was not currently on any home medications and had no known allergies. Preoperative physical examination revealed a young girl in no acute distress with dysmorphic facial features and scoliosis. Airway examination was normal except for a Mallampati grade 3 view. Preoperative laboratory evaluation including electrolytes, renal function, coagulation function, blood glucose and hepatic function was normal. The patient was held nil per os for 8 h for solids and 2 h for liquids prior to surgery and was transported to the operating room where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. Anesthetic induction was performed with the inhalation of incremental concentrations of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty and rocuronium (0.5 mg/kg) administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade, revealing a Cormack-Lehane grade I view. A 4.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed on the first attempt and the cuff slowly inflated to seal the airway at a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 20 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. Two peripheral venous cannulas and an arterial cannula were placed. Per our usual practice to allow for neurophysiological monitoring during spinal surgery, anesthesia was maintained with desflurane titrated to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) at 50 - 60 and a sufentanil infusion of 0.1 - 0.3 µg/kg/h to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 55 - 70 mm Hg . Baseline neurophysiological monitoring including motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) was obtained. The patient was turned and positioned prone for posterior spinal fusion with Magec <sup>® </sup> rods from T3-L2 with a total surgical time of 148 min. Hemodynamic status during the surgical procedure was unremarkable without hypotension or clinically significant changes in heart rate. Intraoperative fluids included 430 mL of Normosol <sup>® </sup> and 100 mL of 5% albumin. No allogeneic blood products were administered. The estimated blood loss was 30 mL. During wound closure, the sufentanil infusion was discontinued. Following completion of the surgical procedure, the patient was turned supine and her trachea was extubated when awake. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and then admitted to the inpatient surgical ward. Postoperative pain control was provided with hydromorphone (0.1 mg per dose) delivered via nurse-controlled analgesia (NCA) as well as intravenous acetaminophen and ketorolac. The remainder of her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged home on postoperative day 4.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】As with other chromosomal abnormalities, deletion of the short arm of chromosome (6p25 deletion) results in a specific pattern of end-organ involvement and anatomical malformations which may require surgical intervention. To date, there are no previous reports regarding the potential anesthetic concerns during the perioperative management of these children. As with the anesthetic care of all patients, the focus of effective perioperative care begins with the preoperative examination and the identification of end-organ involvement related to the chromosomal abnormality.\n\n【8】Given the associated potential for craniofacial involvement including midface hypoplasia, the primary concern for anesthesia providers is the potential for difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation . Preoperative airway examination revealed a Mallampati grade 3 airway. Although we were able to successfully accomplish endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy without difficulty, the ability to accomplish adequate bag-valve mask ventilation should be demonstrated prior to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Additionally, the appropriate equipment for dealing with a difficult airway should be readily available including equipment for indirect laryngoscopy .\n\n【9】Given the potential for associated congenital heart disease, as was noted in our patient, preoperative echocardiography is suggested to evaluate the anatomy, assess myocardial function, the quality of the surgical repair, and the presence of residual shunts or gradients. Reported CNS malformations include Dandy-Walker variant, hydrocephalus, cystic spaces within the periventricular white matter, white matter abnormalities, cerebellar and posterior fossa malformations including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, enlargement of the cisterna magna, and agenesis of the corpus callosum . Preoperative neuroimaging may be indicated and should be guided by the clinical history and physical examination. Associated visual and hearing impairment compounded by developmental delay may impact communication during the perioperative period.\n\n【10】SSEPs and MEPs, used in intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord function, further impact anesthetic management . MEPs are more sensitive to the choice of anesthetic agents than SSEPs . Anesthetic agents both inhaled and intravenous can depress SSEP and MEP with impairment of signal attainment. The effect of the inhaled agent has been shown to be greater than intravenous agents . Per our usual routine, we use 0.5 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of the volatile anesthetic agent, desflurane, supplemented with a benzodiazepine (midazolam) as needed to ensure amnesia with the potent opioid, sufentanil, to provide analgesia and control the hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation. This combination allows for rapid awakening should there be changes in the MEP or SSEP monitoring .\n\n【11】Scoliosis may also impact respiratory function, predisposing these patients to perioperative respiratory insufficiency and failure. The goal of surgical intervention is to prevent progression of the scoliosis and its effects on long-term respiratory function . The reduction in lung volumes and the presence of ventilation/perfusion mismatch can be seen in patients when the Cobb angle (lateral curvature) exceeds 65°. Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy may develop in severe cases (Cobb angle > 100°) . Following scoliosis surgery, including patients with idiopathic scoliosis without co-morbid conditions, there is a 40% decrease in vital capacity during the postoperative period . Postoperative respiratory dysfunction may be greater in patients with associated co-morbid conditions involving the CNS, cardiac and respiratory systems, leading to the need for prolonged respiratory support. These issues can be lessened by preoperative optimization of pulmonary function and the use of non-invasive ventilatory support . Although needed for the control of pain, postoperative opioid administration may impact central control of ventilation and further compromise perioperative respiratory function. Adjunctive agents (acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) may decrease opioid requirements and their associated adverse effects. In our patient, postoperative analgesia was provided by nurse-controlled analgesia using hydromorphone and the use of adjunctive agents (intravenous acetaminophen and ketorolac).\n\n【12】In summary, we present a patient with 6p25 deletion, a recognized chromosomal deletion syndrome, characterized by a specific spectrum of congenital abnormalities. No previous publication has reviewed the anesthetic implications of this disorder. Specific perioperative co-morbid concerns include craniofacial involvement which may impact airway management, associated CHD, and CNS involvement. These concerns may be magnified as was the case in our patient by the specific surgical procedure involved. In our patient, who was scheduled for placement of growing rods to treat scoliosis, additional concerns included anesthetic management to maximize MEP and SSEP monitoring as well as the impact of scoliosis and the surgical procedure on postoperative respiratory function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

No case reports are found in the literature documenting hypoglycemic encephalopathy caused by rapid-acting insulin overdose. Here, we report a case of hypoglycemic encephalopathy caused by insulin aspart (NovoRapid <sup>® </sup> ) overdose during a suicide attempt.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 41-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus had been receiving insulin for 9 years. His additional past medical history was notable for depression for which he had been treated with antidepressant agents. He presented to our emergency center 3 h after attempting suicide by insulin overdose. He injected 600 units of insulin aspart, cut off his left fifth finger, and had subsequently eaten high-carbohydrate foods. On arrival, vital signs were within normal range. He was awake, alert, and without any focal deficits. Blood glucose was 40 mg/dl. The laboratory data revealed leukocytes of 12,480/mm <sup>3 </sup> and serum potassium of 2.9 mEq/l. Other laboratory results were not remarkable. Head CT was not remarkable. First, he was administered a bolus of 40 ml intravenous 50% dextrose. A continuous infusion of 10% dextrose was required to maintain the blood glucose concentration between 100 and 200 mg/dl. Supplemental dextrose was needed for glucose values < 80 mg/dl and he required intermittent bolus therapy during the first 15 h . He received a total glucose load of 230 g during these 15 h. His left fifth finger was amputated and a psychiatrist was consulted to evaluate his psychiatric problem; anti-anxiety drugs were prescribed. The patient was deemed medically stable and was discharged on day 14.\n\n【4】Three weeks later, he was found in a deep coma by family. On arrival, he was comatose. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 166/120 mmHg, temperature 37.5 degrees Celsius, and pulse 110/minute. Blood glucose was 19mg/dl. The laboratory data revealed leukocytes of 21,670/mm <sup>3 </sup> and serum creatine phosphokinase of 4315 IU/l. Careful history taking revealed that he had injected 900 units of insulin aspart in a suicide attempt approximately 8 h before being found. Head CT revealed low density areas throughout the cerebral cortex and partial cerebral edema. He was given an intravenous bolus of 40 ml 50% dextrose and a continuous infusion of 50% dextrose was started at a rate of 25 g/h during the first 4 h period after admission. Over the next 18 h, he received a dextrose infusion at 10 g/h . He received a total glucose load of 270 g in the first 22 h. He was given intravenous infusion of 400 ml isosorbide every day for cerebral edema, but his level of consciousness never improved. Head CT examination on day 9 revealed worsening findings throughout the cerebral cortex. Unfortunately, he fell into an apallic syndrome. He was transferred to a local hospital on day 49.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Our case is unique in that the clinical outcome differed between the first insulin aspart overdose and the second insulin aspart overdose. Rapid-acting insulin (insulin aspart) exists in solution as a monomer, which allows a higher rate of absorption from the subcutaneous sites of injection. Longer-acting insulin is formulated as multimers, which, after subcutaneous injection, will slow down the absorptive process and the postprandial peak . Due to the nature of these different molecular forms, a patient who sustains a rapid-acting insulin overdose may develop hypoglycemia in a much shorter time period than with a longer-acting insulin overdose. Our case arrived at the emergency center after having eaten high-carbohydrate foods shortly after the first overdose. Similar to our report, there is a case report in which the patient had taken a meal after insulin overdose, and was conscious upon arrival to the emergency facility . Therefore, a patient who sustains a rapid-acting insulin overdose can quickly develop hypoglycemia and it is important to recognize this early on. Hypoglycemia may be prevented if the overdose patient has liberal access to high-carbohydrate foods.\n\n【7】In our case, hypoglycemia persisted at least 15 h after subcutaneous injection. Previous reports have suggested that the duration of hypoglycemia appears to depend on the amount of insulin administered . Brvar et al. reported that intermittent hypoglycemia requiring treatment with 50% glucose was recorded three times during the 11 h after insulin overdose . There are also reports of cases who injected two kinds of insulin. In one instance, a patient who injected 300 U of insulin glargine and 200 U of insulin aspart was unable to maintain blood glucose concentration normally for 5 days in spite of dextrose infusion . Fromont et al. reported a case who had injected with 300 U of insulin glargine and 300 U of insulin aspart. The patient developed relapse of hypoglycemia until 30 h after injection . In addition, Mork et al. reported a case who had injected with 800 U of insulin lispro and 3800 U of insulin glargine. In spite of a continuous dextrose infusion, hypoglycemia persisted for 52 h after injection . The mechanism of this prolonged hypoglycemia with slower release of insulin from subcutaneous tissue remains unclear. The huge volume of insulin solution may reduce local blood flow due to compression of tissue at the injection site ; others have suggested a ‘depot’ effect with the actual insulin absorption diminishing due to an increase in the injection site .\n\n【8】No case reports are found in the literature documenting hypoglycemic encephalopathy by rapid-acting insulin overdose. There are previous reports of cases with rapid-acting insulin overdose that arrived at the emergency facility within 4 hours after injection and a case that arrived more than 4 hours after injection that had been given high-carbohydrate drinks and foods. In our case, hypoglycemic encephalopathy occurred at only the second overdose. He rapidly developed hypoglycemia, and fell into hypoglycemic encephalopathy presumably because of the delay in receiving proper therapy. We consider that insulin aspart overdose may predispose to the development of hypoglycemic encephalopathy more readily than overdose with long-acting insulin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "252271d6-10d9-4a92-a4af-6501b9a3d136", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare progressive demyelinating and life-threatening infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by JC virus (JCV) infection . Depletion of lymphocytes and impaired CNS immune surveillance are thought to be predisposing factors. Natalizumab (NTZ) treatment is associated with an increased risk of PML, though the exact pathogenic mechanisms are still not fully understood. PML should be diagnosed as early as possible but this may sometime be difficult as the clinical presentation of PML is often similar to a multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse. Diagnosis is based on a combined analysis of clinical course, brain MRI scans, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for JCV.\n\n【2】NTZ treatment should be suspended immediately on suspicion of PML and their clearance can be accelerated by plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy , though re-establishment of CNS immunosurveillance is often associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), characterized by inflammatory changes on MRI. Information on the immune cells and mediators involved in PML is patchy. We describe the sequential clinical and radiological features of PML from onset in an NTZ-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patient and provide data on CSF JCV copies and immune cell counts in CSF and peripheral blood (PB). The study was conducted at the Neurology Department of the Gregorio Maranon University Hospital (Madrid) and approved by the local ethics committee.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report a 47-year-old man with a 20-year history of RRMS on NTZ after failure to control disease activity with interferon beta and glatiramer acetate therapy. While on NTZ treatment (300 mg every 4 weeks for 27 months), he had remained free of disease activity (no clinical relapses and no new T2 or Gd <sup>+ </sup> \\-enhancing T1 lesions) and the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was stable at 4.5. He was evaluated due to worsening of cerebellar and pyramidal symptoms affecting both lower limbs and left hand apraxia in the previous month (EDSS, 5.5). A cranial MRI scan was consistent with PML  and he was seropositive for JCV. The CSF (January17, 2012) revealed 75 copies/mL of JCV. pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were predominant in CSF with respect to PB , and the IgG index was 0.75 (normal ≤ 0.7). NTZ was discontinued and the patient received six PLEX sessions followed by IV-IgG 0.4 g/kg/day for 4 days.\n\n【5】After 6 weeks, lower limb kinetic tremor and left partial motor seizures were observed. The MRI lesions worsened . In CSF analysis, 475 JCV copies/mL and IgG index of 0.56 were found. A marked CSF increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and decreased CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs compared with PB (February 24, 2012) were found.\n\n【6】MRI after 15 weeks showed worsening of the previous findings .\n\n【7】After 4 months, the patient presented a new spinal cord relapse at T8 level. Increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> , CD19 <sup>+ </sup> , and pDCs persisted in CSF compared with PB , and the IgG index increased to 3.96.\n\n【8】Eight months after onset of PML, pyramidal signs, gait ignition failure, severe proximal intention tremor in lower limbs movements, left hand apraxia, and sensory loss from T8 were present. The MRI-PML lesions  were suggestive of neuronal and axonal damage because of inflammatory PML lesions. All immune cell counts remained high in CSF with respect to PB  and no JCV copies were found; the IgG index was 4.16.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】On withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX, the only Gd <sup>+ </sup> lesions on cranial MRI were the PML lesions compatible with an inflammatory form of PML (PML-IRIS). Simultaneously, higher percentages of mature CD86 <sup>+ </sup> pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and lower percentages of CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were in CSF with respect to PB. This finding was consistent with the described perturbance of memory and lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CNS could facilitate marginal zone-like B-cell homing in secondary lymphoid organs during NTZ treatment of JCV infection . Lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs depletion have been reported in a histopathological study of NTZ-PML patients . The influx of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CSF after withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX coincided with control of JCV, providing evidence for the potential role of these cells in specific JCV responses. The CSF increase of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells known to be the main effector cells in viral infection could be implicated in the control of dissemination of JCV . Autopsy of a patient of PML-IRIS showed that the inflammatory infiltrate was composed predominantly of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells in both parenchyma and perivascular cuffs, with fewer CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, which were confined to perivascular cuffs. These findings are in line with the first CSF, in which lower CSF JCV load and increased of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs was found.\n\n【11】Dendritic cells are central to the initiation and regulation of immune responses. In MS, circulating pDCs show reduced production of IL-6 and IL-10 in response to herpes simplex virus type I, and also functional impairment of dendritic cells during NTZ was observed implying that their response to viral exposure could be impaired in MS .\n\n【12】The posterior non-active PML-MRI lesions, undetectable JC viral load, and increased CSF IgG index suggest that plasma cells, the source of intrathecally produced IgG, including JCV-specific IgG, could contribute to resolution of PML, while lower CSF percentages of CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cell in some MS patients could predispose to development of PML.\n\n【13】PML lesions affect not only oligodendrocytes but also neurons . Consequently, as in our patient, the possible infection of cortical pyramidal neurons in the left frontal lobules at the grey-white matter junction could increase neuronal excitability, leading to focal seizure. The clinical sequelae probably resulted from neuronal and axonal destruction by the JCV and/or by inflammatory factors in the PML lesions, as observed in the last cranial MRI .\n\n【14】In conclusion, our case report illustrates that CSF-specific immune cells changes were present at the time of PML infection and during resolution. Furthermore, the MRI findings suggested that highly aggressive inflammatory PML lesions led to severe clinical deterioration as suggested by cortical neuronal and pontocerebellar axonal lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "714a3fde-60ad-4f93-bf78-b22071bcbab5", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by the inflammation and ulceration of the colon mucosa. Aminosalicylates are the first line medication for UC among which sulfasalazine is a most effective drug for the induction of UC remission as well as for the maintenance of remission. Although the sulfasalazine therapy is associated with side effects, including bone marrow suppression , its long-term use is evident from the follow-up studies . Therapies for UC may also include one or more modalities among steroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, nicotine, heparin, probiotics, and short-chain fatty acids, and curative surgery which may become necessary for patients unresponsive to aminosalicylates or develop steroid dependency .\n\n【2】There are several reports of one or more aspects of sulfasalazine-associated bone marrow suppression such as pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytosis, agranulocytosis, erythroid hypoplasia and bone marrow necrosis in UC patients. Pertinent of these cases are; a fatal case of sulfasalazine-associated agranulocytosis of a 39 years old man ; a 22 years old Caribbean man with UC who was being treated with 3 g/day sulfasalazine daily exhibited bone marrow necrosis in biopsies within 4 - 5 weeks of treatment and discontinuity of sulfasalazine led to his complete recovery ; a 26 years old man with slow acetylator phenotype, who had been treated with sulfasalazine (2 g/day) for three years, developed extensive oral ulceration upon increasing dose to 4 g/day. Among the pathologies, bone marrow examination showed severe hematopoietic megaloblastic changes. The patient recovered upon a strategic administration of folinic acid, hydroxycobalamin and folic acid following sulfasalazine discontinuation ; a 79 years old woman developed sulfasalazine-associated agranulocytosis seven weeks after treatment and recovered upon sulfasalazine discontinuation ; a 32 years old Korean man after two years of sulfasalazine treatment for UC control developed pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow ; and a 52 years old Korean woman with cytomegalovirus infection developed hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow .\n\n【3】In this article, a case of a female patient who developed signs of bone marrow suppression associated with sulfasalazine treatment has been presented.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A Saudi girl (age: 18 years old, body weight: 70 kg, height: 165 cm) was diagnosed as UC in July 2012 based on clinical presentation (gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and so on) and colonoscopy which was subsequently confirmed by the specialized healthcare expertise of the institution. She was prescribed azathioprine 50 mg, b.i.d. sulfasalazine 1 g, t.i.d. p.o. and prednisolone (50 mg for the first 30 days, 40 mg for the next 30 days, 30 mg for the next 30 days, 25 mg for the next 30 days and then tapered down to discontinue over a 2-week period). During the treatment period, the patient sustained low grade fever with coughing and was treated with augmentin 1g, b.i.d. for seven days. Because of a persistent fever, the patient was examined two months after the start of treatment and the laboratory tests identified hematological perturbations. The patient was hospitalized and received blood/platelet transfusions. All medications were stopped except sulfasalazine. The patient was discharged within 10 days of hospitalization with better hematological picture .\n\n【6】In mid-November, the patient who was re-admitted exhibited poor hematology, which did not improve further in the next 10 days. At this stage, all ongoing medication, including sulfasalazine, was discontinued except prednisolone (20 mg/day for the next 30 days). In the following days, hematological indicators of the patients were improved and attained even better level with the passage time. At this stage, sulfasalazine was restarted at a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. However, within a month, hematological indicators declined drastically, which led to discontinuation of sulfasalazine re-treatment . The patient was not re-challenged with sulfasalazine and by the time of last follow-up, she was UC asymptomatic and was being managed with non-medical treatments.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Generally, the immunomodulators are associated with several side effects, and sulfasalazine intolerance is also not too rare. Sulfasalazine associated pancytopenia observed in the case reported herein may underlie bone marrow suppression based on the similarity in symptoms and hematological indicators presented in the cases reviewed above  and other cases such as one pancytopenia case in a 23 years old patient with Crohn’s disease . Although bone marrow biopsy examinations could not be performed, on the basis of coincidence of changes in the hematological profile of the patient with changes in medication, and in the light of previous reports of strong association of pancytopenia with bone marrow cytopathology, it is reasonable to assume the case presented herein as an incidence of bone marrow suppression.\n\n【9】When administered orally, 25% of sulfasalazine is absorbed in the small intestine and most of it reaches the colon where bacterial activity metabolizes it into two metabolites: 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine. 5-aminosalicylic acid is not absorbed from the colon and manifests its therapeutic effects on the inflammatory mucosa while the sulfapyridine is absorbed from colon mucosa and is also excreted in the urine and therefore has restricted effectiveness . For this sake, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfasalazine can be suitable alternatives and both have shown comparable efficacies in a randomized trial . However, 5-aminosalicylic acid-induced pancytopenia suggestive of bone marrow suppression has also been reported .\n\n【10】Since there can be several mechanisms of bone marrow suppression such as immune reactions, infections and drug toxicity. It is recommended that sulfasalazine should be discontinued upon unexplained fever, chills, sore throat, malaise, or other nonspecific illness earlier in the treatment . Some authors have also suggested liver function tests at this stage in order to explore any possibility of immune reaction .\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Sulfasalazine associated pancytopenia observed in the case reported herein is speculated as bone marrow suppression incidence by taking inferential support from previously reported cases in which pancytopenia is strongly associated with bone marrow suppression. It is suggested that symptomatic changes and laboratory profiles of the patients treated with sulfasalazine should be monitored during the first few months of treatment upon increasing dosage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are mainly found in stomach (60%) and small intestine (30%) , and constitute 0.1% of all tumors with rectal origin .\n\n【2】The treatment of choice for resectable rectal GIST is the complete resection, which is the most effective treatment, with the lowest risk of recurrence . The aim is to do the lesion excision (R0 resection), without violating the lesion itself. In the low rectum, there must be taken account the proximity of the anal sphincters, with risks of complications like anal incontinence or sexual or urological dysfunction in more extensive resections .\n\n【3】We report a case of an 81-year-old female with a rectal GIST.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 81-year-old female was brought to the Emergency Department of our hospital, due to recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding, without constitutional complaints. On rectal examination, it was identified an ulcerated rectal mass, on the anterior wall of the rectum. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed an ulcerated, hard and friable tumor located on the anterior surface of the distal rectum . The biopsy revealed a high-grade GIST. The patient was subjected to a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a tumorous formation in the rectum, with no densification of the fat of the ischiorectal space or pelvic lymphadenopathy . The pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results showed a 5.1 × 3.1 cm mass in the rectovaginal space with origin in the anterior wall of the rectum, 2.9 cm from the anal verge with presumably non-epithelial origin and no apparent local invasion .\n\n【6】The patient underwent transvaginal resection of the lesion. The wall closure was made by layers (rectal mucosa, vaginal musculature and vaginal mucosa) .\n\n【7】The immediate postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the sixth postoperative day.\n\n【8】The results of histological examination revealed a rectal GIST, with high risk of biological behavior, 18 mitosis/5 mm <sup>2 </sup> , and positive for CD34, Dog-1 and c-Kit. The proliferative index (assessed with Ki67) was around 60-70%.\n\n【9】On multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was proposed to adjunctive therapy with imatinib.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】GIST represents 80% of mesenchymal tumors. They are relatively rare, constituting 1-3% of all malignant gastrointestinal tumors . The organs most often affected are the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%). The other locations are duodenum (5%), colon and rectum (5%) and esophagus and appendix (< 1%). Rarely, they can be found in extra-luminous locations such as mesentery, omentum and retroperitoneum (< 5%) . Rectal GISTs are more predominant in males and are more frequent between the fifth and seventh decade of life .\n\n【12】This type of tumor originates in interstitial cells of Cajal, located in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal wall, which act as gastrointestinal motility regulators . Approximately 10-30% are clinically malignant; however, all of them have some potential degree of malignancy .\n\n【13】GISTs are associated with two mutations: the mutation of the c-kit proto-oncogene (responsible for the expression of the CD117 protein, a receptor for the tyrosine kinase growth factor) and the mutation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) gene. These mutations are present in 80-85% of patients (75-80% c-kit and 10-15% PDGFRA ). The GISTs that do not have these mutations are classified as “wild type”, this one with better prognosis .\n\n【14】Most patients are asymptomatic. In rectum, although rare, obstruction or hemorrhage may be present.\n\n【15】The diagnosis follows the principles of diagnosis of any rectal mass, using imaging exams (endoscopy, CT scan and pelvic MRI scan) and biopsy.\n\n【16】Usually, the GIST is endoscopically characterized as a bulging of the wall, with normal mucosa or eventual mucosal ulceration, with solid consistency .\n\n【17】The diagnosis includes CT scan with intravenous contrast, in order to identify distant metastatic disease. Locally they present as a well-circumscribed region of contrast, with heterogeneous enhancement, particularly if it is a large GIST with necro-hemorrhagic areas or degenerative components .\n\n【18】Pelvic MRI scan allows locoregional staging. The lesions are usually described as well-defined solid masses, and some of them may have central necrosis, presenting with a diffuse hyposignal at T1 and hypersignal at T2. Post-contrast gain is homogeneous in the solid region, forming a ring around central necrosis.\n\n【19】Signs of malignancy include ulceration, irregular margins and increased dimensions on follow-up exams .\n\n【20】Biopsy is particularly important in the characterization of the tumor, namely in the differential diagnosis with rectal adenocarcinoma (in the case of ulcerated GIST), whose management are different. The final diagnosis is established according to the specific histological and immunohistochemical characteristics (CD117, CD34, actin, desmin, S-100 and Ki67). Sometimes, the biopsy is not conclusive since it is a neoplasm originated in the deeper layers of the rectum, which, if not biopsied, there is no representative sample.\n\n【21】The standard treatment of non-metastatic GIST involves complete resection of the tumor, with free margins, without rupture of the capsule . In the case of rectal GIST, the purpose of surgery, in addition to local tumor resection, is when possible, the sphincters preservation. The spread does not usually involve regional ganglion metastases, so regional lymphadenectomy is unnecessary .\n\n【22】There are several surgical techniques described, from conventional transanal resection (Parks), trans-sacral approach (Kraske), transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS), laparoscopic and laparotomic surgery (anterior resection of the rectum, abdominal-perineal amputation) . The method of choice is decided according to the characteristics of the tumor (size, extent, location) and according to the surgeon’s preferences.\n\n【23】The resection of tumors of the anterior wall of the rectum is technically more difficult. The transvaginal approach is a possible method for local tumor excision when located in the rectovaginal region . It is an alternative to a low or ultralow anterior resection surgery, which has a higher risk of complications. Transvaginal resection is a valid approach due to the large volume of the vagina, which is enough to support the resection.\n\n【24】In our case, enucleation without fragmentation of the piece was not possible. However, the entire lesion was macroscopically resected, and that constitutes one of the most important factors for the prognosis.\n\n【25】In large tumors and in those that have a high risk of metastases, preoperative treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib is recommended to decrease tumor volume, improve intact resection with negative margins, sphincter preservation and increase disease-free survival . Several studies have shown that neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib improved R0 resection rates and decreased the risk of postoperative morbidity . However, in the case of our patient, the tumor was symptomatic, requiring a primary surgical approach.\n\n【26】The worst prognostic factors for GIST are tumor size, mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses/50 high-power fields (a total area of 5 mm <sup>2 </sup> ), non-gastric location, male gender and pseudo-capsule rupture .\n\n【27】Adjuvant therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor is strongly recommended in high-risk patients to reduce the risk of recurrence .\n\n【28】The biology of our patient’s tumor, with a high risk of biological behavior (18 mitosis/5 mm <sup>2 </sup> and a proliferative index around 60-70% (Ki-67)), demanded adjuvant therapy .\n\n【29】Recurrence can develop 10 - 15 years after primary treatment, so clinical follow-up must be done over the long term .\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】Rectal GISTs are uncommon and the treatment involves local excision of the lesion, without regional lymphadenectomy. Transvaginal resection is an acceptable procedure in tumors located in the rectovaginal region, with protrusion in the posterior wall of the vagina. This method allows not only the excision of the tumor, but also prevents iatrogenic damage to the anal sphincters and their clinical consequences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

LCH usually involves the gingiva, lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa. However, it is obscure to many rhinologists, because the nasal cavity is a relatively rare location for this lesion. The most common symptoms are epistaxis and nasal obstruction. The treatment of choice is endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) even for large lesion. We discussed the differences between the cases in terms of management processes and results.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】A 29-year-old female was referred by her obstetrician immediately after childbirth. She has a large exophytic mass in her right nasal cavity. She also reported a two-month history of progressive nasal obstruction and intermittent epistaxis which had been requied multiple nasal packing. Nasal endoscopic examination revealed a large smooth-surfaced hemorrhagic polypoidal mass totally occluding the right nasal cavity. The mass was soft, mobile, nonpulsatile, and nontender. The surface of the lesion was friable, and manipulation elicited active bleeding. The postnasal space was clear and rest of the head and neck examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Incisional biopsy was not performed due to probablility of significant hemorrhage. Computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses (PNS CT) demonstrated a 3 × 5 cm sized soft tissue opacity lesion with intense enhancement occupying the entire right nasal cavity . The lesion was well circumscribed without any evidence of bony destruction or periostial new bone formation. She wanted prompt excision without observation or medication because of long standing disturbing symtoms. Thereupon, under general anesthesia, she underwent endoscopic exploration of the right nasal cavity with preparations for possible lateral rhinotomy for the excision of this tumor. The operation was begun with debulking of tumoral tissue that had not involved the nasal mucosa by soft tissue shaver. This allows better visualization, provides enough space for determination of the original site. The mass was found to be originating from the posterior portion of the right inferior turbinate. Despite significant bleeding, under the endoscopic guidance complete excision of the mass was perfectly done due to the excellent exposure of the lesion, provided by the magnified telescopic view and suction and bipolar cautery to ensure hemostasis. The surgery involved partial resection of the inferior turbinate to remove a cuff of normal appearing tissue. The operation was finished without requirement of perioperative blood transfusion. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and there was no recurrence in the following year.\n\n【5】In histopathological examination, multiple polypoid fragments of angiomatous tissue protruding above the surrounding mucosa were seen. The mass was covered with pseudostratified ciliated epithelium showing focal squamous metaplasia and ulceration below which can be seen profound inflammation in the connective tissue. The submucosal lamina propria contained lobular proliferated capillaries with lumina of varying sizes surrounded by an edematous fibromixoid stroma . There was no evidence of mitotic activity or malignancy. These histopathological findings were consistent with a LCH.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】A 47-year-old male presented with complaints of having had epistaxis and nasal obstruction for the past 3 months. Physical examination revealed reddish hemorrhagic polypoid mass near totally obstructing the left nasal cavity. PNS CT revealed a soft tissue opacity lesion with intense enhancement occupying the entire left nasal cavity without any evidence of bony . Any punch biopsy specimen could not be obtained due to significant bleeding even by needle stick for local anesthesia at the mass. Excision of the mass was done under general anaesthesia using an EES technique, following superselective embolization the day before surgery . At operation field, the shrinked nasal mass by embolization was found. The mass was extirpated by two pieces of 1.7 × 0.7 cm sized masses . The histopathologic findings were consistent with a LCH .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】LCH, a benign, rapidly growing tumorous condition or benign capillary proliferation affects skin and mucous membranes. Occurrence of LCH in human was first originally described in 1897 by Poncet and Dor, who named this lesion botryomycosis hominis . LCH has been referred to by a variety of other names such as PG, granuloma gravidarum, pregnancy tumor, hemangiomatous granuloma, granuloma telangiectacticum, granuloma pediculatum benignum, benign vascular tumor, and Crocker and Hartzell's disease . However, some researchers believe that Hartzell in 1904 introduced the term “PG” that is widely used in the literature, although, it is a misnomer because clear histologic and microbiologic features indicating an infectious origin are lacking. In addition, the term “granuloma” would allude to the presence of granulation tissue in the lesion, which is not typical of a LCH. Mills suggested that the accurate, descriptive term for PG is LCH because it emphasizes the essential component of the lesion, namely, a circumscribed aggregate of capillaries arranged in one or more lobules . Nevertheless, PG is still the more popular terminology .\n\n【10】The peak prevalence is in teenagers and young adults, with a female predilection of 2:1 . Most authors list the gingiva, lips, tongue, buccal mucosa and palate as the most commonly involved locations. LCH rarely involves nasal cavity (LCHNC) which most commonly manifests as progressive nasal obstruction and epistaxis. The first case of LCHNC was described in 1940 . The precise mechanism for the development of LCH is unknown. Traumas (habitual nose picking, nasal packing) and hormonal influences (pregnancy, oral contraceptives) have been suspected to act in the pathogenesis .\n\n【11】LCHNC is rarely discovered as an incidental finding, since epistaxis and nasal obstruction will soon bring the patient to a physician. LCHNC may rarely present as a mass of considerable size and thus entirely fill the nasal cavity; such lesions have been termed as giant LCH . Nasal examination reveals a fragile and usually pedunculate, pink-red mass which has irregular borders . Significant bleeding occurs after biopsy because of the vascular structure of the mass .\n\n【12】On PNS CT, LCHNC appears as a non-specific unilateral mass of soft tissue density . Some rare cases of bony erosion due to compression have been described . Angiography typically shows increased vascularity in the area of the tumor.\n\n【13】Histologically, the LCHNC lesion consists of 2 areas: a lobular and a superficial ulcerative area. The lobular area is characterized by capillary proliferation with a microscopically distinct lobular architecture. The superficial portion of the lesion may undergo secondary nonspecific changes, including stromal edema, capillary dilation, inflammation, and a granulation tissue reaction.\n\n【14】The diagnosis may be delayed because of the overlapping of the symptoms with chronic sinusitis. Furthermore, these tumors can be difficult to distinguish from a malignant lesion due to their rapidity of growth and presentation with epistaxis. A differential diagnosis of a hypervascular mass of the nasal cavity in patients with nasal obstruction and epistaxis might include a diverse range of congenital, inflammatory and neoplastic processes, among which are; polyps, rhinosporidiosis, sarcoid, Wegener’s granulomatosis, meningoencephalocoele, glioma, cavernous hemangioma, cherry angioma, hemangiopericytoma, histiocytoma, leiomyoma, osteoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, angiosarcoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and hypervascular metastases, particularly from kidney, thyroid, lung, or breast. In children, there is always the possibility of a foreign body.\n\n【15】Common treatments for LCH are curettage, cryotherapy, and excision. Excision of the entire lesion has been the treatment of choice. Promising results have been reported for various new treatments, such as laser therapy and sclerosing agents . The EES provides better visualization of the mass and surrounding anatomy, thus allowing the surgeon to remove the mass completely without an external incision. The recurrence rate after excision is approximately 15% . Recurrence is usually due to incomplete excision . No malignant transformations have been reported .\n\n【16】To summarize the lesson from two cases; 1) LCH would be more appropriate term to remind clinician characteristics of the hemangioma. PG might wrongfully remind unexperienced doctor granulation not hemangioma which needed preoperative embolization; 2) Preoperative embolization is highly recommended. Embolization cannot only decrease the amount of bleeding but also decrease the size of mass; 3) The EES is recommended for even giant LCHNC. The EES can provide excellent exposure of the lesion and achieve the good cosmetic results.\n\n【17】In conclusion, giant LCH is a rare lesion of unknown etiology. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly enlarging vascular lesions within the nasal cavity. THE EES is the appropriate treatment even for extremely large lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The majority of reported cases were encountered in the immediate postpartum period . A non-puerperal inversion occurs when the uterus acts to expel a submucous lesion attached to the fundus, such as uterine fibroid, endometrial carcinoma, sarcoma or polyp .\n\n【2】We report a case of spontaneous postmenopausal uterine inversion without underlying pathology.\n\n【3】The diagnosis of non-puerperal uterine inversion is often difficult and requires a high index of suspicion.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 67-year-old woman, para 8 +0, all by normal vaginal deliveries, presented with a 2-day history of lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine. This was associated with a mass protruding from the vagina and offensive vaginal discharge. She had no bowel symptoms.\n\n【6】On examination, her vital signs were normal. Abdominal examination revealed a tender palpable suprapubic mass midway between the pubic symphysis and umbilicus. Pelvic examination showed an infected fleshy, friable mass that was protruding through the introitus past the hymen with foul smelling discharge on its surface; there was no active bleeding. The acute retention was relieved with immediate urethral catheterization and 2,000 mL of urine was drained.\n\n【7】Her complete blood count, serum electrolytes and kidney function test were all within normal limits; urine analysis suggested a urinary tract infection.\n\n【8】The patient was admitted and started on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics and perineal care. Examination under anesthesia showed the mass to be continuous with the cervix which could not be well delineated on palpation. On rectal examination, neither the uterus nor the mass could be felt. A biopsy was taken from the mass revealing endometrial tissue with no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【9】Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a U-shaped uterine cavity with thickened and inverted uterine fundus on sagittal and coronal sections .\n\n【10】Based on the mentioned clinical and imaging findings, non-puerperal uterine inversion with super infection was strongly suspected, and the decision for hysterectomy was made and discussed with the patient.\n\n【11】A laparotomy was carried out, the round and utero-ovarian ligaments and part of the urinary bladder were dragged into a cup-shaped depression . The constricting ring was too tight, therefore, after identifying both ureters the uterus was repositioned using the Haultain procedure followed by abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . The histopathological report revealed no abnormality to which the uterine inversion could be attributed.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Uterine inversion is defined as a decent of the uterine fundus to or through the cervix, so that the uterus is turned inside out .\n\n【14】It can be acute or chronic. Acute inversion causes severe pain and hemorrhage, and almost always is a consequence of a delivery; whereas chronic inversion is insidious and characterized by pelvic pain, bleeding, anemia and urinary dysfunction, including urine retention, as in this case, resulting from anatomical distortion causing bladder neck obstruction .\n\n【15】The diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion. Finding a mass coming through the cervix without definite cervical margins, absence of the uterine fundus or fundal dimpling during bimanual or rectal examinations suggest the diagnosis. The openings of the Fallopian tubes may be identified if it had been dragged through the endometrial surface. The diagnosis is easier with complete uterine inversion when a fleshy mass protrudes from the vulva with a constricting ring of the cervix superiorly .\n\n【16】Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan and MRI can help in the diagnosis of uterine inversion. The suggestive features on ultrasound include Y shape fundal indentation and depressed longitudinal groove extending from the uterus to the center of the inverted portion .\n\n【17】MRI is the best radiological modality not only for the correct diagnosis, but also clearly defines the lesion and its relation to neighbouring structures . The features of the standard pelvic MRI protocol with T2-weighted scans will include U-shaped uterine cavity, thickened and inverted uterine fundus on sagittal section and bull’s eye configuration on an axial image .\n\n【18】In most cases, treatment is guided by whether the condition is acute or chronic, stage of inversion, the reproductive wish of the patient and the cause of the inversion (benign or malignant).\n\n【19】In stage 1, inversion is intrauterine (incomplete) and the fundus remains within the cavity; stage 2, complete inversion of the uterine fundus through the fibromuscular cervix; stage 3 total inversion where the fundus protrudes through the vulva; stage 4, the vagina is also involved within total inversion .\n\n【20】Surgical repositioning or hysterectomy could be done through either abdominal or vaginal approach.\n\n【21】Spinelli and Kustner are transvaginal surgical repositioning techniques with the basic difference being that Spinelli’s approach is anterior and requires dissection of the bladder and an anterior uterine wall incision; while Kustner’s is a posterior approach which involves entering the space of Douglas vaginally and splitting the posterior aspect of the uterus and the cervix, which makes it a bit easier and safer .\n\n【22】Surgical repositioning can also be done through a laparotomy using the Huntington procedure, which involves a gentle upward traction of the round ligaments of the uterus after dilating the cervical ring digitally until the uterus is reinverted .\n\n【23】The operation in this case is consistent with the Haultain procedure, which uses an abdominal approach in which a vertical incision in the posterior portion of the constricting cervical ring is made with traction on the round ligaments until the uterus is reinverted to its normal anatomy. This was followed by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】This case shows that chronic uterine inversion could occur without the usual predisposing factors and high index of suspicion is necessary to detect these unusual presentations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "61ce83d9-473c-4a12-9410-a0b040f64502", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms . It was first described by Gustav Heuck in 1879 , and it is also known as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia . PMF is the least common of all chronic myeloproliferative diseases, with an incidence of 0.2 to 1.5 per 100,000 per year . The median age at presentation is 65 years and 20% of patients are younger than 55 years at the moment of diagnosis. Current diagnosis of PMF is based on the 2008 World Health Organization criteria  and the most consistent clinical findings are splenomegaly, present in up to 90% of patients, and fatigue in up to 70% of patients . Two processes have been implicated in the generation of this disease . A first monoclonal proliferation, resulting in the expansion of one or more myeloid lineages with varying degrees of phenotypic differentiation and accumulating cells in spleen , and a second step characterized by a reactive polyclonal response in the bone marrow, leading to fibroblast deposition, collagen proliferation, reticulin fibrosis and ineffective hematopoiesis. Clonality is documented in up to 50% of patients with the analysis of activation mutation in Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2 V617F) and there is a possible role of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta in fibrosis development .\n\n【2】PMF has a median survival ranging from 2.5 to 5 years. Conventional medical treatment is unsatisfactory and, with the exception of transfusion therapy, none have been shown to confer a survival benefit . To date, myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the only modality with a curative potential for PMF, but has been limited for patients under the age of 60 years and for those with HLA-identical sibling donor because of high transplant-related mortality (TRM) . In myeloablative allo-SCT, Guardiola and colleagues  reported one graft failure and 1-year TRM of 27%, with a 3-year overall survival of 77% in 55 patients. We present a patient with graft failure in the following matched sibling donor allo-SCT for myelofibrosis and discuss its potential causes.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 32 years old female mother of one child underwent curettage for an incomplete abortion. During the postoperative routine screening, an ultrasound showed grade III splenomegaly and she was referred to the hematologist for consultation. At that moment, she had pancytopenia and the bone marrow biopsy showed extensive grade IV reticulin fibrosis. PMF diagnosis was made and she was started on hydroxiurea. Due to the lack of response according to standard criteria , she was proposed to consider allo-SCT as a therapeutic option, which she agreed. An HLA-identical sibling donor was available and transplantation was performed under myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. A total of 4.26 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> CD34 positive cells/kg were collected from donor and infused without any complication. She received standard prophylactic medications (for example acyclovir, fluconazole, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), albendazole, sulfametoxazol and metronidazole). graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis included mofetil micophenolate and cyclosporine. She developed staphylococcus aureus bacteremia the first week after infusion and infection completely resolved with ceftazidime and amikacine. She was discharged from the hospital at day +21 with hemoglobin in 8.1 g/dL, 5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L platelets and 1.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L leucocytes under supportive G-CSF and followed ambulatory care with medical consults twice weekly. On day 32 postransplantion, hemoglobin level fell to 5.4 g/dL and leucocytes maintained in 1.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Platelets were less than 2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Menorrhagia was an evident cause of anemia and was more intense due to thrombocytopenias. Contraceptives were prescribed. Other causes of anemia were discarded and platelets were considered to have a delayed engraftment at that moment. She was on standard prophylactic antibiotic treatment and immunosuppression and the medications were being adjusted according to laboratory results to maintain therapeutic levels. During this period, she received transfusion therapy with packed red blood cells and platelets until bleeding stopped and cytopenias were unresponsive to supportive therapy. Graft failure was suspected and a short course of G-CSF was started with leukocyte recovery from 1×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L to 3.2 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, but sustained for only few days. Epstein Barr virus antigenemia, citomegalovirus DNA were negative. Assessment of parvovirus B19 and herpes virus 6 were not performed due to the lack of the appropriate molecular techniques. Peripheral blood films showed a few teardrop cells, and a hypocellular marrow aspirate was taken without hemophagocytosis characteristics. A short trial of erythropoietin resulted in small benefits. Abdominal computer tomography scans reported splenic infarcts with rapid involution of the splenomegaly. JAK-2 mutational analysis was negative and single tandem repeats (STR) genotyping showed a complete chimeras. Although she persisted with cytopenias, all other evidence was against graft failure and for that reason donor-lymphocyte infusion was not performed. As outpatient, she never developed fever, and C-reactive protein, galactomanan antigen and procalcitonin were all negatives. Bone marrow biopsy taken at day +32 revealed complete absence of fibrosis with a non-cellular marrow and a small paratrabecular area of erythroid production consistent with marrow failure. She continued on medical control and transfusion therapy and at day +73 post stem cell transplant, she presented with jaundice, total bilirrubin in 8.1 mg/dL, GGT in 423 IU/L, alkaline phosphate in 773 IU/L and elevated transaminases. At this moment, she had extensive skin pruritic rash, with erythematous macules and papules involving 50% of body surface and watery diarrhoea. Grade IV acute GvHD was diagnosed and confirmed by skin biopsy. She was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous steroids were started for 3 days and then tapered orally. She developed fever, and cultures were taken from blood, urine, stool and sputum. Eventually, all returned negative and there was no response to broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, with persistent fever even after a complete antifungal treatment course. During this time upper gastric intestinal hemorrhage was complicated by persistent thrombocytopenia requiring multiple platelet transfusions. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid was used as a final effort to reduce bleeding without success. On day +89, she presented a massive gastric hemorrhage, and endoscopic argon plasma coagulation with adrenaline as well as pharmacologic measures were insufficient to save her life.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】This patient exemplifies the difficulties in the management of allo-SCT patients. Fungal and viral agents are among the causes of slow recovery of hematopoiesis, but diagnosis is complicated taking into consideration the immunosuppressive therapy and antibiotics prescribed, therefore, a high degree of suspicion is needed by the transplant team in order to carry out the necessary tests to examine the cause of cytopenia in the post-transplant period. Pancytopenia following bone marrow transplantation is a critical complication and must be carefully and extensively evaluated. Rejection, graft failure, infections and medications are among the causes to be considered. An approach to document engraftment in the post-transplant patient is testing for quimerism, analyzing STR by real-time PCR. STRs are patterns of 5 to 50 base pairs repeats found in the intronic region and are sequences used to assess quimerism with very high degree of accuracy. Complete quimerism is 100% of donor DNA and is associated with acute GvHD. On the other hand, mixed quimerism is a dynamic measure and should be closely monitored, as increasing values are indication of immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion. Graft failure is another cause of pancytopenia post-transplantation. It is defined as a failure to achieve neutrophil count of at least 0.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L for three consecutive days by day +35 and a platelet count of 20 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. In our patient, there was neither self-hematopoyesis nor evidence of engraftment by day +40. The presence of complete chimera confirmed that all circulating cells were donor originated and therefore the difficulty in making a definite diagnosis.\n\n【7】The incidence of graft failure in myeloablative allo-SCT has been documented to be up to 5% with the majority of patients receiving stem cells from non-identical HLA donors . A recently published study of 51 patients with 33 having HLA-identical sibling donor and 27 under myeloablative regimen, showed no graft failures . Deeg and co-workers , in 56 patients undergoing allo-SCT documented zero graft failures in the HLA-identical transplants, with three failures in the non-identical HLA group, two of which were unrelated donors. These data confirm that this serious complication is far more frequent in non-identical HLA transplants with the highest incidence in unrelated donor transplants, which was not this case.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】We present a case of graft failure after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myelofibrosis manifested as pancytopenia in a patient with rapid reduction in spleen size, no residual marrow fibrosis and in remission. One interesting finding was the lack of engraftment even with the presence of a complete chimera and the development of GvHD suggests that donor stem cells might be circulating and were incapable of repopulating the bone marrow due to serious damage in the microenvironment .\n\n【10】We ruled out some of the most frequent causes of graft failure; however, because of lack of resources, we cannot assure whether or not herpes virus 6 or parvovirus B19 contributed to pancytopenia. Although infrequent in matched sibling donor transplants, graft failure must be considered in all patients with cytopenias following stem cell transplantation and this case provides an example of the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment, and the urge to treat early to avoid further complications.\n\n【11】In developing countries, there is an increased need to improve diagnostic methods and therapeutic options and guidelines should address different strategies of treatment of patients in more resource-limited institutions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There are four types based on cardiac catheterization findings including the apical type (> 80% of cases), midventricular type, basal type and focal type . The most common presenting symptoms are acute chest pain and dyspnea while associated clinical findings include elevation in cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes . Other laboratory abnormalities include elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and BNP/peak troponin ratio when compared to ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients . There are no randomized trials or expert consensus for medical management and treatment.\n\n【2】Although the etiology of TC is not clear, it is thought to be related to a catecholamine surge from a preceding physical or emotional stress. However, over 15-20% of TC episodes do not have clear triggers . Catecholamine overload may also lead to chronic inflammatory states and oxidative injury as myocardial biopsies have demonstrated increased fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in TC patients . Estrogen may also play a role as meta-analysis has demonstrated about 80% of cases occur in women > 50 years  and women represent 90% of cases overall .\n\n【3】In 2012 over 6,000 cases of TC were reported in the United States with increasing annual incidence  representing 1-2% of all myocardial infarctions . Roughly 2-12% of patients experience recurrent episodes . Mortality is similar compared to patients with ACS from other causes  and increased compared to control subject with reported chest pain . Common complications include cardiogenic shock , arrhythmias  and death .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 59-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension and surgical menopause at age 35 secondary to bilateral oophorectomy presented to our clinic for follow-up evaluation of chest pain. Six months prior, she presented to the emergency department for new and severe epigastric pain which lasted for 12 h. ECG was significant for ST-depressions in the septal leads concerning for acute posterior myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated troponin I (TnI) of 13 ng/mL and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 600 pg/mL. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% with hypokinesis of the mid and distal segments and apical dyskinesis consistent with TC. Catheterization revealed markedly elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 26 mm Hg with apical ballooning . No obstructive coronary artery disease was seen. She was discharged home on losartan and carvedilol.\n\n【6】Four months later, she experienced similar episode of severe epigastric and chest pain lasting for hours. ECG showed nonspecific ST abnormalities. Laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated TnI (0.7 ng/mL) and BNP within normal limits (62 pg/mL). TTE demonstrated no wall motion abnormalities and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65-70%. Repeat catheterization showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Interestingly, she denied any recent physical or emotional stressors related to either episode.\n\n【7】She was seen at our clinic 1 month later for cardiology consultation. She had no complaints of chest pain or dyspnea at time of presentation and reported being able to exercise rigorously daily without experiencing cardiovascular symptoms. Daily home medications included carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day, losartan 25 mg, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg, aspirin 81 mg, and oral estradiol 2 mg daily, and nitroglycerin 0.4 sublingual tablets as needed. Following this consultation, the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (losartan) was discontinued and she was started on the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril 2.5 mg twice daily. The oral estradiol was stopped due to concern of thrombosis. She has now been symptom free for 6 months and able to exercise regularly without experiencing symptoms.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The pathogenesis of TC is unclear though several hypotheses exist. It could be due to excessive production of epinephrine after beta-adrenergic response resulting in a decline of cardiac myocyte activity and inefficient myocardial function . This may also explain the predilection and worse outcomes in women as myocytes in males may have greater resilience and restorative properties than females . Mental stressors and subsequent increases in epinephrine and catecholamine levels also impact endothelial function and may result in catecholamine-related myocyte toxicity, coronary microvascular dysfunction and coronary microvascular vascular spasm . These theories are supported by the relationship between TC and estrogen withdrawal, as these patients lose the protective qualities of estrogen from catecholamine toxicity, calcium overload and oxidative stress. Fatty acid metabolism may also play a role as one retrospective study utilizing data from a national patient registry found patients with TC were less likely to be treated for hyperlipidemia at the time of presentation .\n\n【10】Several treatment strategies have been explored. As a result of the proposed mechanism involving catecholamine surge, beta-blockers have been explored as a potential treatment. To date, large prospective observational studies have found no improvement in recurrence rates or mortality when treating patients with normal doses of beta-blockers . However, patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction  or interventricular pressure gradients may experience greater benefit . Current understanding is that clinicians should choose combined alpha and beta-blockers such as carvedilol to minimize vasoconstriction due to alpha effects . In addition, beta-blockers have been found to assist in associated complications of TC including cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias and death .\n\n【11】Overall, a reduced ejection fraction is noted in 86.5% of patients with TC  and therefore ACEI and ARBs may play a role in treatment . A retrospective analysis in a large multi-center international registry including 1,118 patients with medications prescribed at hospital discharge after a TC event found improved survival rates 1 year after TC event in patients taking ACEI and ARBs but not beta-blockers . A systematic review also found that ACEI/ARB prescriptions are associated with decreased recurrence rate, but not beta-blocker prescriptions. However, both studies did not distinguish between types of beta-blockers (selective vs. non-selective) or combined beta-blocker and ACEI/ARB therapy . Another retrospective review including 66 patients at two hospitals found that patients taking ACEI prior to admission did not develop critical complications including arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock and death . Long-term clinical management to minimize recurrence rates and optimize overall prognosis is less clear. We substituted an ACEI for the ARB in this patient because large multi-center registries have found an associated decreased mortality and recurrence of TC .\n\n【12】Information surrounding recurrent episodes of TC is limited. Some estimates have found recurrent episodes to occur between 3 weeks to 3.8 years and are associated with consistently poor left ventricular ejection fractions of ≤ 40% . There are no clinical trials exploring medical management for effectively minimizing recurrent episodes. Therefore, assessing the efficacy of medical interventions including ACEI/ARBs and beta-blockers in relation to recurrent episode severity represents a potential point of interest for future exploration .\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】TC is a form of ACS where pathophysiology and optimal treatment is unknown. Recurrence is observed in 2-12% and there is little information surrounding medical interventions to optimize outcomes within this subpopulation. Because the condition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, further exploration into management and treatment plans is warranted. We present a case where ARBs and beta-blockers dampened the symptoms of recurrent TC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, acute complications necessitating emergency surgical intervention are rare. We report a case of spontaneous rupture of feeding vessel of uterine fibroid needing emergency laparotomy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 30-year-old lady, nulliparous, presented to the emergency department with acute onset of lower abdominal pain for 1 day. She has medical history of hypertension and asthma. Her menstrual cycle was normal and urine pregnancy test was negative. On examination, she had diffuse tenderness in the abdomen. A bedside abdominal sonogram was performed which revealed a large amount of free fluid. She was stable and went for a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis which showed hemoperitoneum with source of bleeding arising from a large uterine mass that has ruptured . The hemoglobin level initially was 11.6 g/dL.\n\n【4】Patient went for emergency diagnostic laparoscopy. Upon entry by laparoscopy, a 9-cm pedunculated subserosal uterine leiomyoma was found, with a ruptured feeding vessel identified at the base of the fibroid. Decision was made to convert to open myomectomy in view of the active bleeding. The leiomyoma was excised and 1.3 L of blood and blood clots were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The postoperative course was uneventful. Her postoperative hemoglobin level was 7 g/dL. The patient was given 1 U of packed red blood cells and iron injection. Histopathologic review of the specimen revealed a 9-cm leiomyoma with areas of infarction, hemorrhage and vascular congestion .\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Uterine fibroids constitute the most common tumor in women of reproductive age. Most women with fibroids are asymptomatic. However, when clinically apparent, women usually experience heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or pelvic pressure. Acute complications secondary to fibroids are rare and seldom necessitate emergency surgical intervention. The complications include venous thromboembolism, acute pain secondary to degeneration or torsion of a pedunculated fibroid, acute urinary retention and subsequent renal failure . It is rare for a uterine fibroid to spontaneously rupture .\n\n【7】Intraperitoneal hemorrhage from rupture fibroid is usually venous and secondary to an increase in abdominal pressure, which causes rupture of superficial veins . Bleeding can also be arterial and usually associated with hypertension. Trauma causing avulsion of a fibroid, torsion of a pedunculated fibroid, and pregnancy causing venous congestion resulting in vessel rupture are other possible etiologies for intra-abdominal bleeding from a fibroid . With regard to our case, we could not demonstrate any cause that could lead to rupture of the vessel.\n\n【8】Imaging modalities can aid in diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. The differential diagnosis between ascites and hemoperitoneum is sometimes not easy. Ultrasound is a helpful instrument to make a diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. CT could help the clinician to arrive at the correct diagnosis quickly. However, CT and ultrasound may not be able to delineate the origin of the bleeding . Prompt emergency surgical intervention can be life-saving in situations such as the case described.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】Rupture of uterine fibroid is rare, but it should be included in the differential diagnosis when encountering patient with known submucosa fibroid and acute abdomen pain. Exploratory laparotomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this life-threatening condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In adults, most brain metastases originate from lung cancers (50-60%), followed by breast cancers (15-20%), melanomas (5-10%) as much as cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and renal cell carcinomas .\n\n【2】Neurological manifestations occur in more than two-thirds of patients with brain metastases. The clinical presentations include headache and vomiting (with or without nausea), altered mental status, ataxia, seizures, dizziness, hemiparesis, aphasia, visual reduction, cranial nerve impairment, etc. In some cases, the onset of neurological manifestations is abrupt like a stroke attack . Moreover, fever may coexist both as a manifestation of cancer and also from the brain metastases itself .\n\n【3】When a patient with known brain metastases presents to the emergency department (ED) with one, or some, of these symptoms, an overt diagnosis exists. However, alternative diagnoses should also be considered in the appropriate clinical context. For example, symptoms like headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, motor or sensory focal deficit and altered mental status may also occur in patients with meningitis . Consequently, a correct diagnosis is critical for the appropriate treatment, especially in cases, in which a reversible cause of illness exists.\n\n【4】In this report, we describe two cases of cancer patients with known brain metastases in whom the neurological deterioration was due to meningitis.\n\n【5】Case Reports\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】A 53-year-old female patient was brought to the ED due to excessive vomiting, headache, confusion and generalized malaise during the last few days. From her past medical history, she was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) stage 4 with bone metastases for which she received chemotherapy. A few days later, she underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and she was diagnosed to have a mild ventricular distention and multiple small sized parenchymal metastases. From her neurological examination on admission, nuchal stiffness and altered mental status were observed while her inflammatory markers were the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) < 3.27 mg/L (0 - 5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 2 mm/h (2 - 20 mm/h) and white blood cells (WBCs) 21.760 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (4.000 - 11.000 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) 18.460 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (2.500 - 7.500 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL). She underwent a brain CT with intravenous contrast medium that revealed a mild ventricular distention without any widening of the peripheral subarachnoid spaces. As the brain computed tomography (CT) could not explain completely the clinical picture, she underwent lumbar puncture, which revealed a clear and colorless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the presence of six cells, glucose of 25 mg/dL (serum glucose of 97 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 504 U/L and protein of 250 mg/dL. From the CSF cytology, the presence of tumor cells was confirmed. She was treated with dexamethasone with gradual improvement of her clinical symptoms and finally she was referred to her oncologist for further treatment.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A 56-year-old male patient was admitted due to generalized malaise, headache, altered mental status, vomiting, nausea and fever (38.5 °C) for the last few days. On admission, his laboratory findings were the following: WBCs 5.900 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (4.000 - 11.000 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), PMNs 5.500 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (2.500 - 7.500 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), CRP 7.68 mg/L (0 - 5 mg/L) and ESR 102 mm/h (2 - 20 mm/h). From his past medical history, he was diagnosed with squamous cell lung carcinoma with brain metastases for which he received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The last days, before his current neurological deterioration and until the time of admission, he started dexamethasone in order to treat the brain peritumoral edema. Based on his medical history, he underwent a brain CT scan, which revealed brain metastases (the bigger one was located near cerebellum) with accompanied vasogenic edema. He was treated with dexamethasone and mannitol. Because of persistent headache and fever, in the absence of an obvious site of infection, coexisting meningitis was suspected. He underwent a lumbar puncture with the following CSF characteristics: clear and colorless, negative Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stains, CSF cell count: 80 cells (54% PMNs and 46% lymphocytes), LDH of 69 U/L, glucose of 60 mg/dL (serum glucose of 139 mg/dL), and protein of 180.81 mg/dL. In the absence of titers for virus-specific antibodies in CSF, he was empirically treated with acyclovir. His symptoms improved rapidly and fever receded. After 5 days, he underwent a new lumbar puncture with the following results: CSF cell count of two cells, LDH of 46 U/L, glucose of 130 mg/dL (serum glucose of 203 mg/dL), and protein of 183.11 mg/dL. Two weeks after his admission, while the patient was asymptomatic, he underwent a brain MRI scan that revealed the already known metastases with accompanied peritumoral edema.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】In the first case, the neurological deterioration was due to a non-reversible cause. The infiltration of the leptomeninges by malignant cells, as a complication of cancer, is called carcinomatous meningitis and breast cancer is the most common solid tumor complicated by meningeal carcinomatosis at a proportion of approximately 5% . Although the overall prognosis remains poor, the expansion of the repertoire of available drugs for intrathecal administration, systemic chemotherapy, gene therapy and the use of immunotoxins for the management of leptomeningeal metastases can prolong life expectancy and improve the health-related quality of life in these patients . To these treatment options, the craniospinal radiotherapy should also be added, which is feasible and effective for palliative treatment of leptomeningeal metastases .\n\n【12】In the second case, the neurological deterioration was due to a self-limiting, potentially reversible  and, in cases of bacterial meningitis, treatable illness (especially if the appropriate treatment initiates in time) .\n\n【13】Our patients had both negative Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s sign, while only the first one had nuchal rigidity. Nevertheless, it has been reported that nuchal rigidity was found during clinical examination in 35% and 13% of the acute care geriatric and younger patients, respectively, despite the absence of meningitis . Anyway, the three classic meningeal signs (Kernig’s sign, Brudzinski’s sign and nuchal rigidity) were not able to accurately discriminate patients with meningitis from those without  and individual items of the clinical history have low accuracy for the diagnosis of meningitis . However, in patients with suspected meningitis, rapid and accurate clinical evaluation is required in order to determine the need for lumbar puncture .\n\n【14】The main reason that leads to the decision to perform a lumbar puncture in our patients was the fact that their neurological deterioration was in contrast with the absence of new findings in the performed brain CT scans. This fact, combined with the presence of headache and altered mental status, raised the suspicion of meningitis.\n\n【15】As it is emphasized by these two cases, patients with brain metastases, unchanged at CT imaging, and recent neurological deterioration must undergo lumbar puncture before their symptoms are considered a progression of their already existing brain metastases. In some cases, the deterioration might be due to a potentially reversible illness or due to an illness requiring specific treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "abf93a2f-fe22-4920-8dac-b9da34262e02", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is frequently used worldwide. Coronary artery bypass operation is performed while the heart is stopped and using cardiopulmonary bypass machine is called on-pump CABG . The surgical procedure involves renal, cardiac, cerebral, and respiratory risks .\n\n【2】Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease, which is characterized by high total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels from birth. It is a major cause of premature coronary heart disease, and needs to be treated with CABG surgery at an early age .\n\n【3】Renal transplantation is a form of treatment in patients with end-stage renal disease . The immunosuppressive drugs used after kidney transplantation increase the risk of CABG surgery.\n\n【4】We present a different case in our clinic, in which on-pump CABG was performed in a young patient with renal transplant and had diagnosed hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 19-year-old male patient presented to the cardiology clinic with complaints of chest pain during efforts for a month. He had a history of renal transplantation when he was 12 years old. He had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and family history of coronary artery disease. He had been diagnosed with FH. He has taken the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin (SANDIMMUN <sup>® </sup> Neoral 25 mg) and mycophenolatmofetil (Cellcept <sup>® </sup> 500 mg) due to renal transplantation and statin (Alvastin <sup>® </sup> 80 mg) due to hyperlipidemia.\n\n【7】His physical examination results showed no abnormalities. Vital findings were within normal range: fever 36.7 °C, blood pressure arterial 110/60 mm Hg with a regular pulse of 74 beats/min, respiration rate 14/min, and saturation with 94%/96% with pulse oximeter. In his physical examination, heart sounds were rhythmic and no additional sound murmur was detected. All peripheral pulses were palpable. Both hemithoraxes participated in respiration equally, and there was no ral-rhonchus. There was no distension, rebound or tenderness in abdomen. In local examination, there was the renal transplantation scar.\n\n【8】On laboratory investigation, cardiac markers were normal; GFR 79 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> (normal range > 60), blood urine nitrogen 20 mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, serum cyclosporin level 77 ng/mL, serum total cholesterol 596 mg/dL (normal range 130 - 200 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol 42 mg/dL (normal range 130 - 200 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol 533 mg/dL (normal range 60 - 130 mg/dL), and triglyceride 106 (normal range 50 - 160 mg/dL) were determined.\n\n【9】An electrocardiogram showed ST-T changes (common ST depression). Echocardiography showed normal ventricular function with no cardiac valve pathology. Coronary angiogram revealed over 75% stenosis at the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) , Cx coronary artery  and right coronary artery .\n\n【10】The patient was referred to cardiovascular surgery clinic for CABG surgery. The immunosuppressive and statin drugs were used until operation day. On-pump CABG surgery (LIMA-LAD, DI, Cx (OMI), and RCA (PD)) was performed. Because of the posssibility of renal failure that led to requirement of hemodialysis and AV fistula, safen vein conduit was preferred instead of radial vein. At the end of the operation, low-dose dopamine (3 µg/kg/dk) and nitroglycerin infusion were given and patient was taken to ICU. Because of the fast-track anesthesia, patient was early extubated. Mobilization on the first postoperative day was achieved. Drains were removed on second postoperative day. After routine CABG follow-up, he was discharged on eighth day postoperatively. The last follow-up was 5 months after the surgery and he was remarkably well.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】CABG is a cardiac surgery procedure which is usually applied over 50 years of age. Although risks and benefits are individualized and depend on surgical technique, cerebrovascular events and renal insufficiency are main complications .\n\n【13】FH is a genetic disorder that clinically leads to an increase in plasma cholesterol levels. It increases three- to six-fold in homozygous carriers of FH mutations and two- to three-fold in heterozygous. FH patients often have coronary artery disease at second and third decades of their life; however, a 7-year-old FH patient had CABG as reported in the literature .\n\n【14】Development of atherosclerotic plaque deposition may also occur in the aorta at an early age in patients with FH, as in our case. Therefore, we think that importance of the good examination of the aorta during aortic cannulation in CABG operations should be emphasized in patient with FH. My opinion is that it is getting more value of cannulation in the appropriate area and the side clamping in once at the clean area in the patients that aortic plaque placement is probable just like our case who has aortic soft plaque.\n\n【15】We also thought that in our case, 19-year-old male undergoing renal transplantation, the CABG operation has a higher risk of renal damage compared to the normal individual. In literature, data on the long-term outcomes and risk factors in this population are scarce; however, transient deterioration of graft function has been reported. In our case, as the patient had a history of renal transplantation, and is administered immunosuppressants, he is susceptible to infection or rejection.\n\n【16】In our case, as the patient was in the acute phase after renal transplantation, prevention of rejection was thought to be of the utmost importance. Moreover, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in open heart surgery causes renal function and levels of immunosuppressants to become unstable. In our case, the particular attention is focused on the method used for administering immunosuppressants to this patient perioperatively. Preoperative immunosuppression which continued until the morning of the surgery was restarted as soon as possible postoperatively. Drugs was administered orally the night after surgery.\n\n【17】Immunosuppressive agents taken until operation day and its starting to take medicine as soon as possible after extubation are good managements for prevention from rejection. Their negative effect on renal function cannot be denied. Attention is paid to hypervolemia and hyperpotassemia in patients undergoing standard on-pump CABG. However, in such patients with kidney transplant and FH, more care should be taken. I think that do not hesitate performing intraoperative ultrafiltration just as we did.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】On-pump CABG can be performed succesfully in patient with renal transplant. However, renal recipients have higher risk of infection and renal damage compared with patients without transplants. In addition, as in our case, FH would affect the clinical outcome negatively.\n\n【20】Our precautions to be taken into consideration to prevent renal damage and infection for the patient with a history of renal transplantation include mediastinal washing, achieving adequate hemostasis, intraoperative ultrafitration, using blood product as little as possible, for protection of infection avoiding unnecessary cautery, and multidisciplinary approach with nephrology department is also important to manage the treatment especially in perioperative period.\n\n【21】I would like to think the sensitivity and close follow-up in standard CABG cases, and it should be applied to the highest level in such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The redistribution of fat tissue is the main clinical aspect, but some physiopathological processes may be detected over time. Immunohistochemistry shows degenerative and regenerative changes of the lipedema tissue, characterized by crown-like structures and proliferation of adipose tissue, suggesting increased adipogenesis tissue . Changes in microcirculation, specifically in the lymphatic system, are the most prominent anatomical and functional findings .\n\n【2】A study characterized in detail morphologic and molecular alterations in the adipose tissue composition of lipedema patients compared with healthy controls in histological analysis of the infiltrate of immune cells confirmed the increased presence of macrophages, with no changes in the T-cell compartment, increase in intracellular fibrosis or adipocyte hypertrophy . Obesity is an associated comorbidity in 80% of patients with lipolymphedema .\n\n【3】A study involving magnetic resonance lymphography (without contrast) in patients with lipedema that progressed to lipolymphedema of the lower limbs detected dilated peripheral lymphatic vessels, indicating a subclinical state of lymphedema . Lymphatic vessels begin to dilate and elongate with the progression of lipedema, leading to the development of microaneurysms .\n\n【4】A recent study involving multi-segment bioelectrical impedance analysis found that morbidly obese patients developed subclinical systemic lymphedema that can progress to clinical systemic lymphedema, which is aggravated by an increase in the body mass index (BMI) . Individuals with lipedema develop these conditions in earlier stages and lymphedema is detected by multi-segment bioimpedance in 50% of those with a BMI higher than 30 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【5】The aim of the present study was to report the 3-year follow-up of a male patient with lipedema and subclinical systemic lymphedema evaluated using multi-segment bioimpedance.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A 53-year-old male patient with a history of oncological surgery, prostate, involving lymph node clearance in the right inguinal region followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy subsequently developed edema of the right lower limb and sought a specialized service for the treatment of lymphedema. The physical examination revealed edema from the root of the thigh involving the entire limb. The limb had the physical appearance of lipedema, for which the patient had a family history. At the first evaluation by bioimpedance, the patient’s BMI was 29 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Circumference measurements, volumetry and multi-segment bioimpedance were performed for diagnosis and evaluation treatment. The diagnosis of lipedema is primarily clinical based on history and physical examination. Multi-segment bioimpedance is essential to diagnose systemic edema that suggests changes in the lymphatic system. It is fundamental in the evolution of these patients and was performed during his follow-up period.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】The treatment for lymphedema first time in the Clinica Godoy, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil was during 5 days (8 h per day), involving associated therapy, Godoy method <sup>® </sup> : cervical lymphatic therapy, mechanical lymphatic therapy (RAGodoy <sup>® </sup> ) and grosgrain stocking. Maintenance with grosgrain stocking and mechanical lymphatic therapy returns one time per year. Lipedema has pathophysiological changes related to the lymphatic system and the same treatment of lymphedema is performed in lipedema .\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】Below the knee, the right limb had a volume of 4,720 g and the left limb had a volume of 3,419 g (difference between limbs: 1,224 g). During the 3-year follow-up of the case, only a reduction to 4,100 g in the right leg was maintained. Multi-segment bioimpedance showed the progression from subclinical systemic lymphedema to clinical systemic lymphedema throughout the 3-year follow-up, as displayed in Tables 1 , 2 and 3 . At the first evaluation, abnormally high intracellular and extracellular water, total body water as well as water in both lower limbs and one upper limb were found. Lymphedema detected by bioimpedance was found in the right leg. At the second evaluation, the patient had progressed to subclinical systemic lymphedema, with more water in all extremities and the trunk and bilateral lower limb lymphedema detected by bioimpedance. Three years after the original evaluation, multi-segment bioimpedance revealed clinical systemic lymphedema, with the increase in water in all extremities. The patient was instructed to lose weight and maintain treatment for lymphedema.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】This paper reports the first case of the follow-up of lymphedema/lipedema evaluated by multi-segment bioimpedance in a male patient. The increase in intracellular and extracellular water as well as water in the extremities initially called attention to this condition, but there was no knowledge regarding the evolution of such cases. At the second evaluation 1 year later, the patient presented subclinical systemic lymphedema, which progressed to clinical systemic lymphedema at the 3-year evaluation, as determined by multi-segment bioimpedance.\n\n【17】We have been following patients with lipedema and lymphedema for approximately 8 years, after having included multi-segment bioimpedance in the evaluation of patients, but this is the first case of lipedema progressing to systemic lymphedema in a male patient. Obesity is the main aggravating factor of edema in these patients and the prevalence of subclinical systemic lymphedema increases with the increase in BMI.\n\n【18】With regard to the physiopathology of lipedema, the main changes in which we can interfere involve the lymphatic system . Using multi-segment bioimpedance, we have found that obesity is a major aggravating factor, as a higher BMI translates to greater lymphatic harm. Therefore, the main form of treatment for such patients is to address obesity through weight reduction, which is the only way we currently know to reverse this lymphedema and achieve standards of normality or near normality. Patients with lymphedema and obesity who lose weight experience an important reduction in the edema and, without an additional harm to the lymphatic system, can achieve normality .\n\n【19】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, but the increase in weight is an aggravating factor in both sexes. This condition initially affects the lower limbs, progressing to subclinical systemic lymphedema, followed by clinical systemic lymphedema determined using multi-segment bioimpedance, demonstrating that edema in patients with lipedema may be systemic.\n\n【20】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis . In men, these alterations were not identified. However, it is essential to identify in each patient with lipedema all aggravating factors of the edema and treat each of the pathophysiological aspects involved. However, weight gain is the most serious of all and these are factors that can interfere. Other alterations are described in lipedema of genetic causes, but we cannot interfere. At the moment, weight loss and lymphatic therapy to reduce edema are the main therapeutic bases.\n\n【21】In around 10% of women, the physical aspect of lipedema is detected, but rare in literature in men; as long as they remain thin, the appearance of edema and symptoms is less frequent, a fact that characterizes the lipedema syndrome. Therefore, the patient in the present study has lymphedema and lipedema syndrome .\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, affects the lower limbs, and can progress to subclinical systemic lymphedema.\n\n【24】Weight gain is one of the most aggravating factors of lipedema.\n\n【25】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis, but in men, these alterations were not identified.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and embryonal RMS represent the two main histological patterns and must be differentiated from other small round cell tumors. RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in the pediatric population, comprising approximately 5% of all childhood tumors and nearly 50% of soft tissue sarcomas arising in 0 - 14 years old children . In contrast, it is remarkably uncommon in elder adults, representing merely 2-5% of all malignant soft tissue tumors, mostly of the pleomorphic type .\n\n【2】Alveolar RMS may involve the head and neck region (40%), the genitourinary system (20%), the extremities (20%), the trunk (10%) and other sites (10%) .\n\n【3】Here we report an uncommon case of alveolar RMS in the paranasal cavity of a 61-year-old woman, with emphasis on the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors in this location and the potential immunohistological diagnostic pitfalls.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 61-year-old female presented for onset of otalgia and a lump in the right neck.\n\n【6】A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right ethmoidal sinus lesion extending to the homolateral maxillary sinus and medial turbinate, with radiological features suspicious for a neoplasia .\n\n【7】A biopsy was performed and histological evaluation revealed an infiltrative neoplastic proliferation composed of sheets and solid nests of atypical small round cells , displaying hypercromatic nuclei, scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity . Examination of the individual cell morphology was often limited by variable crush artifacts and necrosis. On the basis of the sole morphology, an initial diagnosis of malignant undifferentiated neoplasia was made, being a small cell carcinoma the favored diagnostic hypothesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody panel  that could confirm the hypothesis of small cell undifferentiated carcinoma (EMA, cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, CK20), including neuroendocrine markers (CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin) and GFAP, s-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A, CD45, EBV-LMP1 and myeloperoxidase (for excluding neuroectodermal tumors, melanoma and lymphohemathopoietic neoplasms).\n\n【8】The tumor cells showed a positive immunostain only for CD56 . A sarcomatous nature of the lesion was suspected and appropriate additional immunohistochemical studies were performed. The neoplastic cells displayed a positive immunoreaction for vimentin, desmin , MyoD1 and myogenin , suggesting a rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.\n\n【9】A cytogenetic analysis revealed the t(2;13) translocation, a chromosomal rearrangement typical of alveolar RMS.\n\n【10】On the basis of immunohistological and cytogenetic findings a final diagnosis of alveolar RMS was made.\n\n【11】In January 2010, the patient underwent the first cycle of polichemotherapy treatment (VAC scheme: vincristine 2 mg/day 1, adriamicine 108 mg/day 1, cyclophosfamide 3,024/days 1-2).\n\n【12】One month later the patient received the second cycle (75% of VAC scheme: vincristine 1.5 mg/day 1, adriamicine 80 mg/day 1, cyclophosfamide 2,268/days 1-2). The third cycle was at 66% of VAC scheme for progressive mielotoxicity side effect.\n\n【13】CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in April revealed a good local response with 80% of tumor regression. From May to July the patient was treated with external beam radiation therapy (69.3 Gy/33 fraction). One month later MRI revealed the presence of local residual disease.\n\n【14】The case was discussed by the Head and Neck Tumor Management Team that scheduled the patient for surgery. Before the operation, the patient presented with a new onset of pain at the right arm and scapula. PET-CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed the presence of multiple bone metastases. The patient was referred to palliative chemotherapy and unfortunately died for disease complications one year after the initial consultation.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Alveolar RMS is composed in its classical form of distinctive nests of primitive-appearing round cells, which grows in a discohesive fashion, surrounded by hyalinized and highly vascular fibrous septa producing a pattern reminiscent of the alveoli of the lung. Obvious rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, in the form of strap cells and cytoplasmic cross striations, is rarely identified.\n\n【17】Solid forms of alveolar RMS lack the prominent nested pattern and cellular discohesion seen in the classical histotype and may closely mimic a variety of other small round cell tumors, such as small cell carcinoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma .\n\n【18】In immunohistochemistry, alveolar RMS typically expresses vimentin and muscle-specific antigens, such as desmin, muscle actins (including smooth muscle isoforms), myogenin and MyoD1 . Aberrant expression of epithelial and neuroendocrine markers, a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall, has been recently described .\n\n【19】Alveolar RMS is a very aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis and requires a histotype-specific aggressive therapy. Therefore an accurate diagnosis and its distinction from other small round cell tumors are of crucial clinical importance.\n\n【20】While some cases of alveolar RMS have been described in young adults, the occurrence of this neoplasm in adults over the age of 45 years is extremely uncommon, being pleomorphic RMS, characterized by different microscopic features and biological behavior, the most common histotype in this category of patients . For this reason, the inclusion of alveolar RMS in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors of the head and neck region is often neglected. Other malignancies such as small cell undifferentiated or neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and melanoma are more likely to be considered in this location in elder patients.\n\n【21】In our case, the initial diagnostic work-up for an undifferentiated tumor arising in the head and neck region in a 56-year-old female patient did not include myogenic markers. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD56 immunostain and only as a consequence of no immunoreaction for the other epithelial, lymphoma, or malignant melanoma markers, the differential diagnosis was expanded to include RMS and additional immunostains for a myogenic differentiation were pursued.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis of CD56 positive small round cell tumors includes natural killer (NK)-cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, primary neuroectodermal tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, synovial sarcoma and malignant melanoma.\n\n【23】CD56 expression has an established role in the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma/NK cell type and other hematological malignancies. The sinonasal region is notably a common location for NK/T-cell lymphomas, in particular in some areas of the world .\n\n【24】CD56 immunostain is of limited value in the differential diagnosis of sarcomas because it is widely expressed in these neoplasms. However, it may be useful in combination with the assessment of CD99 expression in the differential diagnosis with Ewing’s sarcoma. Only 10-25% of Ewing’s sarcomas are CD56 positive in contrast to 100% embryonal and alveolar RMSs .\n\n【25】CD56 is also commonly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and the co-expression of synaptophysin and/or chromogranin is highly suggestive of neuronal or neuroendocrine differentiation.\n\n【26】Indeed, some cases of synaptophysin positive immunoreaction in alveolar RMS have been reported . Conversely, rhabdomyoblastic differentiation may occur in olfactory neuroblastoma .\n\n【27】The differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated round cell neoplasms represents a common problem. In most cases morphologic evaluation is not sufficient and further investigations are required. The study of the immunohistochemical profile of the tumor is mandatory and the evaluation of the right combination of immuno-markers may have very important prognostic and therapeutic implications. In doubtful cases, cytogenetics and molecular biology studies can be useful in establishing the right diagnosis or to confirm the diagnostic hypothesis. The most common chromosomal rearrangements in alveolar RMS are t(2;13)(q35;q14), which is seen in 55% of cases, and t(1;13), which is encountered in about 22% of cases .\n\n【28】Our case suggests that in cases of undifferentiated round cell neoplasms of the head and neck region in elder patients, alveolar RMS should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis, along with lymphoma, small cell carcinoma and estesioneuroblastoma that are commonly encountered in such clinical spectrum. Therefore, the immunohistochemical differential diagnosis should always include a myogenic marker, such as desmin, myogenin or MyoD1. The performance of one more immunostain can avoid a diagnostic pitfall and provide a more rapid and correct diagnosis. Moreover, the demonstration of specific chromosomal rearrangements may be a very helpful diagnostic tool in doubtful cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Left atrium (75%) and right atrium (20%) are the most usual presenting sites . Median sternotomy is the main approach in the excision of atrial tumors. It offers great access to all the structures of the mediastinum and the lungs, enabling all types of cardiac operations as well as combined heart and lung operations . Right thoracotomy is becoming a more popular approach, in selected cases, as surgeons are becoming more familiar with the technique. The reason for this trend is the possible benefits of right thoracotomy especially in redo sternotomy. A comparison of the two methods showed better postoperative results with the use of right infra-axillary minithoracotomy in terms of hospital stay, use of analgesics, postoperative bleeding and the need for blood transfusion .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old male patient was referred to the cardiothoracic department due to the recent diagnosis of a left atrial myxoma. Main symptom was a progressively worsening dyspnea. An echocardiogram that was performed revealed a left atrial mass. Transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis. Tumor size approximated 3.5 cm . His past surgical history included coronary artery disease and a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) through median sternotomy 2 years ago. Due to his previous surgical history, right thoracotomy was preferred to redo median sternotomy.\n\n【4】The patient was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal double-lumen intubation, at left lateral position. A right lateral thoracotomy without rib excision was performed. The right lung was deflated and the pericardium was opened. Bypass circulation with fibrillation and direct cannulation of the aorta and the inferior vena cava was initiated and blood cardioplegia was used. The left atrium was opened, revealing a pale mass . The mass was attached to the interatrial septum. Complete excision of the mass was performed, including part of the interatrial septum . A patch was used to secure the opening of the interatrial septum. Continuous prolene 3/0 suture was used to close the left atrium and the bypass was terminated, after the transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the lack of air in the cardiac cavities. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged from the hospital after 5 days. Pathology examination confirmed the diagnosis of a myxoma.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Full median sternotomy has proven its efficacy and safety as an approach for the excision of cardiac tumors . Right thoracotomy has been reported as a safe method, with minimal complications for cardiac operations  and most recently right mini-thoracotomy has achieved better results in terms of perioperative complications, hospital stay and need of pain control . Furthermore, in selected patients, robotic cardiac surgery with right chest ports has been proven safe and effective in cardiac surgery . The surgeon’s experience and local guidelines are the main factors in choosing this approach. Furthermore, patient specific issues should be taken into consideration, such as past surgical history, as well as the patients wish for an acceptable cosmetic result.\n\n【7】In our case, previous full sternotomy for CABG that our patient had been subjected urged the need for another approach. The choice of right lateral thoracotomy through the fourth rib offered as excellent access to the mediastinum and the cardiac chambers, as direct cannulation of the aorta, superior and inferior vena cava, was feasible, with exceptional perioperative course. With this approach, we avoided possible complications of redo median sternotomy especially cardiac trauma, postoperative bleeding and distorted sternal closure or even sternal dehiscence.\n\n【8】We conclude that the use of right thoracotomy is a safe and effective way of treating patients who have been previously subjected to cardiac surgery and can be used as a standard procedure in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "03c41ea1-d62d-441b-b3ed-4f213dceef5d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Vallecular cysts, which are generally known as epiglottic mucus retention or tongue base cysts, are formations that are generally seen in infants and children. They are rarely seen in adults and occur as a result of the tongue base mucus retention . These cysts might be asymptomatic or might be associated with airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and failure to thrive during infancy, and even with death due to severe laryngeal obstruction . In cases with laryngeal inlet obstruction due to a vallecular cyst, the airway management sometimes might be a challenge . In this case report, the airway management of an adult patient with difficult airway due to a large vallecular cyst completely obstructing the pharynx was presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】This case report was presented after obtaining the patient’s written informed consent. A 28-year-old male patient who was experiencing foreign body sensation in his throat, dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness and snoring that persisted for 2 months, presented with his complaints to the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic. In the indirect laryngoscopic examination, a cystic mass with a smooth surface filling vallecula was detected, and under general anesthesia, the excision of the cystic formation was scheduled. No abnormality was found during the preanesthetic routine systemic physical examination and laboratory investigations. The view of oropharyngeal structures was evaluated as Mallampati class 1. The patient was taken to the operating room without premedication and standard monitoring was applied. As patients with vallecular cyst have the potential for a difficult airway, in addition to tracheostomy and other difficult airway equipment, an otorhinolaryngology specialist was made available during anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 50% O <sub>2 </sub> and air and when necessary with bolus propofol administration. Following tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with end-tidal (ET) 2.5% sevoflurane in 50% O <sub>2 </sub> \\-air and i.v. 1 µg/kg fentanyl. Since mask ventilation could only be provided with two practitioners, the patient’s spontaneous breathing was maintained. Direct laryngoscopic attempts and intubation were performed without muscle relaxant. Despite the use of different laryngoscopic blades , no laryngeal structure was seen due to the cystic formation. Therefore, it was decided to aspirate cyst content under laryngoscopy. After aspiration of approximately 20 mL cyst content with a needle, the peripheral side of the epiglottis was seen on the left-upper side of the shrunken cyst . Therefore, laryngoscopy was performed by an insertion of the left side of the mouth, and tracheal intubation was achieved by endotracheal tube which was advanced blindly under the epiglottis. After confirming the tracheal placement of the tube with pulmonary auscultation, SpO <sub>2 </sub> and ET CO <sub>2 </sub> monitoring, surgery was started, and surgical excision of the cyst was performed. The patient’s oxygenation was maintained at normal values with mask ventilation performed with two applicators until endotracheal intubation was achieved. Eight milligrams dexamethasone was administered intravenously as a precaution against potential airway edema. Upon completing the operation, anesthesia application was finalized and tracheal extubation was performed without any problem. Histopathological examination of the excised material confirmed a vallecular cyst. A week later, due to cyst reoccurrence, the patient was operated on again. With the presence of otorhinolaryngology, difficult airway equipment was made available and anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen and air. Probably due to the fact that the size of the cyst was smaller than the previous one, neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium was given in order to facilitate laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation since mask ventilation was easily provided. Upon the request of the surgeon, cyst content was not aspirated. The previous experience was taken into account, direct laryngoscopy was performed through insertion of the left side of the mouth and tracheal intubation was achieved with a single attempt. No problem arose during the course of anesthesia, surgical intervention and the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The size of a vallecular cyst has a tendency to increase with mucus secretion. As in our patient, since the large cyst prevented the view of the larynx, the airway management is of particular importance. In the cases where the larynx inlet is completely closed by the cystic formation, generally more than one intervention is performed and tracheal intubation can be performed by using laryngoscopes designed for difficult airway, fiberoptic or rigid bronchoscopy . Unfortunately, we have not a fiberoptic bronchoscopy or a video laryngoscope device. In some cases, mask ventilation is achieved with great difficulty, direct laryngoscopic oral intubation might not be achieved and urgent tracheostomy might be required . In the cases in which laryngeal view is blocked by the cyst, glottis might be visualized with the aspiration of the cyst content and tracheal intubation might be achieved. Vijayanand et al  reported that in an adult patient with a large (4 × 3 cm size) vallecular cyst occupying all of the tongue base, epiglottis and larynx are apparent upon the aspiration of the cyst content with a needle under local anesthesia, and endotracheal intubation could be easily performed on the next day under general anesthesia. Probably we were able to see a part of the epiglottis since we could not completely aspirate the cyst content.\n\n【6】Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations showed that the position of the epiglottis can be changed according to the placement of the cyst . In our case, after draining a large portion of cyst content, we detected that the epiglottis was pushed to left side by the vallecular cyst located in the right side of the tongue base. Therefore, although direct laryngoscopy is performed through insertion of the right side of the mouth, we performed direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation through the insertion of the left side of the mouth. Cheng et al  revealed that the laryngeal inlet was obstructed by the cyst in a 50-day-old infant with a large vallecular cyst, when the blade was on the midline. In a similar manner we performed, they moved the blade to 45° left from the midline, and they placed it laterally and achieved intubation.\n\n【7】As a result, they are able to obtain the view of the glottis or other laryngeal structures by shrinking the vallecular cyst size by needle aspiration of its content. Despite the fact that routine direct laryngoscopy is performed by entering from the right side of the mouth, performing laryngoscopy through insertion of the midline or left side, alternatively, can provide laryngeal view and facilitate tracheal intubation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "edfe9213-a2ee-4111-b6a1-3c43196daad3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction with potentially life-threatening multi-organ failure as a sequela. It has been most commonly reported with anticonvulsants and allopurinol , however, has also been associated with antibiotics particularly sulfonamides and less commonly with vancomycin . DRESS is suspected when the presentation of symptoms occur 2 - 6 weeks after exposure to the offending drug . These symptoms are usually fever, lymphadenopathies, rash and multi-organ involvement. Three scoring systems have been devised to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of DRESS for which The European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) scoring system has been most frequently used . RegiSCAR devised a scoring system that identifies cases as possible, probable or definite DRESS . The key underlying pathogenesis of DRESS is a drug specific immune reaction that acts as a trigger of viral reactivation by as yet unknown mechanisms; however, amplification of regulatory T cells has been proposed to be contributory to this viral reactivation . In a study of 40 patients with DRESS, evidence of EBV, HHV-6 or HHV-7 reactivation was found in 29 patients . Reactivation of herpesvirus infection coexisting with drug hypersensitivity is considered specific to DRESS . In fact, the detection of HHV-6 reactivation has even been proposed as a diagnostic marker for DRESS . This viral reactivation seems to further propagate T cell expansion particularly CD 8 cytotoxic lymphocytes  causing tissue damage that ends up as a vicious cycle of ongoing systemic inflammation until drug is effectively withdrawn. Hence prompt recognition of this rare syndrome and thus withdrawal of the offending drug is the mainstay of treatment. However, identification of DRESS syndrome remains to be difficult in the hospital setting as patients are often in multiple agents, onset of symptoms is delayed and there is no validated diagnostic test . In this case report, we present a case of DRESS syndrome associated with vancomycin presenting like severe sepsis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 34-year-old previously healthy African American female was initially admitted at our institution after suffering multiple fractures secondary to fall. She underwent several surgical repairs, and she further developed osteomyelitis. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she continued to receive IV vancomycin and cefepime. After 3 weeks into vancomycin and 2 weeks on cefepime, patient started to have fever (101 °F) and generalized erythematous papular rash. Cefepime was stopped in lieu of this rash. Her rash resolved; however, fever persisted. Four weeks into vancomycin, patient was reportedly hypoxic in the 80’s, and tachycardic hence was brought back at our institution. Upon arrival, vital signs were BP 97/49, HR 108, RR 22, temp 37.7, O <sub>2 </sub> sat 97% on 2 L NC. Physical examination revealed mild confusion, bibasal crackles, no mumurs, normal abdomen and no rash seen. She was given fluid boluses, and blood pressure was responsive. Vancomycin was shifted to daptomycin, and imipinem-cilastatin started. Laboratory studies initially revealed WBC 21.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, eosinophils 2.2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, platelet 264 and lymphocytes 36%. Urinalysis showed protein 100 mg/dL, WBC 1-5 and RBC 1-3, and no atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral smear. Her blood chemistry result is remarkable for Cr 1.51 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, AST 710 unit/L, ALT 659 unit/L, alk phos 459 unit/L and lactic acid 2.8 mg/dL. Serologic test results were remarkable for CMV quantitative PCR 14,274 unit/mL and positive HHV-6 PCR, negative HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, influenza, corona virus, RSV, adenovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, aspergillus galactomannan and blastomyces antigen. Blood cultures were persistently negative. Chest CT showed pulmonary edema and patchy ground glass opacities in upper and lower lobes with mediastinal, bilateral hilar and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies with the largest lymph node being 1.4 cm. Liver US showed mild hepatosplenomegaly. ANA panel negative, TEE negative. Bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed eosinophilia and reactive changes. Flow cytometry showed reactive lymphocytosis. Extensive workup has basically failed to reveal a definite diagnosis. Patient continued to be febrile and tachycardic with broad spectrum antibiotics even with addition of voriconazole. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia worsened. Progressive elevation of liver function tests, worsening kidney function and onset of another rash prompted discontinuation of all antibiotics. Leukocytosis, eosinophilia, ground glass opacities on chest CT, transaminitis and acute kidney injury started to abate down slowly, and patient was no longer febrile and tachycardic. One week after this improvement, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis but without eosinophilia recurred. Liver function tests were noted to be trending down, but total bilirubin and creatinine remained elevated. A notable desquamative type of pruritic rash was also noted . Consequent to this, patient had worsening liver synthetic function manifesting with jaundice, elevated INR, prolonged PTT, elevated bilirubin and low fibrinogen. Supportive therapy was maintained. At the time steroids and liver biopsy were being contemplated, patient had gradually improved on her synthetic liver function and acute kidney injury. She was at this time discharged to an acute long-term care facility in stable condition.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】DRESS syndrome is a severe drug reaction with a mortality rate up to 10%  with most patients dying from acute liver failure, multi-organ failure, fulminant myocarditis or hemophagocytosis . Currently there are no accurate diagnostic criteria for DRESS, but it is a syndrome diagnosed by exclusion . RegiSCAR scoring system has been used to grade DRESS cases as “possible”, “probable” or “definite” DRESS. A delayed onset of symptoms 2 - 6 weeks after the initiation of the causative drug is a feature of DRESS more so with probable/definite cases . The average time of recovery is 6 - 9 weeks with clinical course characterized by several flare-ups of symptoms . It has been reported that these flares might be induced by introduction of new drugs versus simply part of the natural course of DRESS . In addition, relapses have been reported associated with reactivation of HHV-6  and CMV . It is postulated that HHV-6 may interfere with some of the enzymes responsible for drug detoxification . Our case was a “definite” DRESS achieving a RegiSCAR score of 8, and in addition other causes had been ruled out, CMV and HHV-6 reactivation were detected and the time of onset plus resolution of symptoms match the usually reported presentation of DRESS. Vancomycin was the likely causative agent considering timing of onset of symptoms after initiation of drug. This case also describes flare-ups during the clinical course. It is unknown if prompt initiation of steroids in our patient might have caused a more rapid recovery for DRESS syndrome as one study have shown a notable symptomatic and laboratory improvement after 3 days of completing 48 h of steroid treatment . Although DRESS has been less commonly reported due to vancomycin compared to more common drugs such as anticonvulsants and allopurinol, DRESS cases related to vancomycin are rising in numbers likely from increased use for MRSA and continuous IV infusions leading to higher trough levels and hence toxicity of vancomycin . Prompt diagnosis and treatment, most importantly identifying and stopping the drug, remain to be the most important step in the management of DRESS syndrome.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】We report a case of DRESS syndrome associated with a high risk medication, vancomycin with clinical course complicated with flare of symptoms even after stopping drug. Drug exposure also overlaps with several other drugs like cefepime, daptomycin, imipenem-cilastatin, moxifloxacin and voriconzole; however, the timeline that has been described for DRESS most especially fits vancomycin exposure in this patient. This case also demonstrated reactivation of herpesvirus that has been reportedly associated with DRESS syndrome. It is possible that the addition of other drugs together with herpesvirus reactivation and absence of steroid therapy all contributed to this patient’s prolonged and complicated clinical course and associated relapse. Vancomycin, as a commonly used drug especially with increasing MRSA, warrants increased awareness of its association with DRESS, since it can prompt early recognition of symptoms and withdrawal of offending drug.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The development of an AAA, classically, begins with an abnormal smooth muscle cell response to inflammatory changes in the weakened vessel . These changes facilitate the development of atherosclerotic plaque, which causes an increased release of proteolytic enzymes such as elastase that further weakens the vessel wall leading to aneurysmal changes . Atherosclerosis, male gender, smoking, increased diastolic pressure, age (> 60 years) and family history are risk factors for development of AAA . Due to the asymptomatic presentation of most AAAs, the diagnosis is often an incidental finding on imaging . A “symptomatic” AAA usually presents with vague abdominal and/or back pain which is hypothesized to be due to peritoneal inflammation . Due to the lethal nature of the consequences associated with AAA, the awareness of the most unique presentations of this deadly diagnosis is critical to save a valuable human life.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 60-year-old paraplegic African American male presented with a 4-week history of bilateral lower extremity and scrotal edema. His review of system was positive for shortness of breath accompanied by orthopnea. Past medical and surgical history consisted of a back surgery 30 years ago, which had left him paraplegic with limited motor strength and sensation in his lower extremities. Social history was positive for a 42-pack-year smoking history, but he denied alcohol or illegal drugs. On exam, he was afebrile, tachycardic at 105 beats per minute with a blood pressure 140/88 mm Hg and 97% oxygen saturation on room air. Auscultation of lung revealed bibasilar crackles and cardiac exam showed normal heart sounds with absence of murmurs. Third heart sound was not appreciated. Jugular venous distention was absent. Abdominal exam revealed an obese and protuberant abdomen. No masses were palpable and no bruits were auscultated. Exam revealed 4+ pitting edema extending up to the thighs . Neurologic exam showed 1/5 power in bilateral lower extremities. Labs showed normal complete blood counts, renal function, and electrolytes. Chest X-ray revealed mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Duplex ultrasound of the lower extremity venous system was negative for deep venous thrombosis. On the basis of this presentation, he was diagnosed with heart failure clinically and an echocardiogram was planned for him the next day. He was started on low dose furosemide for diuresis and low dose lisinopril for afterload reduction.\n\n【4】On day 2, patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed normal left ventricular and right ventricular function with no valvular abnormalities. The findings of the echocardiogram were personally reviewed by the medical team with the cardiologist. After a multi-specialty discussion between the medical and the cardiovascular team, the thought of an intra-abdominal pathology was entertained. Though an abdominal CT scan confirmed the suspicion of an intra-abdominal pathology, the results exceeded expectations. CT showed a large AAA (8.77 cm diameter) , extending to involve bilateral common iliac arteries. The right common iliac artery was dilated to 6.16 cm and the left common iliac artery to 7.27 cm. The inferior vena cava was compressed inferiorly by the iliac aneurysms , giving rise to the bilateral lower extremity edema.\n\n【5】The patient underwent an open surgical repair with aortoiliac bypass and tolerated the surgery well. Following the surgical repair, the patient had rapid resolution of lower extremity and scrotal edema. The patient was ultimately discharged to rehabilitation.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Ruptured AAAs are a common and potentially preventable cause of death in the United States. The high mortality stems from the asymptomatic nature of presentation of most AAAs. In 2008, only 5-20% of surgically corrected AAAs were symptomatic at first presentation . Although most cases of AAA are diagnosed as incidental findings, awareness of the atypical ways of presentation is important due to the poor prognosis associated with this diagnosis. A case by Sajjad et al found a large AAA that displaced the inferior vena cava with resulting thromboembolism . Takaseya et al described an aortocaval fistula presenting with unilateral lower extremity swelling . Our patient was stable, in no pain and was not old enough to be screened for AAA. Also, the fact that the initial presentation simulated a classic presentation of new onset heart failure deterred us from the diagnosis at the time of initial presentation.\n\n【8】The US Preventative Task Force recommends screening for all men greater than the age of 65 that have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime or have a family history of AAA. The duration of smoking has been shown as an independent risk factor for an increased risk of AAA with a reduction of risk noted with smoking cessation . Some studies suggest men as young as age 50 would benefit from screening ultrasound for AAA . Recent research suggests that even with a thorough physical exam, the accuracy of abdominal palpation to detect AAA is only 68% sensitive and 75% specific. Furthermore, in patients with an abdominal girth greater than 100 cm (40 inch waistline), this specificity drops to 53% . Our patient had not been screened for AAA largely due to his age, although he did have multiple risk factors including obesity and an ongoing tobacco use. Our case also brings to question whether there is a space for more autonomy for the physician to screen AAA solely due to the poor prognosis it carries if the diagnosis is not made in a timely manner .\n\n【9】In conclusion, lower extremity edema developing over a short to intermediate time period with normal cardiac function can be a late presentation of AAA. Diagnosing AAA is challenging and often requires a critical diagnostic decision that can be missed with dire consequences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "652497b8-ffce-4a0a-9227-df18450c4ff1", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Relapse in the recovering addict is a very real concern for the individual, the family and all those involved . The first thing our patient said to us upon initial consultation was, “I’m terrified that I will re-start using and die; please help me”. The patient emphatically expressed this was her greatest concern considering that “relapse is the recovered addict’s biggest fear ”. This presents a major challenge for the anesthesiologist since opioids have been the mainstay of pain management therapy for as long as they have existed. While the risk of relapse is ever present, the dangers of poor post-operative pain management is also very real and can worsen the exact situation the patient is trying to avoid through self-medication or seeking out extra-clinically prescribed pain medication. With that said, modern anesthetic developments, techniques and attitudes allow us to provide exceptional and safe anesthetic care while respecting the patient’s autonomy and request for a narcotic-free anesthetic.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We present a case of a 28-year-old G1P0 female at 39 weeks coming for a primary cesarean delivery due to breech presentation. The past medical history was significant for extensive substance use disorder. On initial pre-operative consultation, it was discovered that the patient had oscillated between extensive drug use and rehabilitation cycles for a dozen years, experimenting with multiple illicit substances, causing her family and husband a lot of anger and strife. She underwent extensive rehabilitation and behavioral therapy through the years and was able to stabilize on maintenance dose buprenorphone + naloxone combination lozenge (Suboxone <sup>® </sup> ) 8 mg/2 mg daily. She had been on this stable dose for 2 years prior to discovering that she was pregnant and was seen in consultation 4 weeks prior to her scheduled cesarean delivery.\n\n【4】The patient’s major concern was fear of receiving opioids and relapsing back into the addiction spiral. To appropriately plan, a large multidisciplinary team comprised of her addiction specialist, the in-house pain management physician, obstetrical anesthesiologist, the patient’s obstetrician, and labor and delivery charge nurses was assembled. An exhaustive discussion was held that covered all narcotic, non-narcotic, regional and alternative options for the perioperative period. All options, possibilities and acceptable expectations were discussed at length. The patient’s family was a major support structure and with her permission, they too were involved in the final planning. After two pre-operative visits, a plan was agreed upon and the cesarean delivery was scheduled.\n\n【5】The patient was the first case of the day and she took her daily Suboxone <sup>® </sup> maintenance dose. Her extended family and husband were present and provided immense support prior to her being transferred into the operating room (OR).\n\n【6】In the OR, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors were applied to the patient. She was properly positioned and an epidural was placed at the T8 level via loss of resistance to air technique. The catheter was threaded and a test dose was administered, which was negative for intravascular or intrathecal placement. This was followed by a spinal block with a 27-g pencil-point needle at the L4-L5 level. The 1.6 mL of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine (12 mg) with 200 µg epinephrine was administered. After confirming a bilateral T5 sensory spinal level, the cesarean section was uneventfully performed and a healthy baby was delivered.\n\n【7】After closure, the anesthesia team performed bilateral ultrasound-guided transverse abdominal plane blocks with a total of 15 mL 0.2% ropivacaine per side. The patient was then transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and an infusion of 0.0625% of bupivacaine at 6 mL/h was started in the epidural. She was also given ketorolac 15 mg and acetaminophen 1,000 mg IV every 6 h for the next 24 h.\n\n【8】The patient was seen the following morning for her post-operative check with her epidural having been running for 18 h. She had been out of bed to her chair, starting in the prior evening with minimal discomfort. Her IV ketorolac and IV acetaminophen were switched to oral ibuprofen 400 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 h in addition to her daily maintenance Suboxone <sup>® </sup> . After expressing a desire to be free from the epidural, the infusion was paused, and then removed 4 h later, after experiencing minimal pain.\n\n【9】The remainder of the patient’s stay was unremarkable. She went home on post-operative day 2, having received no narcotics besides her maintenance Suboxone <sup>® </sup> dose throughout her entire perioperative stay. Her pain scores were minimal and she was very enthusiastic and satisfied with her care. She expressed immense gratitude and on serial follow-ups we were advised that the patient was doing great at home with no pain, not having taken any medication at all besides her daily maintenance Suboxone <sup>® </sup> .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】With the ongoing epidemic of opioid abuse, the frequency with which anesthesiologists will encounter these patients in the perioperative setting will continue to increase. For women who are no longer using illicit substances, the fear of relapse is substantial and not to be taken lightly. This presents challenges for the anesthesiologist who must navigate patients through major painful surgeries while simultaneously respecting the patient’s autonomy and wishes for a narcotic-free anesthetic.\n\n【12】Navigating a recovering polysubstance abuser through a narcotic-free anesthetic relies heavily on the use of regional anesthesia. Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure performed in the United States accounting for roughly one-third of all deliveries. Post-cesarean pain management can be a considerable challenge, especially in those being treated for opioid dependence . Adequate post-cesarean pain management couples regional or neuraxial blockade with a multimodal drug regimen. Scheduled administration of opioid-sparing adjuncts is recommended for all women post-cesarean delivery as they have an additive or synergistic benefit. Individually, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to decrease opioid consumption by 30-50% and acetaminophen has been shown to decrease opioid consumption by 20% in healthy patients . An observational study by Hoyt et al showed significant analgesia in patients who received an infusion of bupivacaine 0.1% with clonidine 1.2 µg/mL for 24 - 27 h postoperatively in opioid addicted parturients taking buprenorphine .\n\n【13】Other multimodal adjuncts have proven efficacious in abdominal surgery but have not been studied specifically in the obstetric population. Intraoperative glucocorticoids decrease narcotic requirement but may lead to hyperglycemia. Gabapentin has been used for multiple procedures but may have undesired maternal-fetal transfer. Ketamine has been used successfully for its narcotic-sparing property and aiding with withdrawal symptoms; however, a recent paper published by Williams suggests ketamine may activate the opioid system which may be less than ideal in populations seeking to avoid opioid medications .\n\n【14】Regional blocks beyond neuraxial techniques are likely to be the major source of analgesia. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block by itself or coupled with an ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric block has been used with success for postoperative analgesia . More recently, the quadratus lumborum (QL) block has been utilized for abdominal procedures. A study by Mieszkowski showed a decrease in morphine consumption over 48 h coupled with lower intensity pain scores over the same amount of time for women given QL1 blocks after cesarean deliveries . When comparing the TAP versus the QL block for cesarean section, Blanco et al found that the QL block significantly decreased morphine consumption over 48 h .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Above all, the decision and planning involves frank discussions between the patient and their anesthesiologist. Contemporary health care ethics is based on principles of autonomy, non-malfeasance, beneficence and justice. Patient autonomy is the hallmark of current medical decision-making, and it supplants the long-standing practice of paternalism epitomized by the Hippocratic Oath. Evolution of patient-centered decision making is credited to human rights principles espoused in the Nuremberg Code and the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among others . In fact, American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics begins with this foundation in human rights: “A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical care with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights ”. Patient autonomy respects patients’ rights. Autonomy is fundamentally patient-centered asking “what does the patient want?” Therefore, the physician is a resource to assist the patient’s informed, self-determined choice.\n\n【17】While these principles seem simple, clinical practice reveals more nuance. Patient autonomy is predicated on capacity, namely ability to comprehend the information and ability to evaluate consequences of a decision rationally . Presuming capacity criteria are met, and the situation is free of coercion, then informed decision making further requires: 1) presentation of material information; 2) options and recommendation and 3) understanding by the patient . Regarding these latter elements, innate bias of the physician can affect what is presented (or not) and how the options are framed regarding risks and benefits. In other words, clinical application of autonomy becomes more difficult because the physician might exclude some options or discount other options’ valuation inappropriately relative to the patient’s value system. Still, this bias must be overcome. One example, as discussed above, is when a patient requests a relatively narcotic-free anesthetic in situations where narcotic use is the perioperative norm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "95ca82a7-70e8-4a0e-94f3-24ec27fef019", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated immune-mediated destruction of platelets . The etiology of ITP is still unknown, and the diagnosis remains exclusionary. In 80% of the cases it may present alone (primary) or with other associated (secondary) clinical conditions, such as viral and bacterial infections or changes in immune status . Identifying trigger factors that cause ITP is extremely difficult, and a variety of viral infections have been associated with ITP, among which the most common ones are the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus. In this context, no data regarding infection of the SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbation of previous ITP treated with splenectomy have been recently published.\n\n【2】Here, we present a clinical case of exacerbation of ITP related to COVID-19, a disease whose causative agent is a virus of Coronaviridae family, and a producer of respiratory and systemic disease, which could progress to a severe form of pneumonia in 10-15% of patients .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 46-year-old man diagnosed with ITP since childhood and submitted to splenectomy at age of 9 years, had stabilized platelet levels between around 50,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> without any further treatment. Recently, in March 2020 the patient presented with a history of odynophagia, headache, and fever with dry cough for a couple of days. At this time, no shortness of breath was documented. On physical examination, lungs were clear and respiratory frequency was normal. Petechiae throughout lower limbs were found.\n\n【5】Initial laboratory showed platelets of 9,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and D-dimer of 630 (normal range up to 500 ng/mL), with no other tests abnormalities. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharynx swab was positive while other viral studies (influenza, parainfluenza and dengue virus) were negative. Chest tomography revealed incipient peribronchovascular micronodular opacities in the periphery of the lower lobe of the left lung, suggesting a tenuous inflammatory/infectious process. Despite the previous history of ITP, new tests for HIV, hepatitis C and B were done and came negative. Bone marrow aspirate showed normocellular with no morphological changes. In order to avoid high dose corticosteroids, we started treatment with a single course of intravenous human immunoglobulin 1 g/kg and eltrombopag 50 mg daily. No antimicrobial treatment or any other therapy for COVID-19 was given.\n\n【6】After 3 days of treatment, platelets levels increased to 36,000/m <sup>3 </sup> and the patient was discharged from the hospital in very good health condition, without fever or cough. Fifteen days after discharge, no SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected and platelets count was 320,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The relationship between acute and chronic infections and the development of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia represent a widely unexplored paradigm, and response to an infectious agent could result in loss of immune self-regulation. The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenic purpura with infection involves several immunological pathways, as well as non-immune mechanisms that accelerate platelet destruction.\n\n【9】Noteworthy, during infections other potential causes of thrombocytopenia should always be considered, for example, hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia (HCV) may also result from liver cirrhosis, leading to portal hypertension and hypersplenism and/or decreased liver production of thrombopoietin . However, the relationship between the infectious agent and the development of thrombocytopenia is clearly demonstrated by improvements in platelet levels following successful treatment of the underlying infection .\n\n【10】Regarding acute infections, it has long been suspected that an acute event may be a trigger for the onset of primary ITP. In newly diagnosed ITP, there is usually a history of symptoms that can be attributed to infection in the days or weeks before diagnosis. In some cases, a pathogen is detected (e.g. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza virus, varicella-zoster virus), which qualifies these cases as secondary ITP. However, in most acute cases of ITP, a pathogen is not identified .\n\n【11】SARS-CoV-2 was identified in late 2019 as the cause of a set of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has spread rapidly, resulting in a pandemic crisis. Morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are largely due to acute viral pneumonitis that could progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however most patients are oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic .\n\n【12】Several newly published articles relate platelet count and acute infection by the new corona virus . Recently, a Chinese meta-analysis associated thrombocytopenia with severe infection by the new coronavirus. This meta-analysis demonstrated that thrombocytopenia is common in critically ill patients and usually suggests malfunction or physiological decompensation, as well as the development of intravascular coagulopathy, often evolving to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In patients with COVID-19, the mechanism for patients with thrombocytopenia is likely to be multifactorial. In SARS, it was suggested that the combination of viral infection and mechanical ventilation would lead to endothelial damage, triggering platelet activation, aggregation and thrombosis in the lung, causing widespread platelet consumption. Coronavirus can also directly infect bone marrow elements, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis or trigger an autoimmune response against blood cells .\n\n【13】In another publication with 47 cases of COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia, leukopenia (14%), lymphopenia (34%), lymphocytosis (11%) and thrombocytopenia (36%) were reported . In our case, the patient had a previous diagnosis of ITP treated with splenectomy, and although with very low platelets, no signs of clinical severity related to the new coronavirus were present. Due to the paucity of data regarding this pandemic virus together with an unprecedented fast knowledge acquisition worldwide we highlight the importance of this case report of a pre-existing ITP exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\n【14】Because it is an emerging disease, we still do not have sufficient data relating ITP to the new coronavirus.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】Our case suggests COVID-19 as a causal factor of worsening previous ITP, with temporal correlation present and exclusion of other clinical conditions. Further studies are needed on the interaction of the new coronavirus with complications of the hematopoietic system, as in this particular case, thrombocytopenic purpura.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "c8a5e417-5eae-483e-a694-a1bc6731e574", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hypercalcemia in granulomatous diseases is well described but rarely symptomatic , with elevated serum calcium levels reported in up to 16% of patients with tuberculosis (TB) in the United States . Hypercalcemia in TB may be more common in tropical settings, however, with up to 27.5% of TB patients in Nigeria presenting with hypercalcemia in a recent series. Of the hypercalcemic subset, only 12% experienced symptoms . No difference in hypercalcemia incidence has been described between pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB , although the highest reported serum calcium level in the literature to date was 15 mg/dL in a patient with tuberculous peritonitis .\n\n【2】Hypercalcemia in granulomatous diseases is proposed to be the result of extra-renal conversion of dietary 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 to the active 1,25-vitamin D3 (calcitriol), independent of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a mechanism best described in sarcoidosis . Calcitriol has a favorable adaptive response by inhibiting IL-2 and interferon-γ and mediating inflammation . Elaboration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by granulomata may represent an additional mechanism for hypercalcemia; this mechanism has been described in sarcoidosis  and coccidiomycosis  but not in TB to date. Hypercalcemia, as a manifestation of sarcoidosis, frequently resolves with glucocorticoids, but to our knowledge, this is only the third case report of steroid treatment for hypercalcemia secondary to TB.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 25-year-old Filipino male with a history of developmental delay and chronic renal disease with proteinuria presented to his nephrologist for a routine appointment. The patient had no subjective complaints, but record review confirmed a weight loss of 10 kg compared to the prior year. He had a dry cough but denied hemoptysis or shortness of breath. On examination, he was under-nourished with a body mass index of 18.4 in addition to bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A serum chemistry panel obtained on the day of evaluation revealed hypercalcemia (15.4 mg/dL, normal 8.9 - 10.4 mg/dL).\n\n【5】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for intravenous hydration and diuretic therapy. A chest radiograph demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy with a lingular airspace opacity; a contrast-enhanced computed tomogram (CT) of the chest and neck demonstrated additional tree-and-bud opacities  with diffuse cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . Diagnostic studies were significant for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculous antigen, multiple negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and a negative serum human immunodeficiency virus enzyme immunoassay. His PTH was appropriately low at 2.91 pg/mL (normal 15 - 65 pg/mL) with a normal PTHrP of 20 pg/mL (normal 14 - 27 pg/mL). However, he was noted to have an elevated level of 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (84 nmol/L, normal 18 - 72 nmol/L) and a low level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (12 nmol/L, normal 35 - 80 nmol/L). A lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation, without evidence of AFB by Ziehl-Niessen staining.\n\n【6】Based on high clinical suspicion for active TB, the patient was empirically started on treatment for TB with rifampin, isoniazide (INH), pyrazinamide and ethambutol during the hospital admission. Seven weeks after presentation, cultures of sputum and the lymph node grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis with isolated resistance to INH. Moxifloxacin was subsequently added to his regimen and INH discontinued. His serum calcium levels normalized at discharge to 8.1 mg/dL following rehydration with furosemide diuresis. He remained asymptomatic and was afebrile without cough and achieved a 3-kg weight gain over the first 2 months of treatment. Surveillance sputum AFB cultures after 8 weeks of therapy revealed no growth.\n\n【7】Despite his apparent improvement, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted, and his calcium levels increased to 10.3 mg/dL despite use of oral furosemide. After 6 months of therapy, he was treated with prednisone 20 mg/day × 21 days followed by a 7-day taper which resolved his calcium issue to 8.8 mg/dL and his follow on calcitriol had reduced to 16 nmol/L. His calcium levels remained within normal limits over the next several months of treatment, he regained 15 kg and his lymph nodes ultimately regressed.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Our patient had chronic and asymptomatic hypercalcemia with adenopathy that persisted despite antituberculous therapy and loop diuretics, with an excellent clinical response to prednisone. Data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as a therapy for TB-related hypercalcemia are limited. Previous case reports have described pulmonary TB with symptomatic, refractory hypercalcemia  and skeletal TB with hypercalcemia  successfully treated with glucocorticoids. Although not routine practice outside of specific syndromes such as meningitis or pericarditis, there are increasing data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in TB. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall reduction in TB mortality of 17% (RR: 0.83) with the use of adjunctive glucocorticoids, including a statistically significant mortality benefit with meningitis and pericarditis. These conclusions are limited by the inclusion of both randomized and non-randomized trials and a lack of overall statistical significance . Additionally, the randomized trials utilized older regimens which are not consistent with today’s standard of care and no study specifically identified either TB adenopathy or hypercalcemia. This case displays the potential utility of glucocorticoids as a treatment option in refractory TB adenopathy with hypercalcemia. Aside from meningitis and pericarditis, further data are needed to better evaluate the role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of the complications of TB including hypercalcemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Chronic inflammation, mucosa injury, mucosa regeneration, and mural fibrosis may lead to enteritis cystic profunda, a rare non-neoplastic condition characterized by misplaced glands deep to the muscularis mucosae of the small bowel which may cause stricture radiographically or obstruction clinically . Chronic inflammation of mucosa (chronic enteritis) in Crohn’s disease also increases the risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma via an inflammation-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence . Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinomas have been reported to have an endometriosis-like invasion pattern and manifest gastric differentiation in the majority of cases . This is further supported by positive immunohistochemistry staining for gastric markers, MUC5AC and MUC6 . Dysplasia has been reported to be present in at least 50% of Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma  and overexpression of p53 has been noted in 60% of Crohn’s disease-associated dysplasia .\n\n【2】In patients with Crohn’s disease, both enteritis cystica profunda and small bowel adenocarcinoma can occur and share similar clinical presentations, i.e. obstruction and/or stricture, thus they should be differentiated from each other. Recently, one case of colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease was reported as a potential diagnostic pitfall . But neoplastic involvement of enteritis cystica profunda in Crohn’s disease has not been reported in the literature. Herein, we report the first case of dysplasia involving enteritis cystica profunda in the setting of Crohn’s disease. Our report highlights the diagnostic rarity and difficulty of this entity.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 68-year-old female with a long history of Crohn’s disease presented to our hospital for further evaluation of abdominal pain of 1-year duration. She had an exploratory laparotomy in 1979 for a pelvic cyst and abdominal pain and was found to have Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum and underwent an appendectomy and isolated small bowel resection (10 - 12 cm) with handsewn end-to-end anastomosis sparing the ileocecal valve. After surgery, she felt well, and had an average of 3 - 4 bowel movements per day with minimal pain on no Crohn’s therapy. She was not feeling well for some time, but did not seek medical attention until the year prior to surgery. She began having increased cramping abdominal pain and borborygmi and returned to the gastroenterologist. She underwent colonoscopy and was found to have a stricture at the anastomosis. She had occasional diarrhea, but overall continued having 4 - 5 bowel movements per day. She reportedly had lost some weight and weighed 100 lb at the time of surgery. She had not tried Crohn’s medications other than prednisone and budesonide in the past year. Budesonide helped with the bloating and pain but was too expensive. Lialda and azathioprine were not helpful in symptom relief in the past.\n\n【5】The patient’s past medical history was remarkable for ovarian failure, thyrotoxicosis (Grave’s disease, status post ablation), calculus of kidney (calcium oxylate), osteoporosis, benign essential hypertension, cholelithiasis, and thrombocytosis. The patient’s social history was remarkable for being a former smoker (20 pack years), quit 17 years ago.\n\n【6】On physical examination, she was very thin, but appeared well nourished. Her abdomen was soft and flat without distension. There was right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or rigidity. No hepatomegaly or masses were noted. Her bowel sounds were normal. Laboratory tests showed slight hypoalbumin at 3.4 g/dL, slightly low total protein at 5.9 g/dL, normal ALT at 16 U/L and AST at 28 U/L, and normal total bilirubin at 0.4 mg/dL. Her hemoglobin was normal at 12.1 g/dL and white cell count (WBC) was at 5,260/μL.\n\n【7】Colonoscopy did not reveal Crohn’s disease in the colon; however, terminal ileal intubation was not possible. Computed tomography (CT) enterography with oral contrast showed dilated proximal small bowel with fecalization and air fluid levels with a 10 cm edematous and thick walled stricture of the terminal ileum. Inflammation of the fat adjacent to the terminal ileum and enlarged ileocecal lymph node were also present. There was neither abscess nor pneumoperitoneum. There was no colonic thickening or pericolonic inflammation.\n\n【8】The patient underwent a single incision laparoscopic ileocolic resection. There were few adhesions from her prior surgery, and the terminal ileal disease was easily identified and dissected from the retroperitoneum. The small bowel was run and significant strictures at the prior anastomosis site as well as 10 cm proximal to that were identified. The remainder of the small bowel and colon appeared normal. An end to side stapled anastomosis was performed. The mesentery was taken close to the bowel wall to avoid mesenteric hematoma in the inflamed Crohn’s mesentery.\n\n【9】Macroscopic findings\n\n【10】The specimen consisted of a segment of ileum and colon measuring 27.0 cm in length. There was mild fibrous adhesion on the serosa of the small bowel. The serosal aspect of the colon was smooth and glistening. An area of stricture was present between the segment of ileum and colon and the bowel circumference at this point measured 2.0 cm. Proximally, the bowel appeared dilated measuring up to 12.0 cm in circumference. No areas of induration, hemorrhage, or abscess cavities were identified. The mucosal surface particularly within the area of the stricture demonstrated areas of ulceration and hemorrhage. No masses or lesions were identified macroscopically. Polyps were not present. The muscularis propria appeared thickened, particularly within the area of the stricture, measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. The colon was macroscopically unremarkable. The stricture segment was entirely submitted for histologically examination.\n\n【11】Microscopic findings\n\n【12】As shown in Figure 1A , sections from the stricture showed chronic active enteritis with extensive ulceration, submucosal and mural fibrosis, hypertrophy of muscular wall, transmural inflammation including prominent lymphoid aggregates, neural hypertrophy, and fibrous adhesions. Most remarkably, there were many, variably sized, cysts or diverticulum predominantly lined by small bowel type mucosa. Some of the cysts were seen in the deep portion of the muscularis propria and in the subserosa . Rare cysts were partially ulcerated and lined by granulation tissue.\n\n【13】The small bowel mucosa lining the cysts was chronically and actively inflamed and the epithelium resembling pyloric glands was composed of cuboidal cells. However, these cuboidal cells were monotonous, had relatively high nucleus to cytoplasm (N/C) ratio, and did not show surface maturation . Some of the cells had thickened nuclear membranes and a single prominent nucleolus. Focal nuclear pleomorphism and loss of nuclear polarity were also noted . Mitotic figures were readily identifiable. The mucosa overlying the strictured segment showed marked chronic active enteritis with high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma of gastric type . The mucosa from the area adjacent to the stricture showed chronic active enteritis with focal pyloric gland metaplasia  and areas of low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia resembling the epithelial lining of the enteritis cystic profunda . In addition, intramucosal adenocarcinoma was also noted in the adjacent surface mucosa (not shown). No granulomas were identified.\n\n【14】The antibodies used for immunohistochemical analysis were shown in Table 1 .\n\n【15】Immunohistochemistry for p53 showed diffuse and strong nuclear immunoreactivity in the epithelium of the enteritis cystica profunda  as well as its overlying mucosa  and adjacent mucosa, supporting the neoplastic nature of the epithelium. As shown in Figure 5A-F , the lesional epithelium showed strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for gastric markers, MUC5AC and MUC6 in addition to CK7, but only weak and focal immunoreactivity for intestinal marker CDX2 or colonic markers MUC2 and CK20 .\n\n【16】The patient had been doing well without evidence of recurrent cancer or metastasis at 9 months after surgery.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Small bowel adenocarcinoma is an important and potentially fatal complication of long-term Crohn’s disease of the small bowel and about 60% of these patients present with small bowel obstruction . Similarly, enteritis cystica profunda can occur as a rare complication of Crohn’s disease, clinically and radiographically mimicking Crohn’s disease-associated adenocarcinoma. Histologically, both are characterized by glands infiltrating beyond the muscularis mucosae . Differentiation of these two entities is usually straightforward in most cases but can be challenging in rare cases. Dysplasia involving enteritis cystica profunda has not been reported, and would potentially complicate the diagnosis.\n\n【19】One case of colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease had been reported previously . In this case report, the authors reported the presence of a stricture associated with a multilocular cystic lesion containing colonic-wall dissecting mucin-filled glands which had lobulated architecture and were invested by lamina propria. However, the glandular epithelium within this cystic lesion showed focal nuclear crowding, enlargement, and hyperchromasia, with increased N/C ratio, but with largely preserved polarity. By immunohistochemistry, this atypical glandular epithelium showed focal positivity for CK7 and p53 with increased MIB-1 staining. The case report was reported as colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease. Although one case of intramucosal adenocarcinoma involvement of diverticula in Crohn’s disease has been reported, enteritis cystica profunda with dysplasia has not been reported .\n\n【20】Here we present the first case of enteritis cystic profunda with dysplasia in a patient with long-term Crohn’s disease as an unexpected diagnosis. Clinically, the patient was thought to have a benign stricture due to Crohn’s disease. Grossly, the involved segment showed stricture and thickening of small bowel but without obvious cysts or mucin pools. However, sections through the stricture clearly showed cysts and diverticula lined by chronically and actively inflamed small intestinal type mucosa including appreciable lamina propria in the muscularis propria and subserosa. The overall configuration of the cysts and diverticula was round and lobular. In addition, the cysts and diverticulae-lining epithelium showed uniform cuboid cells with high-grade dysplasia of gastric differentiation, both histologically and immunophenotypically. The presence of dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma of gastric type in the overlying mucosa and the adjacent mucosa further supported the interpretation of neoplastic involvement of enteritis cystic profunda in this case. The neoplastic/dysplastic nature of this lesion was further supported by the diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for p53, which had been reported previously in Crohn’s enteritis-associated dysplasia/adenocarcinoma . The major differential diagnosis for this case included a deeply invasive, well-differentiated, adenocarcinoma (the so-called “intestinal low-grade tubuloglandular adenocarcinoma” in inflammatory bowel disease  and an endometriosis-like adenocarcinoma) . Importantly, the lobular contour of the lesion and the presence of lamina propria in these deeply situated cysts/diverticula provide reassurance that this is not an invasive adenocarcinoma.\n\n【21】It can be argued that this case may not represent an enteritis cystica profunda, commonly described as cysts lined by mucinous epithelium with or without mucin pool. However, the current case had many variably sized cysts deeply situated in the muscularis propria and subserosa. These findings fit a broad definition of enteritis cystica profunda, i.e. the presence of misplaced glands deep to the muscularis mucosae of the small bowel and yet still lined by lamina propria. The lack of mucin may be due to the neoplastic replacement of the cyst lining epithelium which may have less mucin-secreting capacity.\n\n【22】This case shows several points of interest. First, this high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma occurred in a patient of an older rather than young age. The mean age at onset of Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma in one report is 48 years . Second, this neoplastic process extensively involves the enteritis cystica profunda. Third, the neoplastic epithelium shows marked gastric differentiation, both histomorphologically and immunophenotypically. This finding is consistent with previous observations and reports that Crohn enteritis-associated small bowel dysplasia and adenocarcinomas tend to exhibit gastric differentiation . The lobular contour of the lesion and the presence of lamina propria in the deeply situated cysts and diverticula helped rule out invasive adenocarcinoma. In addition, a finding of pyloric gland metaplasia, dysplasia of gastric type, and intramucosal adenocarcinoma (in the mucosa overlying and adjacent to the enteritis cystica profunda) supports a gastric metaplasia-carcinoma hypothesis in Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel tumorigenesis, as suggested in previous case reports or series . Finally, an awareness of this unique form of small intestinal dysplasia, i.e. gastric type, may help avoid underdiagnosing this as non-neoplastic epithelium on frozen sections when the surgeon submits tissue from the strictured small bowel segment before performing strictureplasty, an alternative management option for some Crohn’s patients with stricture.\n\n【23】In summary, we report the first case of enteritis cystica profunda involved by high-grade dysplasia of gastric type in one patient with Crohn’s disease presenting with small bowel obstruction. Adequate sampling of the strictured area and the adjacent mucosa as well as an awareness of this rare entity is essential for the correct diagnosis. Attention to the overall configuration and the composition of the deeply situated cysts and diverticula help avoid misdiagnosing it as a deeply invasive adenocarcinoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "ad0b2bc2-0087-42fb-910b-6c358da632fd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented increase in mortality globally since 2019 . Patients with COVID-19 primarily present with respiratory manifestations as the virus mainly targets the respiratory system . The predilection of SARS-CoV-2 for the respiratory system may be in part due to underlying respiratory comorbidities. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain have also been reported in patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 . The etiology of the GI symptoms exhibited by patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is not well understood; however involvement of the GI tract has been reflected by fecal samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients . It is likely that chronic functional GI disorders may similarly predispose the patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the GI tract and may manifest as a flare-up of their underlying disorder. We report a case of a 31-year-old female with a history of gastroparesis who presented with intractable vomiting. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the patient was thought to have a flare-up of her gastroparesis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 31-year-old female with a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and diabetic gastroparesis presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of abdominal pain and intractable vomiting for the past 12 h. She was diagnosed with diabetes 10 years back and takes insulin. Patient was diagnosed with gastroparesis via gastric emptying scan 3 years ago. Patient reported that her last flare-up was 2 years back and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days with improvement in her symptoms on metoclopramide. On this admission, the patient reported severe, constant, diffuse abdominal pain without any aggravating or relieving factors. She also reported having 10 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting mainly containing food particles. She denied any fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, numbness in her hands and feet, fever, or chill. Review of systems was negative for any other complaint. The patient also reported she lived with her mother who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 days ago. Vital signs on admission showed temperature of 37.0 °C, respiratory rate 22/min, heart rate 90/min, blood pressure 139/89 mm Hg, and saturating 98% on room air. Respiratory and cardiac examination was normal. Her abdomen was soft, diffusely tender, non-distended, without any rebound tenderness or guarding with normal bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly or flank tenderness was noted.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】Initial labs did not show any electrolyte abnormality. A nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen was also positive. Her inflammatory markers including D-dimer, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were markedly elevated. Her labs at the time of admission are shown in Table 1 . The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave abnormalities. The chest X-ray showed multiple patchy areas of consolidation at the lung bases. The X-ray of the abdomen showed a normal bowel gas pattern with paucity of small bowel gas. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast was positive for mild changes associated with COVID-19 as shown in Figure 1 .\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Patient was started on low residual small frequent meals. Tight glucose control was ensured. The gastroenterology service was consulted, and she was diagnosed with gastroparesis flare secondary to medication non-compliance. She was started on pantoprazole, ondansetron, and prophylactic anticoagulation. She was not given remdesivir or dexamethasone. Over the course of the hospital stay the patient’s symptoms did not improve, and she continued to complain of nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron was switched to metoclopramide with only mild improvement of symptoms. She reported that her symptoms were significantly severe as compared to her previous gastroparesis flare and were not improving with pharmacological therapy. On day 3 the administration of metoclopramide was changed to standing medication and trimethobenzamide was added. She reported improvement in her symptoms on day 7 with her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was also negative.\n\n【9】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【10】She was discharged on day 11 with 2 weeks of anticoagulation and metoclopramide with follow-up in 2 weeks. On the follow-up gastroenterology visit the patient reported improvement in her symptoms.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in China which was declared a pandemic due to the fast-spreading respiratory viral disease named COVID-19 . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta group of coronaviruses (CoVs) . The CoVs belong to a large family of single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleotide RNA viruses . COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs and can present with self-limiting symptoms including fever, dyspnea, fatigue and dry cough. GI symptoms and renal involvement have also been reported in some patients with COVID-19 . The GI symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients can also harbor the virus for a period of 2 - 14 days without any symptoms . Severe form of the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death making an early diagnosis substantial to prevent these complications . Given that the notable percentage of COVID-19 patients present with GI symptoms, screening patients with GI manifestations for COVID-19 remains essential.\n\n【13】The pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the GI tract is poorly understood due to the limited knowledge of the effects of CoVs on the GI system. It is postulated that the first step of viral entry into the enterocytes occurs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein . ACE-2 is mostly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells, Leydig cells and renal tubular epithelium; it is also detected in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelium. This might be the potential point of entry of the virus into the GI tract. The virus then replicates inside the cells and is released . This mechanism might also be the cause of inter-organ dissemination after the initial inoculation given the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors on multiple organ systems . This can also suggest that underlying comorbidities play a role in the pathogenesis of the virus . In a meta-analysis consisting of 1,576 patients, previous respiratory system pathologies were the most prevalent comorbidity reported in COVID-19 patients primarily presenting with pulmonary symptoms . This might also be the reason why our patient presented solely with GI symptoms despite the evidence of pulmonary disease on imaging. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of infected individuals upto 10 weeks after initial symptoms. Therefore COVID-19 may continue to shed the virus through stool long after the resolution of pulmonary symptoms . Cytokines like interleukin 2, 10 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) have previously been involved in GI health and disease. The release of these cytokines in the GI tract of patients with COVID-19 may also be involved in the damage of the GI tract .\n\n【14】Our patient had mild pulmonary symptoms; however her underlying gastroparesis may have predisposed her to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the GI tract as indicated by her symptom severity. The symptoms were refractory to pharmacological therapy and improved along the course of the COVID-19 disease. Although it is possible that her symptoms are independent of the COVID-19 infection and associated with her uncontrolled diabetes; however, the severity of the disease and no significant improvement in her symptoms after pharmacological therapy and better glycemic control, raised the question of different triggers for her exacerbation. Viruses have been implicated in pathogenesis and exacerbation of functional GI disorders. Our patient reported improvement in her symptoms after 7 days and subsequently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Based on her clinical course, SARS-CoV-2 is the likely scenario in this case. The proposed mechanism of viral-induced gastroparesis is through an acute injury to either interstitial cells of Cajal in the stomach or neural innervation leading to delayed gastric emptying . Kim et al found that patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and concomitant cytomegalovirus (CMV) have a higher rate of hospitalization for exacerbations as compared to UC alone . Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect COVID-19 as a nidus to flare-up. Gastroparesis flare can also be caused by medications, surgery, recreational drugs, and hypothyroidism. The thyroid profile was normal in our patient. She did not report taking any new medication or recreational drugs and did not have any recent surgery. Our patient also had significant improvement in her symptoms with the natural disease course of COVID-19.\n\n【15】This unique case illustrates that COVID-19 can present with exacerbated symptoms of an underlying pathology and should be kept in mind in case of a flare-up of a disease. Further studies are needed to determine if patients with chronic GI pathologies are at higher risk of infection of the GI tract and to formulate a guideline-directed medical therapy.\n\n【16】Learning points\n\n【17】This case illustrates that COVID-19 can present as a severe flare-up of a chronic GI disease. Our patient had a severe gastroparesis flare-up concomitantly with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Improvements in her symptoms were noted with natural disease progression of COVID-19. A low threshold of suspicion for COVID-19 disease in patients with GI manifestations should be maintained especially in case of an exacerbation of an underlying chronic disorder. Further insight is required not only for early diagnosis and intervention but also to improve mortality in this patient population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "d6fa05bf-2410-436e-b6ec-0ca007b68bb0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Metastatic cardiac tumors are commonly found in 7.1-9.1% of autopsied patients with cancer and 2.3-18.3% of all autopsied patients . It is common to find metastasis of lung cancer in hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, liver, bones, and brain. Although lung cancer often leads to distant metastasis, myocardial metastasis is rarely diagnosed before death. Since most cardiac metastases appear in patients with advanced stages of the disease, limited treatment options lead to a poor prognosis. Metastatic cardiac tumors can cause heart failure, ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia, conduction disorders, syncope, embolism, and pericardial effusion. Rare cases of ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to metastatic cardiac tumors have been reported . Not infrequently, metastatic cardiac tumor invasion becomes a cause of death in affected patient.\n\n【2】We here report a patient who was diagnosed with myocardial metastasis, which was evidenced by an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) during the treatment of advanced squamous cell lung cancer and frequent episodes of sustained VT during the disease course and was difficult to treat.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient was a 56-year-old Japanese woman. She had a 36-year smoking history, smoking 20 cigarettes per day. In May 2018, the patient experienced left back pain. As there was no improvement in the pain intensity, she decided to visit our hospital to undergo consultation. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the S <sup>1+2 </sup> apex area of the left upper lobe. The tumor was diagnosed as squamous cell lung cancer by transbronchial biopsy. After detailed examination, the cancer was classified as c-T3N1M1b, stage IVA in the eighth edition staging system of Union for International Cancer Control -TNM classification. The tumor was negative for both epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) fusion gene, and the tumor proportion score (TPS) of programmed cell death protein-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) was high expression (TPS 70%) (22C3 pharmDx assay). Due to the occurrence of severe left back pain and invasion of tumor in the chest wall at the apex of the lung, local treatment was prioritized, although the tumor was at stage IVA. The patient received thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions at 2 Gy per fraction) concurrent with weekly carboplatin (area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC): 2) plus paclitaxel (40 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) for 6 weeks. The patient also received radiotherapy for right femoral metastasis. Denosumab was administered as treatment for bone metastasis, and oxycodone was administered as treatment for left back pain.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】In August of the same year, she was admitted to undergo chemotherapy. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.6 °C, heart rate was 70 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure was 110/58 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. No lymphadenopathy was noted. On auscultation, her lung sounds were clear, and her heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. Results of the laboratory test on admission showed mild anemia (hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL). Biochemical tests showed no abnormal values. With regard to the tumor markers, the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (37.9 ng/dL) and cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA) level (9.2 ng/dL) were relatively high. Chest X-ray images on admission showed the presence of a tumor in the left upper lung field. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest  showed a 65 × 45 mm lesion with a heterogeneous contrast effect in S <sup>1+2 </sup> in the left upper lobe. It also showed tumor invasion in the chest wall. A 12-lead ECG showed poor R wave progression in leads V1-3, negative T waves in leads III, aVF, and V1-4 . Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a hypoechoic tumor in the right ventricular cavity . In addition, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed normal wall motion, no valvular disease, and no pericardial effusion.\n\n【8】Contrast-enhanced cardiac CT showed a 35 × 33 mm hypodense tumor in the right ventricular wall and ventricular septum . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a tumor with high intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images  and with isointensity to the myocardium on T1-weighted images  in the right ventricular wall. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT performed in June 2018 showed a strong FDG accumulation with a maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of 6.14 in the right ventricular septum. Cardiac catheterization was performed, and coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. Although myocardial biopsy was performed in the right ventricular wall, no malignant finding was detected. After a detailed examination of the abnormal findings on ECG performed upon admission, the patient was clinically diagnosed with right ventricular metastasis from lung cancer; however, pathological findings ware not obtained to confirm this diagnosis.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】Chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC 5, day 1, every 3 weeks) plus oral S-1(100 mg/day, twice per day, day 1 - 14) was initiated. After discharge from the hospital, she received two courses of chemotherapy as outpatient treatment. However, intrapulmonary, hepatic, and adrenal metastases were observed; hence, she was judged to have progressive disease. In October of the same year, nivolumab treatment (240 mg/body, every 2 weeks) was started.\n\n【11】After three courses of nivolumab treatment, the patient was brought to the emergency department due to complaints of body malaise and increasing dyspnea intensity in November. The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 (E4V4M6); however, her pulse was difficult to palpate, and she was in a state of shock. An ECG performed at the time of visit showed sustained VT (heart rate: 160 bpm). Amiodarone was administered, but the patient did not show a positive response to the treatment. After delivery of cardioversion (biphasic, 100 J), sinus rhythm was restored. After the restoration of sinus rhythm, an ECG revealed the absence of QT prolongation, and TEE showed normal wall motion. The serum levels of cardiac troponin T (< 0.1 ng/mL) and creatine kinase (87 U/L) were normal. Serum electrolyte levels (Na: 132 mmol/L, K: 3.9 mmol/L, Cl: 98 mmol/L, corrected Ca: 9.6 mg/dL) and thyroid hormone levels (thyroid-stimulating hormone: 2.93 µIU/mL, free thyroxine: 1.33 ng/dL, free triiodothyronine: 2.51 pg/mL) were also in the normal range. She was treated with oral amiodarone and bisoprolol. However, the patient experienced frequent episodes of sustained VT with no triggers ; delivery of cardioversion effectively terminated the sustained VT.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】The patient’s performance status (PS) worsened, making it difficult to continue pharmacotherapy for lung cancer. Hence, she only received palliative treatment. The patient’s condition gradually deteriorated, and she eventually died of cardiac arrest due to sinus bradycardia. Her family did not permit an autopsy.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Cardiac metastasis of malignant tumors rarely occurs, and the primary cardiac metastatic neoplasms include lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, and leukemia. The frequency of cardiac metastasis is relatively high in patients with lung cancer than in those with other malignant tumors and has been reported to be 18.2-21.0% in autopsied patients with lung cancer . The modes of cardiac metastasis include direct tumor invasion, hematogenous metastasis, retrograde lymphatic metastasis from mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes . The most common type of cardiac metastasis is pericardial metastasis, while myocardial metastasis is infrequent, accounting for one-fifth of the cardiac metastases .\n\n【16】Since myocardial metastasis of malignant tumors lacks subjective symptoms, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed. In general, patients with myocardial metastasis of malignant tumors show a wide variety of symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and peripheral edema. Among them, arrhythmia and electrocardiographic abnormalities are considered to be the most frequent findings in patients with myocardial metastases . This patient had no subjective symptoms when myocardial metastasis was diagnosed. However, ST depression observed on ECG was strong evidence to diagnose myocardial metastasis. With regard to electrocardiographic changes, ST-T changes are sometimes observed, as in this patient. However, low voltage and arrhythmias such as bundle branch block, atrioventricular block, extrasystole, and atrial fibrillation have also been reported, and findings differ depending on the site of metastasis . Ischemic heart diseases, including myocardial infarction , Takotsubo cardiomyopathy , and myocardial injuries related to anticancer therapy must be differentiated in addition to myocardial metastasis if patients undergoing treatment for advanced lung cancer exhibit alterations in the ST-T wave complex. Anthracyclines and the anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab , are known to cause myocardial injuries related to anticancer therapy. Additionally, myocardial damages associated with radiation therapy  should be differentiated following the exposure of the cardiac tissue to radiation. Ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy were ruled out in the present case as echocardiography revealed good cardiac function and the absence of wall motion abnormality, and coronary angiography revealed the absence of coronary artery stenosis. Myocardial injuries related to anticancer therapy were ruled out as the patient did not receive any anticancer drug with a high risk of myocardial damage and the cardiac tissue was not exposed to radiation. The findings revealed that the changes in the ST-T wave complex were attributed to myocardial metastasis.\n\n【17】TTE is the quickest and easiest method to diagnose myocardial metastasis, and it can evaluate the location of tumors and extent of tumor invasion. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate myocardial metastasis from non-neoplastic diseases such as thrombosis. Therefore, more attention is required. A previous study also reported that localized wall thickening, decreased wall motion, and changes of echogenicity in the myocardium are findings of myocardial metastasis . In terms of other diagnostic methods, contrast-enhanced CT is commonly used; MRI, FDG-PET/CT, technetium-99m myocardial scintigraphy are also useful in diagnosing metastasis. This patient’s tumor in the myocardium of the right ventricle was a hypodense tumor with indistinct boundaries on contrast-enhanced CT images and a tumor with high intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI images. These findings were not inconsistent with the characteristics of intramyocardial metastasis. TTE is an easy and sensitive method that should be initially performed during the follow-up of patients with advanced lung cancer, followed by detailed examination with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI if any suspicion exists, for excluding cardiac metastasis.\n\n【18】Metastatic cardiac tumors are generally treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is also performed in some cases. However, cardiac metastasis often occurs in patients with terminal stages. Therefore, surgical treatment is often difficult, even if cardiac metastasis is diagnosed before death. Cardiac metastasis of malignant tumors can cause heart failure, arrhythmia, and pericardial effusion. Several previous studies reported syncope and sudden death in patients with cardiac metastases ; severe arrhythmia is considered to be one of the causes of death. Arrhythmia is very difficult to control, although antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation are indicated in some patients . In the literature we found four other cases of cardiac metastasis from lung cancer presenting with VT  . In these five cases, including our present case, four cases had previously or synchronously multiple distant metastases in addition to those in the heart. Cardiac metastases were detected in the ventricular wall or septum in the heart in all cases. Radiotherapy was performed in two cases. Although antiarrhythmic drugs were reported to be effective in these four cases, sustained VT was refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone and bisoprolol, in the present case. In cases of recurrent VT, the prognosis may be extremely poor in patients who are refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. In general, VT is classified as ischemic VT that develops along with ischemic heart disease such as myocardial infarction and non-ischemic VT due to other causes. Non-ischemic VT often accompanies cardiomyopathy or cardiac tumors. Additionally, the occurrence of myocardial injury related to anticancer therapy should be identified during cancer pharmacotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being increasingly employed for the treatment of lung cancer, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur in any organ during treatment with ICIs. Although cardiac irAEs are rare, the occurrence of myocarditis, which is the main pathology, is often associated with arrhythmias such as complete atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, and VT, and has a poor prognosis . In the present case, VT was observed following the administration of three courses of nivolumab; however, the levels of troponin T and creatine kinase were not elevated, and there was no evidence of myocarditis. Furthermore, an ECG showed monomorphic VT that had a left bundle branch block morphology, which indicated that the impulses originate in the right ventricle. The findings revealed that the development of VT was attributed to the exacerbation of right ventricular myocardial metastasis. However, the mechanism underlying the onset of arrhythmias in cardiac tumors remains to be clearly elucidated to date. A previous study reported the occurrence of VT accompanying cardiac tumors, which was thought to be caused by the formation of a reentrant circuit in the myocardium around or within the tumor . Although an electrophysiological study or autopsy was not performed in the present study, it might be possible that the metastases in the right ventricular myocardium induced the electrophysiological abnormalities and development of VT, via a re-entry mechanism.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we here describe a rare case of primary squamous cell lung cancer with frequent episodes of sustained VT due to myocardial metastasis. In this patient, a drug-resistant sustained VT developed. Although cardioversion was effective, repeated treatments markedly deteriorated the patient’s PS. The prognosis is very poor when symptoms become evident; hence, the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of cardiac metastasis by chemotherapy, cardiac radiotherapy, or surgery, are necessary prior to the development of symptoms in tolerant cases. Clinicians should pay attention to the development of cardiac metastasis in a patient with advanced lung cancer even without any symptoms.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】Arrhythmias and abnormalities in ECG are the most common diagnostic factors for myocardial metastases. The prognosis of myocardial metastases is generally poor once symptoms such as sustained VT appear. Furthermore, in cases of recurrent sustained VT, the prognosis may be extremely poor in patients who are refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. In retrospect, myocardial metastasis could have been detected by follow-up examinations with contrast-enhanced CT or FDG-PET in addition to analyzing the alterations in the ECG. The early diagnosis and treatment of myocardial metastasis prior to the development of symptoms are crucial for improving patient prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They tend to be large and multiple and pathologically belong to the pseudodiverticula, resulting from a mucosal and submucosal herniation through the muscular layer of the bowels’ wall in places of minor resistance to the intraluminal pressure such as the anatomic points where blood vessels penetrate the intestinal wall. They are generally asymptomatic but complications often occur as age advances with changes in the anatomy and physiology of the affected area. A wide spectrum of symptoms appear from mild epigastric or peri-umbilical discomfort, anaemia, bacterial overgrowth with flatulence, malabsorption syndrome, fatigue and weight loss, to more serious complications such as diverticulitis, acute inflammation, intestinal obstruction and perforation with localized abscess causing abdominal pain with or without signs of peritonitis.\n\n【2】The management of jejunal diverticulosis with perforated diverticulitis usually requires surgical referral. When the patient are stable, trial of nonsurgical management with intravenous antibiotics and other supportive measures alongside percutaneous CT-guided aspiration of localised intraperitoneal collections maybe suitable and avoid the need for laparotomy. The disease should always be taken in consideration in the presence of non specific GI symptoms, especially in the elderly population. We herein report the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian man presenting with one-day history of generalised abdominal pain, on a background of a chronic abdominal discomfort, pain and dyspepsia. Our patient underwent a laparotomy which revealed multiple small jejunal diverticula and two larger adjacent diverticula arising on the mesenteric border of the proximal jejunum. Both diverticula were inflamed and perforated. We also review the literature for this rare disease.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 63-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the emergency department with one-day history of generalised abdominal pain on a background of a chronic abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, pain, flatulence and borborygmi. No significant past medical history was noticed. OGD endoscopy and colonoscopy performed in the last two years were clear. The patient was admitted with right-side abdominal pain, localised at the lower right quadrant, rebound tenderness, pyrexia, significantly raised white cell count, inflammatory markers hypoalbuminemia and a raise to serum amylase. Chest and abdominal X-rays displayed only a few small intestinal air-fluid levels but not pneumoperitoneum. The patient was taken to the operating theatre on the first 24 hours considering appendicitis. A right paramedian incision exploratory laparotomy was performed which identified several small jejunal diverticula and two larger adjacent diverticula arising on the mesenteric border of the proximal jejunum . Both diverticula were inflammed and perforated containing a collection of pus . A careful proximal and distal to the diverticula bowel mobilisation was performed, followed by a resection of the affected segment, using a gastrointestinal anastomosis stapling device. The rest of the diverticula were preserved. A side to side jejuno-jejunal stapled anastomosis was created, followed by a copious peritoneal lavage. A Jackson-Pratt drain was left near the anastomosis. Pathology report described large diverticula and multiple foci of diverticulitis with perforations. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on the sixth day.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The disease was first described by Sommering in 1794 and later by Astley Cooper in 1809. Gordinier and Shil performed the first operation for diverticula in 1906 . The incidence of jejunoileal diverticula in studies of the small bowel by enteroclysis is 2-2.3% which is comparable to autopsy data presenting an incidence of 1.3-4.6%  Incidence in radiographic findings is 2.3% . Duodenal diverticula are approximately 5 times more common than jejunoileal diverticula. The prevalence increases with the age and the disease presents a peak incidence at the sixth and seventh decades with a male predominance .\n\n【7】The jejunal diverticulosis is usually multiple and probably present due to the larger size of the vasa recta at this area . The aetiology is unclear. Studies have focused on abnormalities of the smooth muscles or of the myenteric plexus in order to explain intestinal dyskinesia. Manometric studies in such patients have also shown functional abnormalities. The results support the hypothesis that irregular intestinal contractions generate increased segmental intraluminal pressure, favouring the diverticula formation through the weakest point of the bowel . Despite small bowel diverticulosis seems to be acquired, two cases of familiar predisposition have been reported . The majority of patients are asymptomatic for life. However 30% develop symptoms, experiencing epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, post prandial flatulence, epigastric cramping pain and fever are usually reported . Anemia due to chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding, iron or B12 deficiency has often been reported and commonly attributed to malabsorption syndrome with diarrhoea and steatorrhea. Malabsorption could be justified by the nonsynchronous peristaltic movement of the bowel, the dilation of the diverticula, the stasis of the intestinal content and the bacterial overgrowth .\n\n【8】Considering that jejunal diverticulosis is asymptomatic for a long time in most of the cases, diagnosis is usually made when the disease becomes symptomatic or complicated. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed. It is a challenging disorder from a diagnostic perspective, with no truly reliable diagnostic tests. The literature has shown that computer tomography scan has variable reliability, while barium swallows are the gold standard for diagnosis . Computer tomography may identify localized intestinal wall thickening due to inflammation or edema, abscesses, free abdominal fluids and pneumoperitoneum. Multislice CT seems to be promising in diagnosing jejunal diverticulosis and appears more specific than enteroclysis concerning small bowel diseases and may identify the enterolith inside the diverticulum or protruding into the intestinal lumen . Endoscopic procedures, such as single- or double-balloon enteroscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy, are useful in diagnosing small bowel disorders, however these procedures are expensive, present low availability and cannot be used in the emergency setting, such as intestinal obstruction or perforation .\n\n【9】Complications of jejunal diverticulosis warranting surgical intervention occur in 10-30% of patients and the most common acute complications include diverticulitis, bleeding, enterolith formation, intestinal obstruction and perforation , however, some patients respond to the temporary interruption of the enteral nutrition, to a gastrointestinal relief with a nasogastric tube and to the administration of empirical, wide-spectrum antibiotics . Another series of perforated diverticulitis treated conservatively with antibiotic administration and CT-guided drainage of abdominal abscesses have also been presented . Instigating factors for perforation were shown to be related to a necrotizing inflammatory reaction in 82% of cases, followed by blunt trauma (12%) and foreign body impaction (6%). Cocaine sniffing has also been reported as a risk factor . The incidence of jejunal diverticulitis with or without perforation ranges from 2-6% .\n\n【10】The current treatment of choice for perforated jejunal diverticula causing peritonitis is exploratory laparotomy and resection of affected intestinal segment with primary anastomosis. The extent of the bowel resection depends upon the length of the bowel that is affected by the diverticula and the patient’s peri-operative condition . If diverticula are extensive, resection may have to be limited to include only the segment containing the perforated diverticulum and to leave a segment of small bowel that still contains non-perforated diverticula in order to avoid short bowel syndrome .\n\n【11】Recently, the total laparoscopic approach has been used as a valid surgical strategy, even in cases of complicated diverticulitis . Laparoscopy becomes a valid diagnostic approach as it is rapidly convertible in laparotomy and it can function as a guide in order to avoid unnecessary laparotomies . Our case in this paper presented symptomatology mimicking acute appendicitis and a decision was taken to perform prompt exploratory laparotomy due to the extent of the clinical and haematological findings and the individual Surgeon’s experience.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】It is seen that complicated jejunal diverticula are quite rare and that one of the most common complication is perforation. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected jejunal segment. However, conservative management has been reported in selected patients to alleviate symptoms and inflammation before proceeding to an elective resection and primary anastomosis. If affected diverticula are not resected complications will reoccur. It is important to be familiar with this entity and take it in consideration in cases of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, because any treatment delay may contribute to an unsuccessful clinical outcome for patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e676b421-b244-4f61-8877-bb5081c79b1d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Ewing sarcoma is a very aggressive bone tumor primarily seen in adolescence and peaks in the second decade of life. Atypically primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) involving various soft tissues like the chest wall, lungs, visceral pleura, oral cavity, and perineum have been described, which together with Ewing sarcoma, are classified as Ewing’s family of tumors. It is mostly curable in children. However, the prognosis is poor with increasing age . We describe a rare case of extraskeletal PNET initially presented as a local lung tumor that rapidly involved the adjacent spine, causing paraparesis in a young adult. We also described how sepsis posed a challenge in treating this locally aggressive tumor, making prognosis grim.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 27-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history presented with hoarseness of voice for 1 month. He was diagnosed with laryngitis and was prescribed antibiotics. His symptoms continued to worsen with cough and upper back pain, and decided to come to the emergency room. He has not had a significant cough but had an episode of “tar-like” mucus once associated with nasal congestion and hoarseness. He denies fever, chills, hemoptysis, body aches, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms. He denies sick contacts or recent travel. He had no prior surgeries. His family history was significant for breast cancer in grandmother and colon cancer in grandfather. He smoked cigarettes on and off for the last 10 years and quit 2 weeks ago. He denies alcohol use but admits to occasional marijuana use.\n\n【4】On admission, his vitals are temperature 37.4 °C oral, heart rate of 108 beats per min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min, blood pressure of 146/101 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L via nasal cannula. On examination, he is an alert, well-built young gentleman with a body mass index (BMI) of 24. On auscultation of the chest had decreased breath sounds at the left base. Otherwise, the rest of the exam is unremarkable. Admission labs are summarized in Table 1 . Chest X-ray showed left lower lobe effusion vs. mass.\n\n【5】Hospital course\n\n【6】Based on tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count in the emergency room (ER), and abnormal chest finding with a presentation of cough and shortness of breath, a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia was made in ER with no response to outpatient antibiotic treatment. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and blood cultures obtained. He was admitted for further management. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was done that revealed large multilocular cystic and solid left upper lobe mass concerning neoplasm with left to right mediastinal shift and compressive atelectasis . There is also evidence of large pleural effusion on the left side with ongoing respiratory compromise and concern for hydropneumothorax. A chest tube was placed, fluid from the Fuhrman catheter sent for analysis. Based on light’s criteria, fluid was determined to be exudative. Although cytology was negative for malignant cells, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted. They performed a thoracoscopic examination, finding pleural studding in addition to the mass had undergone Left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleural biopsy with preliminary pathology confirming poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with the final pathology pending. He was presumed to have local lung cancer. The chest tube was changed to Pleurx. It was recommended to follow up outpatient with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan scheduled. He completed an antibiotic course. He also developed left upper extremity swelling during hospitalization, confirming cephalic vein thrombosis, and was discharged on low dose Eliquis.\n\n【7】The outpatient PET scan showed hypermetabolic uptake of left chest mass with several nodular hypermetabolic foci in the left pleural space, likely representing regional pleural-based neoplasia, no apparent hypermetabolic disease outside the confines of the chest.\n\n【8】Ten days later, he comes back to the ER with a weakness of the right lower extremity associated with decreased mobility. The patient reports that he has lost the ability to plantar/dorsiflexion in his right lower extremity. His sensation was intact and denied incontinence of bowel or bladder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbar spine was done, which revealed metastatic lesion to the thoracic area with substantial spinal cord compromise . The patient was started on dexamethasone. Neurosurgery was consulted, and he underwent posterior decompression and removal of the tumor from thoracic vertebrae 2 - 3 with partial T1 - T4 decompression.\n\n【9】Pathology from the left pleural implant from the previous admission showed a small round blue cell tumor compatible with Ewing sarcoma . Immunohistochemically stained slides show that the tumor is positive for pan-keratin. Vimentin, synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 99 (CD99), friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1), AE1/AE3 (anti-cytokeratin antibody, scattered cells) and negative for CD45, smooth muscle actin (SMA), CD20, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, SRY-related HMG-box 10 (SOX10), P40 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is positive for Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 ( EWSR1 ) gene rearrangement in 78% of cells involving the chromosomal translocation of the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22q12.\n\n【10】Flow cytometry studies after erythroid lysis revealed a B-cell population consisting of predominantly small cells showing no clonality or antigenic aberrancy. The T cells show normal expression of the pan T-cell antigens and have a normal CD4: CD8 ratio. The natural killer (NK) cells account for 4.8 % of the total lymphocytes. A CD45-negative non-hematopoietic cell population is detected. Thoracic tumor biopsy again revealed small round blue cells, the FISH study eventually reported as tumor consistent with Ewing sarcoma.\n\n【11】Discussion in multidisciplinary tumor board radiation oncologists recommends starting palliative radiation to T1 - T3 as soon as possible to 3,000 cGy in 10 fractions while inpatient. Since Ewing sarcoma is primarily treated in the pediatric population, a pediatric oncologist was consulted. He then underwent bilateral bone marrow biopsy for further staging. Bilateral bone marrow aspirate smear, clot section, and core biopsy revealed normocellular marrow (40%) with trilineage hematopoiesis and no morphological evidence of involvement Ewing sarcoma. Flow cytometry showed no immunophenotypic evidence of B-cell or T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, and no monoclonal plasma cell population identified, confirming no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Due to its locally aggressive nature, a multimodal approach was recommended that involved chemotherapy, local control with surgery, and radiation. Urology was consulted for fertility preservation and echocardiogram to document baseline cardiac function was done before chemotherapy.\n\n【12】The patient was discussed in the tumor board. The plan was to administer multidrug chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) for cycle 1 followed by about six cycles of VDC, ifosfamide, and etoposide (VDC/IE) every 2 weeks followed by local control to include surgery along with radiation to hemithorax and spine. This will be followed by consolidative chemotherapy with eight more cycles of VDC/IE. Repeat imaging of the tumor to be planned after cycle 5 or 6 so that surgery/radiation can be planned accordingly. Neurosurgery recommended physical therapy with a thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO) brace.\n\n【13】After the first chemotherapy, the patient started to develop sepsis-like syndrome. Infectious disease was consulted, and the patient was started empirically on antibiotics. Blood cultures were positive for staphylococcus with source likely thought to be post-operative wound infection. Chemotherapy was held, and infection was aggressively managed by local incision and drainage, wound vac placement followed by wound care, and prolonged intravenous vancomycin and Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. The patient was able to complete cycle 1 and part A of cycle 2 and was discharged home to return for cycle 2, part B (IE).\n\n【14】Chemotherapy, radiation, or any surgical management were held because of sepsis, which is concerning, especially in this aggressive local tumor. A careful multisystem approach is necessary to improve outcomes that otherwise can make prognosis poor.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Ewing sarcoma family of tumors includes classic Ewing sarcoma, PNET, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, and Askin’s tumors (chest wall) have been described in the 1900s. They are aggressive sarcoma of bone and soft tissue. Classically they arise in long bones with a characteristic “onion peel” appearance on plain radiographs. It may occur in other bones and extraskeletal soft tissues. Ewing sarcoma tumors are a rare entity that is more common between 10 and 15 years of age, with an average annual incidence of 2.9 per million children younger than 20 years of age, slightly higher in males compared to females with a 6-fold higher incidence in white children than black children .\n\n【17】Reciprocal translocation of FLI1 gene on the long arm of chromosome 11 and EWSR1 on chromosome 22 is the primary cytogenetic abnormality believed to be involved in tumorigenesis. The biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis, which shows small round blue cells that must be differentiated from lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small cell carcinoma.\n\n【18】Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain shows glycogen-filled cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical marker CD99 is sensitive, FLI1 fusion, and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2-2) are relatively sensitive, and specific to Ewing sarcoma.\n\n【19】Management is multimodal, involving surgery and radiation for local treatment of primary tumor and systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the mainstay often used in multiple cycles before and after surgery and radiation. A multidisciplinary team approach involving a combination of surgery, radiation, and multidrug chemotherapy have improved the 5-year survival rates to 60-73% in patients with localized disease  and 37-60% in patients with metastatic disease compared to 10% with surgery or radiation alone before the advent of multi-agent systemic therapy as per the literature review by Valdes et al. The 5-year overall survival for patients with isolated pulmonary metastatic disease is higher than patients with other sites of metastatic diseases, approximately 50% and less than 30%, respectively. Once the disease recurs, the patients tend to have a dismal prognosis .\n\n【20】In a retrospective review done by Valdes et al  involving 18 patients older than 19 years of age who received systemic therapy, the median overall survival for the entire group was approximately 21 months. The overall survival for patients with localized disease at 1, 2, and 3 years were 90%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. Their 1-year survival for patients with metastatic disease was 40%. These patients have Ewing sarcoma family of tumors with known extremity primaries with predominant soft tissue involvement . In another retrospective review by Argon et al. involving 25 patients who are over 15 years, 20% of them have metastatic disease at presentation. The reported 2-year overall survival was 32.7% with poor prognosis in patients with localized pelvic primaries .\n\n【21】One of the strongest prognostic factors is a patient presenting with metastatic disease at diagnosis . Several prognostic factors determine the intensity of therapy, including age, location of the primary tumor, localized or metastatic disease, chromosomal translocations, and response to therapy. For patients presenting with localized disease, primary tumors arising from the axial skeleton tend to have a worse prognosis than those arising from the extremity. In a series by Cotterill et al, the 5-year relapse-free survival was 61% and 40% with primary tumors arising from extremity and axial skeleton, respectively . The induction therapy responses, as well as complete surgical resection, are also important prognostic factors. Patients who have a significant amount of residual disease in the resected specimen following treatment with neoadjuvant therapy have a poor prognosis compared to those with minimal or no evidence of disease in the pathological specimen . Children have a better prognosis compared to adults . However, the greater tumor burden in adults, use of lower doses of alkylating agents, and the timing of local therapy may explain the difference between the two groups . There are multiple different structural possibilities for gene fusions in these tumors. Specific cytogenetic and molecular alterations such as p53 mutations, deletions of CDKN2A gene coding P16, P14ARF and deletion of 1p36, or all are associated with worse prognosis .\n\n【22】Multidisciplinary approach coupled with risk-adapted intensive neoadjuvant and adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapies along with other modalities such as radiation and surgery for control of the primary site and metastatic disease if needed. Since Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is usually rare, it does require referral to sarcoma specialists. The primary treatment will involve multidrug chemotherapy with alternating cycles of VDC and IE given every 2 weeks with growth factor support in patients with localized disease. This was based on a randomized phase 3 clinical trial where patients were randomized to the above regimen compared to VDC and dactinomycin (VDCA) 5 years event-free survival was 69% in the containing IE compared to 54% in VDCA arm. The overall survival was also significantly better, and the experimental arm containing IE versus VDCA at 72% and 61%, respectively . Local control can be achieved either with surgery or radiation or both. For patients with metastatic disease, the management depends on the site and the number of metastatic lesions. Patients with limited pulmonary metastatic disease are generally treated with a curative intent to undergo multi-agent intense chemotherapy and pulmonary resection with or without radiation, with improved survival compared to other sites of metastatic disease. The addition of IE to the VDC backbone did not change patients’ outcomes with the metastatic disease; however, it showed significant improvement in nonmetastatic disease and is the commonly used regimen in the USA .\n\n【23】Patients with the relapsed disease tend to have a poor prognosis. Generally, systemic therapy involves either topotecan/cyclophosphamide or irinotecan/temozolomide . Surgery and radiation can be used in selective cases such as local recurrence. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors such as cabozantinib have shown activity in a phase 2 trial with a progression-free survival of 5 months and an overall response rate of 26% .\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】We described a young adult patient with locally aggressive extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma causing cord compression and paraparesis, which initially masqueraded as a local lung mass. This presentation is extremely rare and emphasizes the importance of knowing the aggressive nature of the tumor. The case also describes the challenges in management while, in this case, sepsis can prolong the initiation or continuation of management owing to the prolonged course of recovery and poor prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3e11abdc-157c-4bed-8d1e-316e3e9dd7b7", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Firstly described by Watanabe et al in 1976, lymphoepithelioma-like gastric carcinoma (LELGC), also known as medullary carcinoma, is an undifferentiated type of carcinoma, characterized by an intense inflammatory infiltrate. In up to 80% of the cases, it is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), identified by in situ hybridization . The treatment of LELGC follows the same recommendations as other types of gastric carcinoma.\n\n【2】Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for approximately 25% of adult leukemias in the western world. The reports of CLL cases involving infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract are relatively rare in the literature, and the estimated incidence ranges from 5.7% to 25% in patients with CLL .\n\n【3】We describe the case of a woman with known CCL that was diagnosed with a gastric adenocarcinoma and proposed for radical gastrectomy. The surgical specimen revealed the simultaneously presence of medullary carcinoma (or LELGC) and CCL.\n\n【4】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a LELGC and CLL simultaneously involving the stomach.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】We report the case of a 77-year-old female, who was diagnosed with CLL in March of 2018, staged as a Rai I (intermediate risk). In the first few years of diagnosis, the patient was under a watch-and-wait strategy, but she had recently developed CLL symptoms (fatigue), and was then classified as a Rai I with active disease. As so, she was proposed to start therapy for CLL with ibrutinib.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】In the process of starting CLL therapy, the patient complaint of recurrent epigastric pain and the hematologist ordered an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Aside from the fatigue and epigastric pain, the patient did not have any other symptoms. The EGD identified the presence of a large ulcerated lesion with high edges involving the entire anterior hemi-circumference of the distal antrum. The ECG biopsy revealed the presence of gastric adenocarcinoma. In this setting, a cervico-thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) was performed, revealing multiple cervical adenopathies in submaxillary location and in all cervical chains, internal mammary chains, mediastinal and hilar adenopathies, probably due to CCL status. It was also present a vegetative gastric lesion of the anterior wall, without extraparietal invasion and adenopathies in the gastro-hepatic ligament. There were no signs of pulmonary, hepatic or any other site metastatic involvement. Tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and CA 72-4 were normal.\n\n【10】At this point, the patient had two distinct malignancies: CCL and gastric adenocarcinoma. The clinical case was discussed in the multidisciplinary team consultation, and the patient was proposed to surgery.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】A radical subtotal gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed.\n\n【13】The postoperative period was complicated by a chylous fistula that was conservatively treated; the patient was discharged on the eighth postoperative day, and was regularly observed in the General Surgery Consultation. The fistula closed spontaneously on the third week.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a 6.5-cm medullary carcinoma of the gastric antrum, infiltrating the muscularis propria, without lymphovascular or perineural invasion and the simultaneous presence of a diffuse gastric involvement at the level of subserosa and serosa by a continuity solution of CLL, which was also present in 18 out of 24 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins were tumor-free. Lymphoproliferative disease cells showed strong and diffuse expression for cluster of differentiation (CD)20, CD5 and Bcl2.The gastric carcinoma was classified as a pT2 N0 M0, according to the TNM staging system.\n\n【16】The clinical case was discussed in the multidisciplinary team consultation and it was decided to maintain surveillance of the gastric carcinoma, and start treatment for the CCL.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】In the case that we present, the patient had two different types on malignancy: LELGC (also known as medullary carcinoma) and CLL. As so, we address both entities briefly.\n\n【19】LELGC is a rare type of gastric cancer characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor stroma . According to the World Health Organization classification of tumors of the digestive system, LELGC is a type of tubular carcinoma . LELGC constitutes 1-4% of all gastric carcinomas, and it is considered to predominantly affect males and having a better prognosis than other types of gastric carcinoma . LELGC is categorized into two subtypes: EBV-positive carcinoma and microsatellite instability (MSI)-high carcinoma. Over 80% of LELGC is EBV-positive . This subtype is associated with recurrent mutations in the PIK3CA , DNA hypermethylation, amplification of JAK2 and overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2, and is associated with a better prognosis, since the PD-1/PD-L1 complex may be a therapeutic target . On the other hand, the prevalence of MSI-high LELGC is 7-39%, depending on geographical location . MSI-high status may result from defective function of DNA mismatch repair enzymes, including MutL homolog 1 or MutS homolog 2, but rarely MutS homolog 6 . In our patient, unlike most known cases of LELGC, it was associated with microsatellite instability carcinoma.\n\n【20】The clinical symptoms of LELGC are similar to other types of gastric carcinoma, and include abdominal pain, anorexia and weight loss, among other symptoms . Park et al in 2015 studied a population of 4,282 patients who underwent gastrectomy to treat gastric cancer, 46 of which had LELGC, and concluded that LELGC usually presents in lower T-stages (predominantly T1-2) and has a lower frequency of lymph node metastasis, confirming previous studies . The management of LELGC is similar to the other types of gastric carcinoma.\n\n【21】While under the surveillance on the hemato-oncology department, our patient presented with recurrent epigastralgia, so an EGD was ordered, revealing an ulcerated lesion with high edges located in the distal antrum, and the biopsy confirmed the presence of gastric carcinoma. In this case, since the patient was 77 years old and had an active CLL disease that fulfilled therapeutic indication, the decision of the multidisciplinary team consultation was not proposed for perioperative chemotherapy, and instead, propose primary gastrectomy.\n\n【22】The surgery specimen revealed a LELGC/medullary carcinoma, classified as a pT2 N0 according to the TNM staging system. In this case, there was also gastric involvement by the known CLL. In the literature it is reported that gastrointestinal involvement in leukemia can be present in up to 25% , being more common in acute than chronic leukemia, affecting most frequently the stomach, ileum and proximal colon , and is more prevalent in men . CLL gastric involvement may present itself as leukemic infiltration in the form of nodules, thickened folds, or ulcers .\n\n【23】CLL is characterized by the progressive accumulation of monoclonal lymphocytes in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues . CLL is the most common leukemia in western countries , and typically affects older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years . It is a heterogeneous disease with certain subsets of patients having survival rates without treatment that are similar to the normal population . The diagnosis of CLL is established by the following two criteria : presence of ≥ 5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L monoclonal B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (confirmed by demonstrating light chain restriction using flow cytometry) and leukemia cells found in the blood smear, which are characteristically small, mature-appearing lymphocytes with a narrow border of cytoplasm and a dense nucleus lacking discernible nucleoli and having partially aggregated chromatin (larger, atypical lymphocytes or prolymphocytes may be seen but must not exceed 55%). CLL cells coexpress the B-cell surface antigens CD19 and CD20 together with CD5, CD23, CD43 and CD200 . CLL should be classified according to Binet or Rai classification system . The standard treatment of patients with early asymptomatic disease is a watch-and-wait strategy . Patients with intermediate (stage I and II) and high-risk (stage III and IV) disease, according to the modified Rai classification, or at Binet stage B or C, usually benefit from the initiation of treatment, but some of these patients may be monitored without therapy until they have evidence for progressive or symptomatic disease . The progression criteria have been defined by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL)  .\n\n【24】Before treatment, del(17p), TP53 mutations and IGHV status should be assessed, as well as imaging (CT scans of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) . In this case, our patient was being monitored in the hemato-oncology department. She was staged initially as a Rai I (intermediate risk), and was previously under a watch-and-wait strategy. She had recently developed significant fatigue, so she was in the process of beginning treatment; the TP53 assessement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative, and the IGHV mutational status was also negative; at this point, the patient was proposed for ibrutinib (Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors).\n\n【25】After the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma on EGD, the process of beginning ibrutinib was stopped, and the patient was proposed for surgery, since the treatment of the gastric carcinoma had precedence to the beginning of CLL treatment.\n\n【26】The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a medullary carcinoma/LELGC plus a diffuse gastric involvement of CLL, also involving the lymph nodes. The gastric carcinoma was staged as staged as IB (according to TNM staging classification). As so, in the multidisciplinary team consultation it was decided to propose surveillance for the gastric cancer and to start ibrutinib for CLL. The patient is currently under ibrutinib and maintains surveillance for the gastric cancer.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n\n【28】It is difficult to distinguish gastric LELGC from other types of gastric carcinoma with an endoscopic biopsy, as the stromal lymphocytic infiltration is dense, so the diagnosis of LELGC is usually established after the histopathological examination. LELGC is associated with a better prognosis than other gastric carcinomas, as it usually is characterized by low T and N stages. The gastrointestinal involvement by CLL is relatively rare, but it can range up to 25% of the cases.\n\n【29】There are no guidelines to treat these coexisting entities, so the multidisciplinary team consultation is crucial to establish a clear plan. In this case, since the gastric carcinoma was staged as an IB, according to TNM staging classification, the patient was proposed for surveillance and the decision to start ibrutinib was considered a safe treatment option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is identified by the tunneled major epicardial coronary artery, which courses intramurally and proceeds beneath the muscular bridge. This pathology was first recognized in 1737 by Reyman during autopsy, whereas it was first defined angiographically in 1960 by Portman and Iwing.\n\n【2】Myocardial bridge is usually limited to the mid segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The main angiographic sign is the systolic press including epicardial coronary artery. Moreover, intracoronary Doppler studies demonstrated characteristic impairment in diastolic flow. The degree of press on coronary artery caused by myocardial bridge depends on the level of cardiac contractility, as well as length, thickness and localization of muscular bridge.\n\n【3】Although it is traditionally considered as a benign condition, the literature reveals complications such as ischemia, acute coronary syndrome, coronary spasm, ventricular septal laceration, arrhythmia, atrioventricular block, stunning, transient ventricular dysfunction, sudden death, and premature death following cardiac transplantation, which have been associated with myocardial bridge.\n\n【4】The case, which presented with the clinical picture of acute coronary syndrome and had atherosclerosis and thrombotic obstruction that accompany muscular bridge, which caused critical stenosis in LAD following coronary angiography, is first case in literature. The present case has been introduced with the literature owing to its clinical findings and the difficulties encountered at treatment phase.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 35-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with chest pain that started at rest in the morning and has been extremely severe in the last 30 min. He has had squeezing and burning-like chest pain during effort, or sometimes at rest, for approximately 1 month. He is receiving no medication. He has no family history of coronary artery disease. He has no hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but smoking history of 1 package/day. On his physical examination, body temperature is 36.6 °C, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 14/min, pulse rate is 75/min, and saturation by pulse oximeter is 98%. Cardiac sounds are rhythmic, S1-S2 normal, and there is no extra heart sound or murmur. Both hemithoraces are equally involved in breathing and there is no rale or rhonchi. Abdomen is loose with no distension, rebound or tenderness. Peripheral pulses are palpable. On laboratory analyses, the only pathological finding was troponin-I, which was found to be 0.174 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 0.033 ng/mL). Electrocardiography revealed ST elevation in the anterior leads . The patient was immediately admitted to the coronary angiography (CAG) laboratory for percutaneous intervention. The CAG demonstrated normal left main coronary artery; muscular bridge that caused stenosis over 95% in the mid segment of the LAD during systole and thrombotic obstruction that caused stenosis by 70% in the same segment during diastole ; normal circumflex artery; and normal right coronary artery. Three flows were detected in the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) in distal LAD. At this point, antithrombotic and antiaggregant treatment was commenced including enoxaparin sodium (8000 anti-Xa IU, 2 × 1/day via subcutaneous route), acetyl salicylic acid (300 mg tablet, 1 × 1/day via oral route), clopidogrel (75 mg 1 × 1 via oral route ), metoprolol (50 mg tablet, 2 × 1/day via oral route), and tirofiban hydrochloride monohydrate infusion (10 µg/kg as 3-min bolus injection followed by 0.15 µg/kg/min maintenance dose). After 30 min, it was observed that chest pain relieved and ST elevation on the ECG regressed , and angiographic improvement was determined. The patient underwent angiography again after being treated for 24 h and it was observed that the lesion in LAD has persisted . Therefore, we wavered between percutaneous intervention to the lesion and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; however, it was decided to perform surgical intervention to the coronary artery as the literature revealed that complications due to the stents implanted in the places where muscular bridges exist are more frequent.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Myocardial bridge was first described anatomically in 1737 by Reyman and then in 1805 by Black as a muscular configuration extending over the left descending coronary artery . Until now, many studies have been published that associate the infarctions in young patients, who had muscular bridge without coronary atherosclerosis and in whom acute myocardial infarction has been identified, to myocardial bridges .\n\n【9】This anatomic configuration has pathophysiological structure. Studies demonstrated that these muscular bands are present since birth . Incidence rates show variations. The incidence of myocardial bridge determined by CAG is reported between 1.5% and 16%, whereas it is reported to reach 80% in autopsy series . The LAD coronary artery is the most important artery influenced by muscular bridges. Anatomical studies demonstrate that muscular bridges exist between proximal one-third and middle one-third segments . Some scientists have tried to classify muscular bridges. Geiringer divided the muscular bridges into two groups. In the first type, it is surrounded by muscular structure and courses along the deep of interventricular sulcus, whereas in the second type, muscular bridge originates from trigonum fibrosum and surrounds the LAD up to the apex of the heart .\n\n【10】The relation between ischemia and myocardial bridges is well defined and symptoms are removed by surgical excision of myocardial bridges . Hill et al demonstrated that distortion may develop during systole and relaxation would be delayed during diastole when LAD artery coursed beneath muscular bridge . Nevertheless, some individuals with muscular bridge are asymptomatic .\n\n【11】Ishimori et al reported that giving glycerol nitrate while using vasoactive medication in the patients with myocardial bridge did not musk LAD stenosis and resulted in ischemia in some cases .\n\n【12】Therapeutic approach includes beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, stents, minimal invasive CABG surgery, and surgical myotomy. Nitrate administration is not recommended since it enhances systolic stenosis and worsens symptoms. Although there is no study demonstrating that myocardial perfusion defect has been normalized before stent implantation, Klues et al expressed that stent implantation may remove hemodynamic abnormalities and may improve symptoms. Haager et al followed 11 patients without any lesion except for symptomatic muscular bridge in central position and had stent implanted in this region. They observed minimal increase in mean lumen diameter after stent implantation. They demonstrated that this increase is significant with IVUS. However, 50% of the patients developed mild-to-severe stenosis during 7-week follow-up period and two patients underwent PTCI, whereas two patients underwent CABG. Two-year clinical follow-up showed no abnormality. Haager et al emphasized that the stent they had used has modified modular structure with flexible sulcus.\n\n【13】Myocardial bridge in the LAD and coronary atherosclerotic lesion in the same localization accompanied by thrombus is not a common condition. In conclusion, it was difficult to make a therapeutic decision in the present case because of his age and presence of atherosclerotic thrombotic lesion, which caused diastolic stenosis and persisted despite optimal medical therapy. In the literature, surgical myotomy or CABG are preferred to percutaneous coronary stent implantation because of high risk of intra-stent restenosis in the regions where myocardial bridges exist . Under the light of literature, we as well made our decision in favor of coronary bypass surgery. However, we decided to publish the present case in order that treatment protocols for this clinical condition with high morbi-mortality should be discussed and reevaluated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "17f411fd-8e4b-4b48-9da8-6cbf00dd82c2", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) occurs in 5-10% of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) and carries high morbidity and mortality . Early graft failure remains a leading cause of acute, postoperative MI with or without the subsequent development of hemodynamic compromise or cardiogenic shock . Acute graft failure management may be influenced by multiple factors like the patient’s hemodynamic stability, the incremental risk of re-operation, perceived likelihood of technical or clinical success following re-operation. Management options may include emergent repeat CABG, emergent coronary angioplasty or temporary mechanical circulatory support and possible referral to a transplant or ventricular assist device capable facility. In the setting of acute graft failure of a new bypass graft involving the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) anastomosis, the optimal revascularization strategy is unknown. The possibility of anastomotic suture site perforation or avulsion while performing traditional angioplasty/stenting would be particularly lethal, especially in an unstable patient. We present a case of acute MI complicated by cardiogenic due to acute LIMA to LAD graft closure and successful rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by directly deploying a PK Papyrus covered stent (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) across the distal anastomosis. We feel this strategy would not only be an appropriate rescue option but would also be “fool-proof” in preventing anastomotic site perforations, which may occur with traditional angioplasty or stenting and therefore should be routinely utilized in acute internal mammary artery (IMA) graft failure involving the anastomotic site.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 75-year-old male with the past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis via a right upper extremity fistula was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. Selective coronary angiography revealed multivessel disease, including a critical 80% stenosis of the ostium of the left main coronary artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function. The patient underwent two-vessel CABG: LIMA to LAD and reverse saphenous venous graft to obtuse marginal (OM) branch with 7-0 Prolene sutures distally in end-to-side fashion to the OM and LAD, respectively.\n\n【4】Less than 24 h later, the patient developed acute respiratory distress following extubation and suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation. Following resuscitation, the patient’s hemodynamic status quickly deteriorated requiring maximum vasoactive pharmacologic support. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and severe anterior wall hypokinesis. Patient was referred for temporary mechanical circulatory support and urgent angiography. An Impella CP device was placed and angiography revealed a 95% stenosis at the LIMA to LAD anastomosis with slow flow in the distal LAD . Re-operation was not considered due to patient’s poor hemodynamic status and PCI was deemed risky given the possibility of anastomotic site perforation due to suture breakage, given that the graft was barely 1 day old. A novel strategy of direct stenting with the new covered stent platform was felt to be the most optimal technique in this setting. A 6-French IMA guide was used to engage the LIMA, a standard work-horse 0.014-inch coronary guide wire was advanced across the lesion into the LAD, and in rapid exchange fashion, a 2.5 × 15 mm PK Papyrus covered stent (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) was advanced across the lesion (traversing the LAD to LIMA anastomosis), and successfully deployed at nominal pressure of 10 atm. Subsequent angiography revealed antegrade Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow of the LIMA and LAD with excellent myocardial blush of the subtended anterior and apical myocardial wall segments . Additionally, antegrade flow of the native LAD close to the anastomosis was noted, providing adequate myocardial perfusion of the basal and mid anterior wall segments .\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】CABG is known to improve survival in patients with left main or triple vessel disease . Early graft failure post CABG, leading to perioperative MI, occurs in 5-10% of cases . LIMA is the most commonly used arterial conduit for bypassing the LAD. Acute IMA graft failure is rare, and most commonly results from graft thrombosis, dissection, spasm or stenosis . Data regarding the best revascularization strategy for acute IMA graft failure involving the anastomosis are lacking. Percutaneous revascularization may be preferred, especially if the patient’s clinical condition may not support re-operation , but traditional angioplasty or stenting is fraught with risk of perforation due to loss of suture site integrity early after surgery. In this regard, several case reports have described successful PCI of a failed graft anastomosis . In a case series of patients who underwent urgent PCI for perioperative MI after CABG, the rate of native coronary/bypass graft perforation due to urgent percutaneous revascularization was 30%, and all patients who suffered a perforation were then subsequently treated with covered stent placement . Covered stent deployment in this series was used as a bail-out treatment, a strategy that could be unforgiving in an already hemodynamically unstable patient, such as ours. An out-front covered stent approach will likely mitigate potential risk of anastomosis rupture, a strategy that has not been previously reported. Given the technical challenges of delivering a covered stent through a tortuous LIMA, the newer generation PK Papyrus stent, which is what we used, would be more ideal.\n\n【7】To our knowledge, we report the first case of a PK Papyrus direct covered stent implantation as a primary stent strategy in acute IMA graft anastomosis failure. Limitations of this strategy include lack of prior data and some reports of a higher incidence of periprocedural MI. RECOVERS trial data show an almost a three-fold higher incidence of subacute MI among patients undergoing saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) PCI with a covered stent as compared to standard bare metal stent, which may be due to subacute stent thrombosis . Until recently, the Jostent Graftmaster covered stent (Abbott Cardiovascular, Abbott Park, IL) was the only commercially available covered stent approved for bail-out treatment of free perforations of native coronary arteries or SVGs (≥ 2.75 mm in diameter). However, its inflexible sandwich-stent design and high crossing profile negatively impact deliverability and procedural success . In comparison, the newer generation PK papyrus covered stent, membrane covered single stent design, has a slimmer crossing profile and easier maneuverability. In this regard, we believe that direct stenting with the PK Papyrus covered stent ensures technical success, and is a more appropriate technique for acute graft anastomosis failure, which can significantly reduce life-threatening complications like perforation or graft avulsion. To our knowledge no data exist regarding PK Papyrus stent longevity implanted within an arterial graft or across a graft-to-native vessel anastomosis. Although we achieved an angiographically excellent result, due to lack of experience of this stent platform in this clinical scenario, we plan to perform a selective angiography in the near future to assess anastomosis patency, irrespective of evidence of ischemia.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n\n【9】Balloon angioplasty, with or without stent deployment, at the anastomosis of a newly placed IMA graft may increase the risk of vessel perforation or anastomosis avulsion. Direct new generation covered stenting is a viable option particularly in hemodynamically unstable, inoperable patients. To our knowledge, this is the first case to describe upfront stenting of a LIMA to LAD anastomosis with a PK Papyrus covered stent. More data and collective clinical experience are needed to establish best revascularization strategy in such high risk patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It was first described by Lhermitte in the early nineteen hundreds as a “pseudo peripheral palsy”, weakness of the fingers due to a central nervous system lesion .\n\n【2】Some hand weakness cases have been described as pure motor weakness predominantly in the extensors muscles while others resembled ulnar or median palsies .\n\n【3】It is usually caused by ischemic cortical infarcts in the MCA territory, involving the motor hand cortex, although several cases of subcortical infarcts involving the ventroposterior thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule have also been reported .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】History and presentation\n\n【6】Patient is a right-handed 70-year-old male who was writing notes when he had sudden onset of right hand weakness. He was emergently brought to Cedars Sinai Emergency room. Upon admission he had significant right hand weakness but no difficulty with movement in the right proximal arm, no numbness and no problems with weakness in the right leg or right face. He did not have any symptoms on the left side nor changes in his speech or hearing.\n\n【7】He used to take daily aspirin but he had discontinued it for a couple of weeks due to planned lens surgery. He took no other medications and denied any history of TIAs or strokes in the past and had no history of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【8】Physical exam\n\n【9】Intact except for, 0/5 interosseous strength in the right hand, wrist extension was brief and not against gravity and abducens pollicis brevis strength was 2/5. Otherwise strength in the biceps, triceps and deltoid was 5/5.\n\n【10】Imaging\n\n【11】Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology. CTA head and neck showed 75% stenosis at the origin of the left internal carotid artery due to a mixture of calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic disease extending from the carotid bulb . No hemodynamically significant stenosis within the right internal carotid artery and no hemodynamically significant stenosis or acute vascular occlusion was identified within the proximal anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, or posterior cerebral arteries. Brain MRI showed acute small, positive on diffusion-weighted imaging, ischemic infarction in the left precentral gyrus in the location of the “Omega sign” area which innervates the right hand .\n\n【12】Hospital course\n\n【13】Although the patient’s NIH stroke scale score was 0, since his tone in his right dominant hand was flaccid and he was significantly disabled by his presenting symptoms, after discussing risks and benefits, he received IV rTPA. Patient was admitted to the neuro ICU and had some improvement of his R hand function within 24 h of TPA administration and continued to improve during his hospitalization .He was subsequently started on aspirin antiplatelet therapy and statin (Lipitor) in setting of hyperlipidemia and underwent carotid endarterectomy 3 days after his initial stroke. Post operatively he did fine and was discharged home on post op day 1with minimal residual R hand weakness.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The cortical “hand knob” in the precentral girus has been referred to be the site of hand motor function . It has been described as having an epsilon or omega shape in axial MRI or CT images . In 2007 Caulo et al added 3 morphologic variants to the 2 already known and called them laterally asymmetric epsilon, medially asymmetric epsilon, and nul .\n\n【16】Strokes in this area have been widely suggested to be embolic in origin and hypertension and atherosclerosis disease have been described as the most frequently associated comorbidies . Many authors agree these are small cortical lesions caused by distal embolism with usually no additional tissue at risk and benign clinical course . Despite this, etiology still remains controversial.\n\n【17】Peters et al reviewed 29 patients with hand area cortical strokes. Nearly all the patients had atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery, suggesting a possible arterio-arterial embolic mechanism. They based this suggestion on previous observations that arterial embolic strokes are associated with smaller and more superficial infarcts when compared to cardiogenic ones, assuming that smaller particle size originated from an arterial source, result in more distal infarctions compared to cardiogenic embolism .\n\n【18】In 2001 Gass et al studied 14 consecutive patients with acute distal arm paresis due to a cortical infarct involving the primary motor hand cortex area and concluded that these ischemic strokes are usually caused by distal embolic MCA artery occlusion, either, cardiac or arterial (artery to artery) in origin .\n\n【19】On the other hand Pikula et al recently published their 7 patients’ series with isolated arm weakness and concluded that these cases appear to have a heterogeneous etiology and found no specific pattern .\n\n【20】Many times these lesions are misdiagnosed and symptoms are assigned to lower motor neuron disease . This often leads to mismanagement and incorrect workup.\n\n【21】According to the Guidelines for the early management of adults with ischemic stroke, both CT and MRI are being used as initial imaging diagnostic options . In these cases brain MRI should be considered, if it can be easily obtained, since such a small lesion can be easily missed in CT .\n\n【22】Administration of Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the most beneficial treatment for acute ischemic strokes . Based on the fact that hand weakness is a measurable neurological deficit and can be very disabling, if symptoms are not spontaneously improving and patient has no contraindications, our recommendation is to proceed with IV rTPA administration; followed by a complete stroke workup and treatment of thromboembolic source and risk factors.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Early recognition of a small cortical stroke in patients with sudden onset of hand weakness can lead to appropriate stroke management, administration of IV TPA and early intervention if indicated to prevent further ischemic events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1bfc6b66-29e9-48d6-8494-0178588b0dce", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The risk factors for invasive candidiasis include antibiotic use and duration, more than 4 days on intensive care or longer than 48 hours on mechanical ventilation, high APACHE II score, abdominal surgery, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), central venous catheter (CVC) in situ, and concomitant infection . Around 60% of patients will have one or more of these risk factors . The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection is changing, as most invasive fungal infections previously caused by C. albicans , are now increasingly caused by C. glabrata , C. parapsilosis and C. krusei . The change in the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection means that in vitro testing should include genus- and species-specific susceptibility testing to support clinical decisions.\n\n【2】The use of fluconazole prophylaxis has been associated with the increase in colonization and disease from azole resistant Candida strains . It is reported that, in patients with more than 2 weeks azole prophylaxis, over 17% of Candida spp. exhibited a reduced susceptibility to fluconazole . Intrinsic low-level and acquired high-level azole resistance of C. glabrata has been postulated to have contributed to the emergence of this fungal pathogen in the intensive care unit . As the use of the echinocandins has increased so has selection pressure, and sporadic reports of echinocandin resistance have begun to appear in the literature . The molecular mechanisms of resistance to the echinocandins relate to amino acid substitutions within the FKS1 target gene. At the time of this patient’s treatment, the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) suggested a “susceptible only” breakpoint of < 2 µg/mL for Candida spp. for caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin . However, infections involving isolates with target alterations in the FKS1 gene did not necessarily show minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) above this breakpoint . In addition, in vitro susceptibility testing does not take into account the effect of serum protein binding, which may influence the relative clinical efficacy of the echinocandins . Thus, MIC and susceptibility testing are often poor predictors of clinical outcome in Candida bloodstream infection . Recently, the CLSI have reset the breakpoints for Candida based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. Echinocandin breakpoints for Candida are now species specific and in the case of C. glabrata , different for micafungin than to caspofungin . Similarly, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have also set drug-specific breakpoints for Candida for each of the echinocandin drugs, although due to inter laboratory variation in MIC ranges, the breakpoints for caspofungin against C. glabrata have not yet been established by EUCAST .\n\n【3】Here we report a case of breakthrough Candida bloodstream infection in a 16-year-old male who had previously undergone an emergency laparotomy and had received repeated courses of fluconazole and caspofungin.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In July 2008, a 16-year-old male weighing 50 kg was admitted to hospital with a previous history of constipation and a 4-day history of abdominal pain. Vital signs on admission included a respiratory rate of 32 bpm, blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg, and temperature of 38 °C. The patient was clinically dehydrated and peritonitic; a chest X-ray showed free intraperitoneal gas. Emergency laparotomy revealed a well-established perforation of the mid-sigmoid colon and extensive fecal contamination. A Hartmann’s procedure was carried out, followed by thorough peritoneal lavage and primary abdominal closure. The patient was subsequently transferred to intensive care. In the post-operative period antibacterial prophylaxis with cefuroxime (750 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), metronidazole (500 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g, TDS, Days 6 to 12), gentamicin (320 mg, OD, days 7 to 13) and erythromycin (250 mg, TDS, days 7 to 12) was given.\n\n【6】Recovery from surgery was hampered by multiple infectious complications. On day 3, the patient became pyrexial with a temperature of 39.2 °C. Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured from blood cultures. The CVC was replaced on Day 9 from which Candida tropicalis was reported on day 12; in view of this, fluconazole 400 mg OD was then started. Despite continued combined anti-microbial (meropenem 1 g, TDS days 13 to 18) and anti-fungal therapy, blood cultures remained positive for S. epidermidis and C. tropicalis .\n\n【7】On day 12, the patient also developed a wound infection, and CT scan revealed a pelvic collection. Following dehiscence of the abdominal wound on day 16 which was treated with a VAC dressing, the patient developed a high volume enterocutaneous fistula on day 23 which drained several liters of effluent a day. The CVC was replaced on day 19, and again on day 26, when a Hickman line was introduced instead. The CVC tip culture returned as C. albicans positive. On day 35, fluconazole was replaced with caspofungin (70 mg first dose and then 50 mg OD) due to persistent fever and positive C. tropicalis blood culture. Two further line changes also followed. On day 46, the patient's fever finally abated and bloods returned without fungal-positive cultures. During caspofungin therapy the patient also received antimicrobial therapy with meropenem (1 g, TDS, days 35 to 46), vancomycin (1 g, BD, days 41 to 45) and gentamicin (240 mg, OD, days 32 to 38).\n\n【8】After a couple of days of being afebrile, the patient re-spiked a temperature, and blood cultures once again became positive for S. epidermidis . The CVC was changed for the sixth time and the patient received gentamicin therapy between days 48 and 51. On day 55, meropenem (1 g, TDS) and vancomycin (1 g, BD) were restarted and given until day 62. On day 60, blood cultures returned positive for C. glabrata . Fluconazole 400 mg OD was re-started and the CVC line changed again. Based on sensitivities , the fluconazole therapy was replaced with caspofungin on day 66. The ninth CVC was removed and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was inserted instead. Despite continued caspofungin therapy, the patient’s condition did not improve. On day 84, the PICC line was replaced under cefuroxime, caspofungin plus voriconazole cover for 48-hours while micafungin availability was arranged by pharmacy. Taurolidine citrate 4% line lock was used for the PICC. Micafungin 100 mg OD was started on day 86. On day 89, the PICC line had to be removed for non-infective reasons and a Hickman line inserted with continued taurolodine lock. Micafungin was given between days 86 to 101, and the patient had no further episodes of infection. The patient received TPN for the whole of this period.\n\n【9】The seven isolates of C. glabrata were tested in-house (fluconazole MIC 8 mg/mL) and by the Mycology Regional Laboratory, Wythenshawe Hospital for their antifungal susceptibility. Azoles were tested using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) method , amphotericin B using the Rex method  and caspofungin and micafungin using the CLSI M27-A3 method  .\n\n【10】In summary, between days 11 and 46, the patient developed persistent Candida bloodstream infection (9 positive blood cultures) with C. tropicalis successfully treated with caspofungin. However, between days 62 and 77, the patient again developed persistent Candida bloodstream infection (8 positive blood cultures) this time with C. glabrata that did not respond to caspofungin but which responded to micafungin and concomitant lock therapy with taurolidine 4% citrate.\n\n【11】After an in-patient stay in excess of three months, the patient was transferred to a specialist centre. He remained afebrile with the same Hickman line and had no further infectious complications. The patient developed inevitable intestinal failure and remained on home parenteral nutrition. In the following months, he went on to have reconstructive bowel surgery in the form of closure of the abdominal wall defects and resection of small bowel fistulae; the double barreled jejunostomy which was created has since been closed and the patient has been left with a colostomy.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Literature reports breakthrough Candida bloodstream infection with in vitro-susceptible Candida strains during empiric therapy with fluconazole . We believe that this case study represents the first documented European case of successful treatment of breakthrough C. glabrata infection with micafungin following unsuccessful treatment with caspofungin. The condition of the patient improved, and fever resolved, after the third Hickman line change and initiation of treatment with micafungin. The therapeutic failure of caspofungin against a then - considered susceptible C. glabrata strain is a matter of concern and raises a number of issues.\n\n【14】The relevance of MIC testing for the echinocandins remains unclear . The lack of correlation between elevated MICs and clinical outcome with other antifungals, namely the azoles, was first reported in the literature in 1995 . In this study 232 isolates were collected during a clinical trial of fluconazole and amphotericin B for the treatment of Candida bloodstream infection in non-neutropenic patients. Elevated MICs did not correlate with treatment failure in this study, indeed treatment outcome was successful in four patients despite MICs of > 32 µg/mL. This study group suggested that host factors (such as failure to exchange CVCs) may be more important than MIC in predicting outcome. Uncertain correlation between higher MIC and successful clinical outcome with C. parapsilosis has also been reported in the literature . To investigate the relationship between MIC and outcome, a retrospective analysis of isolates from the caspofungin clinical trial database was undertaken that found no correlation between lower MICs and favorable outcome; indeed, patients with higher MICs (> 2 µg/mL) had better outcomes . These studies highlight the difficulty of interpreting antifungal MIC results in the clinical setting. Although Etests have been shown to produce a wider distribution of MICs than either culture or broth microdilution, no one test has been shown to generate results that significantly correlate with success or failure .\n\n【15】Guidelines recommend that in the presence of elevated MICs to the echinocandins; organism identification and susceptibility testing should be confirmed using a CLSI reference dilution method . The CLSI has now recommended species specific echinocandin breakpoints for Candida species. For C. glabrata , the susceptible breakpoint for micafungin is lower (0.012 µg/mL) than for caspofungin or anidulafungin (0.06 mg/mL). Looking back at the susceptibilities retrospectively, the C. glabrata strain in this patient was resistant (0.5 µg/mL) to caspofungin but was susceptible (≤ 0.015 µg/mL) to micafungin . Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling techniques have provided more accurate information for current and future decision-support analysis.\n\n【16】The points raised in this discussion highlight how the choice of a suitable anti-fungal drug is of paramount importance in the treatment of patients with Candida bloodstream infections. Although amphotericin B, based on its broad spectrum of activity against Candida spp. could be argued to have been an option to consider in this patient, both the Infections Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the management of candidiasis  recommend an echinocandin in preference over amphotericin B for non-neutropenic patients with Candida bloodstream infections, due to concerns of amphotericin B’s toxicity. The high degree of well-documented cross-resistance within the azole class  would have also limited the usefulness of alternative azole agents such as voriconazole for this particular patient following treatment failure with fluconazole.\n\n【17】Other issues in the management of patients with Candida bloodstream infection include host factors, the role of biofilms and the use of line locks. This case of a patient with many of the known risk factors for Candida bloodstream infection, including TPN, abdominal surgery and the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, clearly illustrates the difficulty of managing such patients in clinical practice. Interestingly, in this case there were no further breakthrough Candida bloodstream infections after the Taurolock <sup>™ </sup> (TauroPharm GmbH, Germany) was introduced as a line lock and the switch to micafungin as the antifungal agent. Micafungin, has lower MICs than other members of the class against C. glabrata , which despite the lack of robust evidence for a relationship between MIC and outcome, may have been a contributing factor in the resolution of the multiple Candida bloodstream infections in this patient. Further clinical studies are needed to assess the relevance of MIC to outcome and the influence of other management strategies such as lock therapy, in the complex management of patients with multiple co-morbidities and invasive fungal infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It accounts for 1-4% of all bowel obstructions in the general population, and is the cause of 25% of non-strangulated small bowel obstructions in those over the age of 65 . It has a female preponderance most probably due to the fact that women are more likely to have gallstones . It is typically a disease of the elderly who have multiple co-morbidities; hence diagnosis and management can be challenging . We present a case where a patient had two complications from gallstone ileus during a single admission, which has not previously been reported in the literature, and highlight the use of minimally invasive techniques in the management of such cases.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 78-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of upper abdominal pain and vomiting. On examination, the patient was severely dehydrated. There was tenderness in the epigastrium and a succession splash was audible. Gastric outlet obstruction was suspected and a CT scan was performed, which confirmed a significant stenosis of the pylorus, with appearances suggestive of a neoplastic process. A gastroscopy was attempted soon after to confirm the diagnosis, but it was inconclusive due to the presence of a large amount of gastric fluid residue.\n\n【4】Gastric drainage was established via nasogastric tube insertion and further gastroscopy revealed non-specific pyloric inflammation, confirmed histologically from biopsy at the time of the procedure.\n\n【5】A significant clinical deterioration over the next 2 days mandated a further CT scan, which revealed cholecystoenteric communication and gallstone ileus, with a calculus within the mid small bowel measuring 3 cm , as well as gastric outlet obstruction due to ongoing pyloric inflammation. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy, where the gallstone was retrieved via enterotomy and gross small bowel obstruction was relieved.\n\n【6】Post-operative recovery was initially steady; however, 3 weeks into the admission clinical progress was not satisfactory, with persistent features of proximal obstruction. A third CT scan at that stage showed established gastric outlet obstruction, again highly suspicious of malignancy. The previously taken biopsies revealed inflammation only with no dysplasia.\n\n【7】High volumes of gastric fluid residue required drainage before a further gastroscopy successfully identified a second large gallstone at the pylorus, causing obstruction . This was retrieved with the aid of a lithotriptor to fragment the stone due to its size and roth net to retrieve the fragments . All symptoms of intestinal obstruction resolved following this and the patient made a full recovery.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】A gallstone may enter the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) through the biliary system or via a biliary-enteric fistula. With the latter there are episodes of preceding recurrent calculous cholecystitis resulting in extensive inflammation and adhesions between the gallbladder and GIT . This facilitates the formation of a cholecystoenteric fistula and a channel of entry for the gallstone usually into the duodenum; however, other sites can be the stomach, colon or small bowel . In order of frequency, common sites for obstruction are the terminal ileum, proximal ileum or distal jejunum, colon and only 2% in the duodenum. Obstruction at the duodenal level is known as Bouveret’s syndrome where impaction of the stone causes gastric outlet obstruction . It is generally believed that stone size is an important factor and that stones less than 2.5 cm have a possibility of passing spontaneously . Stones larger than this are likely to cause an obstruction. In our case, the stones measured 2.87 cm in diameter.\n\n【10】The mortality rate has improved over time; however, it remains high at 15-18% due to the multiple co-morbidities of this patient group . In patients presenting with Bouveret’s syndrome, the mortality can be up to 24% . A delay in diagnosis can be a contributing factor as the symptoms of obstruction can resolve and then reoccur as the obstructing stone is propelled distally in the small bowel, known as the “tumbling phenomenon” . Symptoms can vary from those classically seen in bowel obstruction with abdominal pain, distension, nausea and vomiting, to fluid and electrolyte imbalances and weight loss . In the case of Bouveret’s syndrome early nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain are predominant features leading to dehydration. These patients present a diagnostic dilemma with series reporting a median delay of 3 days between admission and surgery .\n\n【11】Plain abdominal radiography is usually the first investigation carried out in patients presenting with bowel obstruction and can occasionally yield a definitive diagnosis of gallstone ileus. The classical Rigler’s triad of dilated bowel loop, pneumobilia and an aberrantly located gallstone is seen in less than 50% of cases . More often other imaging modalities are required and in a minority of cases the diagnosis is made at operation. With the widespread availability of CT scanning, information regarding the site and cause of the obstruction can give a rapid diagnosis in the acute setting . USS and contrast studies can also be useful. CT scanning was used in both presentations of our case. With regard to the gastric outlet obstruction, OGD can make the diagnosis; however, the gallstone is visualized in only 69% of cases, with the remaining requiring a combination of imaging techniques . It is not uncommon for the stone to be obscured at endoscopy in cases of Bouveret’s syndrome due to it being embedded in the mucosa or there is compression of the lumen . Although up to 90% of patients require surgery , it has to be remembered that OGD can be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. In this case, it avoided a second laparotomy in a patient who had undergone a major procedure 10 days previously.\n\n【12】There is no consensus on how these patients should be managed; however, many advocate that enterolithotomy and stone extraction is all that is required due to the elderly population this condition commonly affects . There is a higher morbidity and mortality associated with a one stage approach involving the above with the addition of a cholecystectomy and fistula closure. This can be done with a two stage approach with the cholecystectomy and fistula closure being carried out at a later date. Recurrence of gallstone ileus and ongoing biliary symptoms occur in 5% and 10% of patients respectively and spontaneous closure of the fistula can be seen in up to 50% of cases .\n\n【13】In Bouveret’s syndrome, various treatments have been suggested including endoscopic removal, endoscopic laser lithotripsy, intracorporeal electrohydraulic lithotripsy and surgery . In patients who are at high risk with multiple comorbidities, it can be a viable option; however, multiple sessions may be required and there is a risk that if the stone is not removed en masse , distal obstruction may ensue . In the case presented above, the stone was evacuated in a single procedure.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Our case highlights that the management of this rare condition should be tailored to the patient and clinical scenario. If a patient is fit enough, surgery offers the best solution. Select high-risk cases can be successfully managed with minimally invasive endoscopic techniques.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "6970704a-cd44-4e23-8e63-c03e528657e2", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hemobilia, which is defined as bleeding into the biliary tree, is a rare entity and was first described by Sandblom in 1948 . Hemobilia occurs when there is a communication between a vessel and the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary system and is typically represented as Quincke’s triad: colicky abdominal pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage . The etiology of hemobilia includes iatrogenic trauma, accidental trauma, gallstones, inflammation, vascular malformations and tumors. Accidental trauma used to be the major cause of hemobilia. Currently, two-thirds of hemobilia are caused by iatrogenic trauma, which has been rapidly increasing with the frequent applications of percutaneous hepatic and biliary procedures such as liver biopsy and percutaneous biliary drainage . In contrast, non-traumatic hemobilia due to inflammation, gallstone, and vascular malformations are extremely rare and also difficult to be diagnosed compared to traumatic hemobilia. Pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery is one of non-traumatic hemobilia and as few as 22 cases have been reported . In most of these cases, the patients were treated by either primary cholecystectomy or transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) followed by cholecystectomy.\n\n【2】We report a case of hemobilia caused by psuedoaneurysm of the cystic artery which was successfully treated by performing TAE with metallic coils, without the following cholecystectomy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 71-year-old Japanese woman was sent to the Emergency Department (ED) at our institution, with a subacute onset of epigastric abdominal pain originating from the right upper quadrant. The patient denied a history of hematemesis and melena. Past medical history included hypertension and Parkinson’s disease. She has been suffered by Parkinson’s disease for more than 20 years. The control of this disease has been getting worse and she could hardly walk by herself. She has spent most of her time on wheelchair or lying in bed.\n\n【5】On admission, conjunctiva was slightly pale and icteric. Blood pressure was 90/56 mmHg, body temperature was 38.7 °C, respiratory rate was 20/min, and heart rate was 90/min. The epigastric region appeared full and was tender with palpation. There were no obvious peritoneal findings such as rebound tenderness. Rectal examination was negative for melena. She spoke in very soft voice and joints were stiff because of Parkinson’s disease. Laboratory data on admission showed that white blood cell count (7600/µL), hemoglobin (12.5 g/dl) and platelet count (16.6 x 10 <sup>4 </sup> µL) were normal. Liver function tests showed that total bilirubin (6.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphates (913 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (329 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (343 IU/L),γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (410 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (252 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (5.1mg/dl) were elevated. Coagulation tests were normal.\n\n【6】Although abdominal ultrasonography (US) was immediately performed at ED, it was not diagnostic because of difficulty to hold the proper posture due to Parkinson’s disease and excessive bowel gas. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed marked thickening of the gallbladder wall, which contained high density material. However, these findings did not suggest the presence of vascular abnormalities such as aneurysm . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed two of approximately 15 mm sized circular signal defects in gallbladder in conjunction with dilatation of biliary tree and two or three 5 to 8 mm sized signal defects in the common bile duct close to the papilla of Vater . Radiologist suggested that there are possibly stones in gallbladder and common bile duct at this point. Based on the radiographic findings, differential diagnosis included acute cholicystitis, cholelithiasis, and choledocholithiasis at this point. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotics were started to treat this condition.\n\n【7】On the second day of admission, even though the clinical symptoms and the signs of inflammation appeared to be improving, the patient vomited a large amount of coagulated blood and digital examination revealed a large amount of tarry stool in the rectum. This was the first as well as only episode of hematomesis and melena during the entire clinical course. However, the amount of blood vomited was estimated at approximately 500 mL and the patient showed hypovolemic shock with low systemic blood pressure of under 80 mmHg and tachycardia of 100 /min. The patient was given 2 units of red blood cells transfusion and rapid ringer infusion for resuscitation. In the meantime, emergent upper endoscopy was performed and demonstrated a large amount of coagula in the stomach. No obvious site of bleeding was found in the stomach after removal of the coagula. Upper endoscopy was then advanced to the 2nd portion of duodenum demonstrating that a small amount of blood was suddenly spouted out from the papilla of Vater . This finding was observed only once during the procedure, although we kept on observing there for more than 30 minutes. At this point, decision was made to perform dynamic CT to evaluate the cause of hemobilia. The arterial and portal venous phases of dynamic CT showed the presence of approximately 12 mm nodular lesion at possibly inside the neck of gall bladder with an enhanced pattern parallel to the arterial phase in conjunction with the thickening of gallbladder wall . The nodular lesion, which was not detected on admission, showed no obvious extravasation of contrast agents into surrounding structures. These results suggested the presence of newly developed vascular pseudoaneurysm in conjunction with possible cholecystitis. Although the dynamic CT did not demonstrate any signs of active bleeding from the nodular lesion, patient was hemodynamically unstable and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed for the diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. At the time of DSA, therapeutic materials such as micro coils and gelform were ready to use for the treatment of unexpected bleeding. DSA through the hepatic artery demonstrated the presence of a pseudoaneurysm originated from the cystic artery without any extravasation of contrast agents . Although there was no sign of active bleeding into biliary tree, it was thought that the intermittent bleeding due to the rupture of pseudoaneurysm could cause hemobilia. The right hepatic artery was selectively catheterized, and one microcoil was then placed distal and the other one was placed proximal to the aneurysm to block the arterial inflow to the pseudoaneurysm. Prior to embolization, we confirmed that the sufficient blood supply to the right liver lobe was preserved through the left hepatic artery .\n\n【8】The patient was hemodynamically stabilized immediately after embolization and the clinical symptoms improved significantly. Based on further assessment by anesthesiologists, decision was made not to proceed to any further surgical management such as cholecystectomy because of her severe co-morbidities, and also the patient refused to undergo surgery. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated the presence of stones in the gallbladder, and following the balloon dilation of the sphincter of Odd, small stones came out from the papilla of Vater. At a follow-up of 12 months, the patient was asymptomatic and satisfied with the outcome of treatment.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Non-traumatic cause of hemobilia includes inflammatory conditions such as cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis, and malignancies. Twenty-two cases of hemobilia caused by pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery have been published in English literature. In most of these cases, abdominal US were performed as a primary imaging modality to screen the cause of abdominal pain. In 6 cases, pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery was suspected by color doppler US and followed by enhanced and/or dynamic CT, dynamic MRI, and/or angiography to confirm the diagnosis. Enhanced CT would be the second imaging modality to detect the pseudoaneurysm. Following the initial evaluation with abdominal US and CT, angiography was then performed in most of cases to visualize the vascular abnormalities such as psuedoaneurysm and 8 cases subsequently underwent TAE. Of 18 cases, in which gastrointestinal bleeding such as hematemesis or melena occurred, the blood from papilla of Vater was successfully observed in 6 cases under direct endoscopic visualization and hemobilia was confidently diagnosed. As the present case showed, the direct observation of hemobilia from papilla of Vater has been difficult to encounter, although it is crucial for the accurate diagnosis. Based on the diagnosis of hemobilia, 15 cases were treated with surgery, 3 cases with TAE followed by surgery, and 4 cases with only TAE. The 4 cases, which were treated with only TAE, were not complicated by gallbladder ischemia.\n\n【11】A pseudoaneurysm is a hematoma that is formed as the result of blood leaked from injured arterial wall. The hematoma develops outside the arterial wall so it is wrapped by the surrounding tissues. The exact mechanism to develop a pseudoaneurysm and the association between pseudoaneurysm and inflammatory process such as cholecystitis remains unclear. In the review of 16 cases of cystic artery pseudoaneurysm caused by cholecystitis, Akatsu et al  assumed that the acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall may cause both ulceration of serosa and partial erosion of the elastic and muscular components of the arterial wall, thus leading to the formation and rupture of the pseudoaneurysm. The presence of gall stone may accelerate the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. Furthermore, arterial sclerosis due to hypertension is considered as a risk factor of aneurysm formation  and weakness of arterial wall due to arterial sclerosis may also accelerate the formation of the pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【12】In the present case, the pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery was not detected by US, enhanced CT, or MRCP. One of the signal defects in gall bladder in MRCP could be the pseudoaneurysm, however angiography showed that the pseudoaneurysm was present at the different location, the neck of gall bladder. Although initial enhanced CT did not show any sign of vascular abnormalities, dynamic CT clearly demonstrated the presence of psuedoaneurysm two days after admission. The inflammatory process on gallbladder may be associated with the formation of pseudoaneurysm, which may be developed or enlarged after admission. On the other hand, initial enhanced CT was sliced every 10 mm meanwhile dynamic CT was sliced every 7 mm. The size of aneurysm measured by DSA was approximately 15 mm of diameter so that initial enhanced CT may have missed the initiation of pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【13】Although the typical presentation of hemobilia is represented by Quincke’s triad such as colicky abdominal pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the complete typical triad can be seen in approximately two-thirds of patients who are usually presented with abdominal pain followed by hematemesis or melena . In contrast, our patient was presented with jaundice and abdominal pain. It is possible that the gastrointestinal and biliary motility had been impaired due to the long-standing history of Parkinson’s disease  so that the blood clots stayed longer in the common bile duct to represent the sign of jaundice first, and also in stomach and intestines to represent the late presentation of hematemesis and melena. On the other hand, abdominal US, especially color doppler US, has been recognized as a highly effective diagnostic tool for detecting pseudoaneurysms . However, previous reports have demonstrated that a pseudoaneurysm was detected with color-doppler US only in 6 of 22 cases. Similarly, these imaging modalities were not sufficient enough to make a diagnosis in the present case because of the posture limitation and excessive bowel gas probably due to Parkinson’s disease related impaired gastrointestinal motility.\n\n【14】In the present case, the patient was diagnosed with hemobilia confidently because the bleeding from the papilla of Vater was observed under direct endoscopic visualization by chance. If there was no chance to witness this finding, this patient would be diagnosed with acute gastric mucosal lesion, healed gastroduodenal ulcer, or any other cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, and undergo further re-intervention. It is noted that hemobilia should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding when no obvious bleeding site can be found by upper endoscopy, and further imaging modalities such as contrast and/or dynamic CT and angiography should be considered to assess possible vascular abnormalities. DSA can be a both diagnostic and therapeutic method for the management of vascular abnormalities. Endoscopy can be a diagnostic tool but it is almost impossible to treat hemobilia with endoscopic procedure.\n\n【15】Hemobilia due to rupture of pseudoaneurysm developed on the cystic artery can be treated by either cholecystectomy or TAE. Maeda et al.  reported a case which was successfully treated by a “two-step” strategy consisting of embolization of the cystic artery followed by elective cholecystectomy. Whether cholecystectomy is required after successful embolization of cystic artery pseudoaneurysms remains controversial. Although the concern after embolization of cystic artery is the development of gallbladder ischemia, we assume that embolization of the cystic artery would not lead to ischemia of the gallbladder because it has been reported that the blood supply from gallbladder bed should be sufficient and collateral anastomoses with the epicholedochal artery may develop after embolization of the cystic artery . In our case, we decided not to perform cholecystectomy following TAE because of severe co-morbidities and patient’s refusal. Although cholecystectomy may not be required as far as there are no signs of gallbladder ischemia, the patient needs to be carefully monitored following TAE.\n\n【16】In conclusion, we report the case of hemobilia due to pseudoaneurysm originated from the cystic artery presenting with jaundice and upper abdominal pain followed by massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was successfully treated by TAE. Hemobilia, especially due to psuedoaneurysm of cystic artery, is extremely rare. The direct visualization of blood from the papilla of Vater is crucial for the definitive diagnosis, but is difficult to encounter. Therefore, hemobilia should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with unknown etiology and there should be low threshold to perform dynamic CT and angiography to assess the vascular abnormalities. Although the management of hemobilia due to pseudoanerysm remains controversial, non-surgical approach such as TAE could be a reasonable and definitive treatment option especially for high-risk patients who are not suitable for surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "7f9f9174-11a0-4c7a-accf-c7ad74945ee7", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Evans syndrome (ES) presents with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) . In addition, patients can also present with neutropenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Neutropenia, AIHA and ITP can occur at the same time or present sequentially . ES is more prevalent in the pediatric population as compared to adults .\n\n【2】ES can be categorized as primary or secondary which is dependent on presence or absence of associated connective tissue diseases/autoimmune diseases . Primary type is considered to be idiopathic whereas secondary ES is associated with other diseases or syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, common variable immunodeficiency and non-Hodgkin lymphoma . When associated with other diseases, the management (and outcomes) may be different as opposed to the management of primary ES, which makes correct diagnosis of integral importance .\n\n【3】ES is associated warm AIHA, in which immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies react with red blood cell (RBC) surface antigens at body temperature, as opposed to cold AIHA .\n\n【4】The presenting signs and symptoms of ES can be variable. Although primarily a chronic condition, it is characterized by relapsing remitting flares which can be challenging to manage. It is rare for patients to develop thrombotic events. Although venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been reported in some cases, there are no clearly established incidence rates of arterial thrombosis in patient with ES. According to one retrospective study evaluating 68 patients of ES, six patients developed cardiovascular events over a period of 4.8 years among which four had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) . The study also reflected that risk of AIHA-related complication such as thrombosis may supersede the risk of thrombocytopenia-related complications such as bleeding . Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presenting with ES is extremely rare . Treatment involves steroids, although patients who do not respond to steroids, may require more aggressive interventions such as administration of rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In some cases, with significant thrombocytopenia, splenectomy may also be considered although the benefits of splenectomy are not well established. We present an interesting case of ES with unstable angina (UA) requiring rituximab and intravenous (IV) steroids.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 64-year-old male with past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease with two prior stent placements in right coronary artery and patent ductus arteriosus, presented to the emergency room (ER) due to chest pain and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. He also endorsed fatigue and gross hematuria. Patient did not have any petechiae, bleeding elsewhere or rash. The review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】Physical examination demonstrated splenomegaly and palmar pallor. Otherwise, examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiography (EKG) was done which demonstrated ST depression in leads I, aVL, V5 - V6, T wave inversion in lead III and aVL; these findings were new compared to previous EKG. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin 9.6 (reference value: 13.8 - 18 g/dL); platelet count 58 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (reference value: 150 - 450 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL); segmented neutrophils 80% (25-62%); troponin < 0.03 ng/mL (reference value: < 0.03 ng/mL); lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (reference value: 0.5 - 2 mmol/L); total bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL (reference value: 0.3 - 1 mg/dL); direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (reference value: 0 - 0.2 mg/dL); reticulocyte count 3.8% (reference value: 0.7-1.7%); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 478 U/L (reference value: 140 - 271 U/L); haptoglobin < 30 mg/dL (reference value: 44 - 215 mg/dL). His iron, vitamin B 12, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and folic acid were within normal range. Ferritin level was not checked. His prior hemoglobin approximately 11 months to admission was 15.4 g/dL. Prior EKG did not show any gross ST segment or T-wave changes but did show q waves in lead II, III, V4, V5 and V6. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was done which was unremarkable except for splenomegaly (16 cm). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal ejection fraction and moderate aortic stenosis. Blood smear was urgently done, and it indicated spherocytes without evidence of schistocytes. Patient was admitted with concern for possible AIHA and UA.\n\n【10】Cardiology consultant evaluated the patient and observed patient’s presentation was consistent with UA with symptoms also being contributed by anemia. Hematology also evaluated the patient and determined that patient’s presentation was likely secondary to ES due to presence of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. They also observed other possibilities included paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea despite AIHA being more likely due to smear findings. Direct antiglobulin test was obtained, and it came back positive for IgG confirming the diagnosis of AIHA. Due to concurrent likely immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, the diagnosis of ES was established. Patient was also considered to have concurrent UA which can be categorized as a thrombotic event despite ES’s association with thrombocytopenia.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】Patient was started on prednisone 80 mg daily. Patient continued to have anemia and after two doses, prednisone was switched to dexamethasone 40 mg once daily for 4 days. Patient underwent cardiac stress tests once he clinically improved which indicated mild reversible inferior apical ischemia. Cardiac catheterization was pursued, and it revealed 95% stenosis of proximal left circumflex artery requiring single drug eluding stent placement. Dual antiplatelet therapy was also initiated due to high risk of stent thrombosis despite ongoing intermittent transfusions.\n\n【13】Patient continued to have anemia (dropped from 9.6 to 7.6 g/dL) despite five intermittent blood transfusions, although his platelet counts improved (58 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL to 88 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). Patient remained hemodynamically stable. Later his hemoglobin dropped to 7.1 g/dL and by this time he had received a total of eight packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions since admission. He was considered to be a candidate for rituximab, and he was started on 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every week for total four doses. Patient’s hepatitis B core antibody later was noted to be positive with a negative hepatitis surface antigen and positive hepatitis B surface antibody. There was a concern for risk of reactivation of hepatitis B with rituximab for which he was started on entecavir prophylactically. His hemoglobin dropped to 6.3 g/dL 2 days after receiving the rituximab, which prompted the involvement of surgical consultants for possible splenectomy. However, subsequently after two more units of hemoglobin his hemoglobin stabilized, and splenectomy was deferred.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】Patient’s hemoglobin stabilized after first dose of rituximab. IV steroids were transitioned to oral prednisone 90 mg once daily. He was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy which he tolerated well, and thrombocytopenia continued to improve. Patient’s chest pain resolved post cardiac catheterization. Once patient clinically improved, he was discharged with plans for slow tapering of steroids of prednisone 90 mg and recommendations for outpatient cardiology and hematology follow-up. Plan was also to continue rituximab weekly for a total of four doses.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】“Primary Evans syndrome (ES) is defined by the concurrent or sequential occurrence of immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the absence of an underlying etiology” . Diagnosis of primary ES is established once other etiologies such as primary immunodeficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are ruled out . If patient is anemic, a smear should be done promptly which may show spherocytes, which may help in diagnosis as it is indicative of autoimmune hemolysis. The absence of schistocytes can be considered a clue to rule out TTP as was the case in our patient. Coombs’s test can also be done which can further assist in establishing diagnosis. Other tests indicating hemolytic anemia include LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count and bilirubin levels. Often, ES can have relapsing and remitting course requiring recurrent interventions. Due to the rarity of syndrome itself, no randomized studies focusing on treatment are available till date and therapy is mainly tailored towards addressing AIHA and ITP . “Corticosteroids represent the cornerstone therapy, used at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg of prednisone” . Patients who do not respond to steroids may require rituximab, IVIG or even splenectomy.\n\n【18】ACS can rarely occur with ES and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating early reperfusion . As this is a thrombotic process, it can be difficult to diagnose in the setting of ES which commonly presents with thrombocytopenia. The pathophysiology of the thrombotic events in ES is not clearly understood. One hypothesis revolves around association of AIHA with thrombotic events since ES manifests with AIHA as well. AIHA has been associated with thrombotic events and according to literature 15-33% adults with warm AIHA may have VTEs . However, considering ES patient also have thrombocytopenia, the mechanism of thrombosis in such patients is not clearly understood. There are a limited number of cases reports or case series emphasizing on the occurrence of thrombotic events in ES.\n\n【19】In our patient, normal troponin levels further complicated the situation making it harder to determine if underlying cardiac ischemia was present. However, there was high suspicion due to the character of his chest pain and risk factors. A cardiac stress test was pursued, and it was positive for ischemia. Multivessel disease was later confirmed through cardiac catheterization leading to stent placement which also presented a new challenge in the form of necessity of dual antiplatelets and risk of bleeding due to anemia as well as thrombocytopenia. Although platelets contribute to occurrence of ACS, thrombocytopenia does not result in reduction of this problem . Hence, in our patient dual antiplatelet therapy was continued.\n\n【20】As the patient had risk factors for coronary artery disease these risk factors can be the primary reasons for UA. Considering recent onset of chest pain and concurrent presence of ES, it was considered that UA may have occurred due to thrombotic process secondary to ES, although it is difficult to establish this with certainty.\n\n【21】Patient did not initially respond to oral steroids which complicated the hospital course further. Prednisone was transitioned to IV dexamethasone, although there is limited evidence of any significant benefit to patients who do not respond to steroids. Eventually he was started on rituximab infusion which resulted in stabilization of his hemoglobin levels. He only required two more units of PRBC transfusions after rituximab infusion and thereafter his hemoglobin was noted to uptrend. Prior to initiation of rituximab, patient had required eight units of PRBC transfusions. This highlights the importance of transitioning from steroids of immunotherapy in non-responsive cases. Rituximab which has been approved for lymphomas has also been used to treat ITP and AIHA such as ES .\n\n【22】An interesting factor of this case was positive results for core hepatitis B antibody. There have been reported case reports of ES secondary to hepatitis B. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a new boxed warning of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after 109 cases of fatal reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were receiving rituximab . In our patient considering his hepatitis B surface antibody was positive he was considered not to have active hepatitis B infection. However, it was deduced that there may be residual HBV in the liver with potential for reactivation with rituximab. Hence, he was prophylactically given entecavir which is an inhibitor of replication of HBV .\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】ES is a rare disorder which can present with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Although it is usually associated with thrombocytopenia it can sometimes lead to thrombotic processes. ACS can rarely present in the setting of ES which can be challenging to manage considering the treatment may require stent placement and dual antiplatelet therapy in the setting of anemia and thrombocytopenia. The treatment of ES involves steroids which can be followed by rituximab, IVIG or splenectomy for non-responsive cases. If a thrombotic event such as ACS occurs due to ES, patients may require reperfusion and dual antiplatelet therapy. Early intervention and management can prevent mortality and morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8c02cbb8-a477-4c00-9d4d-86abe3dc49b7", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Wilms’ tumor also known as nephroblastoma is the most common primary renal tumor in children, usually presenting between 6 months and 5 years of age . The majority of patients present with an abdominal mass, abdominal pain, hypertension or hematuria. One recognized yet uncommon presentation is a disturbance in coagulation function related to acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) . Bleeding episodes due to AvWS have been reported in patients affected by lymphoproliferative, myeloproliferative, cardiovascular, neoplasia, and autoimmune disorders . AvWS in association with Wilms’ tumor is characterized by bleeding related to platelet dysfunction and disturbances of coagulation function including an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) .\n\n【2】Neuraxial techniques such as the epidural anesthesia provide effective analgesia following major surgical procedures including laparotomy or thoracotomy. However, neuraxial techniques including epidural anesthesia are contraindicated in patients with altered coagulation function due to the risk of epidural hematoma formation. We present a 2-year-old boy who presented for right radical nephrectomy due to Wilms’ tumor disease. Preoperative evaluation revealed prolonged PTT and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Coagulation function guidelines for epidural anesthesia are reviewed and alternative techniques such as a wound catheter are presented.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. A 2-year-old, 12.1 kg toddler presented to his primary care provider with a chief complaint of cough and constipation. On physical exam, an abdominal mass was noted by his primary care physician and he was admitted for further evaluation. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney, consistent with Wilms’ tumor. His past medial history included a blocked tear duct and infection due to human metapneumovirus. He had no past surgical history except for an uncomplicated circumcision. His medications at the time of surgery were included enalapril and isradipine for blood pressure control. Preoperative blood pressure was 107/68 mm Hg. Physical exam was unremarkable except for a slightly distended abdomen. Preoperative laboratory results revealed hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit 32%, and an elevated platelet count of 533,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were normal. Coagulation studies showed a prothrombin time 13.5 s, a prolonged PTT of 43 s. He was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol followed by rocuronium to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Central venous and arterial cannulas were placed. Maintenance anesthesia consisted of sevoflurane in air and oxygen with intermittent doses of fentanyl. The tumor was resected without complications. Surgical time was 4 h and 14 min. A total of 375 mL of crystalloid was infused and 32 mL of urine was collected. Minimal blood loss was recorded for the procedure. Repeat coagulation studies revealed persistence of the prolonged aPTT (43 s), which contraindicated neuraxial epidural, so a wound catheter was placed during surgical closure. The wound catheter was inserted above closed parietal peritoneum and underneath the muscular fascia layer. At the completion of the case, the patient’s trachea was extubated, and he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Postoperatively, a continuous local anesthetic wound infusion (CLAWI) was administered with ropivacaine 0.2% at 1.2 mL/h for the initial 48 postoperative hours. Initial postoperative pain was assessed as 3 of 10 on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) pain scale. Additional analgesia was provided by intravenous acetaminophen (10 mg/kg intravenously every 6 h) and nurse-controlled analgesia with hydromorphone. Total consumption of intravenous hydromorphone was 4.04 mg (0.33 mg/kg) over the first 48 postoperative hours. FLACC scores were recorded every 2 h postoperatively with the majority being scored at 0 and a one-time maximum score of 5 for the initial 48 postoperative hours. The postoperative course was uncomplicated except for the need for ongoing medications for blood pressure control.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Hemostasis is a complex process regulated by thrombogenic and anti-thrombogenic factors which balance coagulation and bleeding . Primary hemostasis results from the interactions between platelets, the vessel wall, adhesive proteins, and coagulation factors leading to the formation of the initial platelet plug. Normally, platelets do not adhere to intact vascular endothelium. However, after a vascular injury, platelets attach to collagen and vWF in the subendothelial tissue, initiating the coagulation process . A secondary function of vWF is to bind with plasma proteins such as factor VIII (FVIII) in its inactive state, thus preventing its rapid degradation by other proteases . Deficiencies in genes encoding the vWF result in von Willebrand disease (vWD), the most common inherited disturbance of coagulation function . Laboratory findings include both defective platelet function (aggregation) as well as a prolongation of the aPTT .\n\n【7】AvWS is a rare bleeding disorder that usually occurs in individuals with no previous or family history of bleeding. Although it is similar to inherited vWD with regard to laboratory and clinical findings, the etiology of prolonged aPTT in AvWS involves a diverse group pathological conditions . Since most AvWS patients synthesized normal vWF, the mechanisms responsible for producing dysfunctional coagulation in these patients include destruction of vWF by autoantibodies, absorption of vWF by malignant cell clones, and damage to high-molecular-weight (HMW) vWF multimers due to high shear stress . One of the more common pediatric malignancies associated with AvWS is Wilms’ tumor . A retrospective evaluation of the coagulation profile of 190 children with Wilms’ tumor revealed AvWS in eight for an incidence of approximately 4% .\n\n【8】These data would suggest that routine evaluation of coagulation function is indicated prior to neuraxial anesthesia in patients with Wilms’ tumor. In patients without evidence of defects in coagulation function, Vandermuelen et al reported the incidence of epidural hematoma formation to be approximately 1: 220,000 after intrathecal anesthesia and 1: 150,000 after epidural anesthesia . The American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) cautions against placing epidural catheters in patient with abnormal coagulation function due to increased risk for epidural hematoma . Proceeding with neuraxial anesthesia in the presence of clinical anticoagulation or abnormal coagulation function can lead to severe, potentially devastating consequences from spinal hematoma formation. Sequelae may include requirement for surgical evacuation, residual lower extremity motor and sensory deficits, and permanent paraplegia.\n\n【9】Given such concerns, we chose to use Continuous Local Anesthetic Wound Infusion (CLAWI) for postoperative analgesia. The technique has emerged as attractive option in various clinical scenarios given its efficacy and ease of catheter placement . Data in both adult and pediatric patients have demonstrated effective analgesia, decreased opioid requirements, and earlier return of bowel function. In a prospective trial, the continuous preperitoneal infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 mL/h for 48 h following open colorectal resection reduced morphine consumption, improved pain relief, and accelerated postoperative recovery . Similar results were reported following open hepatic surgery .\n\n【10】Efficacy has also been demonstrated in the pediatric population. In children with spina bifida undergoing major reconstruction of the lower urinary tract, a continuous infusion of 0.1% ropivacaine provided postoperative analgesia while reducing systemic opioid use and associated adverse effects . In children undergoing laparotomy for complicated appendicitis, a multimodal regimen that included a CLAWI with 0.2% bupivacaine, paracetamol, and rescue intravenous morphine, served as a safe and effective technique for postoperative analgesia . Anecdotally, we noted similar efficacy in our patient. Given the associated coagulation disturbance, a wound catheter was placed during surgical closure of the incision. During closure of the surgical wound, a multi-holed soaker catheter was inserted above the closed parietal peritoneum and underneath the muscular fascia layer, covering the full length of the wound. The infusion catheter was secured to the skin, the subcutaneous and skin layers closed followed by placement of sterile dressings. Our catheter placement technique is similar to previous studies that showed wound catheter inserted on the pre-peritoneal area or within the muscle fascia is associated with better pain control compared to the subcutaneous layer . The CLAWI was used as part of a multimodal pain management strategy with intravenous acetaminophen and NCA-hydromorphone.\n\n【11】In conclusion, we describe the perioperative care of a 2-year-old toddler with Wilms’ tumor and AvWS. Given the potential for coagulation defects as part of a paraneoplastic process, routine assessment of coagulation function is suggested prior to neuraxial anesthesia. Since epidural analgesia is contraindicated in these patients, multimodal analgesia that includes continuous wound infiltration with local anesthetics offers an effective alternative for postoperative management of pain. Although the analgesic effect of continuous wound infiltration of local anesthetics is inferior to that of epidural anesthesia, CLAWI has been shown to reduce opioid requirements, accelerate the return of bowel function, and improve the postoperative course. A multimodal pain management strategy that includes CLAWI is safe and effective technique for postoperative pain control in children undergoing open abdominal surgery.\n\n【12】Funding Support\n\n【13】Departmental funding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

An elevated serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level in a female patient normally demonstrates the presence of a pregnancy or less commonly, gestational trophoblastic disease or ovarian germ cell tumors. Previous in vitro studies performed suggested that β-hCG promotes tumor progression by inhibiting apoptosis as a result of blocking the transforming growth factor-beta receptor. This has been correlated with the relative rapid progression of β-hCG positive tumors and greater propensity to metastasize . We report a case of stage 3B cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) presenting with abdominal pain and findings of elevated serum β-hCG with pregnancy excluded. Further investigations revealed a metastasis of her primary cervical SCC. We suggest that this rise in β-hCG attributed to ectopic secretion of the hormone by tumour cells and could be a potential prognostic and therapeutic marker.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 44-year-old Vietnamese female, gravida 4, parity 3 (1NVD, 2 LSCS, 1 TOP), with a past surgical history of previous Cesarean section, tubal ligation in 2011, was first diagnosed with stage 3B cervical SCC in November 2016 with right hydronephrosis and a large right sided urinoma. She underwent six cycles of concurrent radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy 50.4Gy × 5 and brachytherapy × 3 (two interstitial and one intracavitary)) and cisplatin. Her treatment duration lasted from December 1, 2016 to January 24, 2017. She remained amenorrheic since completion of treatment. The patient also underwent percutaneous nephrostomy and drainage catheter insertion for her hydronephrosis. Her condition was complicated by thrombosis in right uterine, internal iliac and common iliac veins and she was started on therapeutic clexane. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis were done in April 2017 to assess treatment response which showed interval metabolic resolution at region of cervix, no cervical mass seen, resolution of hydronephrosis and no distant metastasis. The previously noted thrombosis in right uterine, internal iliac and common iliac veins had resolved. The patient was then planned for surveillance monitoring. She remained disease-free for 9 months.\n\n【4】In January 2018, she was referred to our emergency department with worsening right lower back and flank pain of 2 weeks duration, and initial urine pregnancy test was positive. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness at the right flank. Cervix was not visualized on speculum examination and no abnormality of the vault was noted. Initial investigations showed an elevated β-hCG of 593 IU/mL.\n\n【5】Ultrasound scan of the pelvis reported a 2.1 × 0.9 × 0.9 cm endometrial polyp and a 2.9 × 2.8 × 2.9 cm left wall intramural fibroid. No gestational sac was noted. Bilateral ovaries were normal, no adnexal mass was seen; there was small amount of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas . Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed a large mass (13.1 × 10.8 × 8.3 cm) occupying the whole right lobe of the liver with two cystic components noted within the mass which appears to be extending beyond the liver capsule. The right hepatic vein was attenuated, suggesting possible diagnosis of hepatic metastasis. We proceeded with a MRI of the abdomen and pelvis which showed large liver lesions with right chest wall involvement and para-aortic lymphadenopathy, suspicious for metastasis .\n\n【6】The patient subsequently underwent an ultrasound guided needle aspiration and biopsy of the right hepatic lobe cystic lesion. Histology showed features consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from the female genital tract. The patient was counselled for palliative chemotherapy and was commenced on a cisplatin and taxol regime. Her serum β-hCG revealed a downward trend after completion of palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has been detected within tissue homogenates, culture fluid, and serum of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Studies regarding in vivo localization of beta-hCG in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are scant and non-conclusive . In this unique case, the rise in β-hCG is likely attributed to ectopic secretion by metastatic cervical SCC tumor in the liver, as presence of pregnancy, choriocarcinoma or germ cell tumor were excluded. As early as 1981, it was discovered that cervical cancer can produce a β-hCG immunoreactive substance . However, only 30% are detectable in blood as the glycoprotein is usually rapidly degraded and cleared by the liver and kidney . The poor sensitivity has restricted the use of hCG in detecting cervical cancer and monitoring of response following therapy but this has led to the investigation of using urinary gonadotropins (UGF) as an alternative tumor marker. Although there is a lack of correlation between mean level of serum hCG level and advancement of cancer, studies suggest increased sensitivity of serum hCG and UGF with advanced disease . In vitro studies with bladder cell lines suggest β-hCG plays an anti-apoptotic role and β-hCG expression correlates with reduced tumor cell apoptosis and may be involved in tumor vascularization and dissemination . This may mean that serum and urinary β-hCG levels can be useful in screening of patients post therapy and monitoring cancer progression or regression.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】This case has shown a phenomenon of recurrent metastatic cervical SCC with elevated serum β-hCG level originating from the hepatic metastasis. We conclude that ectopic secretion of β-hCG from tumor cells is a consideration in a patient who has detectable serum β-hCG but no clinical evidence of pregnancy. Although rare, metastatic or recurrent SCC can secrete serum β-hCG  and case reports have shown presence of serum β-hCG even in non-gynecological tumors . Larger studies are required to investigate the full potential of serum or urinary β-hCG in the role of prognosticating SCC of the cervix.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "55935d7b-41c7-46a5-a2f5-1d61b0469767", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】In recent years, degenerative, neoplastic, infections or inflammatory, traumatic and iatrogenic causes of vertebral column instability with or without concomitant neural compression are well suited for treatment with plate-screw and autolog graft fixation from an anterior surgical approach . The risks related to screw-plate stabilization of the cervical spine include all risks intrinsic to a routine anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion procedure; injuries to branches of the vagal nerve, dysphasia, esophageal perforation, radicular or myelopathic injury, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, graft migration, postoperative hematoma, stroke and donor site morbidity, if autologous graft is used .\n\n【2】The goals of internal fixation are to restore stability to the structurally compromised spine, to maintain alignment after correction of a deformity, to prevent the progression of a deformity and to alleviate pain. Rarely, these materials may penetrate into esophagus and eliminate through the intestinal tract . In this study, we report a late complication of displacement and loss of an anterior cervical plate and screws in an asymptomatic patient.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 42-year-old female presented with cervical trauma in 1998. The neurologic condition appeared to be normal. Radiographic examination of the cervical spine demonstrated a fracture line in the top end plate of C6 corpus and dislocation of C5-6 . Surgical treatment included anterior C6 corpectomy, anterior iliac crest graft placement and fixation using plate and screws. The immediate post-operative course was uneventful. During the 2 years of follow-up, the patient had no complains, and no changes was observed in the radiography. In 2002, cervical radiographs showed fracture of the screws and dislocation of the plate to C7-T2 levels. The patient had no clinical symptoms, and fusion response is obtained radiologically. We recommended removing plate and screws to prevent tissue injuries. However, the patient did not accept. Cervical MR investigation showed cervical fusion decompressed spinal canal and lordotic curvature. On a subsequent cervical CT in 2011, the displaced plate and screws were no longer visible. Only the broken screw in the corpus of C7 was seen. Whole body fluoroscopy could not identify any plate or displaced screws . Barium meal swallow study showed proximally esophageal stenosis, double lumen imaging and deformity . Gastrointestinal tract endoscopy investigation showed stenosis was in the cervical segment, mild esophageal erosion and traction diverticula .\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Anterior cervical plate and screws are widely used for traumatic, degenerative, infections and neoplastic conditions of the cervical spine .\n\n【7】The reasons for morbidity and mortality due to these procedures are mainly infection, dislocation of plate-screw systems, and trachea esophagus, and vessel injuries .\n\n【8】Esophagus perforation due to anterior cervical approaches may lead to spontaneous healing without any notice or mortality caused by abscess, mediastinitis and sepsis . Infection risk is low after cervical discectomy and fusion procedures (0.1-1.6%). Especially, infections after 6 months of operation are very rare, and it may be associated with esophagus perforation due to displaced plate and screw systems . No early and late infection was seen in the patient. Frequent symptoms due to esophagus perforation are neck and throat pain, odynophagia, dysphasia, hoarseness and aspiration. The common clinical symptoms are high fever, neck stiffness, crepitation on the anterior surface of chest and neck . Gaudinez et al reported the importance of surgical treatment in esophagus perforation after anterior cervical trauma surgery. In their study, they demonstrated high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with medical treatments . In our study, patient showed an asymptomatic course.\n\n【9】There are reports of esophageal penetration after dislocation of plate and screw systems in the literature . In 2007, Martinez et al reported the screw migration after surgery of a C5-7 anterior decompression and fusion. Six years after surgery, the patient presented with dysphasia, and in the radiological examination, the screw could no longer be identified. Plate and screw systems were removed, and the patient was treated for prevertebral abscess secondary to esophagus perforation . Gazzeri et al reported a case of spontaneous healing of esophagus fistule due to screw elimination through the intestinal tract one week after the patient complained of dysphasia and high fever . Cagli et al reported cervical screw missing secondary to delayed esophageal fistula. Two years after the anterior discectomy, iliac graft placement and fixation, plate dislocation and partial migration of the upper screw were observed. After 7 years, the patient complained of dysphasia. Radiographical examination showed that one of the upper screws was missing and two lower screws were broken. Esophageal perforation was found during the removing surgery of plate, and screw systems and perforation were repaired. They concluded the screw was lost via the gastrointestinal due to spontaneous perforation of esophagus fistula . Fujibayashi et al reported a case of an anterior cervical plate and screws, which were disappeared completely. The plate and screws became dislodged and eroded through the posterior wall of the esophagus, then traversed the limit of the gastrointestinal tract. But this is related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection .\n\n【10】In the literature, missing screws were described rarely. However, only one symptomatic missing plate was described. This is first case in literature with asymptomatic, missing plate and screws. We concluded that plate and screws had been eliminated thought the intestinal tract without any significant notice. Seemingly, the plate penetrates into esophagus at one side and healing process of esophagus continues on the other side. As a result of this mechanism, the plate and screws left the body without any significant defect in esophagus.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】It can be concluded that in surgery of the cervical spine, anterior instrumentation is useful and relatively safe. Each case with displacement of plate and screws, neurosurgeons must be alert for esophageal perforation or other tissue injuries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Here we present a case of mediastinal bronchogenic cyst presenting as worsening dysphagia in a young male, which is very uncommon and misleading presentation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 22-year-old male presented with 2-month history of difficulty swallowing solid food. He felt as food being stuck in the mid-chest region. He could drink liquids without any problem. He denied any history of shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or reflux symptoms. He also complained of a runny nose and productive cough of 5 days duration. He denied alcohol intake, smoking or recreational drug abuse. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, his vital signs showed the temperature of 37.2 °C, pulse 88/min, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, respiration rate 16/min and SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 98% on room air. His head to toe physical examination was normal. A chest X-ray was obtained for his upper respiratory symptoms which revealed clear lungs field but soft tissue prominence medially in the right hilar region . CT scan of chest with contrast showed a subcarinal cystic lesion compressing the adjacent portion of the esophagus and left atrium . After discussing the diagnosis of bronchogenic cyst, the patient was given the option of surgical excision of the cyst. The patient decided to undergo cyst removal and the cyst was excised surgically through a right thoracotomy. Histology evaluation showed cyst wall lined with respiratory epithelium consistent with a bronchogenic cyst . No dysplastic or malignant cells were visualized. Following surgery, his dysphagia resolved.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Bronchogenic cysts account for 6-15% of primary mediastinal masses and comprise up to 40-50% of all congenital mediastinal cysts . Bronchogenic cysts are usually detected incidentally on chest radiographs. Patients typically present during the second decade of life with a recurrent cough, dyspnea or wheeze . Our patient had an unusual initial presentation of dysphagia which is very uncommon and makes it interesting as it can initially pursue evaluation for gastrointestinal pathology and cause further delay in reaching a diagnosis. The similar presentation has been described by Kapoor et al, Manish et al and Chih-Hao Chen et al . In all of these cases, gastrointestinal evaluation was initially pursued with barium swallow and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n\n【6】Bronchogenic cysts appear on chest radiograph as round, water-density masses. CT typically shows sharply marginated cystic mass of soft tissue or water attenuation. On histologic examination, the cyst is lined by respiratory epithelium with occasional foci of squamous metaplasia and the wall resembles that of larger airways and contains smooth muscle, glands, and cartilage. The presence of cartilage plates is the most reliable diagnostic criterion . Complications include infection, compression of adjacent structures, intracystic hemorrhage, rupture, bronchial fistula, pneumothorax and rarely malignant transformation . Even asymptomatic bronchogenic cysts are recommended to be removed surgically unless refused by the patient or a close follow-up is possible. This is to prevent the development of complications later since around 40 and 70% of cases presents with clinical manifestations in a relatively short time . The management of a bronchogenic cyst consists of surgical excision by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or thoracotomy .\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】Our case report highlights unusual presentation of the bronchogenic cyst as dysphagia which can be misleading and may cause a delay in reaching the diagnosis.

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts have quite similar histopathology characteristics in that they both keratinize epithelium with fluid filled lumens but differ in the fact that only dermoid cysts have dermal structures such as sebaceous gland, hair structures, etc. Teratoid cysts are varied, however, from the type of epithelium simple squamous to ciliated respiratory epithelium .\n\n【4】We present a rare case of epidermoid cyst presenting in the floor of the mouth.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 17-year-old female presented to oral medicine clinic following referral by GP with regard to swelling right submandibular region.\n\n【7】She advised she was not feeling fatigued, malaise or pyrexia. History of presenting swelling was first noticed in the past year but seemed to have grown slowly since. She felt the swelling intraorally  and it was generally soft but tender to palpation and sometimes felt hard on swallowing. She denied any problems with speech, swallowing or airway when lying supine.\n\n【8】She was medically fit and well with co-codamol to manage to stress-related migraines. She never smoked and currently studied for A levels.\n\n【9】On examination, the swelling was visible extraorally  with no cervical lymphadenopathy. Intraorally right side floor of the mouth appeared larger than left, which was soft on bi-manual palpation. Saliva was readily expressed from Wharton’s ducts. Linea Alba was recorded on right buccal mucosa.\n\n【10】Mandibular standard occlusal failed to show any radiopacity, so a plan of clinical photos and ultrasound was arranged. The ultrasound  revealed an oval shaped lesion measuring 4.1 × 3.3 cm separate from the mylohyoid muscle with echogenic material, no vascularity within, suggestive of dermoid/epidermoid cyst. An MRI  was indicated at this point to characterize the lesion, which reported a 2.3 × 3.7 × 4.1 cyst on right sublingual region appearing to arise from the right sublingual gland.\n\n【11】The conflicting reports of the ultrasound and MRI coupled with reported increase in size of the swelling according to the patient led to her case being referred to a salivary gland multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. A working diagnosis of a “plunging ranula” was concluded due to very high T2 signal indicating a high fluid content with proposed treatment of excision of lesion with right sublingual gland.\n\n【12】The patient along with family presented these findings and the patient subsequently underwent an excision of lesion with right sublingual gland via an intraoral approach under GA.\n\n【13】The patient made a full uneventful recovery .The pathology revealed normal morphology of right sublingual gland and the lesion as “fibrous cyst wall and a cyst lining composed of orthokeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium which has a corrugated surface appearance and keratin debris within the lumen”, i.e. epidermoid cyst.\n\n【14】On postoperative follow-up, the intraoral area was observed to have healed quite nicely and patient reported no paraesthesia with good salivary gland function with no other symptoms.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Dermoid cysts are rare, slow-growing, benign, developmental cysts and only 6.5% are in the floor of mouth .\n\n【17】While this was not the case in our patient, dermoid cysts may enlarge and interfere with deglutition and speech, or can pose a critical risk to the airway especially if there is an upward displacement of the tongue and therefore require immediate surgical intervention.\n\n【18】Depending on the position of development, i.e. above or below the mylohyoid muscle, sublingual or submandibular swelling can be caused. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice and recurrence is rare. An intraoral approach for the treatment of large lesions presenting above the mylohyoid muscle can provide good cosmetic and functional results.\n\n【19】However, adjunct diagnostic imaging aids such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT of head with contrast area are valuable tools for estimating tumor margins and lesion composition, and assessing infiltration in surrounding tissues.\n\n【20】MDT meeting provides helpful platform with surgical colleagues, radiologists and other departments to help form a working diagnosis. This mechanism should be utilized as it can also guide the surgical approach for each patient.\n\n【21】While the numerous pathological conditions can affect the floor of the mouth, the differential diagnosis must include lesions of a development, inflammatory, obstructive, or neoplastic in origin; however, other common pathologies of the oral soft tissue such as lipoma, branchial cleft cysts, and thyroglossal duct cysts should be ruled out .\n\n【22】A better understanding of epidermoid cyst, especially occurring intraorally, may add to the clinical care of patient with this rare disorder as it is not encountered often in practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It has also been shown to have broad efficacy in the treatment of bipolar disorder and manic episodes . In addition to the commonly known adverse effects of this drug, including high blood sugar and/or weight gain, a few reports have indicated hematological toxicity as an adverse effect . However, only one case report of eosinophilia has been published to date . We report a case of eosinophilia possibly associated with olanzapine treatment for a recurrent manic episode.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient, a 65-year-old woman, was admitted for dyspnea and fever and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She was treated with antibiotics and a few days later, her symptoms improved. During the treatment, we were consulted for her decreased need to sleep, talkativeness, euphoric mood, excessive inquisitiveness, and hyperactivity. Her husband reported that she had been diagnosed with cyclothymic personality and developed hypomanic episode on occasion, although she had never been treated for those episodes. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and olanzapine treatment, 10 mg/day, was started.\n\n【4】Before the beginning of olanzapine treatment, her white blood cell (WBC) count and eosinophil count were 5,120/L and 548/L, respectively, making eosinophils 10.7% of the total WBC count. Four days after the induction of treatment, her WBC count had increased to 7,670/L, of which 2,000/L, or 26.0% of the total WBC count, was eosinophils. At this point, drugs possibly associated with eosinophilia such as antibiotics and NSAIDs were terminated and a parasitic infection and other causes of eosinophilia were excluded. Olanzapine treatment was discontinued in consultation with the internal medicine specialist. Two weeks after olanzapine cessation, the eosinophil counts had decreased to 12.0%. In addition, the lymphocyte count had transiently decreased to 15% of the total WBC count, and had increased to the normal range as eosinophil counts declined.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Blood eosinophilia, which is the presence of > 500/L of eosinophils, signifies either a cytokine-mediated reactive phenomenon (secondary) or an integral phenotype of an underlying hematological neoplasm (primary) . Secondary eosinophilia is usually associated with parasitosis and allergic conditions including drug allergy . Antibiotics or NSAIDs are often identified as a causative agent, and with regard to atypical antipsychotics, it is well established that clozapine can cause eosinophilia, which is often associated with organ-specific inflammatory processes . One of the most distinctive findings of the present case is that the patient developed eosinophilia without leukocytosis. Eosinophilia is typically accompanied by leukocytosis and in the case reported by Mathias et al , the total WBC count increased up to 14.9 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, half of which were eosinophils. Eosinophilia appears to be asymptomatic in general, yet eosinophil counts > 2,000/L can cause organ toxicity . Although it is not known exactly why the total WBC count did not increase in our case, we should look for important diagnostic clues for allergic reactions to medications, including eosinophilia, by measuring differential leukocyte counts. In conclusion, olanzapine is a potent agent for various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and manic disorder; however, impaired glucose tolerance and/or weight gain are common adverse effects, and hematological complications should be taken into consideration as a possible adverse reaction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Paraduodenal hernia is the most common form of congenital internal hernia and constitutes a protrusion of bowel into the retroperitoneal space through peritoneal defects near the third and fourth portion of the duodenum. It may lead to intestinal obstruction or is typically detected incidentally at autopsy or laparotomy. They are divided into distinct subgroups based on the localization: the paraduodenal area is the most common type with an overall incidence of 53%, followed by pericecal (13%), foramen of Winslow and transmesenteric (8%), intersigmoid, supravesical and pelvic (6%), and transomental (1-4%) localizations . There are two types of congenital paraduodenal hernia: left-sided, which is more common (75%), and right-sided, which is very rare (25%) . There is a sex predilection with a male to female ratio of 3:1 . The reported lifetime risk of obstruction and bowel strangulation is around 50% with a mortality of 20% and higher . In this paper, we discuss about one case of left paraduodenal hernia treated successfully.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 18-year-old man was admitted to emergency service with the complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In history, he did not have any abdominal operation and he was admitted to emergency service with same complaints 1 year ago. On admission, only abdominal tenderness was detected in physical examination. Hematological and biochemical parameters were normal. The signs of intestinal obstruction were revealed in conventional abdominal graphs . The dilatation of all intestine segments  and minimal free fluid in pelvic area were revealed in abdominal CT. In operation, herniation of the jejunal segments was detected in pouch at left side of the fourth portion of the duodenum . Retracted to the abdomen of jejunal segments from pouch, detorsion and pouch was closed by non-absorbable sutures. The patient had active bowel sounds on postoperative day 2 and resumed oral intake on day 3. He was discharged on day 4 and has been well since.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Paraduodenal hernia was first described by Treitz in 1857 . The pathophysiology is not entirely clear. One theory suggests mechanical forces of undulating intra-abdominal pressure to lead to herniation in places where the peritoneum is yet incompletely fused. Andrews first described the currently accepted mechanism of formation as a type of malrotation . During the period between the fifth and 11th weeks of gestation, there is a midgut rotation and the fusion of mesentery with the posterior abdominal structures from the ligament of Treitz to the right iliac fossa . The space into which the bowel herniates is called Landzert’s fossa, and is found behind the fourth part of the duodenum. At autopsy Landzert’s fossa has been found to be present in approximately 2% of the population .\n\n【6】Paraduodenal hernias usually present with symptoms of acute small bowel obstruction such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension. Sometimes, clustering of dilated loops of small bowel may be palpable. Barium studies, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to diagnose internal hernias; the yield is highest when the patient is imaged during asymptomatic episode .\n\n【7】Once a left paraduodenal hernia is identified, operative treatment is necessary, as patients with an LPDH have a 50% lifetime risk of developing small bowel obstruction with a 20-50% mortality rate for acute presentations . Surgical intervention included reduction of the herniated small bowel loops and closure of the hernia orifice with non-absorbable sutures or a mesh . In our case, after reduction of the herniated small bowel loops, hernia orifice has closed with non-absorbable sutures.\n\n【8】In conclusion, diagnosis of this rare clinical entity is very difficult before the operation. If diagnosis is delayed, the course of this disease may be mortal due to perforation. This rare complication could be considered in young patients who have recurrent clinical symptoms of intestinal obstruction and have not any abdominal operation history. Timely surgical intervention effectively relieves the patient’s complaints and prevents further complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "233c0c32-dba4-4783-bca0-b44b7d8252b6", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Intrasellar cavernous hemangiomas (CH) are extremely rare; to our knowledge, there are only a few cases reported in the literature . CHs account for 5-13% of the intracranial vascular malformations. Although they can occur in all parts of the nervous system, most often these lesions occur in the cerebral hemispheres and typically present with seizures and bleeding . CH is a rare vascular lesion of the sellar region. The radiological and neuroophthamological features are similar to a pituitary adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of an intrasellar CH were reported in only two cases and can mimic pituitary adenoma .\n\n【2】In this article, we present case report of a patient, who was first evaluated as pituitary macroadenoma preoperatively but retrospectively was noticed to be a case of CH which has distinctive features from other lesions of sella.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 32-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital for blurred vision continuing nearly for one month. All the biochemical and endocrinological tests were in normal ranges. No pathological finding was observed in vision field and neurological examination.\n\n【5】In the MRI analysis, a solid lesion with 22 mm × 18 mm × 22 mm dimensions was expanding sella, showing extension to suprasellar cistern, compressing optic chiasma and hypointense in T1WI , markedly hyperintense in T2WI  and markedly contrast enhanced . It was evaluated as non-functioning hypophysis macroadenoma. Trans-sphenoidal subtotal mass resection was performed and there were no complications during the operation. In the postoperative period, transient Diabetes Insipidus (DI) had occurred. The histopathological diagnosis was CH. It was remarkable that retrospectively the lesion was markedly hyperintense in T2WI and contained areas of signal void indicating presence of vascular structure . Although dynamic study was not performed, during the hypophysis and cranial MRI analysis, more than one contrast-enhanced series were taken sequentially. It was remarkable that in the first series the lesion was peripheral  and in the following series completely marked contrast-enhanced .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】CH is more a hamartoma or vascular malformation rather than a neoplasia . Although CH is very rare, CH of the cavernous sinus present like tumors and there can be a medial extension into the sella . This growth pattern is differentiated from intrasellar CH with cavernous sinus extension by measuring the major portion of the tumor mass. In our case, hemangioma was located in the sella and there was no cavernous sinus extension.\n\n【8】Intrasellar CH’s may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the literature, besides asymptomatic cases one of which was found during autopsy  and another found incidentally, cranial nerve palsies caused by cavernous sinus extension  or secondary vision problems due to optic chiasm compression  were reported.\n\n【9】Except from the case reported by Nagai et al , which was not diagnosed histopathologically and was thought as intrasellar CH with only clinical and MRI findings, there are only two studies describing MRI findings of intrasellar CH. Cobbs et al  presented a case of intrasellar CH which was operated under the diagnosis of adenoma and had complications of subaracnoidal hemorrhage and rhinorrhea. In this report, T2 signal characteristics in MRI findings were not mentioned and they declared development of moderate homogeneous enhancement in post-contrast T1WI. Likewise, in the intrasellar CH case, which also had cavernous sinus extension reported by Chuang et al , T2 signal characteristics were mentioned and hypointense to grey matter on T1WI and homogenous enhancement after contrast administration were reported. Although T2 WI characteristics were mentioned in parasellar CHs in the literature, no definition of T2 signal characteristics of intrasellar CH was made before our case. The reason for this is thought to be the exclusion of T2 WI in routine hypophysis MRI.\n\n【10】One case of cavernous sinus CH was reported as marked T2 with hyperintensity with some signal void structures . In our case, marked hyperintensity in T2WI and signal void structures consistent with vascular origin were noticeable.\n\n【11】In the differential diagnosis of mass lesions in sellar region, dynamic studies may give extra information . This lesion initially is peripherally and then progressively totally homogeneous contrast enhanced. This contrast pattern is similar to other extra-cranial CH cases such as liver CHs . In the literature, it was reported that while in a cavernous sinus CH, in coronal image, patchy peripheral contrast enhancement was observed, in axial image homogeneous contrast was enhanced .\n\n【12】In our case, similar MRI findings were noticeable. In first contrast administration series, the lesion was peripherally contrast enhanced while in continuing series it was marked homogeneously contrast enhanced.\n\n【13】Many neoplasms, such as meningioma, optic glioma, craniopharyngioma, germinoma, and CH develop in the sellar and parasellar regions, while large pituitary adenomas with para or supra-sellar extension are often difficult to differentiate from other tumors.\n\n【14】As the sellar CHs are dura based, complete resection may cause severe hemorrhage. For this reason, if intrasellar CH is suspected, only partial resection should be performed. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also be used in treatment .\n\n【15】In the differential diagnosis of mass lesions in the sellar region, although seen rarely, CHs should be taken into consideration because of high complication risks both during and after operation. T2WI signal characteristics of these kinds of lesions may be instructive. Marked hyperintensity in T2WI and presence of signal void areas may suggest CH. The dynamic studies of contrast administration may contribute in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions located in these regions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5bed4893-9cba-4e1d-b3bc-8ef6acbdb5d0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Many organs can be associated with inguinal hernias, but bladder hernia is a very uncommon condition with a frequency between 1% and 4% of all inguinal hernias . Patients typically present clinically with scrotal swelling, obstructive urinary tract symptoms and the classic complaint of inability to completely empty the bladder .\n\n【2】Patients usually present with scrotal and inguinal swelling, and occasionally with the classic complaint of double voiding. Most are small hernias that are not of major clinical significance. On the other hand, scrotal bladder hernias are exceptional diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for both the urologists and general surgeons .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 51-year-old morbidly obese male patient presented with chronic urinary retention and scrotal swelling, and needed to compress his scrotum to urinate. He is admitted to urology clinic with the complaint of becoming suddenly unable to void within 3 days, and his previous history is not significant. He had been involved in a traffic accident 15 years ago, but claimed no history of previous surgery. Physical examination revealed an obese man (weight, 120 kg; height, 174 cm). A large left hemiscrotum was suggestive of an inguinal hernia, and the prostate gland was normal sized, benign and nontender. The left hemiscrotum was enlarged and compressible without a solid mass. The left testicle, cord structures and external inguinal ring were not palpable. Computed tomography imaging of the pelvis demonstrated a large left inguinal sliding hernia of only the urinary bladder, and a cystogram confirmed the diagnosis of left scrotal cystocele, in addition to the bladder calculus . Preceding herniorrhaphy, he underwent cystourethroscopy which did not reveal any urethral or bladder neck stricture, and showed that the ureteral orifices are within normal location. Additionally, no hydroureteronephrosis was seen on CT imaging, therefore no ureteral stent was inserted.\n\n【5】After preoperative left ureteral stent placement, the patient underwent a left groin exploration. It was found that there was a large sliding indirect inguinal hernia. When the hernia sac was opened, an incarcerated omentum together with entire left half of the bladder was found to be encompassed in the sac. Incarcerated omentum was excised, and the rest was reduced into the peritoneal cavity. After ligating and dividing attachments between the bladder and hernia sac, the bladder was reduced manually out of the scrotum, and a small insignificant bladder diverticulum was revealed. Bladder was replaced into the retroperitoneal space of Retzius, and a standard Lichtenstein herniorraphy was performed. Postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative second day.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Herniation of urinary bladder is a relatively uncommon but not rare condition. However, isolated scrotal cystocele is very rare. It is important to recognize this condition in any men older than 50 years with inguinal hernia, as unknowingly, bladder injury during herniorrhaphy can lead to infection, sepsis or even death .\n\n【8】Bladder outlet obstruction, obesity and weakened pelvic musculature are predisposing factors . Pathophysiological causes include decreasing bladder tonus or increasing laxity of the surrounding tissue in combination with bladder outlet obstruction. Increased abdominal pressure due to obesity is an important factor .\n\n【9】Majority of bladder hernias are extraperitoneal, more rarely paraperitoneal, and only exceptionally intraperitoneal. In view of the size of the hernia and distension of the bladder wall in the scrotum, the condition is described as a hernia of a bladder diverticulum or scrotal cystocele, although scrotal hernias of large vesical diverticuli have also been described . Bladder hernias are usually asymptomatic, larger hernias that can cause voiding complaints related to bladder outlet obstruction and swelling of one side of the scrotum before micturation. Patients frequently describe the need to manually compress the scrotum to empty the bladder. Hematuria, pain, renal failure, incarceration and perforation can occur .\n\n【10】Urinary bladder hernias are most commonly diagnosed intraoperatively during the hernia sac dissection or after inadvertent cystotomy. CT scan is also described as an important aid in diagnosing and outlining the anatomy of the affected area. MRI can also identify such lesions during studies of the abdomen and pelvis performed for unrelated purposes, or MRI can be used to clarify the findings seen on urography or sonography. The high resolution provided by MRI can allow analysis of the relationship of the hernia to the vascular landmarks and peritoneal structures, thus classifying the lesion as direct or indirect according to its position in relation .\n\n【11】There are several treatment options, such as repositioning the protruded part of the bladder into the pelvis, or excising the affected part of the bladder. A surgical approach through an inguinal incision for bladder hernioraphy permits adequate access to the bladder and hernia sac. If a bladder hernia is incidentally found during hernioraphy, recommendations include either reduction of the bladder back to its anatomic location within Retzius’ space or selective resection of the herniated bladder component, followed by standard inguinal hernia repair with or without mesh .\n\n【12】Our case is different from the literature simply as isolated bladder in the presence of the hernia sac.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Bladder herniation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any inguinal, scrotal, or low abdominal wall hernia. Sliding inguinal hernias involving the urinary bladder often present with obstructive voiding symptoms and a scrotal mass. Large scrotal cystoceles are uncommon and warrant prompt surgical correction. Radiographic imaging aids the surgeon in fully defining the hernia contents and amount of bladder involvement prior to operative intervention. A tension-free herniorraphy should be performed for the correction of the underlying anatomical defect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b93984db-60df-4ccf-8f3c-5e19e6e2ea59", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Osimertinib is a third-generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI). In the FLAURA trial, osimertinib improved progression-free survival in previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared with erlotinib and gefitinib. Therefore, osimertinib has become a standard drug as the first-line treatment for these patients. Owing to highly selective inhibition of mutated EGFR and lower activity against wild-type EGFR , less than 5% of patients develop significant pulmonary toxicity . Digestive and dermatological symptoms are representative as adverse effects of osimertinib. On the other hand, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is recognized as an infrequent, but serious adverse effect associated with osimertinib.\n\n【2】Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar erythrocytes originating from the alveolar capillaries . Various diseases cause DAH. As the causes of DAH, the following two etiologies are well known: 1) pulmonary capillaritis, i.e. anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated granulomatous vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis and Goodpasture syndrome; and 2) various drugs, such as propyluracil, anticoagulants and amiodarone . The precise prevalence of each cause remains unknown. EGFR-TKI is a rare drug that causes DAH. As pulmonary adverse effects of osimertinib, acute pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and fleeting asymptomatic infiltrates on imaging have been reported .\n\n【3】We herein report a case of DAH, which occurred during osimertinib for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and resolved after withdrawal of osimertinib and steroid treatment.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 70-year-old man visited another hospital because of a persistent cough for 2 months. The right pleural effusion was found on a chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a mass of 4 cm in diameter in the right upper lobe and bilateral multiple lung nodules . He was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (cT2aN0M1a, c-stageIVA) with EGFR exon 19 deletion by transbronchial biopsy. Endoscopic bronchial occlusion with endobronchial Watanabe spigot (EWS), silicone-made bronchial fillers, was performed twice for management of intractable iatrogenic pneumothorax after bronchoscopy. Then he started osimertinib (80 mg/day). He also had prostatic hypertrophy and had been treated with tamsulosin. He had no allergy, socially drank and was an ex-smoker with a history of 15 pack-years of cigarette smoking. At the start of osimertinib, his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) was 0. He was prescribed with dextromethorphan and tamsulosin at that time, but took neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulation agent. Two months after the initiation of osimertinib, both primary tumor in the right upper lobe and metastatic lesions in the bilateral lungs reduced, and no ground-grass opacity was detected .\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】Four months after osimertinib initiation, he required an emergency admission to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. His consciousness at the arrival to our emergency room (ER) was clear, and his vital signs revealed a temperature of 35.8 °C, a blood pressure of 150/98 mm Hg, a pulse of 113 beats/min, a percutaneous oxygen saturation of 78% under bag valve mask ventilation, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min. His breath sounds were decreased, and coarse crackles were audible bilaterally. His limbs were cold with livedo reticularis and cyanosis. There was no jugular venous distention. In the peripheral venous blood sampling, the leukocyte count was 11,500/µL, C-reactive protein level was 9.49 mg/dL, platelet count was 30.7 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL. No abnormality of coagulation was revealed, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio was 1.27 and activated partial thromboplastin time was 33.9 s. The arterial blood gas analysis (under bag valve mask of oxygen flow of 15 L/min) showed lactic acidosis, pH was 7.165 and lactate was 11.8 mmol/L. The urine test was normal, except for hematuria due to prostatic hypertrophy. Sputum, urine and blood bacterial cultures were all negative. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with normal range of QTc time (472 ms). Chest radiographs at ER visit showed unilateral diffuse ground-grass opacities dominantly in the left lung field . Chest CT revealed diffuse ground-grass opacities and consolidation in the left upper and lower lobe, dominantly upper lobe . At that time, we suspected drug-induced interstitial pneumonia or infectious disease. Neither bleeding nor inflammation was not visually observed in his bronchial tracts by bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the left B5 (fluid recovery rate 65%) became serially and increasingly hemorrhagic . The total cell count in the BALF was 3.3 × 10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL, and differential cell count showed 54.5% of lymphocytes, 43.5% of neutrophils, 1.5% of macrophage, 0.5% of eosinophils and 5.13 of cluster of differentiation (CD)4/CD8 ratio. In the BALF, bacterial cultures were negative and no malignant cell was detected. Thereafter, proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA, myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies were all negative.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with osimertinib-induced DAH.\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】We discontinued osimertinib, and then started steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone at 1,000 mg/day for 3 consecutive days, followed by steroid maintenance therapy with prednisolone (1.25 mg/kg/day). The consolidation regressed after the steroid pulse therapy. The second BALF from the left B5 (fluid recovery rate 41%) on the hospital day 9 was not bloody . The total cell count in the second BALF was 1.3 × 10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL, and differential cell count showed 14.5% of lymphocytes, 2.5% of neutrophils, 83.0% of macrophage, 0% of eosinophils, and 1.73 of CD4/CD8 ratio. His pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> (PF) ratio improved significantly from 77.6 on the hospital day 1 to 182 on the hospital day 11. Thus, he was extubated on the hospital day 11 . Prednisolone and O <sub>2 </sub> inhalation were gradually tapered.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】He was discharged home on the hospital day 91. Considering the risk of recurrence of DAH and decreased ECOG-PS from 0 to 3, he was followed without further aggressive chemotherapy. Three months after the discharge, he died of lung cancer progression.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】This was a rare case of osimertinib-induced DAH. To our knowledge, there were only two osimertinib-induced and four other EGFR-TKI-induced DAH cases  . We could not find a report of DAH induced by other EGFR-TKIs; afatinib and dacomitinib, and anti-EGFR antibodies; cetuximab and panitumumab.\n\n【16】Although the mechanisms of drug-induced DAH remains unidentified, a direct toxicity to type II pneumocytes, tracheal epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells by cytotoxic drugs and activation of immune system cells may play a key role . In some previous literatures of TKI-induced DAH, this cytotoxic mechanism was assumed as the cause of DAH . In addition to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, EGFR-TKI also suppresses angiogenesis and promotes apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells .\n\n【17】Compared with the previous cases of EGFR-TKI-induced DAH, our case was interesting in distribution of DAH shadow, i.e. unilaterally localized consolidations. A 65-year-old US woman required intubated mechanical ventilation and then improved by steroid pulse therapy . Her CT images were similar to our case in that the diffuse consolidation did not bilaterally spread, but was localized in the left upper lobe. However, the reason why DAH happened dominantly in the unilateral lung remains uncertain.\n\n【18】In our case, not only bronchoscopy but also BAL was necessary for the detection of DAH. If we had not performed BAL at the ER visit, we might have assumed infectious pneumonia and treated him only with antibiotics. We should not hesitate to perform bronchoscopy with BAL when we encounter intractable or atypical pneumonia during EGFR-TKI treatment.\n\n【19】Our case was also interesting in the report of differential cell counts in the BALF. Differential cell counts in the BALF may be a potential and useful marker of sensitivity to steroid and prognosis in DAH. There were only two reports of differential cell counts in the BALF of EGFR-TKI-induced DAH . A 56-year-old Japanese man with 90% of lymphocytes and 10% of neutrophils in the BALF improved after high dose of methylprednisolone . Another 75-year-old Japanese woman with 20% of lymphocytes and 8% of neutrophils in the BALF recovered without steroid pulse therapy . In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), differential cell counts in the BALF were not correlated with steroid sensitivity and prognosis . Fibrosis was reported to be of unfavorable prognostic relevance in acute exacerbation of ILDs . On the other hand, when we find diffuse consolidations with increased lymphocytes (≥ 20%) in the BALF, we should consider other differential diagnoses except IPF . Cytologically increased lymphocytes in the BALF and histologically small fibrotic changes may be favorable prognostic indicators of DAH. However, bronchoscopic specimen with biopsy is difficult at a risk of hemorrhagic worsening in DAH. Thus, BALF may be clinically available and useful as a prognostic marker of DAH.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Osimertinib causes not only interstitial pneumonia but also alveolar hemorrhage. The consolidations may spread not bilaterally, but be localized unilaterally. We have to keep this rare adverse event in mind, and consider immediate withdrawal of osimertinib and treatment with steroid. Increased lymphocytes in the BALF may be a potential indicator of sensitivity to steroid and favorable prognosis in DAH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In 1948, Stewart and Treves first described the development of angiosarcoma in women following radical mastectomy for breast cancer complicated by edema . STS is typically found in an ipsilateral upper extremity post radical mastectomy complicated by lymphedema. In this case report, our patient who had STS in the right lower extremity in the presence of obesity-associated lymphedema is atypical. The average life expectancy of cutaneous angiosarcoma is 2.5 years with most patients dying within the first 2 years from metastatic disease . Untreated patients, on average, live 5 - 8 months . These factors make early detection of STS paramount as the treatment before metastasis via wide excision tissue removal is the best option in improving outcomes.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】The patient was a 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of lymphedema of the right lower extremity for the past 2 years and diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity status post right above knee amputation. The patient also had surgical re-vision of the right knee stump due to recurrent disease. Ultimately there was metastasis to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands status post radiation and chemotherapy. Other history included recent right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis treated with rivaroxaban, recent resolution of a large right-sided pneumothorax, morbid obesity for her entire recorded adult life with body mass index (BMI) of 41.6, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and no other surgical history. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from an inpatient rehabilitation facility for worsening shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and respiratory distress. A review of systems was unable to be obtained due to the patient’s mental status.\n\n【5】Of note, the patient had an extensive history of radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity and was being followed by a vascular surgeon for lymphedema for the last 10 years. She could not tolerate paclitaxel or doxorubicin due to acute hypersensitivity reaction. She was initiated on monotherapy treatment with gemcitabine approximately 4 months before the presentation and completed six rounds of treatment. The patient remained on monthly denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, for osseous metastasis. The histomorphologic features and immunohistochemistry profile of the right anterior leg soft tissue were consistent with the diagnosis of angiosarcoma with a high Ki-67 mitotic index (45%) and with cells positive for CD34, CD31, and factor VIII (pictures not shown). The positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed metastatic disease to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands .\n\n【6】On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 86/53 mm Hg, a pulse of 132 beats/min, temperature of 36.6 °C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98% on bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) with FiO <sub>2 </sub> of 60%, and BMI of 41.6. On the physical exam, she was non-alert and lethargic. Rhonchi were auscultated over the lung fields bilaterally. There was minimal +1 left lower limb edema in contrast to the worse 3+ edema of the right lower stump with serous discharge from the surgical incision consistent with wound dehiscence. There were no signs of purulence, erythema, or cellulitis associated with the wound. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】The complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 16.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and low hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL . Chest X-ray showed bilateral effusions, for which she underwent thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis showing groups of malignant cells with positive CD34 and partial CD31 and epithelial membrane antigen positivity supporting the diagnosis of metastatic angiosarcoma .\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath, primarily consistent with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of underlying metastatic pulmonary disease and malignant pleural effusion. She was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was subsequently given cardizem bolus and infusion and was intubated due to persistent respiratory distress. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. She continued to require ventilation support for oxygenation.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】The hematology-oncology service was consulted, and the patient was found to have significant progressive decompensation of underlying metastatic pulmonary disease from angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity, likely causing respiratory failure and cardiac instability. She was not a candidate for any additional therapy options for the underlying metastatic disease. The prognosis and goals of care were discussed with the patient’s family and the decision was made to transition to hospice care. The patient was made comfortable and ultimately passed away in the ICU.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Classically, STS presents after radical mastectomy in the upper extremities but can present in other areas like the lower extremities about 10% of the time . The lesions are small and typically purple at onset and then develop into a nodule. Due to these lesions’ innocuous appearance, the diagnosis and treatment can be delayed . Approximately 90% of angiosarcomas associated with lymphedema occur following mastectomy. Lymphedema is a chronic, incurable condition. It is classified as primary lymphedema resulting from anomalous development of the lymphatic system or secondary lymphedema resulting from injury to the lymphatic vasculature . Distant metastasis is seen in 27-42% of patients with angiosarcoma. Metastasis occurs hematogenously, most commonly to the liver, bones, soft tissues, and lymph nodes . STS development in patients following radical mastectomy that survived at least 5 years is 0.07-0.45%. The mechanism to which STS occurs is unknown, but it is theorized that angiogenesis in edematous regions could lead to neoplasm as collateral circulation becomes established . Another theory is that chronic edema leads to localized immunodeficiency, permitting oncogenesis .\n\n【15】The incidence of chronic edema associated with obesity, called massive localized lymphedema, as seen in this patient, is trending upward with the increase in obesity in westernized societies . This being said, there is a logical concern for a rise in STS incidence in these populations. Obesity-associated lymphedema in the lower extremities typically occurs once a patient’s BMI reaches 50 . Obesity-associated lymphedema results from the proliferation and hypertrophy of adipocytes. This hypertrophy causes lymphatic fibrosis and stasis, allowing for the accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes . Macrophages, in particular, are known to be involved in lymphangiogenesis, producing lymphangiogenic cytokines and differentiating into lymphatic endothelial cells . These macrophages encircle dead adipocytes in crown-like inflammatory foci, which release inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are associated with increased risk for, and more aggressive behavior of, various malignancies in obese patients .\n\n【16】The overall incidence of STS has decreased with the introduction of breast-conserving therapy that removes less of the lymphatic drainage structure than radical mastectomy. Due to its rarity, the exact decrease in incidence is difficult to approximate, but since the introduction of breast-conserving therapy, the incidence of chronic lymphedema after breast cancer treatment has decreased from 40% to 4% .\n\n【17】Before starting treatment, a biopsy is required for the diagnosis of STS. On histology, angiosarcoma of STS shows a proliferation of anastomotic vascular channels that dissect collagen within the dermis. The malignant endothelial cells are commonly hyperchromatic, pleomorphic with macronuclei, and show signs of frequent mitosis. Another common feature is the presence of “hobnailing”, where the endothelial cells project into the vessel lumen . Staining for common endothelial cell markers such as factor VIII, anti-CD31, and anti-CD34 antibodies can be useful in identifying angiosarcoma as well, with anti-CD31 being the most sensitive and specific of the three .\n\n【18】After biopsy and identification, the first-line treatment is wide tissue excision and removal of the mass. Standard adjuvant therapy is local radiation of the excision site or medical management with chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drugs used as the standard of care are methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, or a combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D . There is no significant difference in survival between chemotherapy and radiation . Following treatment, recurrence and metastasis are common. On initial presentation, it is thought that metastatic disease is present 16-44% of the time, and the 5-year average survival is 40% . Therefore, it is crucial to have a low biopsy threshold in patients with a newly developed skin lesion in a limb with chronic lymphedema due to the poor prognosis of STS and the benefits of early detection and treatment.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】STS is a rare syndrome in which angiosarcoma develops on the skin in the presence of long-standing lymphedema. Although uncommon, the danger angiosarcoma poses is significant and warrants knowledge of the disease and screening in patients with chronic edema. In addition, early detection should be seen as the best way to optimize outcomes for these patients as the prognosis for metastatic angiosarcoma is poor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Compared to the stomach which is the most frequent site of occurrence in the GI tract, primary colonic MALT lymphoma (MALToma) is rare and shares no typical association with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection . MALToma of the colon can present with a broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms  and different endoscopic manifestations . As a result of its rarity, the etiopathogenesis of this condition along with treatment guidelines are not yet established . We present an uncommon case of a primary MALToma of the colon, discovered during a colonoscopy and successfully resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) without the use of adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】Our case report describes a 75-year-old female with a history of bowel habit changes who was referred to the Endoscopic Department of our hospital to undergo a colonoscopy. The patient presented numerous times to her primary care physician in the past year due to repeated episodes of abnormal loose and watery stools, lasting several weeks. These episodes resolved spontaneously, followed by periods where the patient described normal bowel habits. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, right-sided nephrectomy due to a benign kidney tumor, and a lateral intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) localized in the head of the pancreas. She has no history of excessive alcohol use or smoking. Physical examination revealed no signs of systemic illness, and laboratory test results were unremarkable.\n\n【5】A follow-up computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis for her IPMN demonstrated a round, well-demarcated lesion in the ascending colon and no other signs of enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity or hepatosplenomegaly. Considering the patient’s previous history of sudden changes in her bowel habits and this radiological finding, we performed a colonoscopy, which revealed an approximately 2 cm broad-based polypoid lesion in the ascending colon .\n\n【6】Histologic analysis of the biopsy specimens disclosed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the colonic mucosa and submucosa , which immunohistochemically stained positive for B-lymphocyte markers CD20 and Bcl-2 , and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, and cyclin D1. Immunostaining of the light chains revealed a dominance in the expression of the lambda chains with a 1/10 kappa to lambda chain ratio. Furthermore, the Ki-67 proliferation index was 36%. These findings were compatible with non-Hodgkin B-cell marginal zone lymphoma.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with multiple biopsies was normal and revealed no sign of HP infection. Additional imaging with CT of the neck and chest revealed a borderline enlarged submental lymph node. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, and the results showed no signs of lymphocytic infiltration. All these findings were sufficient to set the diagnosis of primary extranodal MALToma of the colon. The patient was classified as stage IE, according to the Lugano lymphoma staging classification.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】After a multidisciplinary team meeting, the therapeutic decision was to perform a polypectomy with an ESD procedure without additional treatment with rituximab or adjuvant chemotherapy. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the dissected polypoid lesion reconfirmed the diagnosis.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】The patient’s condition remains stable, and she is undergoing follow-up care through the Hematology Section of our hospital. A control colonoscopy has been scheduled for her in the coming months.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】MALToma is a widely-known malignancy that was first introduced by Isaacson et al in 1983  and is an uncommon type of NHL that occurs in extranodal sites, such as the GI tract. Other extranodal sites vary and can involve the lungs, the salivary glands, the ocular adnexa, the breast, the skin, and the soft tissue . In the majority, these sites do not comprise native lymphoid tissue, however numerous specific chronic immune responses due to infectious and other stimulus agents result in lymphoid transformation and stepwise lymphoid growth. Even though MALToma emerges in many different anatomical sites, the histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics are the same. The most predominant site of appearance is the stomach and is thoroughly known to be strongly associated with HP infection . Primary colonic MALToma is a rare type of B-cell NHL, representing only 2.5% of all MALTomas  and less than 0.6% of all colorectal malignancies . It manifests with the highest frequency between the fifth and the seventh decade of life ; and recent reviews demonstrate a female predominance with a 2:1 ratio in comparison to the males . Treatment approaches are currently under debate and include a variety of immunosuppressive and surgical strategies or even a combination of them.\n\n【15】The etiopathogenesis of colonic MALToma is not yet clarified, possibly due to its rarity. However, some proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include not only the well-known immune cross-reactivity induced by chronic infections (HP, hepatitis C virus) but also the chronic inflammatory response of the mucosa driven by autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases .\n\n【16】Histology stands as the gold standard to set the diagnosis of colon MALToma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms revised in 2017, the diagnosis is established and estimated by the origin of the cellular proliferation along with certain morphological and immunohistochemical criteria .\n\n【17】There is no standardized staging procedure for colorectal MALToma, but a typical screening that includes EGD, ileocolonoscopy, CT thorax and abdomen, and a bone marrow biopsy is recommended as a first approach , completed by secondary targeted imaging based on clinical evaluation .\n\n【18】Clinical aspects of MALToma of the colon differ from asymptomatic cases with incidental lymphoma findings during a routine control , to rare cases with acute intestinal obstruction . From an endoscopic perspective, the right colon and the rectum are the most typical sites of manifestation , usually presenting as a single flat, elevated, or semi-pedunculated polypoid lesion .\n\n【19】Due to its rarity, colonic MALToma has not been exhaustively studied and a standard treatment process has not yet been designed . First-line treatment is currently under debate and varies from watch-and-wait strategies to combination therapy with immunosuppression and surgery . Merely 20% of extragastric MALToma tested positive for HP and most cases that were first treated with eradication therapy received supplementary treatment to achieve clinical remission . A large number of patients with advanced disease were treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy with rituximab, or a combination of these, with the majority of the therapeutic approaches demonstrating successful results . Nowadays, for patients with low-grade localized lymphoma, many case studies describe treatment approaches with endoscopic resection. Low-invasive techniques with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or ESD have shown prosperous results with a low rate of lymphoma regression during follow-ups, either as monotherapy  or as a complementation therapy, in patients with large obstructive lesions, after a downsize treatment .\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Colonic MALT lymphoma is a rare subtype of B-cell NHL, with typical histological and immunophenotypical findings, occurring with a variety of clinical manifestations as well as endoscopic appearances. Even though there is still a debate over the therapeutic approaches, endoscopic interventions such as EMR and ESD for resectable lesions, are gaining ground in patients with localized disease compared to surgical procedures and chemotherapy or immunotherapy.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】MALT lymphoma is a rare type of colon cancer and shares no association with HP infection. Even though there are no standardized guidelines for treatment and follow-up, a wide variety of first-line treatment options, such as surgery and/or chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, appear to have good therapeutic results. In the current era of advanced endoscopy, minimally invasive techniques such as ESD, appear to achieve growing recognition as an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of colonic MALToma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "31986cb6-a7b6-41a8-97fa-62a6464bef89", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a heterogeneous group of free-living organisms that have the potential to cause pulmonary and less commonly extrapulmonary infections in humans . NTM infections exhibit a wide geographical variation worldwide . Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most reported species causing pulmonary disease globally, followed variably by Mycobacterium kansasii ( M. kansasii ), Mycobacterium xenopi ( M. xenopi ), and other NTM, largely depending on geographic location . M. xenopi is the second most pathogen of pulmonary NTM infections in Canada, southwest Europe, and UK , while M. kansasii is only behind MAC as an isolated organism of non-tuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the USA, predominately Southwest and Midwest regions of the USA . The usual infection route is inhaling airborne particles from an environmental source . NTM infections are universally not contagious .\n\n【2】The majority of NTM-PD were reported in hosts with underlying lung diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and prior mycobacterial tuberculosis . Despite immune deficiency being considered a risk factor for NTM lung infections, immunocompromised patients comprise only a small population of those with pulmonary disease, in contrast to typical mycobacterial tuberculosis . The clinical features of NTM lung disease are variable and usually mimic the symptoms of pre-existing lung diseases .\n\n【3】The diagnosis of NTM-PD is challenging, partly because of the nonspecific nature of their clinical features and radiological characteristics . The diagnosis typically requires specific microbiological criteria in the presence of pulmonary symptoms and suggestive radiological findings . The microbiological criteria entail either two positive sputum cultures, a positive culture from a bronchial wash or lavage, or a lung biopsy with histologic findings of mycobacterial infection in the presence of a positive culture .\n\n【4】Herein, the authors present a series of three elderly patients with chronic lung diseases, who were diagnosed with NTM-PD from a community-based hospital in the midwestern USA. The infections were caused by M. xenopi in two patients and MAC in the third patient. The NTM-PD masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. The current literature reporting on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological features, diagnosis, and management of NTM-PD is briefly reviewed in this communication.\n\n【5】Case Reports\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy smoking (a 55-pack-year), emphysema, and occupational asbestos exposure, presented initially to the pulmonary outpatient clinic for abnormal findings on a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan for lung cancer screening. The patient was asymptomatic, and the physical exam was only notable for a hyperinflated chest wall with decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The low-dose chest CT scan showed diffuse emphysema with large bulla/cavities most significantly in the upper lobes and bilateral small lung nodules. A follow-up CT was recommended within 3 months for close monitoring of the nodular lesions, but the patient lost to follow-up. After 2 years, the patient presented to the pulmonary clinic with exertional shortness of breath and a productive cough for several weeks. The patient’s symptoms only partially improved with courses of oral antibiotic therapy and bronchodilator inhalers. A CT scan of the chest redemonstrated a similar appearance of severe emphysema and thick-walled apical bullae with an interval progression in the number and size of left-sided pulmonary nodules . Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated only a hyper-metabolic uptake in the prostate region. He was referred to the urology service, and further workup ruled out prostate cancer. The patient’s complaints continued to progress despite regular compliance with the prescribed inhalers, and he lost significant weight over 3 months’ time.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】A repeat CT chest scan depicted an interval progression of the left lung nodular processes in the left upper lobe  without significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Other lung pathologies were fairly stable. Sputum Gram stain and culture were negative for any growth. Urine antigens for fungal pathogens were unrevealing. Serial expectorant morning sputum samples were positive for many acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and cultures grew M. xenopi , which was further identified by the direct matrix-associated laser desorption (MALDI) technique. Sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) and MAC. A diagnosis of an atypical mycobacterial infection with M. xenopi was made based on a combination of a suggestive clinical history with possible radiological findings and confirmatory microbiology.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】The patient commenced triple therapy comprising a multi-drug regimen of rifampin, ethambutol, and azithromycin after the diagnosis was made.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】The patient’s symptoms started to gradually improve with the triple therapy and a repeat CT chest revealed an interval reduction in the size of the left upper lobe lesion.\n\n【15】Case 2\n\n【16】Investigations\n\n【17】A 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for heavy smoking (a 25-pack-year), daily marijuana use, long-standing COPD with bullous emphysema, and prior unprovoked pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation, presented to the pulmonary outpatient clinic with increasing tiredness and worsening productive cough for a few months. The patient endorsed regular compliance with her medications, but she admitted to continuing active smoking. Notably, the patient has a history of cavitary and nodular lung disease under yearly surveillance. Her last PET scan 7 years prior to her index presentation was concerning for abnormal hyper-metabolic uptake in an upper right lobe cavitary lesion. Subsequently, she underwent endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) which ruled a neoplastic process but revealed a non-caseating granuloma. Extensive infectious workup at that time (i.e. AFB stains, and serial cultures of the sputum, bronchial lavage, and lung biopsy) did not yield any infectious culprit for the granulomatous pathology, particularly, mycobacterial, and fungal etiologies. The patient remained relatively asymptomatic for the interval 6-year period with fairly stable cavitary and nodular lesions appearances over the serial scans. The physical examination revealed a low body mass index (BMI) of 16.5, which was significantly reduced from the prior visit 1 year ago. The respiratory examination showed reduced breathing sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. An acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and she was commenced on an albuterol inhaler, a short course of prednisone, and oral antibiotics. However, the patient’s symptoms were not adequately controlled.\n\n【18】Diagnosis\n\n【19】A CT chest demonstrated an interval significant progression of the right upper lobe cavity lesion (3.2 × 1.7 cm)  from the prior exam (1.1 × 0.8 cm) which was nearly 1 year ago . The bilateral nodular lesions and advanced emphysematous bullous disease were relatively unchanged. A PET scan depicted no significant hyper-metabolic activity in the right upper cavitary lesion at this time. An interdisciplinary review of the serial CT images suggested a possibility of a chronic infectious process given the low metabolic activity of the lesion. Nevertheless, the possibility of lung malignancy remained a concern considering the patient’s high-risk status and the patient has been counseled about further invasive workup if needed. Sputum cultures grew M. xenopi , which was identified by the MALDI technique. Sputum PCR was negative for M. tuberculosis and MAC.\n\n【20】Treatment\n\n【21】After the diagnosis was made, triple therapy (azithromycin, rifampin, and ethambutol) was started.\n\n【22】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【23】A repeat CT chest imaging was planned after 8 weeks from initiating anti-tuberculous therapy to evaluate the clinical and radiological response.\n\n【24】Case 3\n\n【25】Investigations\n\n【26】A 74-year-old male patient with a past medical history of heavy smoking (a 60-pack-year), advanced emphysema on 3 L of oxygen at home, bronchiectasis, remote history of bladder cancer status post-surgical resection and chemotherapy, presented to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea and fatigue for 1 day. He also reported a chronic cough and intermittent sputum production. The patient was discharged from our hospital 2 days prior to his index presentation following a short-coursed admission with an acute exacerbation of COPD due to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. The patient had no increase in supplemental oxygen requirement at that admission. The patient improved with supportive management with analgesics, albuterol nebulizers, dexamethasone, and COVID-directed therapy (remdesivir). Notably, the patient had several admissions to the medical floor with acute flare-ups of COPD in the past few months. The patient is originally from Iraq and immigrated to the USA 10 years ago, but he denied any recent traveling outside the USA. Initial evaluation revealed a frail and underweight elderly patient (BMI of 16.5) with signs of acute respiratory distress. He was afebrile with sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 110 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute), and stable blood pressure. The lung examination was significant for decreased breathing sounds bilaterally and mild diffuse expiratory wheezing.\n\n【27】Diagnosis\n\n【28】Chest X-ray (CXR) showed stable reticulonodular and emphysematous changes with a volume loss in the left upper lung from scarring . CT chest demonstrated diffuse random-sized nodules with an ill-defined cavitary lesion in the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe, extending inferiorly into a more solid component along the pleura, which was seen in a previous CT chest that was performed 1 month ago . Further review of prior images revealed that the cavitary lesion was visualized 1.5 years ago on imaging performed at an outside hospital to rule out pulmonary embolism, but it has progressed in size during the index imaging. The patient was started on empirical cefepime and vancomycin, nebulizer, and dexamethasone for possible worsening bronchiectasis. An infectious workup revealed positive sputum for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but serial blood cultures remained negative. Urine antigens for histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis were also negative. Consecutive sputum cultures grew many AFB, which was identified as MAC. Sputum PCR was negative for M. tuberculosis .\n\n【29】Treatment\n\n【30】A multi-drug therapy regime of rifampicin, azithromycin, and ethambutol was started for MAC. The parenteral antibiotic therapy was transitioned to levofloxacin upon discharge to complete a 4-week course.\n\n【31】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【32】The patient continued MAC therapy with close follow-up with pulmonary and infectious disease services.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】The exact incidence of NTM-PD in the USA is not precisely known, as the disease is not mandatory reportable in most states .\n\n【35】There are four distinct clinical syndromes described with various NTM species in humans ; pulmonary disease, especially in elderly patients with chronic lung disease, is caused primarily by MAC, both globally and in the USA , followed by M. kansasii , particularly in midwestern regions of the USA . Less common species include M. xenopi , which is more prevalent in Canada, southwest Europe, and the UK . Superficial lymphadenitis, commonly cervical lymphadenitis in the pediatric population, is largely caused by MAC and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum ( M. scrofulaceum ) . Mycobacterium marinum ( M. marinum ) and Mycobacterium ulcerans ( M. ulcerans ) are the principal pathogens for skin and soft tissue infections that are acquired through direct inoculation, and they may also cause surgical site infections . The disseminated disease is typically noted in severely immunocompromised patients (mostly caused by MAC) .\n\n【36】Our case series demonstrated NTM-PD in three elderly patients with COPD and significant smoking history, consistent with the literature reported above . Nevertheless, M. xenopi was isolated in two out of three patients in this series, a finding that is not much in keeping with the epidemiological pattern of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA, where those patients were diagnosed . The reported patients had no history of recent traveling to regions where M. xenopi is more prevalent.\n\n【37】The clinical presentation of MAC and M. xenopi lung disease of our patients is similar to those in the literature . The symptoms of NTM lung diseases are nonspecific (i.e. dry or productive cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and occasionally hemoptysis) . They closely resemble the symptoms of the underlying lung disease, thus making clinical suspicion quite difficult .\n\n【38】The clinical course of MAC is generally less progressive compared to mycobacterial tuberculosis . Extensive lung parenchymal destruction is often evident at the time of MAC diagnosis, partly because of the indolent nature of the disease . Disseminated disease is usually associated with severe cell-mediated immunity deficiency . A less frequent variant of MAC lung disease is notably reported in older women without prior overt lung disease or smoking history, which is characterized by a right middle lobe or lingular infiltrate; referred to as the Lady Windermere syndrome . The least common MAC variant is described in relatively younger immunocompetent hosts with significant exposure to hot tubs . The latter variant is considered a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction to aerosolized MAC from hot tubs .\n\n【39】M. xenopi is a low-virulent NTM that emerged as an opportunistic pathogen for pulmonary disease and less commonly extrapulmonary infections (mostly osteoarticular infections) . A comprehensive review of 136 cases of M. xenopi lung disease from a single tertiary center in France described three disease patterns; cavitary disease in patients with chronic lung disease, mostly COPD (as observed in our reported patients), acute infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts, and rarely solitary nodular disease in immunocompetent patients .\n\n【40】A retrospective study of 74 patients from a single institution in Canada by Carrillo et al  compared the radiological characteristics of the lung disease caused by MAC and M. xenopi . The study noted that patients with M. xenopi were relatively younger and more often had advanced emphysema and lung malignancy . MAC patients mostly had a nodular bronchiectatic pattern, followed by a cavitary pattern (which was noted in our MAC patient) . While the cavitary pattern tended to predominately occur in M. xenopi infection, the majority of patients had variable patterns of random nodules, consolidation, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance, and ground-glass opacities . However, these imaging patterns were not statistically significant and were neither pathognomonic for MAC nor M. xenopi . The cavitation process of M. xenopi typically involves the upper lobes, as observed in the second patient with M. xenopi infection .\n\n【41】Interestingly, M. xenopi infection was reportedly associated with lung malignancy . This suggested association was postulated by scar tissues that may potentially undergo a malignant transformation . Heavy smoking, as a risk factor for lung cancer, is also prevalent among M. xenopi patients, which is an observation that may partly explain the coincidence of M. xenopi and malignancy . In the review of Carrillo et al , about one-fourth (25%) of patients with M. xenopi had prior or concurrent lung cancer . The concern of lung malignancy was evident in our M. xenopi patients, considering their suggestive clinical history and the suspicious radiological findings on initial presentation. A similar case reported by Fogla et al  described an elderly, heavy-smoker, male patient who had an upper lobe cavitary lesion on imaging. Percutaneous needle biopsy and bronchial lavage did not yield neoplastic cells but necrotic tissues. The patient underwent a wedge resection because of a high malignancy suspicion; histology demonstrated caseating granulomas with positive AFP, and further molecular studies with 16S RNA confirmed M. xenopi infection and ruled out typical tuberculosis . Nevertheless, the small possibility of concurrent lung cancer cannot be entirely ruled out in our presented patients.\n\n【42】Microbiological confirmation remains the gold standard to diagnose NTM-PD, as their clinical course and radiological findings greatly mimic typical mycobacterial, fungal, and neoplastic lung diseases . Specific diagnostic criteria were established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) . These criteria require at least two positive expectorated sputum cultures, a positive sputum culture from a bronchial wash or lavage, and a lung biopsy with histologic findings of mycobacterial infection (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) in the presence of a positive NTM culture .\n\n【43】Nevertheless, positive sputum results should be interpreted cautiously as these NTM have variable virulence, therefore, they can be only transiently recovered from the respiratory tract without causing a progressive infection . In addition, NTMs may contaminate laboratory specimens, for instance, tap water (liquid or frozen) may contain NTMs that can potentially contaminate these specimens . Fortunately, highly accurate nucleic acid probes are becoming readily available for faster identification of NTM, including MAC and M. xenopi .\n\n【44】Management of NTM-PD remains challenging. As the infection is usually chronic, a multi-drug regimen is warranted, and there are no randomized comparative trials that evaluated the currently employed regimens . The ATS/IDSA treatment guidelines from 2007 include a combination of a macrolide with rifampin and ethambutol, which should be continued until sputum cultures remain negative for 12 months for MAC , with the same guidelines being currently recommended for M. xenopi . In contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines from 2017 recommend initial treatment with four medications including a macrolide, rifampin, and ethambutol combined with either a fluoroquinolone or isoniazid for NTM infections . These guidelines are based on limited evidence obtained from non-randomized controlled trials .\n\n【45】Surgical intervention for NTM-PD is currently limited only to patients who failed medical therapy (i.e. remained sputum positive after 6 months of continued anti-tuberculous therapy), those who cannot tolerate various medications, and hosts with macrolide-resistant strains .\n\n【46】Conclusions\n\n【47】This case series highlights NTM-PD as an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions. Interestingly, two of the NTM infections in our series were caused by M. xenopi , a less frequent culprit of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA. The NTM infections masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients. The diagnostic criteria for NTM-PD established by the AST/IDSA should be followed to achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis to start anti-tuberculous therapy.\n\n【48】Learning points\n\n【49】NTM-PD is an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions.\n\n【50】NTM-PD can greatly mimic lung malignancy both clinically and radiologically, which may pose a diagnostic dilemma.\n\n【51】Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9f247636-2b8a-4627-82b7-9eedf72c0587", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】There were not many reported cases of upward and downward gaze palsy due to a unilateral rostral and dorsal midbrain lesion . Therefore, the neural structures and pathways underlying vertical gaze control are yet not fully understood. We herein describe a rare case of upward and downward gaze palsy with a loss of vertical smooth pursuit and oculocephalic reflex, convergence palsy, concomitant skew deviation, and bilateral light-near dissociation due to a unilateral rostral and dorsal midbrain infarction. However, ocular tilt reaction, convergence retraction nystagmus, and eyelids abnormalities were not observed. The etiology of these neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms was discussed in detail.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 48-year-old Japanese man with atrial septal defect abruptly complained of nausea, dizziness, and binocular diplopia in January 2015. Two days later, the patient came to our neuro-ophthalmology service and was admitted. No treatment has been performed for atrial septal defect. There was not any other contributory medical history. Consciousness was alert. The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 144/86 mmHg and heart rate of 62/min. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. The diameter of the pupil was 5 mm bilaterally in the illuminated room. In both eyes, though pupil responses to direct and indirect light responses were sluggish, near response of pupil was prompt. Consequently, bilateral light-near dissociation was confirmed. Palpebral aperture measured 8.5 mm in both eyes. Eyelids retraction and lag was not observed. There was upward and downward gaze palsy. Upward gaze palsy was greater than downward . Vertical oculocephalic reflex as well as smooth pursuit was not observed. In addition, convergence palsy and concomitant skew deviation with left-sided hypotropia were demonstrated . Nystagmus was not observed. Bell’s phenomenon was not detected in both eyes. Maddox rod test demonstrated normal torsion in both eyes. Abnormal head tilt was not observed. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Complete blood cell count and laboratory examination were within normal ranges. Chest roentgenogram, electrocardiography and carotid ultrasonography demonstrated no abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated atrial septal defect and no thrombosis in the left atrium. Transesophageal echocardiography could not be performed, because of the patient’s refusal. Computed tomography venography demonstrated no abnormalities in the lower extremities and lung. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized infarct lesion in the rostral and dorsal midbrain on the left side . Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Regarding the etiology of left-sided midbrain infarction, paradoxical embolism secondary to atrial septal defect was suspected. Using 7 days of sodium ozagrel at 160 mg/day, the patient did not complain of nausea and dizziness, and pupil function, downward gaze, vertical oculocephalic reflex, and vertical smooth pursuit were normalized. Consequently, the patient was discharged. Thereafter, under oral clopidogrel at 75 mg/day, the patient became asymptomatic within a month. However, bilateral Bell’s phenomenon was not observed.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) is a wing-shape nucleus, lying dorsomedial to the red nucleus and rostral to the oculomotor nuclei. It contains the neural generators for bilateral vertical saccades. Excitatory burst neurons within this nucleus send collaterals to motoneurons supplying yoked muscle pairs of the two eyes. Axon collaterals responsible for upward saccades reach bilaterally the superior rectus muscle and inferior oblique muscle crossing within the oculomotor nucleus, whereas collaterals for downward saccades project only to the ipsilateral inferior rectus and superior oblique which act as depressor muscles. The interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) lies adjacent and caudal to the riMLF, and is the neural integrator for vertical and torsional gaze. It is responsible for the vertical smooth pursuit and vertical vestibular ocular reflexes. Neurons contained in this nucleus contribute to hold the eyes in eccentric gaze after a vertical saccade and in the eye-head coordination in the roll plane . Moreover, INC receives neuron from the vestibular nucleus. Therefore, INC involvement can cause ocular tilt reaction, which consists of skew deviation, conjugate ocular torsion and head tilt . The posterior commissure contains the projections from INC to the contralateral oculomotor nuclei and the opposite INC. Furthermore, it contains axons responsible for upward gaze originating from the nucleus of the posterior commissure (NPC) and projecting to the riMLF, and to the INC. In addition, the posterior commissure contains the M-group, which is important for coordinating eyelid movements with vertical gaze. The NPC is lying rostral to the superior colliculi at the junction of the aqueduct and third ventricle . However, in vertical gaze and eyelid movement, the role of the NPC remains unclear. Based on two cases of eyelid retraction and eyelid lag with minimal vertical gaze impairment, Galetta et al  noted that a premotor eyelid control might locate in the region of the NPC.\n\n【6】The reason why unilateral rostral midbrain infarctions can induce conjugate upward and downward gaze palsy remains uncertain. Bogousslavsky et al  reported an autopsy case of conjugate upward and downward gaze palsy due to a unilateral infarct destroying the riMLF, but sparing the posterior commissure and INC. The authors stated that a unilateral riMLF lesion may have disrupted bilateral upgaze excitatory and inhibitory inputs and unilateral downgaze excitatory inputs . Ranalli et al  noted a case of paralysis of upward saccades, decreased amplitude and velocity of downward saccades and vertical smooth pursuit, as well as decreased gain and amplitude of the vertical ocular reflex. The neurophysiological examination demonstrated involvement of the right riMLF, a part of the right INC, and the NPC, but the posterior commissure tract was preserved. The authors hypothesized that downward gaze fibers might partly decussate in the ventral posterior commissure and transverse the region of the opposite riMLF .\n\n【7】The mechanism of vertical oculocephalic reflex and smooth pursuit is still controversial. Ohashi et al  described a case of ocular tilt reaction, and upward and downward gaze palsy with a loss of vertical smooth pursuit and oculocephalic reflex secondary to a unilateral midbrain hemorrhage. The authors noted that unilateral riMLF and INC might be involved, and damage to the unilateral INC might cause ocular tilt reaction. However, the relationship between involvement of INC and a loss of vertical oculocephalic reflex and smooth pursuit was not mentioned . Thereafter, there were two reported cases of upward and downward gaze palsy with a loss of vertical oculocephalic reflex and smooth pursuit due to a unilateral midbrain infarction . In both cases, convergence of eyes as well as Bell’s phenomenon was preserved, and ocular tilt reaction was not detected. Although unilateral riMLF and INC were involved, the posterior commissure was spared. The authors speculated that unilateral INC involvement might cause a loss of vertical oculocephalic reflex and smooth pursuit . The main projections from the INC to ocular motoneurons and the contralateral INC are through the posterior commissure. Consequently, a lesion of unilateral INC may be, in effect, a bilateral lesion, and so affects inputs to ocular motoneurons on both sides .\n\n【8】In human, the mechanism of convergence is still uncertain. Nashold et al  reported that, in all of 16 patients, after the stereotactic mesencephalotomy for pain control, unilateral destroyed lesion which located below the superior follicular region in the vicinity of the posterior commissure caused convergence palsy.\n\n【9】The precise etiology of light-near dissociation remains uncertain. Based on the neuroimaging analysis, Shams et al  stated that pretectal lesion affecting the posterior commissure might cause bilateral light-near dissociation. Midline lesion of the posterior commissure interrupts most projections from both pretectal olivary nucleus, and may cause bilateral symmetric loss of the pupillary light reflex with preservation of the near response. The authors speculated that the near-reflex fibers approached the Edinger-Westphal nucleus through the ventral region, unlike the afferent retinal light-near reflex fibers that follow a dorsal route .\n\n【10】Convergence retraction nystagmus is characterized by fast convergence and retraction of the eyes with a slow divergence and forward movement of the eyes, and may develop in dorsal midbrain lesion. However, its pathological etiology remains unclear. Riodan-Eva et al  reported a case of convergence retraction nystagmus secondary to involvement of unilateral riMLF, rostral portion of the INC and NPC. Based on the electrophysiological analysis in a case of unilateral riMLF and NPC impairment, Rambold et al  stated that convergence retraction nystagmus might be a disorder of vergence rather than of opposing adducting saccades.\n\n【11】In our patient, upward and downward gaze palsy might be caused by damage to the left-sided riMLF. In addition, loss of vertical oculocephalic reflex and vertical smooth pursuit might be induced by impairment of the left-sided INC. However, there was not ocular tilt reaction, despite involvement of unilateral INC. Therefore, we considered that, in our patient, the left-sided INC was partially damaged. Concomitant skew deviation is defined as vertical misalignment of the eyes, and a poorly localizing sign of posterior fossa dysfunction . Convergence palsy might result from impairment of the region which located at the posterior commissure and lateral to the Sylvian aqueduct. Bilateral light-near dissociation might be induced by involvement of the posterior commissure. There were not convergence retraction nystagmus, and eyelids retraction and lag, probably because the NPC might be spared. We believed that our patient had no Bell’s phenomenon in both eyes by nature. In our patient, vertical gaze palsy continued longer than the other neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms. Consequently, the left-sided riMLF might be damaged intensely, whereas the left-sided INC and posterior commissure might be partially involved. In conclusion, we emphasize that, in cases of unilateral rostral and dorsal midbrain infarction, detailed neuro-ophthalmologic examination is very useful for precise recognition of its extent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "7b934dc1-b5a5-423b-a2ff-0ee47646b44f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Lymphoproliferative disorders are innate disorders of the immune system in which a population of lymphocytes exhibit disordered growth patterns. Immunodeficiency associated lymphoproliferative disorders refer to an abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes in patients with underlying immunosuppression and are particularly interesting because they form a model in which to explore the relationship between the immune system and the development of malignancy. These disorders are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous, and typically differ based on the underlying setting in which they arise. Immunodeficiency associated lymphoproliferative disorders can occur in association with primary immune disorders or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Additionally, they can occur in the setting of iatrogenic immunodeficiency, either in the post-transplant setting after solid organ, stem cell, and bone marrow transplantation or less commonly, during treatment of various autoimmune and rheumatological disorders managed with immunomodulatory agents .\n\n【2】Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of chronic intestinal diseases characterized by inflammation of the bowel. IBD is often treated with various immunomodulatory drugs including thiopurines (TPs), mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors. Thiopurines, in particular, are known to have a significantly increased relative risk for development of iatrogenic immunodeficiency associated lymphoproliferative disorders (IILPDs) . Here we present a case of IILPD involving the rectosigmoid junction in a patient with IBD treated with immunomodulatory medications, along with a review of the available literature of this rare condition.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 43-year-old Caucasian man presented to his gastroenterologist with progressive rectal pain and fevers. His medical history was significant for a 22-year history of ulcerative colitis, which was subsequently diagnosed as Crohn’s disease and iron-deficiency anemia. Following an IBD flare 9 months prior to lymphoma diagnosis, oral steroids were added to his longstanding mesalamine and azathioprine therapy. After 5 months of persistent symptoms, he underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed severe colitis. In light of these findings, treatment with vedolizumab was initiated. After two doses, he reported worsening rectal pain and fevers with imaging findings of a perirectal abscess. He underwent abscess drainage which was complicated by colonic perforation requiring emergent Hartmann’s procedure with diverting colostomy and seton drain placement. Pathology at that time was without evidence of lymphoma.\n\n【6】The patient presented to our institution a few months later for a second opinion given ongoing severe rectal pain and drainage. He underwent an examination under anesthesia with rigid proctoscopy. Digital examination was notable for hard, neoplastic feeling tissue along the posterior wall of the rectum and biopsies were taken of a hard exophytic appearing tissue .\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】He subsequently underwent a colonoscopy and endoscopy with biopsies. The pathology from rectal biopsies revealed IILPD, monomorphic, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, non-germinal center . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were negative for MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6 rearrangements. Other biopsied sites were without evidence of lymphoma. Mesalamine and azathioprine were discontinued, and patient was referred to hematology for further management.\n\n【9】Treatment and follow-up\n\n【10】Staging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan, whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan and bone marrow biopsy/aspirate revealed disease localized to the rectum. The patient has since completed six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP), and achieved complete response which was confirmed by post-treatment PET scan as well as colonoscopy with random biopsies.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Primary colorectal lymphoma (PCL) is an uncommon colonic malignancy comprising only 0.2% to 0.6% of all large bowel malignancies . PCL is an uncommon site of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and accounts for approximately 10-20% of gastrointestinal NHL . PCL more frequently involves the cecum compared to the rectum, likely due to differences in the amount of lymphoid tissue in these two regions .\n\n【13】Epidemiological studies show that the incidence of colorectal lymphomas is highest between the ages of 50 and 70 years, with a 2:1 male predominance . The majority of patients with PCL present with early stage disease (stage IE) . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histological subtype occurring in the colon and rectum . Several studies have reported a small, but significant increased risk of lymphoma associated with use of thiopurines . Kotlyar and colleagues published a meta-analysis where they estimated a standardized incidence rate of thiopurine associated lymphoma of 2.80 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.82 - 4.32) in population-based studies . These authors demonstrated that patients with IBD who were taking thiopurines had nearly a six-fold higher incidence of lymphoma when compared with the general population. Similar to other studies, this meta-analysis demonstrated that the magnitude of risk is associated with duration of treatment with increased risk of lymphoma in those with more than 1 year of active treatment. As in other studies, findings from this meta-analysis suggest that the increased incidence of lymphoma does not persist after treatment with thiopurines is discontinued . This suggests that the driving factor in thiopurine associated lymphoma is via immunosuppression rather than direct DNA damage.\n\n【14】Due to its rarity, there is no standard of care or high-level evidence to direct management of PCLs. Many experts suggest a multidisciplinary approach to treatment with involvement of surgical oncology, gastroenterology, hematology, and radiation oncology. Additionally, treatment decisions should factor in presenting symptoms (e.g. obstruction, bleeding, perforation), intent of treatment (curative versus palliative) and histological sub-type of NHL given variable responses to chemotherapy.\n\n【15】The role for surgery in the upfront management of PCL remains unclear despite high rates of surgical intervention in patients. Surgery is often used as a diagnostic tool when there is an initial suspicion for carcinoma. Additionally, patients may present with acute concerns such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction that require urgent or emergent surgical intervention.\n\n【16】There are no randomized controlled studies comparing surgery plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. Some advocate for surgical intervention for localized disease involving large lesions, particularly those localized to the colon, in the hope that this will decrease rates of perforation and bleeding, minimize chemotherapy-related toxicity and potentially improve survival outcomes . The benefit of surgical resection followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone has been assessed in several nonrandomized studies, and has demonstrated superior survival rates in those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone . One large retrospective analysis of patients with limited stage intestinal DLBCL demonstrated lower recurrence rate (15.3% versus 36.8%) and improved 3-year overall survival rate (91% versus 62%) in patients treated with surgery plus chemotherapy versus those treated with chemotherapy alone . Another prospective nonrandomized study which included patients with limited stage gastrointestinal DLBCL also demonstrated favorable outcomes in those patients treated with primary surgical resection followed by chemotherapy . A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database study additionally demonstrated better overall survival for patients with PCL treated with surgery compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. However, a subgroup analysis demonstrated that certain groups including those with rectal disease, left-sided disease, and certain histological subtypes did not show a survival benefit from surgery . The authors acknowledged that there is a lack of evidence to support a correlation of surgical intervention with improved survival. The study was limited by lack of important clinical information including chemotherapy data, selection bias, and variations in data reporting and coding systems . Hangge and colleagues report on their experience of PCL by comparing an institutional cohort to SEER database. While institutional patients who underwent surgery had the highest 5-year overall survival, these authors concluded that treatment modality of surgery versus no surgery was not predictive of overall survival . In fact, the most common treatment in the institutional cohort was chemotherapy alone. The higher survival rate in surgical patients was thought to be impacted by preoperative selection bias, disease stage, and histological subtype. Additionally, a subgroup analysis did not detect any significant differences; however, small sample sizes limited the ability to power for this analysis . Another systematic review of primary gastrointestinal NHL of the small and large intestines additionally concluded survival benefit in those treated with surgery . However, the authors note several limitations that prevent “evidence-based generalizable conclusions about optimal treatment practices” . Some of the limitations noted included selection bias in operative candidates, aggressive histological subtypes necessitating emergent surgeries and pre-rituximab era medical management not reflecting optimal outcomes.\n\n【17】Many experts argue that chemotherapy alone should remain the standard therapy for patients with a highly proliferative aggressive lymphoma given high response rate and potential for cure with R-CHOP-like regimens. Additionally, the infiltrative and systemic nature of lymphoma often precludes it from being managed with surgical resection or for extent of disease to be encompassed in radiation fields . Skubbe and colleagues conducted a retrospective review of patients with colorectal lymphoma, and did not demonstrate a difference in overall survival between those treated with surgical management versus chemotherapy alone .\n\n【18】Learning points\n\n【19】PCL is an uncommon disease, and cases of IILPD with isolated involvement of the colorectal area are even rarer. While the relative risk of lymphoma in patients who are actively treated with thiopurines is moderate, the absolute risk of lymphoma for any given patient remains quite low. Therefore, the decision to proceed with thiopurine treatment requires risk/benefit discussion. At this time, there is no current standard of care treatment for PCL or IILPD, and management should be tailored to the individual patient using a multidisciplinary approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. Elderly individuals may be easy to fall into a depressed state because of biological changes in the brain and body aging; experiences of loss of a spouse, friend, etc.; and need for stable biopsychosocial status in health and financial aspects. In fact, the rate of suicide is higher in older age groups than in the other generations. The incidence of dementia also increases with aging. Although depression and dementia are common in the elderly age group, recognition and diagnosis of such diseases in the clinical setting might be difficult.\n\n【2】Eating disorders occur most commonly in adolescents and are rarely newly diagnosed after the age of 40 years . However, anorexia is also one of the major symptoms of depression in the elderly. In addition to an impact on quality of life, significant morbidity and mortality are associated with anorexia. Individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder may suffer from osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, altered gastrointestinal motility, hormonal shifts, leukopenia, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia. Japan is currently an aging society with a huge proportion of elderly citizens. Consequently, the incidence and severity of anorexia and depression are predicted to increase in the future. In fact, at present, anorexia is common in the elderly. The social burdens, financial strain, and the high level of physical and cognitive intactness required for meal preparation all contribute to decreased appetite and food intake in older people . Anorexia can also be a symptom of physical illness or above-mentioned depression . Anorexia tardive, a related disorder specific to the elderly, is marked by loss of appetite and significant weight loss, but has more depressive symptoms, less disturbed body image, and preoccupation with eating behavior compared with anorexia nervosa. This condition may be secondary to complicated bereavement as a variant of a geriatric depressive episode .\n\n【3】In this report, we present a case of an elderly woman who visited a primary care physician first and was eventually diagnosed as anorexia due to depression.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 84-year-old woman started to gradually lose appetite. About a month later, she consulted her local doctor and was noted to have only superficial gastritis after a series of tests, including blood examinations, endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound. She was prescribed a lansoprazole 15 mg/day and regularly followed up at the hospital. She gained her appetite temporarily, but again lost her appetite and stopped having meals altogether after about a week. Because of this, she was advised admission by her local doctor.\n\n【6】Past medical history included total hysterectomy due to myoma at the age of 50 years. She was the oldest female of seven siblings, but was adopted and raised by her aunt since birth, with very little interaction with her biological parents and siblings. After graduating high school at the age of 21 years, she married an office worker. Moreover, she obtained a degree and managed a barbershop until the age of 74 years. Currently, she lives in a household of three with her son and his wife.\n\n【7】She was advised by her local doctor and visited our hospital at first on September 2. On physical examination, she was alert and conscious and had no apparent cognitive dysfunction. She was 150 cm tall, weighed 38 kg, and had a body mass index of 16.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Blood pressure was 102/64 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.5 °C, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The breasts and stomach area were unremarkable. Her hips were slightly bent and caused her to lean forward, but she could walk on her own. There was no anarthria or dysphagia. Mini-mental status examination score was 24/30 points. Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D)  was 17/50 points . There was no obvious suicidal ideation. Laboratory findings showed no abnormalities. Thyroid hormone levels were also normal. Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed no apparent abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed minimal diffuse white matter ischemic changes that were suggestive of atrophy in the frontal lobe, but this was expected of her age . She was subsequently discharged and was advised to follow-up as an outpatient. On her outpatient visit, the patient mentioned that she did have any internal need or desire to eat. Although she was drinking 500 mL of milk every day, she lost 5 kg within the past month. Upon assessment, we noted that her physical strength was gradually getting weaker and that her ability to walk was declining due to disuse. As an outpatient, there was not enough time for the staff to talk and communicate fully with the patient. In addition, we judged that it was difficult to continue following her progress with tests as an outpatient and admitted her to the hospital on September 26. Repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any anatomic abnormalities. We continued to track her progress along with administration of vitamin tablets, fluid replacement, and physical rehabilitation to prevent muscle disuse.\n\n【8】During this admission, she started talking with us and we learned that the patient started to become emotionally unstable since the 2011 earthquake. She would get frightened of aftershocks during the night, became scared of being alone during the day, and would have sleepless nights because of persistent thoughts about the earthquake. She visited psychiatrists a few times and was prescribed sleep-inducing pills. About 2 years ago, she joined a senior club by a non-profit organization and started participating in activities, such as haiku, playing the harmonica, and using the computer, which were held four times a week. She recalled looking forward to each meeting until about 4 months before her hospitalization, when she was invited to attend a school reunion. Although she always looked forward to reunions, she did not think that it would be fun because only two of her best friends will be able to attend. She was unmotivated and decided not to attend. Later, at the senior club, she started feeling that her mind was not functioning as quickly as before and she grew impatient toward herself. Although her facial expressions were normal and conversations were smooth, it seemed as if she lacked the will to live and often blamed herself. After discussing with psychiatrists, we diagnosed her as having an eating disorder from geriatric depression.\n\n【9】We started administering the patient with 5 mg of mianserin, 20 mg of mirtazapine, and 25 mg of dogmatyl. Subsequently, she was discharged from the hospital and was asked to continue to visit as an outpatient. About a month after discharge from the hospital, her appetite improved gradually, she started enjoying rehabilitation, and even started snacking. She no longer lacked the ability to enjoy experiences. About a month after she left the hospital, she came to the hospital on a silver car, was walking on her own, smiled often, and became her healthy self. At this time, she claimed that meals tasted good and was even eating a little too much. Thereafter, she continued to visit the hospital on a regular basis for checkups. About half a year after discharge from the hospital, her weight returned to 50 kg.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This was a case of an 84-year-old elderly woman who complained of loss of appetite and weight, but with no cognitive functional disorders and no apparent signs of emotional stress. The female presented in this report anorexia can be a symptom of depression and the treatment plan was devised accordingly. After multiple tests, it became apparent that she was suffering from an eating disorder. The biopsychosocial model has increased popularity not only in the medical and psychiatric fields but also in other various medical fields recently due to its consideration of multiple forms of etiological risks when determining how to most effectively understand and treat individuals for physical and mental illness. This model, in regard to depression, takes into account biological and psychological or cognitive, and social risk factors/contributors to depression when making diagnosis and treatment. The evidence regarding the cause of late life depression is addressed from a biopsychosocial perspective. Thorough understanding of the biopsychosocial model enabled diagnosis and appropriate treatment of early-onset geriatric depression. The individual-focalized and humanized approach, assisting the patient as singular being, was the best one achieving her biopsychosocial needs in this clinical practice. The successful outcome after a typical biopsychosocial model of psychotherapeutic intervention for eating disorders provided additional indirect evidence that she was indeed suffering from anorexia.\n\n【12】At an old age, there are various experiences of loss, including loss of health, social roles, and personal relationships. By listening carefully in this case study, it was apparent that the patient experienced much loss. Moreover, in geriatric depression, patients have few negative emotions, such as feeling depressed, sad, or any other subjective drops in mood; this implies that elderly individuals might find it difficult to explain their symptoms to others, and that the people around them might hardly notice any symptoms of depression. Moreover, patients with this condition might experience several physical malfunctions, such as pain, numbness, loss of appetite, etc. At an old age, many people experience loss of spouses, friends, status, health, and financial assets, in addition to biological changes in the brain and body. In other words, from the biopsychosocial perspective, elderly individuals might easily become depressed. Moreover, looking at the suicide rates by age group, older people have a higher tendency to commit suicide than people in the other age groups. In elderly individuals with depression, complaints about a depressed mood are often few, and the symptoms are atypical. Compared with young people, older people have few symptoms that are characteristic of intrinsic depression, such as desperate ideation, decreased sexual desire, guilt feeling, and depressed mood. Physical discomfort and anxiety symptoms, such as hypochondria, general physical symptoms, impatience, and digestive system symptoms have been reported . Elderly people with depression have less frequent symptoms of depressed mood, guilt feelings, and diligent thought, which are considered to be common in intrinsic depression; instead, excessive anxiety to physical symptoms and feeling of frustration are frequent.\n\n【13】This is thought to be one of the causes of the actual increase in the number of diseases with aging. Some common co-morbid conditions associated with depression are coronary artery disease in about 10-20% and endocrine disorders in 20-60%. Additionally, the prevalence rate of anorexia is approximately 66% in patients with advanced cancer . Furthermore, the mortality rate of depression has been reported to be high; this was true even in central nervous system diseases, such as dementia in about 10%, Parkinson’s disease in about 30%, and stroke in 20-30% . In the overwhelming majority of cases that appeared in literature, disordered patterns of eating, weight, and body image in the elderly were accompanied by co-morbid conditions of anxiety, depression, grief, or dementia . There have been cases of presumed anorexia that have actually been due to hypothalamic tumors and dysfunction , but there was no evidence of any mass on CT or MRI. MRI is usually used to rule out organic causes for psychiatric symptoms. Specially, it is usefulness for diagnosis by exclusion of vascular depression or vascular dementia . Therefore, MRI was very useful in our case . In addition, anorexia and refusal to eat disorders in the elderly have several differential diseases . There is also a need to carefully exclude these diseases and situations.\n\n【14】About 10% of the elderly who receive primary medical care have been diagnosed with depression. Untreated geriatric depression could heighten the risk of cognitive function disorders, physical complications, and death; therefore, it is extremely important to test and diagnose this condition. Anorexia has proven to be an independent predictor of mortality in elderly people . Therefore, it is important to note that depression is a treatable disease even in the elderly and that patients require appropriate social support, as well as medical and mental therapies. In addition, depression in the elderly is an influential risk factor for suicide; in this sense, differences in depressive symptoms between young people and older people should be known and not overlooked.\n\n【15】In conclusion, this case report highlighted that in atypical populations, such as the elderly, there is a need to be aware of the possibility of eating disorders to decrease risks to health and even life due to a delay in the diagnosis. People suffering from geriatric depression often do not volunteer feelings of sadness, depression, or other negative emotions. The elderly have a tendency to get depressed due to biopsychosocial causes. More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, the effectiveness of primary care will become more important in the future and primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. We think that general medicine will have an more important part in medical practice in the future in Japan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In a patient with a murmur and a fever of undetermined origin, precipitating or predisposing factors, if present, should produce a high index of suspicion of infective endocarditis . Infection of the pacemaker system should be suspected in any patient with an implanted device manifesting a persistent febrile illness, and if untreated, it can result in acute or subacute bacterial endocarditis and can be fatal . Typical clinical features of infective endocarditis are constitutional symptoms of fever, chills, and malaise with persistent bacteremia and a new or changing heart murmur . Rheumatic manifestations are known to be frequent complications of IE. Embolic complications can occur as neurologic abnormalities, arthralgias, or vasculitis and can focus attention away from the underlying cardiac cause. Such complications initially might obscure the diagnosis of endocarditis .\n\n【2】Vasculitis is a serious complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that develops in a minority of patients with this disease. The condition occurs in patients with longstanding, severe, seropositive erosive nodular RA. In one study, the mean duration between the diagnosis of RA and the onset of vasculitic symptoms was 13.6 years . Rheumatoid vasculitis leads to necrosis, blood vessel occlusion, and tissue ischemia in a manner that resembles other forms of systemic vasculitis, particularly polyarteritis nodosa. The classic skin lesions of rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) are deep cutaneous ulcers on the lower extremities. Clinical manifestations of small vessel vasculitis may be present in RV, but the clinical picture and most challenging problems are dominated by disease in medium-sized arteries and arterioles , and there is considerable associated morbidity and mortality . In this case the differential diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis in a patient with IE and severe RA is emphasized.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our department with complaints of fever, chills, asthenia, night sweats, arthralgia, weight loss, and necrotizing skin ulcers on the body and lower extremities since the last month. She had a history of RA for 20 years and a temporary pacemaker application after a drug-induced bradyarrhytmia two months ago. The bradyarrhytmia was due to calcium channel-blocking agent (verapamil) she was using for essential hypertension. The pace-maker was removed after the drug effect was counteracted, but the pace lead fractured and remained inside the right ventricle.\n\n【5】At admission she was fully oriented, her axillary temperature was 38.8 °C , heart rate was 120 bpm, respiratory rate was 35/min, and blood pressure was 135/95 mmHg. Physical examination revealed deformation of the hands , and feet, flexion contractures of the hip and knee, necrotizing skin ulcers on the lower extremities and the body , and borderline splenomegaly. She had normal head, eye, neck and lung findings. A 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the lower end of the sternum. Her abdomen was soft and nontender. No hepatomegaly was detected. There were no clubbing, cyanosis, and edema of the extremities.\n\n【6】Laboratory findings were as follows: white cell count: 46.6 K/µL with neutrophils 87.1%, hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl, platelet count: 264 K/µL, blood urea nitrogen: 37 mg/dl (N: 9.8 - 20), creatinine: 2.18 mg/dl (N: 0.6 - 1.1), serum albumin: 2.2 g/dl (N: 3.5 - 5), serum globulin: 2.2 g/dl (N: 1.1 - 3.1), CRP: 24.80 mg/dl (N: 0.01 - 0.82), procalcitonin: 0.215 ng/ml (N < 0.05), ferritin: 719.4 ng/ml (N: 10 - 204), serum iron: 18 µg/dl (N: 25 - 156), serum total iron binding capacity: 110 µg/dl (N: 250 - 425), sedimentation rate: 109 mm/hr, rheumatoid factor: 929 IU/ml (N < 10), anti CCP: 56.5 U/ml (N < 5).Plasma cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen were negative. Complement levels of C3C was 86 mg/dl (N: 83 - 193) and C4 was 4.3 mg/dl (N: 15 - 57). Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and 2+ proteinuria (1.3 g/day by quantitative measurement). Assessment of the cell morphology showed dysmorphic red blood cells with folds and spicules. During follow-up hematuria and proteinuria resolved and no further evaluation for differential diagnosis was required.\n\n【7】Serology for hepatitis A, B, C, HIV, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, Toxoplasma, Rubella, Brucella, Typhoid fever, Syphilis and aspergillosis was negative.\n\n【8】Evaluation of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies reactive to myeloperoxidase (p-ANCA), and proteinase-3 (c-ANCA), serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNA), other ANA and anticytoplasmic antibodies (eg,Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Smith (anti-Sm), RNP, Jo-1), antiphospholipid antibodies (eg,anticardiolipin antibodies), Scl-70 antibody (topoisomerase-1), and antibody to centromeric protein (anticentromere antibody) revealed negative.\n\n【9】The electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were normal. Colored doppler ultrasonography of the upper and lower extremities revealed no abnormalities in the flow and structure of the arterial and venous vascularite.\n\n【10】Clinical course\n\n【11】At admission, empiric antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone 2 g/d) was commenced after blood and urine samples were obtained for cultures. In case of possible IE, blood cultures were obtained by four different vene punctures over 24 h, at least 1 h apart.\n\n【12】On the second day of her hospital stay, transthoracic echocardiogram followed by transesophageal showed an ejection fraction of 30%, an echodensity on the fractured pacemaker lead inside the right ventricule, and a mobile, 1.2 × 1.0 cm vegetation on the lateral leaflet of the tricuspid valve with minimal tricuspid regurgitation . Antibiotherapy with vancomycin 500 mg and imipenem 500mg IV daily were commenced according to the definition of possible IE by clinical criteria . Antibiotic dosages were adjusted by creatinine clearance which was 27.8 ml/min. Dose regimens changed as the patient’s creatinine clearance improved. Methicillin- resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus was identified in two of the four blood cultures drawn > 12 h apart, and definite IE was diagnosed by the presence of two major criteria . The high level of rheumatoid factor was not taken into account because of the patient’s longstanding and severe RA although it is one of the minor diagnostic criteria of IE.\n\n【13】Response to treatment was monitored by the clinical status (in particular course of fever) and C-reactive protein. Echo follow-up examinations were carried on for later comparisons and detection of complications as proposed . C-reactive protein and leucocyte count fell to normal levels as the patient responded to therapy. According to the guidelines, duration of therapy is somewhat arbitrary and should be guided by the course of the disease, 4 weeks of intravenous therapy is usually considered the minimum . It has been hypothesized that anticoagulatory or antiaggregatory drugs might be benefical in reducing the growth of vegetations . There was no clinical evidence for such measures during follow-up. Anticoagulation may even be hazardous in view of the potential for haemorrhagic complications after cerebral embolization . We did not confront with a complication of cerebral emboli. Neither an anticoagulatory nor an antiaggregatory drug was commenced during the treatment of the case. On the second week of the treatment with antibiotics, the patient’s temperature raised above 38 °C again. Candida stellatoidea was identified from the urine culture, and fluconazole 200 mg IV daily was administered.\n\n【14】Histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen from skin lesions revealed acute severe vasculitis in the papillar dermis with dense inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophil-predominance, fibrinoid necrosis within the vessel wall  and necrosis of the epidermis which was consistent with leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis (LCV) . Differential diagnosis were considered between infection, connective tissue disease and drug reaction . No drug intake was registered. In patients with septic vasculitis, the demonstrative severe pandermal LCV with neutrophil- and bacteria-containing (one of the implicated microbial pathogens is staphyloccoccus) thrombi, extravascular neutrophilia with microabscesses and neutrophilic exocytosis, and papillary dermal edema  were not present in our case. The longstanding history and destructive RA with very high seropositivity achieved the diagnosis of romatoid vasculitis in our patient. Treatment administered with methylprednisolon 500 mg IV bolus followed by 40 mg PO daily.\n\n【15】It is generally accepted that large (usually defined as > 10 mm) mobile vegetations pose a grave embolic threat and should therefore be removed surgically as soon as possible . The patient was consulted with the department of cardiovascular surgery. In our case, the patient’s poor clinical condition and difficulty of moving the fractured lead away without causing recurrent emboli postponed the surgery. After four weeks of medical treatment, a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no change from the previous one. Although the patient’s blood and urine cultures were negative on the 4th week of her admission, she remained on vancomycin 2 g/d and imipenem 500 mg/qid. Fluconazole was discontinued.\n\n【16】On the 5th week of her hospital stay, vancomycin resistant enteroccoccus (VRE) was identified from blood culture. She was isolated from the other patients. Vancomycin was discontinued and daptomycin (cubicin 6 mg/kg in 0.9% sodium chloride by intravenous infusion over a 30 minute period once every 24 hours for 14 days) was commenced. On the 6th week of her hospital stay, she had severe respiratory failure due to pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii was identified from the sputum culture. It was sensitive to only amikacin. Right heart endocarditis in the majority of cases leads to- sometimes silent- septic pulmonary embolism and may present with signs of pneumonia and pleuritis . Two days after amikacin had been commenced, the patient’s clinical situation deteriorated and had to be supported by mechanical ventilation. On the 50th day of her hospital stay she died of severe sepsis.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Infection of valvular tissue or cardiovascular endothelium by a variety of pathogens constitutes IE. Although endocarditis mostly involves the cardiac valves, it may also manifest as endarteritis or develop on foreign bodies such as intravenous lines, pacemaker leads, conduits, etc. Today the physician often confronts more aggressive infections, in particular staphylococcal endocarditis, and often the disease arises in immunocompromised patients .\n\n【19】Infective endocarditis is now affecting older patients who more often develop IE as the result of health care-associated procedures, either in patients with no previously known valve disease or in patients with prosthetic valves .\n\n【20】There is no specific laboratory marker of IE. Laboratory abnormalities include leucocytosis with granulocytosis with a left shift (or leucopenia, especially in overt sepsis), elevated sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein and gamma globulin levels. Anaemia of infection with low serum iron levels is a cardinal sign of endocarditis. Circulating immune complexes and occasionally a positive rheumatoid factor are detectable. The most important laboratory test is the blood culture. IE usually leads to a continuous bacteraemia, such that (in the absence of pretreatment with antibiotics) blood cultures are very sensitive to detect the disease and may be drawn at any time independent from the time course of fever .\n\n【21】In a pooled analysis of 3784 episodes of IE, it was shown that oral streptococci had fallen into second place to staphylococci as the leading cause of IE. Traditionally, native valve staphylococcal IE is due to S. aureus, which is most often susceptible to oxacillin, at least in community-acquired IE. In contrast, staphylococcal prosthetic valve IE is more frequently due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) with oxacillin resistance. Mortality in large series ranges between 15% and 20%. Mortality is the highest in staphylococcal and fungal endocarditis .\n\n【22】Presented with the nonspecific systemic symptoms of fever of unknown origin with fever, chills, malaise, night sweats, arthralgia, and weight loss, laboratory findings with granulocytosis, anaemia of infection, high levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, and sedimentation rate, and low levels of C4 with methicillin-resistant ısolate of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia of which most often originates from the skin and oropharynx) and intracardiac pacemaker lead with an echodensity on it and a mobile vegetation on the tricuspid valve, the diagnosis of right-sided IE was considered in our patient. Although intravenous drug use is a well-defined risk factor for the development of right-sided IE, our patient had no previous history of intravenous drug use.\n\n【23】The classification of vasculitic syndromes are based on clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features , and diagnostic imaging studies . It is well-known that patients with RA exhibit various cutaneous conditions including rheumatoid vasculitis . Because proof of vasculitis is not always obtainable, even in biopsy specimens, biopsies from different lesions and from the border of the lesions were taken as recommended  in our patient. The histopathologic findings were consistent with leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis (LCV). As previously reported, LCV related to bacterial infection was considered if no drug intake was registered before the development of skin lesions, and bacteriologic evidence of infection was obtained . In cases with IE and LCV, a trend to low serum complement levels was evident. This was associated to an immune complex-mediated process initiated by antigen products of the infectious agent responsible for the IE, or to the result of abnormal immunoregulation related to the infectious disease . Although some cases of drug-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis manifest a severe pan-dermal and/or pustular vasculitis, such as those associated with calcium channel blockers, the typical drug-induced leucocytoclastic vasculitis is mild in character and is confined to the superficial vascular plexus .\n\n【24】It is important that leg ulcers do not always mean vasculitis. Chronic leg ulcers, with or without edema are often recognized in patients with RA. The etiology is multifactorial, but often associated with venous insufficiency . By using doppler ultrasonography, venous insufficiency of the lower extremities was excluded in our patient. According to Jorizzo and Daniels’ classification of RV , our patient had severe form of RV with digital gangrene, and large cutaneous ulcers. Infection of the ulcers, if occurs will be a complicating risk. By using broad spectrum antibiotics for IE, we did not come across with any infection of the ulcers in the case.\n\n【25】The etiology of RV is unclear. Rheumatoid vasculitis usually develops at a time when the inflammatory arthritis is ‘burned out’, (ie, when the erosive process that led to joint destruction has become less active) . High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) are reported consistently to be the strongest predictor of the development of RV, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may be helpful in distinguishing RV from other forms of small vessel vasculitis. Circulating immune complexes were negative, and the RF and CCP were strongly positive in our patient. We could not look for antiendothelial cell antibodies, but, antiedothelial cell antibody assays have no defined role in making the diagnosis, assessing the prognosis, or gauging disease activity in RV at present .\n\n【26】Numerous medications used to treat RA have also been proposed as triggers of RV, partly because of some similarities between drug-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis and RV. In particular, the treatment of RA with oral glucocorticoids has been implicated in the development of RV . Rheumatoid vasculitis most often occurs in people with at least 10 years of severe disease. Our patient had a history of RA for over 20 years, and had been on corticosteroid therapy of differrent dose regimens since then. Systemic vasculitis complicating rheumatoid arthritis appears to be on the decline. This is probably as a consequence of modern and better treatments of the underlying arthritis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e6d56474-8896-49e8-9055-aeb4d11821b3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Tanacetum parthenium has an interesting history. It is a member of the daisy family, and the plant originated in Europe, North America and Australia. According to a few clinical trials, Tanacetum parthenium was not associated with serious adverse events but rather with mild and reversible events . Adverse events leading to withdrawals were mainly of a gastrointestinal nature . There is no major safety issue. It is mentioned by common names, such as feverfew and featherfew .\n\n【2】In the past, feverfew was used by Greeks and Europeans to treat fevers, migraine headaches and bites . In 1978, it was first freely used as a preventative for migraine in the UK. Many clinical trials support the use of feverfew to prevent migraine and treat rheumatic disease, arthritis and irregular menstrual cycles .\n\n【3】The medicinal components of feverfew are its leaves and the flower heads, and the constituents of the plant are a volatile oil, flavonoids, polyenes and sesquiterpene lactones . More than 30 sesquiterpene lactones have been identified in feverfew. Sesquiterpene lactones are active constituents in feverfew, especially parthenolide, 3-beta-hydroxyparthenolide, tanaparthin-alpha-peroxide, costunolide, reynosin, 8-beta hydroxyreynosinn, canin, artecanin and secotanaparthenolide A . The leaves are cut before complete flowering and dried at temperatures not exceeding 35 °C . Many commercial feverfew preparations are standardized based on a 0.1% to 0.2% parthenolide content .\n\n【4】The Few Gs are herbs that have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding or having coumarin-like or salicylate-like effects; the name Few Gs was proposed by Ciocon and other writers to help health care professionals remember a list of herbs that are known to alter bleeding. The Few Gs include feverfew, ginger, ginkgo biloba, garlic and ginseng .\n\n【5】Possible adverse drug reactions associated with feverfew use are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores and increased risk of bleeding. Stopping feverfew therapy can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia, joint pain, nervousness and headache, and patients should be advised to taper then discontinue feverfew completely 2 - 3 weeks before surgery or when starting any anticoagulant or platelet therapy .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 36-year-old female visited the obstetrics and gynecology clinic with complaints of vaginal bleeding, a prolonged duration of the menstrual cycle exceeding 15 days and reddish skin without bruising. The patient suffered from these symptoms over a period of 3 months prior to the clinic visit.\n\n【8】Physical, colposcopic and hysteroscopy examinations showed no signs of fibroids, adenomyosis, endometritis, hyperplasia or pelvic infection with normal uterine and urethral structure and negative cervix and uterus biopsies.\n\n【9】The laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count (CBC) but a low hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL, a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 42 s, a prothrombin time (PT) of 27.3 s, a negative urine pregnancy test and no serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\n\n【10】The patient was a mother of three children and did not have any chronic diseases, blood disorders or polycystic ovary syndrome. The patient had no previous history of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, and she had a with a normal hormone profile. She suffered from chronic migraine without auras since the age of 28 years and was treated with 100 mg sumatriptan tablets for 4 years, but without response or improvement, she then changed to topiramate 50 mg once daily. Nine months ago, 800 mg feverfew capsules were administered twice daily for 6 months alone, and then the dose was increased to 800 mg three times daily without improvements.\n\n【11】Previously, she did not take any over-the-counter oral contraceptives or herbs except the combination of paracetamol and caffeine 1 g when needed during feverfew therapy. Feverfew was discontinued, and the doctor prescribed 10 mg medroxyprogesterone tablets for 10 days beginning on the 21st day of the next menstrual cycle with 190 mg iron sulfate tablets twice daily and multivitamin tablets once daily for 3 months.\n\n【12】After 4 months, a workup at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic was performed. The laboratory results showed a PT of 14.4 s, a PTT of 29 s, a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL, and all coagulation profiles completely recovered to normal levels .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Feverfew treats migraine headaches through many mechanisms, and the active constituent parthenolide is a potent inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte granules, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and prostaglandin synthetase . The dose of feverfew for migraine headaches is 100 to 300 mg up to four times daily for 16 weeks from the standard preparation (0.2-0.4% parthenolide) and 6.25 mg, three times daily, for up to 16 weeks from feverfew supplements with CO <sub>2 </sub> extracted .\n\n【15】However, the adult dose of parthenolide was 0.2 - 0.6 mg for migraine prophylaxis. According to clinical trials, the beneficial effects of Tanacetum parthenium for migraine prophylaxis can be seen within 4 - 6 weeks of initiating therapy. The duration of treatment will vary for individual migraine sufferers .\n\n【16】In 2004, a systemic review published in the Cochrane database assessed the evidence against the efficacy of feverfew for preventing migraine and found that the efficacy of feverfew could not be established .\n\n【17】Moreover, we used the Naranjo algorithm. It is the most commonly used tool to assess adverse drug reaction causality. This algorithm has ten simple questions. The questions involve the following areas: the temporal relationship, the pattern of response, dechallenge or administration of an antagonist, rechallenge, alternative causes, placebo response, drug level in the body fluids or tissue, dose-response relationship, previous patient experience with the drug, and confirmation by any other objective evidence. The answer to each question is then assigned a score. A score of 9 or greater means that an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is highly probable, a score of 5 to 8 means that an ADR is probable, a score of 1 to 4 means that an ADR is possible, and a score of zero or less means that an ADR is unlikely . We applied this algorithm in our case. The causality rating for feverfew fell within the range of 5 - 8, which indicates a probable ADR. A probable ADR means the event had a plausible time relationship with feverfew intake, and the response to withdrawal (dechallenge) was clinically reasonable with an unknown rechallenge .\n\n【18】In our case, a positive dechallenge refers to the adverse drug reaction disappearing after stopping feverfew use, and the patient coagulation profile was improved after 4 months. According to the patient history, physical examination and laboratory investigations, we excluded all possible and alternative causes that could induce vaginal bleeding, e.g. pelvic infections, endometritis and hyperplasia or abnormalities in uterine structure.\n\n【19】In addition, the patient did not take any hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives, and these medications can alter coagulation factors. However, a study showed that factor VII and X levels and fibrinogen were significantly increased in patients treated with combined oral contraceptive pills, where the extent of elevation varied depending on the estrogen-progesterone components .\n\n【20】During feverfew therapy, the patient took only a combination tablet of paracetamol with caffeine. Paracetamol has scarce inhibition of peripheral cyclooxygenase; it is only a weak inhibitor of platelet aggregation and does not alter the bleeding time . One study did not find an effect of abstinence from caffeine on blood clot lysis time, whereas the effects of caffeine intake on platelet activity are more variable .\n\n【21】The vaginal bleeding induced by feverfew in this case may be related to inhibiting ADP, thrombin, and the collagen-induced aggregation of platelets by interfering with cellular phospholipases, preventing the release of arachidonic acid and inhibiting the release of serotonin from platelets . Feverfew should be used cautiously by patients planning elective surgery or taking parenteral or oral anticoagulants .\n\n【22】In our case, the patient received feverfew 800 mg twice daily for 6 months and then increased to 800 mg three times daily. The severity of vaginal bleeding may be related to an increase in the frequency of feverfew and the prolonged duration of use. The treating doctor prescribed medroxyprogesterone to control bleeding and corrected hemoglobin levels with iron supplementation.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】The efficacy of feverfew for preventing migraine has still not been established. Any patient on Tanacetum parthenium should be monitored for blood coagulation factors, and it should be used cautiously by patients planning elective surgery, taking antithrombotic drugs or having coagulant disease. Patients should be advised to taper then discontinue feverfew completely at least 2 - 3 weeks before surgery. The Naranjo scale indicates that a probable relationship exists between feverfew, vaginal bleeding and alterations of coagulation test results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5ebe3d17-d200-4f17-b855-4488d3bb56cf", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Congenital hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors with low incidence rate. They grow in utero and reach full growth at birth. On the other hand, infantile hemangiomas are more common and appear after birth . Congenital hemangiomas appear in the head or limbs more often than in other locations in affected infants. They can be classified into two types based on the course of progression: rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma (RICH) and non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH). Their sizes vary from a few centimeters to more than 10 cm, and they are typically solitary although multifocal lesions have been reported . RICH involutes completely by the age of 14 months whereas NICH never regresses, but grows in proportion with the child size and may eventually require excision .\n\n【2】Another uncommon congenital anomaly is natal teeth. Depending on the time of appearance in the oral cavity, teeth that are present at birth are called natal teeth, while teeth that erupt within the first 30 days from birth are called neonatal teeth . The lower central incisor in the mandibular region is the most frequent location for both natal and neonatal teeth. Natal teeth are multifactorial disorder with some defined genetic components. They have been reported in association with different disorders such as Ellis-van Creveld, Soto, Pierre Robin and Hallerman-Streiff syndromes . In our intensive literature search, we did not find any record of natal teeth in association with RICH, and our personal communications with some pediatricians did not confirm the association between these two entities together due to the sporadic occurrence of RICH. Therefore, we think that this association is rare but worth reporting because it remains unclear whether this is in fact an association or a mere coincidence.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】This is a case report of a Hispanic newborn girl that was diagnosed with RICH associated with two incisors natal teeth . Birth was spontaneous vaginal without complications. Amniotic fluid was stained with meconium. Apgars were 9/9 at 1/5 min. Exam after delivery revealed a 7.5 × 5.5 cm grayish telangiectatic tumor on the outer upper right thigh. There was a small, roughly circular erosion centrally with surrounding pink scarring; a large feeder artery at 12 o’clock was noticed. Two firmly fixed lower incisor teeth were present, compatible with natal teeth. The scalp, face, neck, chest, back, axillae, abdomen, groin, external genitalia, buttocks, bilateral upper and lower extremities including the hands and feet were normal. The differential diagnosis of the hemangioma was RICH, NICH or arteriovenous malformation. A dermatology referral was made. The patient was prescribed mupirocin ointment on a non-stick gauze and dressing twice daily . The newborn screen and CBC were normal. Her teeth were not loose and as they did not interfere with feeding, no intervention was carried out. In the following weeks, close observation showed the lesion to be involuting centrally and peripherally . The central erosion was fading , and thus the hemangioma was categorized as RICH. Mupirocin was stopped after 6 weeks.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The precise incidence of congenital hemangiomas is unknown. In a prospective study of 594 infants born in Mary Birch Hospital for Women in San Diego, 29 infants out of 594 were identified with hemangiomas. Two out of the 29 had congenital hemangiomas subtype (0.3%) and 27 infants had infantile hemangiomas (4.5%) . Most cutaneous hemangiomas follow a benign course without any complications and they often require no intervention. Some lesions may ulcerate, bleed or leave a scar. Other complications include pyogenic granuloma-like growth , a life threatening hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia . Although most hemangiomas are isolated anomalies, several studies have reported that hemangiomas may run in families as an autosomal dominant trait suggesting the involvement of causative genetic factors . Genetic mutations have been identified in the inherited forms of vascular anomalies but they have not been replicated in other independent studies .\n\n【7】In contrast, the incidence of natal and neonatal teeth is 1:2,000 - 1:3,500 in European and Asian population, respectively . There is controversy concerning the sex distribution; some studies reported more females affected than males . An example is the study by Barfiwala et al which found 35 out of 50 cases were in females . Occasionally, natal teeth are associated with complications such as Riga-Fede disease in which an oral ulceration manifests itself on the ventral surface of the tongue or on the inner surface of the lower lip . It is caused by trauma to the soft tissue from erupted teeth. Another morbidity associated with natal teeth is ingestion or aspiration of the teeth if they are loose. Feeding difficulties can occur with injury to the mother’s breast.\n\n【8】A retrospective study by Moura et al on 23 children with natal or neonatal teeth showed that most cases were natal teeth (83%) and presented a mild degree of mobility (64%). Only two patients had breast-feeding difficulties (9%). Tooth maintenance was the most common treatment of choice (64%), and only two patients with Riga-Fede disease presented with oral ulceration (9%) . The treatment of the natal and neonatal teeth is usually guided towards avoiding the possible complications. Observation and extraction are the main options. Extraction should be done only if the teeth are loose or if they cause feeding difficulties for the mother or the infant.\n\n【9】In conclusion, this report is the first to document the co-occurrence of natal teeth with a congenital hemangioma. While it appears to be unique, further reports could shed light on frequency and on the contribution of possible genetic factors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "97b2fbe4-4be8-489d-9839-4a79acec3a15", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, specifically t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), which rearranges the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 ( ABL1 ) and breakpoint cluster region ( BCR ) genes . In 2016, there were estimated 54,226 people with CML in the USA . The estimated number of new cases for 2019 in the USA is 8,990 . The course of CML can be divided in three phases: chronic, accelerated or blast phase . Most patients being diagnosed are in the chronic phase.\n\n【2】The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy changed the landscape of this disease. Long-term outcomes of imatinib-treated patients in the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) showed an overall survival rate of 83.3% at 10 years . Achieving an optimal response requires BCR-ABL transcripts level ≤ 10% at 3 months, ≤ 1% at 6 months, ≤ 0.1% at 1 year, and ≤ 0.01% onwards . Resistance-associated mutations will develop in more than 30% of CML patients treated with TKI . Most known resistance-associated mutations are simple point mutations that take place in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain and result in ineffective drug binding . Next-generation sequencing has allowed detection of leukemia-associated mutations in patients with TKI resistance in the absence of kinase domain mutations. For example, mutations in DNMT3A and ASXL1 could lead to TKI resistance . Mutation mechanisms independent of BCR-ABL1 are more likely seen in primary resistance .\n\n【3】High-complexity scenarios like molecular diagnostic issues, primary refractory CML, and emergence of TKI resistance-associated mutations frequently pose therapeutic challenges. In this article, we will discuss some of these clinical scenarios using a case-based approach.\n\n【4】Case Reports\n\n【5】Case 1: primary imatinib resistance in P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML\n\n【6】A 71-year-old male presented to our practice in November 2017 for incidental finding of persistent leukocytosis on laboratory studies. His complete blood count (CBC) showed a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 22.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.9 g/dL, and platelets of 114 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 4% myelocytes and 2% metamyelocytes. A diagnostic bone marrow performed in January 2018 showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (almost 100% cellularity) characterized by marked granulocytic hyperplasia consistent with a diagnosis of CML. Cytogenetics showed abnormal male karyotype with loss of Y chromosome and t(9;22) detected in all cells examined. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 on peripheral blood and marrow identified presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript e1a2 involving minor  breakpoint. He was started on imatinib in mid-January 2018. He achieved a complete hematological response soon after initiation of TKI therapy, but his BCR-ABL transcript levels over the following 6 months raised concerns for TKI-resistant disease. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis did not show any resistance-associated mutations. He was switched to the second generation TKI therapy with dasatinib in June 2018. BCR-ABL1 transcripts level by qRT-PCR on peripheral blood was 61.726% by international scale (IS) prior to dasatinib. Follow-up result in October 2018 was 17.046% by IS, with a log reduction of 0.706. There was response to dasatinib noted at 3 months with more than 50% decrease from baseline levels . Although he was still above the desired 10% mark, we decided to continue treatment and revaluate again in 3 months. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up after that office visit.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】CML with isolated BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript e1a2 involving minor  breakpoint is extremely rare. In a MD Anderson Cancer Center study, P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML represented only 1% of patients with CML and it was associated with an inferior outcome to therapy with TKI . P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML is often associated with peripheral monocytosis, absence of splenomegaly and bone marrow morphologic features that are intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) . It has also been associated with frequent additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A recent study presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology meeting recommended P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML to be considered as a high-risk group. The authors from Helsinki University demonstrated that p190 activates specific cancer pathways, notably Src signaling and interferon pathways . Management of these patients requires strict TKI response monitoring and early consideration of stem cell transplant in eligible patients. Frontline use of the second generation TKI in patients with P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML should be strongly considered.\n\n【9】Case 2: primary imatinib resistance with ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations\n\n【10】A 37-year-old African American male was initially admitted to our center for persistent headache and fatigue. His CBC showed WBC of 323 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 6.7 g/dL, and platelets of 1,120 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 28% myelocytes and 4% blasts. He underwent a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy in September 2017 which showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (100% cellularity) with myeloid hyperplasia and increased atypical megakaryocytes. Chromosome analysis showed 46XY karyotype with translocation (9;22). BCR-ABL by qRT-PCR was detected at 42.369% by IS involving the major break point . Molecular profiling showed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. He was started on imatinib at time of hospitalization. He achieved a complete hematological response with imatinib, but no molecular response. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis was done in January 2018 with no mutations detected. He was then switched to dasatinib 100 mg daily in May 2018 with eventual dose reduction to 70 mg due to grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity with diarrhea. He failed to achieve a molecular response to dasatinib. In January 2019 he was switched to ponatinib and referred for allogeneic stem cell transplant evaluation. BCR-ABL1 transcript level by qRT-PCR prior to initiation of ponatinib was 38.848%. Fluctuating transcript levels were attributed to issues with treatment adherence. Latest qRT-PCR results in December 2019 (11 months after ponatinib initiation) showed a BCR-ABL1 level of 2.350% by IS with a 1.485 log reduction .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Patients with CML diagnosed in the chronic phase can be triaged into initial TKI treatment choice based upon prognostic scoring systems, such as Sokal or European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS), with higher risk patients generally being offered frontline second-generation TKIs . Our patient was high risk based upon the Sokal system, but unfortunately was not a candidate for the second generation TKI due to cost and insurance issues. The patient achieved a complete hematologic response with imatinib but did not show any signs of molecular response with rising BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Primary imatinib failure in chronic phase CML is not an uncommon scenario, and patients in this category may still achieve a response to the second and third generation TKI with a 72% overall survival at 3 years . Our patient was tested for ABL1 kinase mutation and found to be negative, which is seen in about 50% of patients who are non-responders to TKI medications . Next-generation sequencing performed at the time of diagnosis revealed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. It has been previously described that the development of clonal evolution is associated with decrease in both response and overall survival with the use of imatinib . More recently there has been growing evidence that both ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations are associated with TKI resistance and progression to more advanced stages of CML . Next-generation sequencing for common myeloid somatic mutations may be helpful to determine the risk of initial TKI failure in patients with chronic phase CML.\n\n【13】Case 3: primary imatinib resistance with c.1424 35-NT mutation\n\n【14】A 45-year-old female was admitted to our center in June 2017 with hyperleukocytosis. Her initial CBC showed WBC of 334 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 8.7 g/dL and platelets of 268 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 23% myelocytes, 12% metamyelocytes, 3% promyelocytes, and 4% blasts. She underwent a diagnostic bone marrow in June 2017 showing a hypercellular marrow with 100% cellularity. Cytogenetics showed 46XX karyotype with positive t(9;22). The FISH studies confirmed t(9;22). She had some delays in starting treatment due to financial barriers but was eventually started on imatinib 400 mg once a day. She achieved a complete hematological response rapidly. However, she continued to have persistent detection of BCR-ABL mutation at 12.7% with log reduction of 0.773 at 6 months . A mutation analysis was performed showing an ABL kinase domain mutation, specifically a c.1424 35-NT insertion. By the end of January 2018, she was started on bosutinib 500 mg per day. The patient developed significant gastrointestinal toxicity and required a dose reduction to 400 mg per day. She achieved a major molecular response 12 months after bosutinib initiation, which has sustained so far with latest qRT-PCR in July 2019 showing 0.016% by IS with log reduction of 3.571 . The patient continued to have major molecular response after bosutinib dose reduction.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】This case highlights another instance of failure to achieve an adequate response with frontline imatinib. The patient was initially treated with imatinib with an increase in BCR-ABL transcripts nearly two-fold from baseline. A prior study has indicated that two-fold rises in consecutive samples of BCR-ABL transcripts predicts a greater than 60% possibility of identifying a kinase domain mutation . The patient had ABL1 kinase mutation analysis that showed a c.1424 35-NT insertion. Point mutations are generally thought to confer resistance to imatinib therapy and nearly 100 different types have been documented . Interestingly, this patient’s point mutation has conflicting reports as to its contribution to TKI resistance. One group reported that a 35-base pair insertion alters the tyrosine kinase in a manner similar to the T315I mutation . Another group concluded that the 35-NT insertion did not correlate with TKI resistance . The patient was ultimately transitioned to bosutinib with an excellent response achieving a major molecular response (MMR). Our case demonstrates that 35-NT insertions can lead to imatinib resistance and may respond to the second generation TKIs.\n\n【17】Case 4: positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(9;22) with negative RT-PCR for BCR-ABL1\n\n【18】A 72-year-old female initially presented to our center for evaluation of leukocytosis. Her CBC showed WBC of 73 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 12 g/dL and platelets of 464 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 3% myelocytes, 14% metamyelocytes and 1% blasts. The cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood showed an abnormal female karyotype, with t(9;22) on all cells examined. FISH analysis confirmed t(9;22) in 95.5% of analyzed nuclei (normal < 1.5%). BCR-ABL by PCR was negative, including standard p210, p190 testing and non-standard BCR-ABL PCR testing for p230. She was started on the frontline treatment with imatinib in July 2018. She achieved a complete morphologic response but soon after developed grade 3 skin rash and was unable to tolerate imatinib further. She was then switched to dasatinib. FISH analysis on peripheral blood was reported as negative in February 2019 (6 months after initiation of therapy). FISH has remained undetectable since then, except for a one-time low level positive at 2% during a temporary TKI-treatment interruption. She has been reluctant to have a bone marrow biopsy performed from time of initial diagnosis. We have provided frequent education regarding its importance for morphological evaluation, and for the subsequent assessment of cytogenetic response. Most recent peripheral blood FISH in September 2019 remains undetectable.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Peripheral blood studies for detection of t(9;22) or BCR-ABL1 are not considered enough for diagnosis of CML. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required for all patients in whom CML is suspected. It will confirm the diagnosis and provide information needed for staging in terms of the blast and basophil percentages . Our patient was informed in detail of the rationale behind a diagnostic bone marrow examination, but she still refused. To further complicate the situation, although cytogenetics and FISH on peripheral blood were both positive, molecular testing for BCR-ABL1 transcripts by RT-PCR was negative making response assessment challenging. Possible reasons for discordance between FISH and RT-PCR testing were discussed with molecular pathologist. Standard commercial testing included reverse transcription of extracted sample ribonucleic acid (RNA) to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) for BCR-ABL1 fusions e13a2, e14a2  and e1a2 . Additional non-standard testing for e19a2  was also performed. A false-negative PCR result was considered initially, but repeated testing was consistently negative making sampling or procedural errors unlikely. We believe the discordant results in this case could be explained by the presence of an atypical fusion transcript. Rare breakpoints having junction configurations other than e13a2, e14a2, e1a2 or e19a2 have been reported . Management of these cases is challenging, especially when access to advanced molecular testing is limited. Most practices rely on standardized send-out testing using commercially available products. After extensive discussion with the patient, it was agreed to initiate TKI therapy and to monitor using FISH on peripheral blood. For correlative purposes, a complete cytogenetic response was considered equivalent to a negative FISH test (± 2%), given the lack of a marrow examination .\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Upfront treatment with imatinib although attractive from a cost benefit standpoint has limitations for selected patients with unusual BCR-ABL1 transcripts or presence of specific mutations. The second generation TKIs are appropriate in these situations as frontline therapy. Close monitoring, transition to ponatinib if no response to the second generation TKIs and consideration of bone marrow transplant evaluation in eligible patients is recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "bb232445-1da6-4ccb-bad0-0d110d929462", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Measured heart rate variability (HRV) has been documented as a reliable assessment tool for predictive longevity in people with cancer. De Couck et al  examined the relationship of vagal activity, as shown by HRV, in patients with prostate cancer and found that higher initial HRV was significantly correlated with lower risk of mortality.\n\n【2】Fadul et al  described autonomic dysfunction (AD) measured by HRV and its prevalence in advanced cancer. They concluded that AD is associated with reduced longevity in men with advanced cancer.\n\n【3】A relationship has been established where predictable HRV values, suggesting higher vagal nerve activity, are seen in the survival of patients with cancer . De Couck et al  reported that, in people with prostate and non-small cell lung cancer, measuring HRV to determine high vagal activity may be a “routine” measurement that can be considered in estimating prognosis, and that there may be a modulating role of vagal nerve activity in cancer. Women with breast cancer have shown decreased HRV values . Neuroimmunomodulation may play a significant factor in the body’s ability to recover from cancer and promote longevity .\n\n【4】Palma et al  reported on 45 women, aged 35 - 70 years, and showed that “breast cancer survivors regardless of their post-operative period exhibited a decrease in overall variability and both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity when compared to women without the disease” . Using HRV could be a valuable tool for “early diagnosis and better prognosis of autonomic dysfunction, and survival in breast cancer patients” . High HRV values relating to autonomic function can help determine longevity, and in the case of women having gone through breast cancer treatments, their HRV values were decreased .\n\n【5】Chiropractic has been shown to have positive impact on HRV studies . A core aim of chiropractic care is to optimize the health and wellbeing of individuals through the enhancement of nervous system function brought about by reducing nerve interference caused by vertebral subluxation . The World Health Organization similarly defines chiropractic as a health care profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health. There is an emphasis on manual techniques, including joint adjustment and/or manipulation, with a particular focus on subluxations . Vertebral subluxation correction is achieved through chiropractic adjustments that are typically manually performed . Chiropractors commonly use such procedures to influence joint and neurophysiological function . Vertebral subluxations may result in altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity .\n\n【6】The purpose of this paper was to chronicle the salutogenic improvements in HRV in a 43-year-old woman, post breast cancer following a course of chiropractic care focused on vertebral subluxation.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】History\n\n【9】A 43-year-old woman presented with a history of double radical mastectomies, including associated lymph nodes removed following diagnosed with type 1b, stage 3 breast carcinoma. She was diagnosed with a BRCA +1 gene mutation. The mastectomies were performed 12 months prior to presenting for chiropractic care. Following the mastectomies was a 16-week program of chemotherapy, consisting of eight chemotherapy sessions. The chemotherapy formula consisted of adriamycin, cytoxan and taxol. She was primarily sedentary for 8 months during and following the chemotherapy treatments. She reported the classic extremes in fatigue, nausea and indigestion during this time.\n\n【10】The patient’s initial presentation for chiropractic care was approximately 8 months after last chemotherapy treatment. At the time of her presentation, she complained of chronic tiredness, overall aches/pain that were non-focal, abnormal tactile sensation in fingers and toes, decreased sensation to touch and temperature in thorax, and “brain fog”.\n\n【11】Examination\n\n【12】A thorough chiropractic examination was performed, including the examination in posture analysis, spinal assessment incorporating neurological and biomechanical assessment indicators of vertebral subluxation , and HRV as a baseline and outcome assessment.\n\n【13】HRV\n\n【14】HRV was collected using the pulse wave profiler as part of the insight subluxation station. The use of HRV allowed examination of the balance between the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. “HRV consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called IBIs. A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis” .\n\n【15】An effective numerical analysis of the HRV graphs was performed using the Sd IBI (ms). The Sd IBI is the standard deviation of the IBI in milliseconds, which measures the specific changes in time between successive heartbeats. The time between beats is called an “R-R interval”, or an “IBI” . The outcome numbers when higher are considered better, and lower considered less desirable. HRV assessment revealed a strong imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system . The number analysis of the Sd IBI of this patient prior to beginning chiropractic care was 45.42.\n\n【16】A simplified explanation of HRV and vagal tone is that a lower measurement is seen as undesirable, while a higher measurement of vagal tone is seen as more desirable. “Research has found that lowered HRV is associated with aging, and increased incidence of sudden death” .\n\n【17】Chiropractic management and outcomes\n\n【18】The patient followed a care plan of 44 visits over 8 months. To determine the site of vertebral subluxation, the Thompson protocol was used . Thompson technique is a full spine adjusting technique that focuses on the cervical spine and pelvis, and emphasizes high-velocity low-amplitude, and low-force procedures using a weighted drop table. The specific protocol allows the chiropractor to know “where to begin and what specific area to adjust” . The technique had to be modified in adaptation of the patient’s physical state.\n\n【19】HRV was the primary examination tool used to objectively evaluate vagal tone and progress of the patient. HRV assessment was performed on the patient four times after the initiation of chiropractic care at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months and showed sustained improvement. The number analysis of the Sd IBI of this patient improved from an initial calculation of 45.42, and progressed to 128.58. The higher the number recorded, the better the vagal tone. The number analysis of the Sd IBIs at each assessment interval was 74.05 (4 weeks), 124.42 (6 weeks), 114.43 (3 months) and 128.58 (6 months) .\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】A 43-year-old woman who followed a protocol for breast cancer treatment presented for chiropractic care with a wide range of neurological, postural and orthopedic signs and symptoms. A course of chiropractic care was associated with sustained improvement in HRV assessments.\n\n【22】Studies show that HRV of women post breast cancer is dramatically low, even with following appropriate protocols . It is known that low vagal activity is a predictor of onset and progression of diseases such as cancer, and that this is reason to activate the vagus nerve by therapeutic intervention . Chiropractic care has been shown to improve HRV, and therefore should be considered as an intervention . Studies show that “biomechanical changes caused by spinal manipulation are thought to have physiological consequences by means of their effects on the inflow of sensory information to the central nervous system” . This effect on the central nervous system has the opportunity for systemic improvement. “Spinal manipulation is a therapeutic technique used by manual therapists which may have widespread neuro-physiological effects” .\n\n【23】The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which includes chiropractic care, is increasing with cancer patients . The use of chiropractic in the care of cancer patients is, however, scant with one study describing the use of CAM at a cancer center . The focus of the research found in PubMed relating to “chiropractic” and “cancer” related to musculoskeletal pain associated with the cancer . No studies were found relating to “chiropractic” and “cancer” and “HRV” suggesting the novel approach investigated in the current study.\n\n【24】Winn et al  showed ANS responses via HRV when manipulating either the upper cervical spine (C1 and C2), or lower (C6 and C7) segments. Driscoll et al  showed the chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) improved autonomic function assessed using electrocardiogram and arterial tonometry. Roy et al  used HRV to evaluate the parasympathetic nervous system and found change after a single session of chiropractic care.\n\n【25】A number of recent studies have documented an association between chiropractic care and positive changes in HRV values. Knowles et al  reported a retrospective study of 46 patients evaluated with HRV while undergoing a program of care using network spinal analysis, showing it “may be an effective method for people to improve their ANS function through adjustments of vertebral subluxation, reorganizing spinal tension patterns and decreasing physiological stress” . Haas and Russell  reported sustained improvement in HRV was seen up to 2 years when patients underwent chiropractic care. Zhang et al  concluded in their study “…HRV and visual analog scale (VAS) changed in patients as a result of chiropractic care”. Hart  concluded HRV measures demonstrate chiropractic improved neurological function and adaptability. The positive changes documented in the current case reflect those previously reported . To our knowledge, no prior studies demonstrate improved HRV in post breast cancer patients receiving chiropractic care, highlighting that further research is needed to investigate the role that chiropractors may play in assisting similar patient populations so as to inform clinical practice and future higher-level research designs.\n\n【26】Limitations\n\n【27】This is a single case report. Due to the inherent limitations, being an isolated case not controlled for external factors and natural progression, the findings cannot be generalized or causation of vertebral subluxation implied. To further gauge the effectiveness of chiropractic care for a homogeneous population, further studies are needed.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】A course of chiropractic care focused on the assessment and correction of vertebral subluxation was associated with a salutogenic response in a woman post breast cancer, as measured via HRV.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "50857e13-7733-45b7-8d3b-517b2a36a480", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Coronary artery anomalies are very rare disorders, accounting for only 1.3% of the patients, undergoing diagnostic investigations. In Yamanaka’s report, right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the left coronary cusp was noted in 0.17% of coronary angiographies, while left coronary artery (LCA) from the right coronary cusp was seen in 0.047% .\n\n【2】We report a case of aberrant origin of RCA having a malignant course causing ischemia, left ventricle (LV) showing apical non-compaction as well and later on developing ischemic stroke. This course of the disease, to best of our knowledge, has never been reported in literature before.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 57 years old man, diabetic and hypertensive, presented with chest pain of 4 days duration. The pain was of ischemic in nature. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-T changes in inferior leads. He was managed on the lines of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and coronary angiography (CA) was planned. The left main (LM) was normal with mild irregularities in left anterior descending artery (LAD) and normal non-dominant left circumflex (LCX). Surprisingly the injection in left system showed an aberrant vessel originating from the left cusp which was anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA). This was then selectively engaged with the help of XB guide and a BMW wire showing a mega dominant RCA with moderate ostial stenosis .\n\n【5】Multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCT) was done then to rule out the inter-arterial course of the vessel, which confirmed it . The LV function was depressed, with ejection fraction (EF) 39% showing mid apical non-compaction .\n\n【6】He was referred to cardiac surgeon for surgery who advised stress test. Stress test  showed dilated LV with segmental myocardial infarctions (MI) involving apex, apical 1/2 of inferior wall, apical septum, mid anterior wall and apical lateral wall. Partial thickness MI of basal inferior wall, infero-lateral part, basal and apical segments of anterior wall and reduced EF were found.\n\n【7】He was then planned to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), as evidence of ischemia was there and the patient was still complaining of ischemic pain. His bilateral carotid Doppler was normal. The patient, while waiting for surgery, developed non-hemorrhagic stroke and right sided body weakness. His immediate computed tomography (CT) scan of brain was unremarkable but after 48 h, it showed a large infarct with hemorrhagic transformation within it. He needed ventilator support, was shifted back to the ward after 1 week, followed by discharge in a stable condition. The CABG was subsequently deferred and the patient is currently being managed on intensive medical therapy.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus is a very rare condition reported to be 1.3% by Yamanaka’s report  and 1.07% in P. Angelini’s group study respectively .\n\n【10】This anomalous origin mainly involves RCA, as a study shown by Garg that, 15 out of 4,100 patients (0.37%) had abnormal origin of RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva, but only one patient (0.02%) had LCA from the right sinus . Although its prevalence is low, but the consequences can be dire ranging from myocardial ischemia to syncope and arrhythmias; but the most dreadful condition that it leads to is sudden cardiac death . In an autopsy report, the mortality percentage of anomalous RCA arising from left sinus was found to be 57% as compared to be 25% of the anomalous vessel arising from right sinus .\n\n【11】The condition may have severe consequences, so its diagnosis should be made accurately. There are several methods to evaluate ARCA including echocardiography (ECHO), angiography, MDCT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Transthoracic ECHO is poor in diagnosing this anomaly but transesophageal ECHO provides much better information . Non-invasive tools like MDCT  and MRI  are investigations of choice. When MDCT is combined with stress myocardial perfusion scan, the yield of diagnosing the anomaly gets much enhanced .\n\n【12】The LV function, shown by both MDCT and stress test was depressed confirming obstruction at some part in the RCA causing infarction. There have been proposed many mechanisms of causation of ischemia in this type of vessel like, slit like RCA ostium in aortic wall, acute angulation of the vessel, unusual angle of take-off, tortuous proximal vessel leading to extended atherosclerotic process and lipid accumulation . In our case, the vessel was taking interarterial course, i.e. between aorta and pulmonary artery and the pulsations of these big vessels may render that critical part of RCA to episodic occlusion causing ischemia as well as the moderate ostial lesion.\n\n【13】The incidence of stroke after myocardial infarction (MI) is high. A study, by Witt and colleagues in 2005  showed a 44-fold rise within 30 days after MI; and even after 3 years it remained two to three times high. Another study showed a short-term incidence of 3.0 to 5.2 percent of stroke  while the 5-year incidence was shown to be 8.1 percent . Although the incidence of stroke is more in anterior wall MI but the major determinant for thrombus formation leading to embolic stroke is the low ejection fraction  , severe apical-wall-motion abnormality  as its absence in both anterior and inferior infarction makes the patient a low risk for stroke. Our patient had both the low ejection fraction and apical wall motion abnormality, so it’s a strong suspicion that he formed a thrombus in left ventricle which later embolized the vessels leading to stroke. Another possibility is that our patient was diagnosed having apical non-compaction which is a potential cause for systolic embolic events .\n\n【14】The prevalence of non-compaction of LV in adults is only about 0.014%  but more recent studies have found its increase prevalence to about 0.25 to 5 % in varying populations . The occurrence of aberrant RCA with LV non-compaction has not yet been reported in literature to our knowledge, so it’s a unique case.\n\n【15】Revascularization in the form of CABG is recommended (class IA) for documented coronary ischemia in the setting of an anomalous RCA coursing between aorta and pulmonary arteries by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for congenital heart diseases .\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】This is a rare case of association of anomalous RCA from left coronary cusp (LCC) with apical non-compaction of LV. The condition may remain asymptomatic but it can lead to devastating conditions like myocardial ischemia, syncope and even sudden cardiac death, so proper and urgent evaluation followed by swift management is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "7efa80b2-df54-4d06-83e4-8208dd4c7980", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant neoplasm that typically arises in the salivary glands. It is a rare epithelial tumor that accounts for 10% of all salivary tumors and 1-2% of malignant tumors of the head and neck . Notably, it may also arise in the breast, digestive tract or lungs. Instances in which ACC is classified as a primary lung tumor are rare, accounting for only 0.04-0.2% of all primary lung tumors . Previously, primary ACC of the lungs was referred to as a benign glandular neoplasm. However today, it is regarded as a low-grade bronchial carcinoma, due to its origin from the bronchial glands, and is a slow-growing, low-grade malignancy.\n\n【2】Primary ACC of the lung presents differently than other primary lung malignancies. In terms of demographic characteristics, primary ACC of the lung tends to occur in the younger patient population, affecting males and females equally. Since it is a rare occurrence, most information describing the correlation of smoking to development of primary ACC of the lungs is collected through case studies. These studies suggest that smoking may not be associated with its etiology, unlike other lung cancers such as small cell or squamous. The severity of symptoms differs from patient to patient, but the most common presentations include cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath. As a result, many patients’ risk was misdiagnosed with asthma or bronchitis. Additionally, some patients remain asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally after completing imaging for another ailment .\n\n【3】Metastasis of primary ACC of the lung to distant sites such as the kidney and liver is relatively uncommon, and is only accounted for by a small number of cases published in literature. Hematoxylin-eosin staining remains the principal method for diagnosing ACC of the lung, and yet it can be misdiagnosed as carcinoid or adenocarcinoma in nature. As a result, immunohistochemistry is an important tool that helps guide histological diagnosis . We present a case of a 51-year-old male who was diagnosed with primary ACC of the lung through hematoxylin-eosin staining after being admitted for complaints of weight loss and cough.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 51-year-old male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to the emergency department on request of his primary care physician due to abnormal outpatient imaging findings on computed tomography (CT) scan. For the past 8 months, the patient has had symptoms of cough, dyspnea on exertion, lightheadedness, and significant weight loss. The cough is productive with clear-white sputum, occasionally having traces of bright red blood. Due to the worsening of dyspnea and cough upon exertion, the patient has difficulties carrying out daily tasks. The patient was prescribed an albuterol inhaler due to cough and shortness of breath. However, since the medication did not alleviate symptoms, the patient discontinued use of the inhaler. In the past 8 months, the patient endorsed about 20 pounds of unintentional weight loss. For the past year, the patient also reports feeling feverish, with profuse night sweats requiring constant change of clothing and bedsheets. He also reports lower back pain on both sides that has progressively worsened since the onset, 8 months ago. Within the last year, he has been treated for pneumonia and completed a course of antibiotics. Past surgical history is significant for a left leg open reduction and internal fixation and chest tube placement in 1998 due to a motor vehicle accident. He is a previous smoker of one pack every 2 days for 15 - 20 years and stopped 5 years prior. He used to drink alcohol every day for the past 10 years and decreased the frequency 5 years ago. The patient has worked in the automotive industry since the age of 15 and endorsed frequent exposure to multiple chemicals and gas. Otherwise, the patient denied headache, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or changes in his urination or bowel movements.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】In the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, body mass index of 19, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He did not appear to be in any acute distress and did not have labored breathing. Physical exam was only significant for decreased breath sounds on auscultation of the full posterior right lung field. There were no crackles, wheezing, or rhonchi appreciated on anterior and posterior lung auscultation. Mild pain was endorsed on superficial palpation of the lower back bilaterally. Lab work showed a leukocytosis of 10,800 µL with no other significant results. A chest X-ray, presented as Figure 1 , was completed and showed complete opacification of the right hemithorax with a rightward mediastinal shift, and mild irregularity of the right mainstem bronchus. Further evaluation with a CT of the chest with contrast was ordered, shown in Figures 2 \\- 4 . This was significant for complete collapse of the right lung, an ill-defined hypoattenuation in the right upper lobe measuring 6.1 × 5.3 cm ascending into the right mainstem bronchus, concerning for neoplasm. There was a small right pleural effusion and an additional 1.3 cm nodule at the left lung base. Prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes, a large subcarinal lymph node measuring 2.4 × 1.4 cm, and scattered calcified mediastinal lymph nodes were also found. In the upper abdomen, a hypodense hepatic lesion measuring 5.2 × 3.8 cm with an additional 1.3 cm lesion was found in the superior right hepatic lobe. There were multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, one measuring 2.9 cm in the right anterior interpolar region and a 1.6 cm lesion in the left upper pole. Due to these concerning findings, the patient was admitted to the medical floor. Thoracic surgery, oncology, and pulmonology were consulted.\n\n【9】A plan for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast was ordered due to the patient’s symptoms of lightheadedness and to rule out any brain involvement. A nuclear medicine (NM) bone scan was ordered to assess for any bone involvement, and a further plan for an ultrasound (US) thoracentesis and YAG laser bronchoscopy was made. The MRI of the brain was negative with no abnormal findings, and the NM bone scan showed no focal suspicious osseous uptake to suggest metastatic disease. The US thoracentesis was not completed due to an inadequate amount of fluid for a safe procedure, thus the patient was taken for the YAG laser bronchoscopy with biopsy. He was found to have a bulky tumor with complete obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus and biopsies were taken. Despite removing/lasering 3.5 cm of tumor, the airway still remained closed and a repeat rigid bronchoscopy with laser was planned. The patient tolerated repeat procedure well, and post-operative chest X-ray showed mild improved aeration in the right lung.\n\n【10】Pathology results from the biopsy of the mass were diagnostic for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lung, depicted in Figures 5 \\- 7 . Due to the liver and bilateral renal nodules noted on imaging, a CT-guided liver biopsy was planned to determine if this is metastatic disease. Biopsy results confirmed that the liver nodules were also adenoid cystic carcinoma, thus confirming metastasis.\n\n【11】Treatment and follow-up\n\n【12】With the exception of moderate cough and mild throat pain, the patient recovered well from bronchoscopy and was deemed stable for discharge from a medical standpoint. He followed up with a multimodal outpatient cancer clinic and due to progressive metastatic disease and worsening symptoms, received 5 days of radiation followed by four rounds of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and cisplatin (CAP).\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】This case presents a patient with ACC, a salivary gland tumor that originated in the lung with subsequent metastasis to the liver and bilateral kidneys. ACC is an uncommon malignancy, representing approximately 1-2% of all cases of head and neck cancer and about 10% of all salivary neoplasms. ACC may also occur as a primary lung tumor, as presented in this case. It is considered malignant and arises centrally, specifically in the tracheobronchial glands in the airway submucosa. Previous studies reported that primary lung lesions were typically located in the trachea, main bronchus, or truncus intermedius, although some were found below the lobar bronchus or pulmonary parenchyma. Reportedly, it has a morphology that is similar to ACC that originates in the salivary glands .\n\n【15】In general, ACC is characterized by slow growth and perineural invasion, with distant dissemination being less likely. Although it tends to remain local, late recurrence after treatment is seen. For instance, one case study reported a 78-year-old male who presented with ACC that metastasized to his colon 19 years after the primary tumor was resected . Due to the wide variability in site of metastasis and time following remission, serial abdominal imaging for recurrence may be beneficial.\n\n【16】Metastasis of ACC, particularly originating in the lung, is rare but is associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality . In one study, only eight out of 34 participants with primary ACC of the lung had metastasis to other distant sites and were deemed as the non-operable group when considering treatment options. Of the eight, only one participant had metastasis to the kidney and two had metastasis to the liver such as presented in our case. Follow-up in this study showed that metastasis is associated with worse prognosis, to which patients eventually succumbed .\n\n【17】An additional case study reported a similar scenario as the case presented here. Namely, the patient was a 70-year-old male who had primary ACC of the lung and underwent treatment with right pneumonectomy and radiotherapy. Three years after initial presentation, he returned with symptoms of right flank pain and hematuria. MRI revealed solid renal lesions of which the largest was biopsied and found to be morphologically similar to his previous lung ACC, thus confirming renal metastasis. The patient was managed with a right nephrectomy and during follow-up 6 months later, the patient was alive and without disease . To date, there have been only 11 instances in which this has occurred in the English literature.\n\n【18】Due to the indolent nature of ACC and the lack of effective treatment options, watchful waiting is typically recommended in asymptomatic individuals with stable disease. In individuals who are symptomatic, have progressing disease, or who are good surgical candidates, treatment is recommended. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment in primary ACC of the lung, in which the tumor is resectable. Particularly, a tracheobronchoplasty may be indicated since the tumor often arises centrally. Although it is common for resected margins to be positive due to widespread invasion along the airway, radiosensitivity is high and therefore postoperative radiotherapy may be a useful component in treatment.\n\n【19】Although the mainstay of medical therapy for advanced disease is still under debate, first-line treatment is often systemic chemotherapy. Current regimens include CAP as well as 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Overall effectiveness and tolerability of these regimens is unclear . A phase II clinical trial looking at 22 individuals with advanced salivary gland carcinomas, of which 12 had ACC, showed an adjuvant CAP response rate of 27% . With genomic studies of ACC identifying that the MYB-NFIB fusion gene is present in 70% of cases, focus is now shifting to use of immunotherapy . Unfortunately, in our case this gene was not able to be assessed. Additionally, recent case studies have found that ACC of the lungs may show partial response to targeted therapies such as imatinib due to the expression of c-KIT . Further studies should be done to determine efficacy of these targeted therapies.\n\n【20】This case highlights the rarity of primary lung ACC with distant metastasis and reviews the suggested workup for diagnosis along with treatment and surveillance. Although there is no definitive therapy recommended, chemotherapy and surgical resection remain the mainstay of treatment. Despite its infrequent diagnosis, ACC may not present with symptoms until the disease has progressed. Individuals affected may be treated for other conditions such as asthma or bronchitis since initial symptoms may be non-specific and overlooked. Thus, it is necessary to follow up with patients who have continued worsening symptoms and consider imaging for further evaluation.\n\n【21】Learning points\n\n【22】ACC is a rare tumor, accounting for only 1-2% of head and neck cancers, characterized by slow growth, local invasion, and delayed distant metastasis. Due to its indolent course, treatment is usually deferred while asymptomatic or in cases of stable disease, instead opting for regular monitoring. Typically, ACC metastases spread hematogenously to the lung or bones, but can also be seen in the liver, kidney, and colon. A retrospective study of 94 patients with ACC of the head and neck showed treatment failure in 67% of patients with 40% of those patients developing distant metastasis, 27% undergoing locoregional recurrence, and 33% developing both distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence . Further, 95% of the individuals who developed pulmonary metastasis had no symptoms at the time of discovery . Due to the unpredictable nature of ACC and the high incidence of recurrence, lifelong monitoring with imaging is prudent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It may be difficult to differentiate a primary gastric cancer from secondary based on clinical, endoscopic, radiological and histopathological findings . However, the differentiation is very important in order to manage these patients to avoid over-treatment. Most series report a greater tendency for lobular carcinoma to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract . In this report, we described a case of breast cancer metastasis to the stomach, which was initially diagnosed and treated as primary gastric cancer, and subsequently diagnosed as a metastatic spread of breast origin after pathological evaluation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A fifty-year-old postmenopausal woman was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of weight loss and epigastric pain. Physical examination revealed no abnormality except for cachexia. Laboratory tests including hemogram, biochemical parameters and tumor markers were unremarkable. She was initally investigated with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (GE). GE demonstrated diffuse hyperemic nodules in the mucosa of the greater curvature and the corpus posterior wall. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the biopsy specimens revealed diffuse carcinoma with signet-ring type. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickened gastric wall . Based on these findings total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy reconstrcuction was performed. Histopathology after surgery revealed involvement of the stomach by a malignant neoplasm composed of diffuse infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa . Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CK 7, GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein-15), ER and PR, where as negative for CK 20.\n\n【4】Due to the suspicion of breast origin, mammography and breast USG was performed. Mammography revealed microcalcificiations in the upper outer quadrant with no mass in left breast of patient while USG showed a solid nodule measuring 18 mm × 13 mm. The contralateral breast was normal and both axillary was impalpable with nodes. The mass was non-palpable so a USG-guided tru-cut biopsy of the lesion was done, which revealed infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Finally, the patient was evaluated as metastatic breast cancer masquerading as primary gastric cancer and therefore simple mastectomy was performed and the patient was referred to medical oncology for adjuvant therapy.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】It has been known that gastric metastasis from breast cancer are rare entities that are usually found after the diagnosis or treatment of the primary tumor. It is very rare to determinate such kind of metastasis in the absence of known primary breast cancer. In this report we presented a case of gastric metastasis from asymptomatic breast cancer admitted to our clinic with the complaints of weight loss and epigastric pain.\n\n【7】Primary and metastatic cancers of the stomach usually presents similiarly with non-specific symptoms of anorexia, vomiting, epigastric pain and/or haemorrhage . These non-specific symptomatolgoy can usually delay the diagnosis as seen in our case. Endoscopic, radiological and histological assessments are usually unhelpful to discriminate between primary gastric cancer and breast cancer metastasis to the stomach. Since metastatic gastric infiltration is frequently limited to the submucosa and seromuscular layer, endoscopic evaluation may be normal in 50% of cases or only show discrete mucosal abnormalities such as nodular and polypoid or ulcerated lesions indistinguishable from other tumors or benign disease . In their review of the literature from 1943 to June 2012, Massimo et al found that 125 patients has been reported with gastric metastasis from breast cancer including 57 presenting with linitis plastica, 27 with obstruction/stenosis, 12 with ulcer erosion/bleeding, 11 with dyspepsia, 10 with pain as the main symptom, 2 with polypoid lesions, 2 with perforation, and in 4 cases with no symptoms in presentation .\n\n【8】Imaging findings on CT scan or barium studies include encasement of the whole stomach as seen in linitis plastica, multiple lesions of the stomach or extrinsic lesions of the gastric wall. Deep biopsies are needed to obtain representative material and the histological features should be compared with those of the primary breast tumor in order to confirm the diagnosis. Occasionally, lobular breast carcinoma may produce a signet ring morphology which can be confused with a primary gastric adenocarcinoma as in our case . The large number of signet-ring cells combined with a gastric mucosal spreading pattern can compromise the diagnosis, and metastatic disease to the stomach can be almost indistinguishable from primary gastric linitis plastica . Madeya et al reported that 73% of patients with gastric metastases had diffuse intramural infiltration imitating linitis plastica .\n\n【9】Further immunohistochemical studies may be the only reliable method to differentiate between metastatic and primary gastric carcinoma. Metastatic breast carcinoma is usually positive for CK7, GCDFP-15, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ER and PR, and negative for CK20 . Although ER and PR positivity in gastric biopsies suspects breast cancer metastasis to the stomach, it is has been estimated that ER and PR positivity with weak to moderate staining intensity in 32% and 12%, respectively, of patients with primary gastric cancer . ERα can be used to differantiate gastric metastasis from breast cancer as van Velthuysen et al reported that no primary gastric tumor expressed ERα. They also observed that the absence of E-cadherin staining was significantly related to metastatic breast carcinoma . Positive staining with GCDFP-15 has been found to be a sensitive (55-76%) and specific (95-100%) marker for correctly identifying a malignant lesion as metastatic breast carcinoma . The positivity for CK7 and GCDFP-15 including hormone receptor expression of ERα.and PR, and in addition the negativity for CK20 were of great value in accurated diagnosing in the presented case.\n\n【10】Most series report a higher tendency for lobular carcinoma to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract, the gynecological organs and the peritoneum while ductal carcinoma most frequently relapses in the liver, the bones, the lungs and the brain .The reason for this mode of spread has not been clearly identified. Taal et al  reported that 83% of patients with gastric involvement had lobular breast cancer as a primary histological subtype as described in our case.\n\n【11】Reports on treatment of gastric metastasis of breast cancer has varied in literature. Breast cancer metastasis to the stomach represents evidence of systemic disease and the need for systemic therapy . Surgery is usually required to palliate symptoms in the case of obstruction, bleeding and perforation . McLemore et al reported that surgical intervention did not have a significant effect on survival . However, Pectaides et al stated that patients with metastasis only to the gastrointestinal tract who underwent palliative surgical resection tended to have an increased median survival .The overall prognosis at a progressed stage from most of the reported case series is rather poor, with a predicted median survival of only 24 - 36 months from the time of diagnosis .\n\n【12】Contrary to the most previous reports, the patient in this report were initially diagnosed with an apparent primary gastric cancer and therofore this diagnosis was revised to metastatic spread of breast cancer, but only after surgery had been performed.\n\n【13】Conlusion\n\n【14】We remind that metastases to stomach may rarely be the first manifestation of breast cancer metastases. Surgeons should be awake of patients affected by breast cancer who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms. Detailed diagnostic procedures could be required to obtain a conclusive histopathological diagnosis allowing a satisfactory treatment for the patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although HIV patients are twenty times more likely to develop intracranial lymphoma , they may rarely grow other types of intracranial tumors such as meningiomas and gliomas .\n\n【2】Meningiomas represent 33.4% of all primary brain tumors, making them the most common primary brain tumors . The prevalence of meningioma is estimated at approximately 97.5 in 100,000 in the United States with over 138,000 individuals currently diagnosed with this tumor . Meningiomas are more common in women (1:1.4 to 1:2.8 men to women ratio) and reportedly more common in African Americans . Approximately 90% of meningiomas are benign, 5-10% atypical \\[World Health organization (WHO) grade II\\] and less than 2% classified as malignant (WHO grade III, also termed anaplastic) . About 3% of benign meningiomas and 78% of atypical tumors recur in five years . The median time to recurrence for benign lesions is 7.5 and for malignant 3.5 years .\n\n【3】The current case, to our knowledge, would be the seventh case in the literature of a meningioma in an HIV positive patient .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 25-year-old African-American male was admitted because of a recent onset of seizures. He had been HIV positive for seven years and he was not on antiretroviral therapy. His past medical history was insignificant. The neurological exam was normal. On admission, the patient had leukocytosis of 16,000 but no fever. His body mass index (BMI) was 16 (weight 106 pounds). Brain MRI showed a 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.0 cm irregular enhancing mass in the inferior aspect of the left frontal lobe with surrounding large amount of vasogenic edema. The radiologist suggested a differential diagnosis including anaplastic astrocytoma/glioma, lymphoma, metastatic disease and less likely squamous cell carcinoma arising from the adjacent ethmoid sinus. There was also an adjacent 1.3 x 2.6 cm cystic structure in the left frontal lobe which appeared to communicate with the left lateral ventricle frontal horn . This, according to the radiologist, more likely represented an incidental porencephalic cyst rather than a component of the mass.\n\n【6】An infectious disease specialist was consulted for suspected microbiologic etiology. Baseline viral load was less than 50 copies/µl and laboratory tests for toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus and syphilis were negative. Craniotomy was performed and pathology report came with atypical meningioma WHO grade II .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Meningiomas are generally solid tumors but may rarely be associated with cysts resulting in diagnostic difficulties on imaging . In HIV positive patients, not all intracranial cysto-necrotic brain lesions are indicative of an infectious process. They may be a tumor manifestation, including meningiomas. Viral antigens, like HIV tat protein, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of such tumors . These proteins are transcriptional activators that regulate one or more genes by increasing the rate of transcription, It may be that the HIV virus plays an oncogenic role through the occurrence of mutations and especially loss of chromosome 22 on a background of immune deficiency . This case suggests that HIV positive patients may develop higher malignancy meningiomas at an earlier age than in the general population where it occurs usually at age 55 years for atypical meningioma . A previous report by Khurshid et al. 1999 described four HIV patients with meningiomas in which the mean age at diagnosis was 40 . All four patients had solid tumors (meningiomas) and three of them were in advanced HIV stage (AIDS) contrary to our patient. The true prevalence of such cases may be higher than initially thought due to lack of extensive autopsy data on AIDS patients.

{"seq_id": "1e98cf18-17db-4939-914b-6c8c0849e679", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Long duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) without restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is considered an indication of poor outcomes and high mortality. Forty-four percent of patients who undergo CPR in-hospital achieve ROSC and only 17% survive to discharge . Recently there has been increased interest in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the setting of cardiac arrest. Its successful application was reported over 10 years ago, but use in resuscitation of cardiac arrest is still uncommon. The 'Update on Extracorporeal Life Support' of 2004 reported a survival rate of 40% for ECMO-assisted resuscitation, a striking improvement over standard CPR . We report the cardiac arrest and successful ECMO resuscitation of a 66-year-old male.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 66-year-old male presented to a surgical service for elective right inguinal herniorrhaphy. His past history was remarkable for heart transplant one year previous due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Preoperative cardiac evaluation including cardiac catheterization was unremarkable. After an uneventful surgical course under general anesthesia and a localized bupivacaine injection, the patient developed bradycardia progressing to cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and medications and several attempts at electrocardioversion were administered per Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol. These maneuvers proved unsuccessful and the patient remained in a non-perfusing bradydysrhythmia. Transcutaneous and transvenous pacemakers were attempted without evidence of ventricular capture. Chest compressions maintained a systolic blood pressure range of 80 - 110 mmHg.\n\n【4】After 90 minutes, the decision to place the patient on ECMO was made. The patient was given 30,000 units unfractionated heparin via central administration, and ECMO was established utilizing the right femoral artery and vein. The patient showed marked improvement over the next seven hours, converting spontaneously to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient was weaned from ECMO with no findings of neurological deficit and discharged to home on hospital day six.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The decision to engage in emergency CPB or ECMO after prolonged CPR can be a difficult decision to make. Many experienced clinicians fear neurological deficits regardless of eventual return of flow and cardiac stability. However, there is mounting evidence that CPB greatly improves survival versus standard CPR. A review of 387 papers yielded an average of 15-25% of selected patients that suffer a witnessed cardiac arrest and are not responsive to ACLS resuscitation may be successfully resuscitated with CPB . The most important factor for survival appears to be time until onset of mechanical circulatory support. Although there is no set timetable, when mechanical support is initiated within 60 minutes, 47% survival with no major neurologic deficits is obtained. When CPR is extended to 90 minutes, the probability of survival drops to 10% .\n\n【7】The ability to correct the underlying pathology is the determining factor for long-term survival . Pathologies that appear to be most effectively treated with CPB include shock and cardiac arrest secondary to hypothermia and drug toxicity (likely in the above case). Daubin et al. was able to discharge 76.5% of patients presenting with refractory shock or cardiac arrest resulting from acute drug intoxication despite mean CPR duration of 101 \\+ 55 minutes. Of the 17 cases reported, 15 patients had ingested cardiotoxic drugs . Other successful reports using CPB include the setting of shock or cardiac arrest secondary to pulmonary emboli, acute MI, impassable airways, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and iatrogenic complications that occur in the cardiac catheterization laboratory . Common contraindications to CPB include previous irreversible brain damage, terminal malignancy, age greater than 75 years, sepsis, out of hospital cardiac arrest, drowning, and trauma .\n\n【8】There are several complications associated with CPB; the most common are cannulation-related vascular injuries including lower extremity ischemia, dissecting aneurysm, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The inability of CPB to decompress the left ventricle has led to irreversible myocardial injury, significant pulmonary edema, and left ventricular overload leading to left ventricular distention. Inotropic support and percutaneous balloon technology can help reduce the complications related to left ventricular overload, particularly in patients with asystole or ventricular fibrillation . Additionally the frequent requirement of blood products adds some inherent risk to the patient.\n\n【9】There have been several reports of survival of bupivacaine toxicity thanks to the use of CPB . Bupivicaine is a racemic mixture of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers, but its cardiotoxic properties are attributed to the dextrorotatory isomer. Levobupivacaine, a drug containing only the levorotatory molecule of bupivacaine, has been developed for similar anesthetic behavior with reduced cardiotoxicity. Levobupivacaine can be used at higher concentrations than bupivacaine before signs of central nervous system toxicity occur and escalate to cardiovascular toxicity. Furthermore, there is a much higher success rate of CPB in animals that received cardiotoxic doses of levobupivacaine compared to bupivacaine. Therefore, levobupivacaine should be considered when larger doses of anesthetic are required .\n\n【10】Recently lipid emulsion therapy has emerged as a successful method of resuscitating patients with anesthetic overdose. Since the mechanism of action is not fully understood nor a standard protocol established, lipid emulsion is seen as the last resort before initiating CPB. However, failure of lipid rescue in cases of anesthetic cardiotoxicity has not been reported .\n\n【11】In conclusion, emergency cardiopulmonary bypass can increase survival of patients suffering cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest, especially in the setting of drug toxicity. The best outcomes are obtained when CPR is instituted immediately and mechanical support is initiated with little delay. Complications related to CPB can be reduced if measures are instituted immediately to ensure adequate leg perfusion and ventricular unloading.

Currently, phrenic nerve injury following cardiac surgery is probably the most common cause . Other causes include cervical spondylosis , compressive tumors , trauma , herpes zoster , poliomyelitis , pneumonia and others. However many cases of UDP remain idiopathic .\n\n【2】Patients with UDP but without underlying lung disease are usually asymptomatic at rest, however may have dyspnea on effort or while in supine position. An elevated hemi-diaphragm on chest x-ray is suggestive of the diagnosis that can be confirmed with fluoroscopic sniff test with paradoxical movement of the paralyzed hemi-diaphragm with inspiration. Pulmonary function test usually shows reduced vital capacity of 70-80% of predicted normal values. The prognosis of UDP in idiopathic cases is usually fair. Most cases generally lead a normal life and some cases may recover spontaneously.\n\n【3】Here we report a case of UDP following vaccination against polio, Diphtheria, hepatitis A virus and typhus prior to a planned trip to India in a 62-year-old male physician.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Sixty-two year old man, who works as a physician and has controlled diabetes (HgA1C < 6.6), hypertension and gout, received vaccination against polio (IPV- immovax, Aventis, France) given subcutaneously, Diphtheria (dT-immovax, Aventis, France) given intramuscularly and against hepatitis A virus and abdominal typhus (Hepatyrix, GSK, Belgium) given intramuscularly before a planned visit to India, 5 days following the vaccination, patient started to complain of orthopnea and shortness of breath on effort without cough, fever or chest pain. Eventually, the patient traveled to India for one week and came back with the same complains without progression, 3 weeks after the start of symptoms patient was referred to the hospital and admitted for evaluation. His medications included aturvastatin, metformin, doxazocin, allopurinol, amlodipine, vitamin E, and candisartan. On physical examination, while in sitting position, patient was without stress or cyanosis and had breath count of 12 per minute. Jugular venous pressure was normal. Heart sounds normal. Decreased breath sounds at the right lung base and dullness on percussion. The rest of the physical examination was negative. Routine complete blood count and chemistry were normal. Blood gases showed arterial oxygen saturation of 95% in room air, arterial PCO2 of 41 mmHg. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal.\n\n【6】Chest x-ray showed elevated right diaphragm with evidence of no movement on fluoroscopy . Computerized tomography of the neck and chest showed no evidence of tumor but right diaphragm paralysis. Electromyogram (EMG) of the upper extremities was negative for neuropathy or myopathy.\n\n【7】Pulmonary function test showed an abnormal restrictive pattern with FEV1 of 1.52 liters (43% of predicted value), and FVC 2.12 liters (46.7% of predicted value). FEV1: FVC ratio of 71.82%, total lung capacity of 4.42 liters (59.2% of predictive value), and residual volume of 2.07 liters (82.3% of predictive value).\n\n【8】Patient was evaluated by neurologist who found no evidence neuropathy or myopathy of any source.\n\n【9】Follow-up after 3 months without subjective or chest x-ray changes and repeated pulmonary function tests showed no change in volume or flow parameters.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The cause of the UDP in this patient is not clear. The temporal relationship with the vaccination makes the association very suspicious.\n\n【12】There is only a single case report of UDP following immunization in the literature . A 6-month-old female who developed fever and flaccid paralysis of all limbs and right diaphragm following immunization with oral polio and triple (DTP) vaccines. Poliovirus types isolated from her stool matched with the vaccine strains. This case illustrates the development of full blown polio. The polio virus immunization in our patient is a dead virus and there was no evidence of the development of acute infection of polio or other infection in our patient.\n\n【13】There are no reports of diaphragmatic paralysis following Typhus or hepatitis A virus infection. There is one report of diaphragmatic paralysis in a 3-week-old infant following acute infection with diphtheria .\n\n【14】Our patient had diabetes, a disease that could be complicated with neuropathy or myopathy. However, he had no symptoms, sings or EMG findings suggestive of neuropathy. In the literature, there is one report of reversible unilateral right diaphragmatic hemi-paralysis in a 52-year-old female with diabetic neuropathy .\n\n【15】In my opinion, the most likely explanation in our case is a neurological adverse effect affecting the phrenic nerve following vaccination. Neurological adverse effect post vaccination were reported, especially encephalomyelitis following different types of immunization including diphtheria-tetanus-polio and others .

Iatrogenic injury is the most frequent cause, associated with several medical-surgical procedures. There is an increase in its incidence in the last decades in parallel with technological advances in the medical field .\n\n【2】Neurological findings of cerebral air embolism (CAE) are nonspecific and include an altered state of consciousness, seizures, and stroke-like symptoms or may even be clinically silent. Systemic manifestations can also be present, such as respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmia, and cardio-respiratory arrest .\n\n【3】When facing a suspected CAE, an immediate computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for early diagnosis and management, since specific treatment may affect the outcome .\n\n【4】We report four cases of CAE diagnosed by brain CT scan, three after removal of a central venous catheter (CVC) (one for hemodialysis and two for chemotherapy) and one after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n\n【5】Case Reports\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】A 65-year-old male patient with HIV under antiretroviral therapy was admitted with acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. After three sessions, the CVC was removed and the patient had sudden altered level of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 6, deviation of the gaze to the right and bilateral extensor plantar response.\n\n【8】Emergency brain CT scan  revealed multiple bi-hemispheric frontoparietal curvilinear hypodensities consistent with air in the cortical sulci, distributed predominantly in the right hemisphere. Unfortunately, these findings were only adequately valued after image review, which led to the late etiological diagnosis.\n\n【9】Follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  (48 h after the onset) showed large right frontoparietal cortical ischemic lesions, with additional small left perirolandic cortex involvement. No MRI signal abnormality was identified at the subarachnoid space and CT scan at the same time demonstrated resorption of the air content located in the subarachnoid/intravascular space. These imaging findings were suggestive of CAE involving multiple arterial territories with associated extensive laminar cortical necrosis.\n\n【10】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was not offered during the acute phase since the diagnosis was not promptly performed. The patient had a slight neurological improvement, presenting at the time of discharge, left hemiparesis (muscle strength grade 4/5).\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】A 36-year-old female with human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) stage 3 under chemotherapy for Castleman’s disease was admitted for suspected infective endocarditis. After CVC removal, the patient presented a simple partial seizure with secondary generalization, altered level of consciousness and subsequent left hemiparesis (muscle strength grade 3/5).\n\n【13】Emergency CT scan demonstrated multiple bilateral micro-hypodensities distributed in the subarachnoid space along high cerebral convexity. Unfortunately, these findings were only adequately valued after image review, which led to the late etiological diagnosis.\n\n【14】Follow-up CT scan (4 days after the onset) showed disappearance of the hypodense content in the subarachnoid/ vascular space and presence of cerebral infarctions with the same topographic distribution.\n\n【15】HBOT was not offered during the acute phase since the diagnosis was not promptly performed. At the time of hospital discharge, the patient did not present significant neurological improvement, remaining with left hemiparesis (muscle strength grade 3/5).\n\n【16】Case 3\n\n【17】A 57-year-old man diagnosed with sigmoid adenocarcinoma and undergoing chemotherapy, was admitted for resection of a left cerebellar hemisphere metastasis. Three days after surgery, CVC was removed and the patient experienced sudden onset of involuntary movements and altered level of consciousness, followed by left hemiparesis (muscle strength grade 3/5).\n\n【18】Emergency brain CT scan  was performed and showed intracranial air with vascular distribution. These findings were only assessed during image review on the following day, which led to a diagnostic delay.\n\n【19】Follow-up MRI scan , performed 3 days after the onset documented cortical ischemia and parenchymal edema, with the same distribution of the intracranial air, no longer documented on the follow-up CT scan .\n\n【20】HBOT was not offered during the acute phase since the diagnosis was not promptly performed. The patient underwent physiotherapy with slow improvement, presenting at the time of discharge muscle strength grade 4/5 in the left limbs.\n\n【21】Case 4\n\n【22】An 89-year-old man diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma was submitted to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion. After endoscope removal, the patient had sudden desaturation, bradycardia and altered level of consciousness (GCS 3) with further need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n【23】Emergency CT scan showed diffuse subarachnoid intracranial air , suggestive of gas embolism and imaging findings indicative of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy .\n\n【24】The presence of large ischemic lesions on CT and the dismal patient prognosis precluded additional treatment actions and HBOT was not suggested. The patient died 24 h after the onset.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Vascular air embolism is a rare event, initially described in the 19th century, associated with medical-surgical procedures, penetrating injuries and barotrauma. The number of clinical reports has been increasing in recent years, along with the expansion of invasive medical and surgical procedures and therapeutic methods . The real incidence is unknown, since misdiagnoses are common. For CVC and cardiothoracic surgery with cardiac bypass, the incidence is estimated to be 0.13% and 0.003-0.007%, respectively , with frequent intracranial involvement. The epidemiological studies regarding specifically to CAE are limited . It is often associated with CVC management or neurosurgical and otorhinolaryngological procedures.\n\n【27】Vascular gas embolism implies a negative pressure gradient and direct communication between the vascular system and atmospheric air. Both venous and arterial intracranial air have been associated with CAE, with recent reports arguing that cerebral arterial air is required to produce neurological complications .\n\n【28】CAE may occur in the presence of an intra-cardiac or intra-pulmonary shunt, and/or when multiple air emboli, that are small enough to be filtered through the pulmonary vasculature, are embolized through the systemic circulation (paradoxical embolism). Vasodilators or anaesthetic agents may enhance the later mechanism. Once in the intracranial arterial circulation, the gas bubbles preferentially occlude small caliber arteries (mean diameter 30 to 60 µm)  causing brain injury by reduction of cerebral parenchyma perfusion distal to the occlusion, in terminal arterial territories, and/or by a local inflammatory reaction activated by the presence of air .\n\n【29】Cerebral arterial gas embolism has a predilection for supratentorial compartment with bilateral distribution, but involving mainly the right cerebral hemisphere, since the brachiocephalic trunk is the major first branch of the aorta. Distribution of intracranial air may be related to patient’s position at the time of the event, with the prone position causing emboli located mostly in the posterior circulation due to preferential flow to the right vertebral artery .\n\n【30】It has been suggested that CVC associated CAE with no documented right-left shunt could result from passage of venous emboli by a retrograde venous movement to the jugular veins, especially if the patient is seated with high back .\n\n【31】The grade of morbidity and mortality in vascular gas embolism is associated with gas volume, accumulation rate, and patient position at the time of the embolic event. In CAE, the topography where air bubbles accumulate is of paramount importance to predict the outcome, and paradoxically a small amount of air can have catastrophic consequences .\n\n【32】There are no specific neurological findings for CAE, and it may even be clinically silent. As any ischemic stroke, its neurological manifestations depend on the brain region affected, frequently manifesting with stroke-like symptoms and accompanied by changes in the level of consciousness and general seizures. The suspicion must be raised in the presence of systemic symptoms, such as respiratory distress, arrhythmias and cardiorespiratory arrest. The mill-wheel murmur indicates the presence of intracardiac air but is only present in one-third of patients .\n\n【33】Patients with suspected CAE should undergo emergent CT scan, to identify the presence of intracranial air within the first hour from the onset, owing to rapid resorption of air by brain arterioles. It should be emphasised that late examination may not show the presence of air . This might explain the under-recognition of this disease. Non-contrast CT scan is a highly sensitive imaging technique to detect the presence of small amounts of air. It allows direct visualization of air emboli, such as small round or curvilinear hypodensities (gyriform pattern), representing air in the cerebral cortical vessels .\n\n【34】Potential causes of false-negative studies and reduced CT scan imaging sensitivity include non-visualization of small amounts of air, gas reabsorption before acquisition, misinterpretation of air attenuation coefficient as fat . The use of thin-slice thickness (5 mm or smaller) and air attenuation coefficient measurement, using the lung window settings and comparing with the attenuation coefficient of the paranasal sinuses, increase the diagnostic accuracy. Although rarely reported, gas emboli are also visible in MRI gradient echo sequences due to their susceptibility artifacts .\n\n【35】The diagnosis of CAE by MRI is challenging. The imaging findings are non-specific and include cortical diffusion restriction (cytotoxic edema) areas. Additionally, adjacent areas of vasogenic edema may also be present. These features are similar to those documented in our cases, depicted by cortical necrosis due to acute local ischemia and vasogenic edema as a result of regional inflammatory reaction. CT and MRI perfusion studies in these patients are scarce, often presenting nonspecific findings. In CAE the whole brain CT perfusion may demonstrate areas of ischemia or penumbra in the region where the air bubbles are lodged, findings that are similar to those seen in acute ischemic lesions .\n\n【36】Recently, studies have addressed the prognostic value of neuroimaging evaluation in these patients, and the presence of intracranial air in a gyriform pattern could be an indicator of unfavourable outcome . Fatal cases are usually associated with the coexistence of intracardiac air or with massive CAE .\n\n【37】Early detection of CAE promotes proper management and treatment, including immediate airway closing, positioning in Trendelenburg, adequate oxygenation, in addition to other support measures, as well as HBOT .\n\n【38】HBOT is the first-line treatment for CAE and should be initiated soon after the embolic event, within the first 4 - 6 h after symptoms onset, to ensure a good prognosis. It has been suggested that the beneficial role of HBOT can be extended up to 30 h after the initial event .\n\n【39】HBOT induces a reduction in air bubble size by increasing the ambient pressure and reduces the amount of air by increasing systemic hyperoxygenation. The parenchymal edema may also be reduced, by promoting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and by decreasing leukocytes adhesion to the endothelium.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n\n【41】CAE is often underdiagnosed despite its potential devastating consequences. The suspicion must be raised in the appropriate clinical setting for high-risk patients. Brain CT scan is the imaging technique of choice and should be immediately performed, due to its high sensitivity for gas detection. MRI cannot generally depict CEA. It is essential to be aware of this severe disease to be able to make an early diagnosis, which may significantly impact patients’ management and outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These fibrin adhesions between epicardium and pericardium increase not only the cost, but also bleeding, duration of surgery and poor clinical outcomes. If cardiac re-surgery will be performed several weeks after the first surgery, it corresponds to the time when adhesion around the heart is the most intensive and pericardial inflammation is the maximum. These materials, which are locally performed on the surgical area, made the surgeons remain distant due to their undesirable effects, mainly increased risk of infection and immune reaction .\n\n【2】Cardiac re-surgery was performed in 2014 in a patient, who had undergone mitral commissurotomy with the assistance of heart-lung machine (CPB) in 1998 and in whom a material considered to reduce adhesion has been wrapped around the heart. Detailed information on the film barrier used during the first surgery could not be obtained from the center where the surgery was performed. In our clinic, effect of the material wrapped around the heart during mitral valve replacement on adhesion was observed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 64-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with shortness of breath, palpitation and limited effort. Whilst transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mitral stenosis (mean gradient: 9.5 mm Hg, area: 1.8 cm <sup>2 </sup> ), mitral insufficiency (grade 2-3/4), pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mm Hg, and tricuspid insufficiency (grade 2-3/4), aortic valve was considered to be within the normal limits. Coronary angiography revealed no lesion. The patient was admitted to the cardiovascular surgery clinic for mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve De Vega annuloplasty. Prior to the open heart surgery, routine laboratory analyses (complete blood count, biochemical analyses, telegram, urinalysis, dental examination report, electrocardiography, etc.) were requested, preoperative medical treatment was arranged, and the patient was prepared for surgery.\n\n【5】On the day of surgery, the patient was admitted to the operating room. Fentanyl, midazolam and pancuronium bromide were used for the induction of anesthesia. Standard median sternotomy was performed. Heparin sodium was given at a dose of 300 IU/kg (Nevparin <sup>® </sup> flacon 25,000 IU/5 mL). CPB and cross-clamp, standard aortic and selective (VCS, VCI) venous cannulation were performed. Jostra-Cobe (model 043213 105, VLC 865, Sweden) heart-lung machine was used. Crystalloid cardioplegy was given during surgery, whereas hot shot cardioplegy was given at the end of surgery. Standard left atriotomy and right atriotomy were performed. Unnecessary electrocautery use and luxury perfusion in CPB were avoided. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were checked every 20 min after induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. Intraoperative blood transfusion was performed when hematocrit value decreased to 20%. Mediastinal and chest drains were placed subxyphoidally. At the end of surgery, appropriate dose of protamine hydrochloride (Protamin <sup>® </sup> ampoule 1,000 IU/1 mL) was administered for full-dose neutralization in the patient that underwent on-pump CABG, and activated clothing time (ACT) was kept between 100 and 120 s. The patient was then admitted to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Although the mechanism of adhesion formation is unclear, inflammatory response plays a role in its pathogenesis. Open heart surgery increases reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is reported to cause postoperative adhesion. In some animal experiments, it was demonstrated that ROS scavengers could prevent adhesion formation .\n\n【8】What expected after cardiac surgery is the complete healing of pericardium in the presence of membrane formation. Second, it results in formation of single-layer, flattened mesothelial cells over disappeared connective tissue. It has been determined that mesothelial cells can differentiate from multipotent cells that occurred on the collagen basis. These cells prevent adhesion by synthesizing growth factors, lubricants and extracellular matrix proteins and secreting fibrin scavenging factors . Some local drugs or biologicals can prevent adhesion .\n\n【9】Although there is no protective method, postoperative pericardial adhesion significantly influences mortality and morbidity. Whilst some studies have focused on autogenous, heterogeneous and synthetic structures that could act as a barrier between epicardium and pericardium or sternum, some other studies have focused on the agents that could prevent adhesion after cardiac surgery . Efficacy of synthetic and xenogeneic membranes has been understood . However, there are reports that these membranes are associated with formation of calcification, capsule and epicardial reaction. Their effectivity has not been proven. As these structures are not transparent, they make the examination of cardiac structure difficult during surgery . On the other hand, it was demonstrated that systemic anti-inflammatory drugs and topical fibrinolytic agents reduce adhesion. However, both approaches impair wound healing and unfavorably influence bleeding . Inflammatory response is important in the pathogenesis of adhesion formation. It is known that decreased tissue oxygen due to ischemia leads to adhesion formation. Free oxygen radicals are significantly increased following endothelial tissue injury. These radicals rapidly react with oxygen and aggravate oxygen gap . Free oxygen radicals such as superoxide, peroxide and hydroxyl radicals have the potential to oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oxidation of fatty acids would result in peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and accordingly in the process that would enhance vascular permeability . This process causes formation of serosanguineous exudate. Exudation triggers adhesion. In general, these adhesions are exposed to lysis after 72 h. Endogenous fibrinolytic activity is the factor that enables lysis . Collected fibrin, which results from the balance between fibrin collection and degradation being in favor of fibrin, forms the adhesion .\n\n【10】It was determined that the area with adhesion-preventing material covered over the anterior and lateral aspects of the heart after sternotomy and mitral commissurotomy performed in 1998  has equal adhesion (even higher in some places) to the area with no material performed while exposing to surgical procedure in 2014. We can say that the film barrier wrapped around the heart during cardiac surgery to prevent adhesion is not effective. However, case series are needed to support this statement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth most common cancer in men but small-cell bladder cancer (SCBC) is a rare form and composes less than 1% of primary bladder malignancies .\n\n【2】Available knowledge in the literature is based mainly on some retrospective series and case reports . Although older age and smoking are putative risk factors for this type of carcinoma, the role of familial or genetic predisposition is uncertain . The age, gender predilection and symptoms at presentation of SCBC are similar to those of bladder urothelial carcinoma . The most common presenting symptoms such as painless hematuria, dysuria, obstructive voiding symptoms, weight loss, abdominal pain and/or recurrent urinary tract infections as seen in BC, can occur in the patients with SCBC .\n\n【3】In this case report, we present a case with a large SCBC leading to acute kidney failure.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic with dysuria, nocturia and pollacuria happening for 1 month. He had no smoking and gross hematuria history in his health past. He was a farmer. His PSA level (2.1 ng/dL), urine analysis test results were at normal level and no bacteria were cultured in his urine culture. Although an antibiotic regimen including ciprofloxacin group was given for 7 days, his complaints increased and nausea and anorexia occurred. His creatinine level was 2.1 and urea was 65 at that time, and urinary system ultrasonography revealed that a bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis in his kidneys and thickness of his bladder wall was measured as 24 mm. It was not established residual urine was in his bladder but the patients was catheterized for urine output follow-up. Two days later, his urine output stopped and creatine level increased up to 5.3. Non-contrast abdomen computed tomography (NCCT) was performed and an increased bilateral hdyronephrosis was established on NCCT sections . NCCT also revealed that all the bladder wall thickness increased. Bilaterally double J ureteral stent insertion was planned to deal with hydronephrosis and bladder biopsy for pathological diagnosis. Cystoscopy revealed that tumor had been already extended to nearly all bladder walls. Right ureteral orifice was not seen, but the left one was hardly seen and a double J ureteral stent was inserted. Afterwards, transurethral resection (TUR) was performed. His creatine level increased after for a while progressively while not establishing prerenal or renal insufficiency by the internist. But the patient’s general health status went bad progressively. His creatine level increased up to 8.5 and NaHCO <sub>3 </sub> was given in order to prevent metabolic acidosis. His creatine level started to decrease after a nephrostomy tube was inserted for the right side. After these managements, the patient’s general health status went well. Pathological examination revealed a small-cell carcinom of the bladder . NCCT did not reveal any metastatic signs. A chemotherapy regimen was planned, but the patient did not accept it and died 4 months after the first diagnosis.\n\n【6】Pathological examination\n\n【7】Macroscopic examination revealed 0.3 cc volume, ragged, irregularly shaped and gray white tissue. Microscopy showed a diffuse patternless type growth of loosely cohesive, relatively uniform and small round to oval cells with powdery (salt-and-pepper) nuclear chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies are commonly observed. The neoplastic cells on immunohistochemistry exhibited cytokeratin and diffuse synaptophysin positivity, and were negative for chromogranin A and leucocyte common antigen (LCA) .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】SCBC commonly affects men (men/women ratio is 3.8:1 ) in their seventh or eighth decade of life , and the patient in our case was 58 years old.\n\n【10】Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of SCBC, three of which have gained prominence. The first so-called stem cell theory, postulates a cancer stem cell, which then differentiates into diverse cell types. This is suggested by the occurrence of SCBC together with other types of bladder tumors . A second view suggests the origin of SCBC from malignant transformation of neuroendocrine stem cells that are found within the urothelium and bladder . The third hypothesis is that SCBC originates from extreme metaplasia of urothelial cells .\n\n【11】Smoking is the strongest risk factor in the 50-70% of patients with SCBC , but the patient in our case had no smoking history.\n\n【12】Painless gross hematuria and local irritative symptoms such as dysuria, pelvic pain, urinary obstruction, urinary infections, sometimes anorexia, and fatigue and weight loss are some of the symptoms  as they existed in our case. The clinical features in our case mostly depend on the acute renal failure.\n\n【13】Ultrasonography in our case revealed an increase in bladder wall up to 24 mm. NCCT revealed that all bladder walls increased as it looks like in carcinoma in situ  as well as bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis. However, the final diagnosis of SCBC is based on pathological examination of the tumor tissue obtained by TUR. Also, the common cellular pattern is diffuse sheets of dark blue cells with necrosis and mitosis . Neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin A, synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) are often focally or diffusely positive for these cancers by immunohistochemical methods . However, the absence of staining for these markers does not rule out the diagnosis of SCBC, and diagnosis relies on microscopic findings . The microscopic examination of our case showed a diffuse patternless type growth of loosely cohesive, relatively uniform, small round to oval cells with powdery (salt-and-pepper) nuclear chromatin and scant cytoplasm .\n\n【14】There are no standard guidelines for SCBC treatment due to its rarity. Treatment decisions are usually based on retrospective studies and case reports . Because SCBC is more aggressive than the conventional ones, it should be treated as metastatic disease, even there is no radiologic evidence . We also could not establish any metastases. SCBC management is not well-known and it is usually treated as small-cell lung cancer with the exception that surgical therapies are often an important part of management in SCBC . A study did not reveal any difference in patients treated with or without cystectomy; however, the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was only 16% . But neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (in case of a surgically resectable tumor is existing) can result in a 5-year survival of 80% . Chemotherapy can be useful for all stages of SCBC among patients who were treated with TUR, but it is not effective in addition to cystectomy . A variety of chemotherapeutic regimens have been used, but carboplatin or cisplatin and etaposide is the current treatment of choice . Although chemoradiation therapy is the primary management for the SCBC, the experience combining chemotherapy with radical cystectomy for primary SCBC has shown equal, or better, local control and cancer-free survival than that was found with chemoradiation . However, with 5-year disease-specific survival rates of 16% to 18% with chemoradiation or chemotherapy and radical cystectomy, respectively, the primary method to improve survival will be more effective treatment .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases, and characterized by airflow obstruction with variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation. It displays a complex pathophysiology, and several risk factors that predispose to asthma and several triggers which are environmental factors that worsen asthma in a patient with established disease have been identified . Abundant objective data now exist which demonstrate that psychological factors can interact with the asthmatic diathesis to worsen or ameliorate the disease process .\n\n【2】We describe an asthmatic woman, who during a severe asthmatic attack, which was precipitated by intense anxiety, developed a hysterical attack with “loss of consciousness”, a complication which was followed by termination of her asthmatic attack almost immediately. To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported similar case.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 72-year-old woman with a history of essential hypertension for 6 years, and bronchial asthma for 3 years which developed shortly after the death of her husband, and was confirmed by respiratory function tests, was hospitalized because her asthma has become much worse despite treatment with prednisone, 40 mg a day, sustained-release theophylline, 300 mg twice a day, and inhalation of terbutaline and ipratropium bromide three times a day. The worsening of her asthma began after her pulmonologist, to whom she was attached very much, informed her that he is going to travel abroad after 2 weeks for 3 months. In the day of travel she became more anxious and developed a severe asthmatic attack. Her other medications at admission included captopril 25 mg three times a day. Other medical history was unremarkable.\n\n【5】Physical examination revealed an anxious patient with respiratory distress and tachypnea (36 breaths per minute), and breathing efforts were associated with cough, audible expiratory wheezing and the use of accessory muscles of respiration. Her pulse was 100 beats per minute and regular, and her blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg. Examination of the chest revealed a hyper-resonant chest, diminished symmetrical air entry to the lungs, expiratory wheezes and prolongation of the expiratory phase. The heart sounds were rapid and regular with no murmurs. Other physical findings were unremarkable. Arterial blood gases and pH showed the following values: pH of 7.45, PO <sub>2 </sub> of 62 mm Hg and PCO <sub>2 </sub> of 30 mm Hg. Chest roentgenogram showed mild cardiomegaly, and hyperinflation of the lungs with depression of the diaphragms. The electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104/min.\n\n【6】The patient continued to get her previous medications except of prednisone which was replaced by intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg a day, and she was supplemented with oxygen by nasal cannula. However, no immediate significant improvement was observed in the patient's status. She became more and more anxious with a concomitant deterioration of her asthma, and when the nurse brought her a nebulizer with ipratropium bromide for inhalation, she refused to get the inhalation, destroyed the nebulizer and threw it away, and threw herself back on the bed laying down “unresponsive”. Soon after that, an abrupt relief of her asthmatic attack was observed, manifested by resolution of the respiratory distress, tachypnea, wheezing and cough, and most of the previous physical findings in the chest examination. Examination of her “unresponsiveness” revealed a typical hysterical attack. Blood gases taken 10 min later, when she still was “unresponsive”, showed the following values: a pH of 7.41, a PO <sub>2 </sub> of 85 mm Hg and PCO <sub>2 </sub> of 39 mm Hg. She remained “unresponsive” for about 1 h, then she awakened and again another exacerbation of her asthma began, but was less serious than before, and responded more effectively to the previous treatment with addition of a sedative drug. No other hysterical attacks were observed, she became less anxious, and was discharged after three days in a good status, and was referred for psychological evaluation.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】About 200 years ago Theophile Laennec was the first to propose that asthma is a psychosomatic disease . This hypothesis has received increasing support for several decades, so that asthma was considered by some to be a classic example of a psychosomatic disease . However, subsequent studies suggested that overt neurotic disorders are not proportionately high in asthmatics, an observation which failed to support the idea that emotion is a common basic cause of this disorder . Dubo et al  found that family psychodynamics was significantly altered by a child with severe, chronic disease but that childhood asthma was not affected in degree of severity by the familial emotional mood. Another study of the personality profiles of asthmatics  demonstrated patterns which have been called characteristics of psychosomatic disease, but these patters correlated with the severity of functional impairment rather than presence or absence of asthma. This study could be interpreted as suggesting that emotional disturbances are usually a result rather than a cause of asthma.\n\n【9】It is now well established that emotional factors are so clearly associated with asthmatic attacks, where emotional disturbances could be a trigger and also a result of asthmatic attacks  as was with our patient. Not surprisingly then, psychiatric interventions such as hypnosis , or behavioral modifications  have been reported to produce a favorable response in some subjects with asthma. The extent to which psychological factors participate in the induction and/or continuation of any given acute exacerbation is unknown but probably varies from patient to patient and in the same patient from episode to episode .\n\n【10】Paradoxically, very severe stress such as bereavement usually does not worsen, and may even improve, asthma symptoms , as occurred in our patient. Although this statement is present in Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , searching extensively the medical literature by the PubMed and the Medline, we could not find description of any case similar to ours, where the asthmatic attack was precipitated and terminated by the same emotional disturbance, but with different intensities.\n\n【11】The pathways and nature of the interactions between psychological factors and asthma are complex, but have been shown to be operational to some extent in almost half of the patients studies . There are several studies in animals and man which collectively provide strong indirect evidence of a cholinergic vagal pathway by which psychogenic stimuli may affect bronchial hypersensitivity . Other pathways could be implicated, such as the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic bronchodilator system , but clear evidence will depend on the development of a specific neural blockers.\n\n【12】In our patient, the interactions between the emotional status and her asthma were very complex and most atypical. From one side, the anxiety was the trigger of her present asthmatic attack. From the other side, as the severity of her asthmatic attack increased, the severity of her anxiety also increased and progressed to a hysterical attack with “unresponsiveness”. The hysterical attack ameliorated to a great extent, or even terminated the asthmatic attack almost immediately, such that the respiratory distress, the tachypnea, the diminished air entry to the lungs, the expiratory wheezing and prolongation of expiratory phase, all resolved almost completely, and the arterial blood gases and pH improved significantly. To the best of our knowledge, no similar case has been reported previously.\n\n【13】The mechanism by which the hysterical attack in our patient ameliorated or terminated the asthmatic attack is not fully understood. Asthma appears to be associated with a characteristic airway inflammatory process . Animal experiments show that anterior hypothalamic lesions in small animals affect both immunological and cellular function that could affect inflammation in the airways . Similar experiments are not possible in man, but studies of the relationship between the immune and nervous systems indicate that there are a number of ways in which the central nervous system could modulate the degree of airway inflammation in patients with asthma . Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence that patients with severe asthma who suffer hypoxic brain damage have remission of their asthma . In addition, it has become increasingly clear that patients with intense anxiety leading to panic disorders may also have central nervous system biochemical abnormalities . Thus, it may be possible that in our patient, the hysterical attack influenced the immune system through the central nervous system to ameliorate the inflammatory process and the bronchospasm, and consequently the asthmatic attack. Other unknown mechanisms or pathways may also be involved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Fracture of an elongated SP is more common  than fracture of a normally sized SP, which is a rare event . Previous reports have shown that facial or neck trauma is the most frequent cause of fracture of the SP .\n\n【2】No reports have indicated that rolling over is a cause of fracture of the SP. We herein describe a patient who developed a fracture of the SP associated with sudden neck pain by rolling over during sleep. Thus, fracture of the SP should be considered when elderly patients develop sudden neck pain after a casual motion such as rolling over.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 67-year-old woman developed a sudden onset of severe left-sided neck pain the night before presentation. She presented 6 h after the onset of the symptom. Her medical history included diabetes and osteoporosis. There was no family history of bone disease. Her regular medications were drugs for diabetes and osteoporosis. The patient’s chief complaint was pain on the left side of her neck. She experienced worsening pain and no limitation during her jaw movement. She reported no surgical history or tonsillectomy. The patient did not complain of symptoms mimicking glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Upon examination, she had severe neck pain but normal vital signs. Neck examination revealed tenderness in near front of the mastoid process. Other examinations were normal. Blood test and X-ray findings were also normal. Because of concern regarding an underlying fracture, a computed tomography scan of the neck was performed, which revealed a fracture of the SP .\n\n【5】Thus, the patient was diagnosed with a fracture of the SP and received conservative treatment and follow-up. A neck brace was placed to limit her neck movement, and an analgesic was prescribed (acetaminophen, 500 mg every 8 h for 8 weeks). After 2 months when conservative treatment started, her neck pain gradually resolved.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Investigations of the epidemiology of fracture of the SP have indicated that such fractures are rare traumatic events that frequently occur in association with other head and neck fractures, especially mandibular fractures . Several reports have described fractures of the SP in patients with Eagle syndrome . However, no reports have described fracture of the SP due to a minor trauma such as that induced by rolling over.\n\n【8】With respect to the cause of the fracture of the SP in the patient, traumatic injury is likely. When she rolled over, her neck sprained unnaturally. She also had a history of osteoporosis; thus, bone fragility might have contributed to the fracture. She had no other predisposing risk factors for fracture of the SP, although the influence of osteoporosis was not completely ruled out. Therefore, the cause of the fracture of the SP in her could be considered to be related to rolling over.\n\n【9】Regarding the therapeutic approach to the fracture of the SP in the patient, conservative management was chosen and provided good recovery. However, optimal management of a fracture of the SP depends on its severity and displacement . Surgical removal of an SP bone chip could be necessary in some patients, but conservative treatment might be sufficient in those with only mild discomfort. The patient was treated conservatively with a neck brace to limit her neck movement, and we prescribed an analgesic. To the best of my knowledge, no reports have described fractures in elderly patients in association with rolling over. Fracture of the styloid process should be considered in elderly patients with sudden onset of neck pain during sleep.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on an aneurismal dilation of portal vein due to left liver lobe aplasia. Portal vein aneurysms (PVAs) are commonly observed as saccular pseudo aneurysms. Portal vein diameter greater than 20 mm is accepted as an aneurysm . Usually, this condition is observed secondary to portal hypertension in patients with chronic hepatic disease. True aneurysms which all wall layers prevented in the absence of chronic hepatic disease and portal hypertension are extremely rare. In this paper, clinical and radiologic findings of incidentally found left liver lobe aplasia and PVA in a 27-week pregnant woman presented with acute abdomen and operated for a right side ovarian torsion are discussed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to our clinic with nausea, bilious vomiting and acute abdomen. Her medical history revealed that her complaints begun 3 days before and she was followed up in another clinic for a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis. In abdominal examination, abdomen was distended and rebound tenderness was present in the right para median region. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a pregnancy of 26 weeks and 6 days, consistent with the last menstrual period. Ultrasound examination was performed with LOGIQ 9 (GE Healthcare Technologies, Ultrasound, Milwaukee, USA) convex (2 - 5 MHz) transducer. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a single live intrauterine fetus of 27 weeks with a fetal weight of about 969 g with cephalic presentation and normal fetal growth. A 78 × 50 mm cyst and solid structures compatible with adnex above the cyst were defined on right side ovary. There were no arterial signals detected by a color Doppler sonography (CDS) on solid tissues around the cyst. In abdominal ultrasound, portal vein was larger than normal and its largest diameter was measured as 24 mm in the distal site adjacent to liver and 21 mm in the middle site. Hepatic and splenic parenchyma echoes and sizes were in normal ranges. There was no free fluid in abdomen. Splenic vein diameter was measured as 8 mm.\n\n【4】A lower abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 1.5 T MRI tool (General Electric Signa Excita, GE Health Care System, Milwaukee, USA) revealed a smooth edged cystic lesion on right ovary sized 80 × 33 mm, which was hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted series. A solid structure was detected on superior aspect of the cyst which was compatible with at least two times twisted salpinx. Left liver lobe and left portal vein were aplastic and were not visualized. In hepatic hilum, portal vein was divided into two main branches both advancing to the right lobe. Portal vein seemed dilated and its diameter was 24 mm just before bifurcation, 21 mm in the middle part and 20 mm in proximal portion . Contrast was not used as the patient was pregnant.\n\n【5】These findings suggested an ovarian torsion and patient was taken to operation room with ritodrine treatment for tocolysis. Abdomen was explored through a 4 cm sized right oblique paramedian incision and a cystic mass of 7 × 7 cm in size was found. Macroscopic view of the mass was compatible with a hemorrhagic infarct . With a careful inspection, the mass was observed to be a four-time anti-clockwise twisted ovary and tuba. Salpinx was stuck to ovary and twisted with it. Thus, the tissues were necrotic, and a salphingo-ooferectomy and an appendectomy were performed. Histopathological examination revealed hemorrhagic infarct of the ovarian and tubal tissue . Postoperative course was uneventful both for the mother and the fetus.\n\n【6】In the postoperative period, patient was examined for chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. There were no esophageal varices on endoscopic examination. There were no laboratory findings consistent with chronic viral hepatitis or chronic liver failure. Patient was discharged on second postoperative day as no findings of portal hypertension have been found as well.\n\n【7】The CDS examination performed after operation, in the 31st week of gestation revealed no decrease in portal vein diameter. About one month later, the labor, CDS and MRI were repeated. Portal venous diameter was measured as 21 mm on distal part near the liver, 19 mm on middle part and 16 mm on proximal portion . Partial decrease on portal venous diameter suggested that pregnancy had some effect on portal vein dilation.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of acute abdomen and its incidence is 0.05% . In pregnancy, its incidence is higher than normal population due to ligamentous laxity caused by increased levels of some hormones . Ovarian mass is regarded as a risk factor for ovarian torsion. While the most common cause of ovarian torsion in pregnancy is the corpus luteum, all of the ovarian masses may lead to this condition . In our case, pregnancy and cystic mass were considered as risk factors for the ovarian torsion. The pathologic evaluation of the resected cystic lesion was reported as “persistent corpus luteum”.\n\n【10】Generally, PVAs occur secondary to portal hypertension. Portal vein diameter may increase up to 19 mm in cirrhotic patients. Portal vein diameter size greater than 20 mm at maximum is regarded as PVA . Regardless of whether left liver lobe aplasia causes gastric malpositioning and volvulus, these are generally asymptomatic . To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about PVA associated with left liver lobe aplasia.\n\n【11】In our case, the most important mechanism in the pathogenesis of the PVA development in the absence of chronic hepatic disease is increased retrograde flow due to increased resistance caused by left liver lobe and left portal vein aplasia. Also, decrease in portal vein diameter after labor suggests some gestational effect on this dilation. In a normal gestation, volume of plasma increases by 10% in the 12th week and up to 40% in the middle of the third trimester . Splanchnic blood flow and portal vein blood will naturally increase as well. There are reports showing increased portal vein blood flow in pregnancy . In pregnant women, it is known that some hormones like relaxin (RLX) affect vascular smooth muscles to make dilation . RLX is an insulin-like hormone produced by corpus luteum, placenta and decidua in pregnant women. It converts endothelin (ET) big molecule to ET 1-32 by increasing the gelatinase activity. Produced ET 1-32 provokes endothelial receptor B to produce NO and make vasodilatation . There are many reports about the effects of RLX on vascular bed and kidneys . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about its effects on portal venous system and liver. Pregnancy does not cause significant portal vein dilation in an individual with a healthy liver. In our case, left liver lobe aplasia caused an increase in the portal vein blood flow and this situation contributed the vein dilation.\n\n【12】As a result, this case shows that patients with left liver lobe aplasia may develop aneurismal portal vein dilation even in the absence of chronic hepatic disease and for these patients portal vein diameter may increase in the course of gestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It represents about 5% of primary bone tumors and accounts for about 20% of bone benign neoplasms . GCTB is classified as benign; however, some case reports describe aggressive forms of the disease with metastatic potential, most often to the lungs .\n\n【2】Around 60% of the cases of GCTB affect women, with 70-80% of them typically during the third or fourth decades of life, when skeletal maturity is reached .\n\n【3】Historically the GCTB was first described in 1818 by Cooper and Travers; Nelaton deepened into its clinical features in 1860, but only in 1912 Bloodgood used the name “giant cell tumor” and employed local curettage and bone grafting as treatment, preventing member amputation as widely practiced until then .\n\n【4】Systemic therapy is reserved to cases when surgery cannot be performed and it is based on feel case reports. This is a case report study to report the experience of the Hospital Sao Paulo (University Hospital - UH/Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo - UNIFESP) in the treatment of a case of metastatic GCTB.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 24-year-old female with a history of childhood asthma and no bronchospasm for many years. She had history of surgery for bone tumor in the distal region of the right tibia 8 months before admission in Hospital Sao Paulo; however, the material was not sent for histopathological analysis. Whole body computed tomography (CT) was not performed at that time.\n\n【7】About 3 months after orthopedic surgery, the patient begins with history of progressive dyspnea and 5 months later arrived in Hospital Sao Paulo.\n\n【8】She underwent investigation by clinical examination that revealed dyspnea without inflammatory or infectious characteristic and distal tibia bulging. Imaging studies were performed with chest radiograph , CT of the leg  and skeletal scintigraphy .\n\n【9】Cytological research was also carried out by bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and biopsy of the tibial lesion. The biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell tumor in both materials.\n\n【10】We opted for systemic therapy because of irresectability of pulmonary lesions; however, before starting systemic therapy, the patient developed sudden worsening of dyspnea by spontaneous right pneumothorax .\n\n【11】After resolution of clinical complication, she started systemic treatment with cisplatin 25 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> and doxorubicin 25 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on day 1 and day 2. Three days after the first cycle of chemotherapy, she developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation with exclusion of infectious etiology. After a week in the intensive care unit, denosumab was made available by the board of the Hospital Sao Paulo in view of the severity of the case. Subcutaneously 120 mg was administered on the 10th day after the start of chemotherapy. However, the patient remained respiratory complications and died the day after receiving denosumab.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The GCTB is rare bone neoplasm primarily classified as benign; however, disseminated disease was described, most often to the lungs . GCTB usually begins in the epiphysis of long bones and tends to expand into the metaphysis or the joint compartment .\n\n【14】The most common symptom in the early stage of the disease is localized pain combined with a visible or palpable mass, sometimes with rapid growth . The most involved sites in decreasing order of frequency are the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal femur, distal radius and distal tibia .\n\n【15】Lungs are the main metastatic site, and the recurrence of bone disease increases the risk of distant implants; approximately 5% of these recurrent cases develop lung disease . Multicenter disease at the diagnosis, as described above, is a very rare condition, affecting less than 1% of the patients .\n\n【16】Radiologically the GCTB presents itself initially as a lytic lesion without sclerotic margin, eccentric, within the limits of cortical. As it grows, it becomes insuflative, with a wide transition zone, thinned bone cortex, extensive remodeling and invasion of metaphyseal bone, involving the whole bone diameter, disrupting the cortical, provoking pathological fracture and compromising the adjacent soft tissues .\n\n【17】Accurate diagnosis is given by histopathological analysis by punch biopsy or local resection. Differential diagnoses include brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism, aneurysmal bone cyst, osteogenic sarcoma, chondroblastoma and fibrosarcoma .\n\n【18】The histogenesis of GCTB is still obscure, without any identified correlation between the histological grade at presentation and tumor aggressiveness. It is assumed that giant cells are monocytes transformed into osteoclasts that express RANKL (kappa B nuclear factor receptor), an essential growth factor in the osteoclastic differentiation and activation .\n\n【19】Over the past 30 years, the GCTB, specially the localized form, has been treated with intralesional curettage, cement (polymethylmethacrylate) filling or bone graft and, alternatively, with segmental resection of the lesion with surgical margins .\n\n【20】The possibility of local recurrence is significant, reaching 15-50% of the cases treated with local curettage . When it occurs, 75% of them appear within the first 2 years of the follow-up . The use of chemical and thermal adjuvants, such as phenol, hydrogen peroxide and liquid nitrogen, reduced the recurrence rate to 17%, getting lower when cavity filling with cement was performed . Wide en bloc resections promote greater control of the disease and lower recurrence rates of about 5%; however, there is a higher rate of surgical complications, present in 16% of the cases, and functional impairment .\n\n【21】Radiotherapy presents a local control rate of the disease of 60-84%; however, due to the risk of sarcomatous degeneration, described in up to 11% in some series of cases, this treatment modality is reserved for cases with lesions unable to be removed with surgical margins, like those located in sacrum .\n\n【22】Even for metastatic disease, the surgical resection remains the treatment of choice. In cases where surgery is not possible because of the patient’s adverse condition or disease itself, systemic treatment can be used. The choice of systemic treatment regimen is made based on small studies reports or series of cases. No prospective studies have evaluated the chemotherapeutic treatment of GCTB. The agents most commonly reported are ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin in various combinations. Interferon is described for the treatment of aggressive GCTB; however, this drug is associated with several potentially serious adverse effects, remaining currently as an option after the failure of surgery, radiotherapy and targeted molecular therapy .\n\n【23】Recently a promising new treatment option with molecular targeted therapy has emerged, the denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed to the RANK ligand-L, preventing it from binding to the receptor of nuclear factor kappa-B and interrupting the osteoclast differentiation and activity. A small phase 2 study with 35 patients showed a 86% rate activity against the disease with up to 65% reconstitution of cortical . However, it is not available for use in the Brazilian public health system.\n\n【24】In the current case report, it was decided for the use of conventional chemotherapy regimen with cisplatin and doxorubicin, described by another report in which a single patient had been submitted to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, achieving prolonged disease control . Interferon would be a plausible drug, but it was not available in our service. After the end of the first chemotherapy cycle, the patient received one application of denosumab, but she died of lung metastases complications after just 1 day, without possibility of experiencing the benefits of treatment.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】GCTB is rare neoplasm with unpredictable behavior considering its histopathological analysis. The main treatment is still based on intralesional curettage associated or not with cement filling or bone graft, leaving the systemic therapy options for cases where surgery is not feasible. The prognosis depends mainly on the behavior of the disease, since there are no prognostic markers for this tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

As preinvasive cervical disease commonly occurs in women of reproductive age, various management strategies have been described to potentially avoid these sequalae . Conversely, scarred cervical stenosis can occur and complicate labor or even result in infertility. We describe an uncommon occurrence of cervical stenosis presenting in labor and resulting in failure to progress in a multiparous lady who had undergone a laser cone biopsy after three previous spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 34-year-old patient, gravida six para three, presented to our delivery suite at 37+0 weeks’ gestation in labor. She had two terminations of pregnancies, and three normal vaginal deliveries at 39 + 0, 36 + 4, and 38 + 6 weeks’ gestation in 2005, 2008, and 2016 respectively. Her babies were healthy and weighed between 2,500 to 2,925 g at birth. In May 2017, she underwent a laser cone biopsy for CIN 3 with clear margins achieved. Excisional biopsy was the treatment of choice as it was a type two transformational zone. A laser cone was performed instead of a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) in view of a large transformational zone. Subsequent follow up cervical smear and examination were normal. She had no other significant past medical history.\n\n【4】She conceived spontaneously in 2019 and presented at eight weeks gestation at her booking visit. A transvaginal cervical length scan, performed at 12 weeks’ gestation in view of her previous laser cone biopsy, estimated her cervical length to be 3.6 - 3.7 cm. She declined Down syndrome screening and her fetal anomaly scan at 20 weeks’ gestation was normal except for an aberrant right subclavian artery. Her pregnancy progressed uneventfully.\n\n【5】The patient presented at 37 weeks with spontaneous rupture of membranes followed by regular contraction pains. Speculum examination confirmed the presence of a definite pool of clear liquor but her cervical os was closed on vaginal examination. She was started on a Syntocinon infusion to augment labor, titrated to maintain her contractions every 2 - 3 min. Her cervix remained closed after 6 h and a decision was made to stop her Syntocinon infusion and insert a 3 mg dinoprostone (Prostin E2) tablet. A vaginal examination performed 6 h later revealed a full effaced and 1 cm dilated cervix. She was restarted on Syntocinon infusion thereafter but made no progress after 6 h of augmentation, with contractions felt and seen every 3 min. After discussion with the patient, another dinoprostone tablet was inserted, and Syntocinon augmentation recommenced 6 h later. However, after another 4 h, there was no change to her cervical findings despite regular contractions every 2 -3 min. A diagnosis of cervical stenosis was made.\n\n【6】She underwent an emergency cesarean section for failure to progress and delivered a healthy baby girl with a birthweight of 3,515 g and an estimated blood loss of 400 mL. Intraoperatively, her internal cervical os was found to be one cm dilated, thin and fibrotic. She had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged well on the third postoperative day.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Several definitions of cervical stenosis have been suggested with no widely agreed consensus, with the incidence of cervical stenosis following laser conization ranging from 7.0-16.8% . In an early study of patients treated by cold knife conization between 1968 and 1973 by Moinian et al , six out of 100 full-term pregnancies ended up with cesarean delivery due to failure to dilate due to “rigid scarred cervix”. Houlard et al later showed that up to 16.8% of women could develop cervical stenosis post laser cone biopsy, as defined by the inability to pass a 4 mm cotton swab through the cervical os, with older aged women being at higher risk, as well as larger lesions and depth of excision, endocervical lesions and the use of continuous laser mode . Other studies have suggested lower risks of cervical stenosis, but the definition had been heterogenous  . In the largest meta-analysis of observational and cohort studies of 65,082 treated and 6,292,563 untreated patients, there were no differences found in cervical stenosis or cesarean delivery rates .\n\n【9】A study by Mathevet et al looked into the outcomes between the three techniques of conization and found that cervical stenosis occurred in 29% of women who underwent a cold knife cone biopsy, compared to 9% and 19% in the laser and LEEP categories respectively, however the data was not statistically significant . In the subsequent long-term follow-up study , two women required cesarean sections for cervical dystocia; one was previously treated with laser conization while the other with LEEP. Mathevet et al  reported that these findings, although from a small sample size, appeared to be consistent with an earlier study by Leiman et al in 1980, which suggested that larger cones sizes are associated with increased risks of preterm complications, while smaller cones sizes are associated with cervical stenosis resulting in cesarean section .\n\n【10】Aside from Moinian et al’s study in the late 60s to early 70s regarding diagnosis of cervical stenosis only at labor , there is one other case report by Munireddy et al  where cervical stenosis prevented any cervical dilatation in a primiparous lady treated with a laser cone biopsy 6 years beforehand. In our multiparous patient, her cervical stenosis was a complication from her previous laser cone biopsy. This was not diagnosed since she had normal menses and was able to conceive naturally. Despite sustained regular contractions and augmentation with Syntocinon, progressive cervical dilatation beyond 1 cm failed to occur in this multiparous lady, leading to a delayed diagnosis, and eventual cesarean delivery.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Counselling of patients, especially those of child-bearing age, regarding local excisional treatment for preinvasive cervical disease should include the risks of cervical stenosis and future adverse obstetric sequalae. The patient’s desire for future fertility must be explored and taken into account before deciding on the mode of treatment. As obstetric complications range widely from cervical insufficiency resulting in preterm delivery or PPROM to cervical stenosis resulting in infertility or failure to progress in labor, close antenatal surveillance is paramount in subsequent pregnancies and should involve a multidisciplinary team comprising obstetricians, gynaecologic oncologists, maternal fetal specialists and neonatologists. Understanding the potential for cervical stenosis to occur, although uncommon, would allow preemptive counselling of these patients when they present in labor, early recognition in a labor with poor progress and a swift, better-informed decision to deliver via an emergency cesarean section.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Decubitus ulcers typically occur over bony skin such as the buttocks. These wounds can be common in spinal cord injury patients with limited mobility. The number of patients with pressure ulcers is estimated to be approximately 1.3 - 3 million in the USA and the number of hospitalized patients has increased by more than 75% between 1993 and 2006 . Pressure ulcers can be classified according to four stages. Stage 1 is discolored but not broken skin. Stage 2 is a shallow open red-pink wound and may have a blister. Stage 3 manifests as a full thickness loss of skin with visible adipose tissue. Stage 4 is full thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed muscle and bone .\n\n【2】Mesenchymal/multipotential stem cells or MSCs are thought to have regenerative capacity and can be isolated from a variety of tissue sources including adipose or fat tissue . Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are MSCs which have been collected from fat. Easily accessible subcutaneous fat from the abdomen or the flanks can be collected via mini-lipoaspiration and contains high amounts of ADSCs . Both ADSCs and MSCs are multi-potential cells with ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, muscle and fat and can be expanded in culture. The expression of different cytokines and growth factors by these cells is thought to be part of a healing cascade and new blood vessel formation. By stimulating a local inflammation process and immunomodulatory/paracrine response, this signaling can enable the repair of damaged tissue . MSCs/ADSCs are currently being considered in various diseases and injuries . The exploitation of stem cells ability to promote a healing cascade is a new paradigm in medicine. The cells are anti-inflammatory and promote angiogenesis . This complex signaling process causes the homing of other cells to the area to repair damaged tissue and regeneration occurs.\n\n【3】The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is the mixture of cells from adipose tissue collected via mini-lipoaspiration after the adipocytes (fat cells) have been depleted. The remaining cells include a large percentage of ADSCs. The population is known to have a large percentage of CD34 <sup>+ </sup> cells which have a role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis . CD34 is a protein expressed on the cellular membrane of ADSCs and pericytes. Fat tissue has a network of microvessels and capillaries which are rich in pericytes .\n\n【4】It is believed that these cells help to build and maintain an endothelial network. Because SVF contains a variety of regenerative cells and growth factors and can be offered as an out-patient surgical procedure, it represents a novel therapeutic tool for many indications. Further, fat tissue is quickly becoming the preferred source for stem cells as compared to bone marrow due to the relative higher amounts of ADSCs/MSCs and lower amounts of pro-inflammatory leukocytes .\n\n【5】Local injection of SVF may reduce inflammation and promote healing/normal tissue formation as opposed to scar tissue. SVF can be collected bed side after a simple adipose tissue collection making it a practical surgical procedure for physicians to provide to their patients . Comella et al reported on the safety of SVF in a variety of indications with various delivery methods. Other publications have demonstrated success of SVF for specific conditions including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , congestive heart failure , degenerative disc disease , osteoarthritis/orthopedics , radiation necrosis , sclerosis , tendinopathy , xerostomia , psoriasis  and multiple sclerosis . The following is a case report and to our knowledge first in man a single injection of SVF and PRP into a chronic non-healing stage 3 ulcer in a patient with an incomplete spinal cord injury.\n\n【6】Patients and Methods\n\n【7】The following case report was completed on a 49-year-old male with prior incomplete spinal cord injury with stage 3 decubitus ulcer on the buttocks. The wound had persisted for 8 months with full thickness loss of epidermis and no exposure of underlying bone, muscle or tendon. Prior interventions include wound cleansing with hydrogen peroxide, wound dressing with eusol (bleach, boric acid and water) and gauze, and pressure relief by changing of position in bed.\n\n【8】The patient provided written informed consent to undergo the experimental clinical procedure as well as consent to publication of outcomes, images and data. Using less than 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000) and a 30-gauge 0.5-inch needle, local infiltration blebs allowed small incisions with a no. 11 blade for cannula entry. Areas to be treated were then infiltrated with a standard tumescent solution (500 mL normal saline, 20 mL of lidocaine (2%), 10 mL of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/mL)) with a 14 gauge × 15 cm infiltration cannula. After good tumescence was achieved, a harvester cannula was introduced through the entry points. Adipose tissue was then aspirated gently using the 2.1-mm small cannula.\n\n【9】The total fat collected was approximately 60 mL minus the infranate. Using a commercially available collection kit and enzyme (Adipocell™ Enzyme; US Stem Cell, Inc. Sunrise, FL), the fat was processed to obtain the SVF. Briefly, the fat was washed using a balanced salt solution to remove red blood cells and debris and then placed on enzyme to digest collagen bonds in the extracellular matrix. The SVF was separated by density after centrifugation. After washing, the cells were prepared for final suspension in platelet-rich plasma (PRP).\n\n【10】To create PRP, whole blood was collected via a 22-gauge butterfly needle into ACD solution A blood tubes (BD Vacutainer®). The autologous whole blood was centrifuged at 500 g for 8 min. Using a 10 mL syringe and cell extractor, approximately 5 mL of PRP was collected just above the buffy coat (white ring). The final SVF pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of PRP. After local numbing with 5 mL 1% lidocaine and 1 mL bicarbonate, the 5 mL of the SVF and PRP was injected in 0.25 mL intervals in and around the ulcer.\n\n【11】The patient was monitored for any safety events including adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs) before, during and following the procedure. SAEs are defined as any fatal or life-threatening events leading to hospitalizations, or requiring major medical interventions. Baseline parameters collected included blood work, blood pressure, weight/height, pulse and photographic imaging of decubitus ulcer. Photographic imaging was also at day 6, day 21 and 2 months post-injection.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】The entire procedure including the mini-lipoaspiration, the blood collection and the SVF/PRP injection was well tolerated with no reported AEs. During the follow-up period, the patient did not report any AEs or SAEs. Normal activities were resumed in under a week and the patient reported a willingness to repeat therapy should it be necessary. Approximately 30 - 60 million nucleated cells are typically collected from a 60 mL sample of fat tissue after adipocyte depletion. During the follow-up period, the patient reported satisfaction with the healing process of his wound, reduction of pain until non-painful stage and no AEs. Figure 1a shows photograph of stage 3 decubitus ulcer prior to cell therapy. Figure 1b , taken 6 days after direct injection of SVF plus PRP, shows re-epithelialization of the ulcer. Figure 1c , taken 21 days after injection, shows remodeling. Figure 1d , taken 2 months after injection, shows continual remodeling/maturation.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Decubitus ulcers are a common complication for spinal cord injury patients. Chronic stage 3 and 4 pressure sores can be difficult to heal and lead to life-threatening complications. Recent literature has revealed the anti-inflammatory and healing properties of stem cells. The use of SVF in a clinical outpatient setting for non-healing ulcer wounds could be a novel therapy. Future studies could help to establish appropriate clinical protocols (including repeat dosing or quantity/volume of cells/PRP) for specific indications.\n\n【16】Given the complex nature of the healing cascade and the lack of understanding of the mechanisms of action of stem cells, it is unclear to what extent this protocol may be successful in other cases. Proposed mechanisms of action in this patient could be an immunomodulary/paracrine effect or engraftment of the injected cells. The injection of the SVF most probably stimulated a reduction of inflammation followed by the formation of new healthy tissue. Complete tissue remodeling as a result of a complex sequence of events is stimulated by expression of growth factors, chemokines and cytokines.\n\n【17】Direct injection of SVF plus PRP in a chronic stage 3 decubitus ulcer can be effectively and safely completed in an outpatient setting according to this case study. The patient tolerated the procedure with no reported AEs. Photographic imaging depicted the stages of wound healing after a single injection of the cellular mixture. Anticipated outcomes for wound healing and detailed protocols could be determined with larger clinical studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Characterized by recurrent ischemic events in the developing brains of young patients, the process is one that often decimates the quality of life of affected individuals . Its pathophysiology has been further characterized as the formation of microvascular collaterals in response to smooth muscle hyperplasia and luminal thrombosis which reduces blood flow through the ICA’s and their proximal branches . The cerebrovascular implications of MMD are widespread and include focal neurological symptoms in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, migraine-like headaches, and choreiform movement disorder . The latter is an example of the disease’s tendency to induce pathology in a pattern of microvascular damage in the basal ganglia . The vascular changes in MMD have been demonstrated to occur in an extracranial manner, thus it is logical to assume that the same steno-occlusive mechanism could induce dysfunction and ischemia in other organ systems .\n\n【2】The pathophysiological process of arterial stenosis and small vessel collateralization involves vessel wall thickening and angiogenesis. MMD has genetic association with a higher incidence among the Japanese population with familial occurrence as high as 15%. Evidence suggests that RNF213 gene on chromosome 17q25.3 is an important susceptibility factor for the development of MMD in east Asian populations . MMD is associated with multiple conditions that may be causative or syndromic in association. These include diseases affecting arteries around the circle of Willis, hematological conditions (sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia), vasculitis and autoimmune and multisystem diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa), genetic and developmental disorders (Alagille syndrome, Down syndrome), other vasculopathies and extracranial cardiovascular diseases (coarctation of the aorta, fibromuscular dysplasia), and metabolic diseases and renal disorders (type I glycogenosis, polycystic kidney disease) .\n\n【3】Our case highlights a young female with apparent coronary artery disease that was suspected to be related to the rare extracranial manifestations of MMD. This case presents the rare instance of possible cardiac manifestations rarely associated with the typical sequela MMD.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 37-year-old woman with known MMD presented to our medical center with complaints of altered mental status, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient also endorsed mild dyspnea and nonproductive cough. The patient denied associated palpitations, syncope, or fever.\n\n【7】Initial vitals showed a blood pressure of 101/69 mm Hg, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, and SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100% on 2 L nasal cannula. Physical examination showed bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, and flaccid paralysis of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. The patient was alert and orient to person but not to place or time. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【8】The patient’s past medical history included MMD which was initially diagnosed in 2016 after suffering intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) which involved the basal ganglia. The patient underwent extensive evaluation to assess the underlying cause of the sudden cerebral insult. The diagnosis was confirmed after magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and cerebral angiogram revealed stenosis of the right and left internal carotid arteries as well as the vertebral arteries and anterior cerebral arteries. The patient underwent a combination of balloon angioplasty and bilateral internal carotid artery stent placement. It was determined at the time of diagnosis that the patient had MMD with stage III involvement according to the Suzuki staging model . The patient had no significant family history. Home medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, gabapentin 600 mg twice daily alongside duloxetine, tramadol, and omeprazole.\n\n【9】During the current admission, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed that confirmed a left ventricular systolic function that was severely reduced, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 23% by the biplane method of disks alongside apical akinesis. TTE imaging also revealed a moderate size apical left ventricular thrombus . The left atrium was normal in size, and there was no evidence of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve was normal in structure and function with no hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The right ventricular function was moderately reduced with evidence of a hypokinetic apex and right ventricular free wall. There was trace tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimated at 19.0 mm Hg . At that time, the differential diagnosis included ischemic cardiomyopathy. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest with contrast showed no evidence of coronary calcification. Two prior echocardiographic evaluations, completed in the preceding 18 months, showed an LVEF of 55% with no evidence of regional wall abnormalities. The patient was admitted, and further imaging was obtained. The patient was subsequently started on intravenous (IV) heparin 25,000 units (18 units/kg/h).\n\n【10】Diagnosis\n\n【11】The patient underwent further evaluation with a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in order to better characterize the nature of the left ventricular mass and assess for any underlying ischemic disease contributing to the patient’s presentation. CMR remonstrated a large thrombus measuring 3.0 × 1.2 cm in the apex and apical anterior wall alongside a normal left ventricular size with severe systolic dysfunction, LVEF 22%. There was severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall and akinesis of the apex and apical lateral wall. Imaging also showed near transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the apex, transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the apical and mid lateral wall as well as greater than 75% subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the apical and mid anterior wall . This was consistent with an infarction pattern with no significant viability in these territories. Right ventricular imaging showed a normal right ventricular size with severe systolic dysfunction, right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) 13% with mild bi-atrial enlargement .\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】A multidisciplinary meeting was arranged in order to evaluate the patients’ appropriateness for coronary angiography, and it was determined that it would not be in the best interest of the patient to pursue further invasive testing. This plan was formed based on a shared decision making with the family and the multidisciplinary team. The patient lacked capacity to give informed consent due to prior debilitating CVA. The patient was scheduled to undergo cardiac CT in the outpatient setting. The patient was continued on warfarin, aspirin, and high-intensity statin therapy. The patient was continued on carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, and furosemide for medical management optimization.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】Patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. No further outpatient evaluations or testing was conducted.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Our case presents a young female with evidence of ischemic cardiac disease that was suspected to be attributed to extracranial manifestations of MMD. Initial workup showed evidence of a severely depressed ejection fraction alongside evidence of a left ventricular aneurysm and thrombus. Further investigation showed evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities that was suspected and later confirmed to be due to underlying ischemic disease that we suspected to be related to extracranial steno-occlusive manifestation of MMD which is typically associated with cerebrovascular manifestations primarily. This presentation is atypical in a young female and highlights the importance of evaluating the possibility of unordinary manifestations of a disease usually associated with cerebrovascular events.\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of MMD is related to impaired inflammatory response or defects in cellular repair mechanisms. These changes have been associated with increased angiogenesis-related factors, high levels of fibroblast growth factor, which may stimulate arterial growth, have been found in the vascular intima, media, and smooth muscle as well as cerebrospinal fluid among patients with MMD . Vessel abnormalities characterized by narrowed or blocked blood flow often occur in the major blood vessels in the circle of Willis and in the smaller collateral vessels in people with MMD. These abnormalities may be caused by an accumulation of fibrous and cellular material in the inner lining of the vessels, as well as by changes in the internal elastic structure and thinning of the middle layer of the vessels. A defining feature of MMD is the development of a network of enlarged and dilated small arteries as a means of compensating for the impaired blood flow. In addition to affecting the intracranial vessels, stenosis caused by thickening of the inner lining of the vessels may also occur in the extracranial and systemic arteries, including the cervical carotid, and renal arteries.\n\n【19】Although involvement of the coronary blood supply is not typically associated with the sequelae of MMD, the well-described extracranial involvement does raise the question of whether coronary involvement of MMD may be the inciting contributor in our patients’ presentation especially in the absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. This hypothesis is driven by the presence of apparent infarcted cardiac tissue on cardiac MRI alongside the development of severely reduced cardiac function and an aneurysmal ventricular wall. There have been reports of patient’s coronary involvement in MMD with cases ranging from stenosis of the coronary arteries to provocation-induced vasospasm of the arteries . Two patients presented with reduced ejection fractions such as ours and one patient presented with symptoms of heart failure but was expired on arrival . It is difficult to assess the exact etiology of our patient coronary involvement as cardiac angiography was not conducted.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】MMD is a complex disease associated with the pathophysiological process of arterial stenosis and small vessel collateralization that is classically associated with cerebrovascular events related to the underlying pathological arterial architecture. Although rarely described in the literature, MMD can have associated extracranial manifestations specifically those with involvement in the coronary artery architecture. This coronary involvement may contribute to a host of disease complications and as described in our case ischemic cardiac disease. We highlight this case and provide a comprehensive literature review of previous cases with similar manifestations to help clarify possible atypical manifestations of this complex disease.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】This case highlights the possibility of coronary artery manifestations in a patient with known MMD. Although not readily described in the literature, MMD does have a broad extracranial involvement that we believe may extend to the coronary arteries.\n\n【24】Video 1.

{"seq_id": "700a1b90-f757-41c3-9809-763341e80561", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is a rare valvular abnormality and is primarily seen in younger women . It is rarely found as an isolated valvular defect, but rather is a common sequela of rheumatic heart disease and is generally associated with mitral stenosis . Other less frequent causes of TS include carcinoid syndrome, vegetations due to infective endocarditis, systemic conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, metastatic tumors, radiation therapy and congenital abnormalities such as atresia or stenosis . TS leads to an elevated right atrial pressure due to a pressure gradient between the right atrium and ventricle. Due to elevated right sided pressures, patients with TS frequently present with signs of right heart failure, including fatigue and exertional syncope. Hepatic congestion and ascites causing abdominal discomfort, and lower extremity edema can also be seen in severe cases of TS .\n\n【2】The passage of permanent pacemaker lead through the tricuspid valve has been known to be associated with tricuspid regurgitation and stenosis . Initially, it was observed in the setting of endocarditis associated with permanent pacemaker lead . The presence of vegetation due to endocarditis would lead to tricuspid regurgitation, and rarely to TS . This was known as “functional tricuspid stenosis” . However, since the 1980s, authors have described pacemaker lead-induced TS in the absence of endocarditis . The likely underlying mechanism is adherence between the lead and the sub-valvular tissue causing mechanical irritation or fibrosis secondary to leaflet perforation and/or laceration . Occasionally the permanent pacemaker lead forms a loop in the right ventricle which predisposes to adhesions and reactive fibrosis . However, cases have been reported of TS with no discernible lead looping or leaflet perforation .\n\n【3】During pregnancy, an increase in cardiac output occurs secondary to an increased preload due to a rise in blood volume, reduced afterload due to decline in systemic vascular resistance, and an increased maternal heart rate . This increase in cardiac output during pregnancy can result in cardiac decompensation if concomitant valvular heart disease is present. Presence of TS may lead to overt heart failure and other grave complications including recurrent miscarriages . A patient with multivalvular heart disease having recurrent miscarriages that were solely attributed to presence of TS has been reported . The proposed mechanism was that TS causes low cardiac output which leads to decreased uterine blood flow and impaired venous drainage which ultimately leads to decreased viability of pregnancy . However, the specific impact of isolated TS on pregnancy is still undetermined.\n\n【4】The management of TS is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion due to limited literature. No specific recommendations are available regarding the management of TS in the presence of permanent pacemaker leads. The available options for management of TS secondary to permanent pacemaker lead include medical management, balloon valvuloplasty (with or without removal of pacemaker lead), or tricuspid valve replacement. The common practice includes pre-pregnancy counseling and close monitoring by expert physicians during pregnancy . Here we describe the management and outcomes of a 33-year-old female with pacemaker lead-induced TS, prior to and post pregnancy.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 33-year-old female presented to the office for prepregnancy counseling. She was complaining of intermittent palpitations associated with dyspnea on exertion. Her past medical history was remarkable for symptomatic congenital complete heart block for which a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted at the age of 15 years, as well as essential hypertension and asthma. On presentation, she was 100% atrial-sensed ventricular-paced, dual-chamber pacing (DDD) mode. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Her physical exam was significant for grade 3/6 diastolic murmur along the left sternal border. Physical examination was negative for rales/crackles on lung auscultation, peripheral edema, or ascites.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】On transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient had a normal left ventricular function, moderate to severe TS with mild regurgitation, and a tricuspid valve area of 0.88 cm <sup>2 </sup> . The mean gradient across the tricuspid valve was 19.4 mm Hg . The anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve seemed to be tethered down by pacing lead. Due to physiological increase in cardiac output during pregnancy, there was concern about severe TS leading to overt failure. Hence, an intervention was deemed necessary prior to conception.\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】The patient underwent a successful tricuspid balloon valvuloplasty, and the mean gradient across the tricuspid valve decreased from 19.4 to 5 - 7 mm Hg. There was no change in lead impedances or pacing thresholds after the procedure. Subsequently, patient achieved an uneventful pregnancy with close surveillance. Follow-up echocardiographic findings were stable throughout pregnancy, and she had a normal vaginal delivery at term with no complications.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】She presented for a routine follow-up 2 years after her valvuloplasty and was found to have elevated impedance and threshold but adequate sensitivity in the right atrial lead. The device was switched from DDD mode to ventricular pacing (VDD) mode which resulted in 100% atrial sensing and 100% ventricular pacing. She presented again 2 more years later with worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent palpitations. Repeat echocardiogram showed restenosis of the tricuspid valve with a mean gradient of 14 mm Hg along with a valve area of 0.72 cm <sup>2 </sup> . She wanted to conceive again so a repeat balloon valvuloplasty was planned. She underwent balloon valvuloplasty with an 1.8 × 6 cm balloon dilation catheter followed by a 25 mm balloon. However, there was still no change in degree of TS and the mean gradient remained high after the procedure. The case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgery and a tricuspid valve replacement was planned. She underwent successful tricuspid valve replacement with 33 mm Epic valve. During the procedure the right atrial lead was repositioned due to elevated impedance. The right ventricular lead was disconnected, retained, and sewn over and an epicardial ventricular lead was placed. She was able to conceive again and delivered at term with no complications. Repeat echocardiogram 2 years later showed a mean gradient of 5.5 mm Hg across the bioprosthetic tricuspid valve and the patient denied any symptoms of dyspnea or palpitations.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Our patient had moderate to severe TS secondary to adhesion of the pacemaker lead to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and wanted to conceive. She underwent balloon valvotomy prior to pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy. The patient attained pregnancy with no complications. However, in the planning of her second pregnancy, the patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty again for tricuspid restenosis that was unsuccessful. It was later followed by tricuspid valve replacement with repositioning of the right atrial and right ventricular leads. We suspect that the presence of permanent pacemaker lead contributed to the development of early restenosis after the first procedure.\n\n【16】Severe TS is classified as a mean pressure gradient of 5 mm Hg or more, inflow time-velocity integral of greater than 60 cm, a pressure half-time (T <sub>1/2 </sub> ) of 190 ms or more, and a valve area by continuity equation of 1 cm <sup>2 </sup> or less . As per European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease, intervention on the tricuspid valve is usually carried out at the time of intervention on other valves in patients who are symptomatic despite being on medical therapy . Percutaneous balloon tricuspid dilatation has been performed in a few cases but frequently induces significant regurgitation. The choice between valve repair or valve replacement depends on valve anatomy and surgical expertise . For individuals with symptomatic TS and with low to moderate surgical risk, tricuspid valve surgery is recommended over balloon valvotomy alone . Overall, there is a scarcity of data on long-term outcomes of either procedure.\n\n【17】The management of TS secondary to permanent pacemaker lead is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion. Medically, patients with symptomatic TS, including those with lower extremity edema and hepatic congestion can be treated with loop diuretics but efficacy is limited in the long term . Cases have been described where TS was successfully treated with percutaneous tricuspid valvuloplasty without the removal of the permanent pacemaker lead . Other options for management include permanent pacemaker lead removal with tricuspid valve replacement or permanent pacemaker lead removal with valvuloplasty . Data regarding tricuspid balloon valvotomy outcomes and studies comparing balloon valvotomy with valve surg­ery in the presence of permanent pacemaker lead is limited. A recent meta-analysis describes the management of mitral stenosis in pregnancy guided by the Wilkins score and the severity of sub-valvular disease . However, no similar score or studies are available to help in the management of TS. Overall, there is a lack of data on long-term results on any form of medical or surgical interventions for management isolated TS, especially when permanent pacemaker is present.\n\n【18】To our knowledge, we presented the only case highlighting the management of pacemaker lead-induced TS prior to pregnancy. The limitation to our case is that the management may not be generalizable. More studies are needed to help further guide TS management especially in this patient population. In our opinion, patients with moderate to severe TS secondary to pacemaker leads would likely benefit from tricuspid valve replacement compared to balloon valvuloplasty as the possibility of later restenosis of the valve is very high. Leaving the permanent pacemaker lead in place further increases the possibility of restenosis in case of balloon valvuloplasty. We conclude that more data is needed in this regard especially considering the increased use of permanent pacemakers.\n\n【19】Learning points\n\n【20】Clinicians may consider that patients with moderate to severe TS secondary to pacemaker leads may likely benefit more, prior to conceiving, from a tricuspid valve replacement compared to balloon valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty alone while leaving the PPM lead in place may lead to high possibility of restenosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Annual incidence of VTE is estimated to be between 0.5% and 20% depending on the cancer type and background risk . In a population-based case-control study, patients with hematologic malignancies had the highest risk of VTE, followed by patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancers . Cancer patients often have a hypercoagulable state due to the production of substances with procoagulant activity like cancer procoagulant, proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines and upregulation of tissue factor expression on tumor cells, endothelial cells, and circulating monocytes . The risk of venous thrombosis in cancer patients is also increased due to various other factors including chemotherapeutic drugs, surgery, hospitalization and placement of central venous catheters .\n\n【2】Bevacizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor that has improved survival rates among patients with cancers of lung, colon and glioblastomas. Bevacizumab has been associated with arterial and venous thromboembolism occurring during the treatment period . We describe two cases of venous thrombosis that occurred several weeks after stopping bevacizumab, raising the question of a delayed adverse drug effect.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 72-year-old female initially presented to an outside hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 3 weeks. Her past medical history was significant for controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her family history was significant for heart failure and stroke. She was worked up with a CT scan of the abdomen which showed extensive hepatic metastatic disease, minimal ascites and right mesenteric pericolonic lymphadenopathy. A colonoscopy was performed that showed an ulcerated near-obstructing 6 cm mass in the proximal ascending colon. Biopsies confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. She was referred to our institution for further care. Patient was started on 5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin (mFOLFOX6) and bevacizumab. She tolerated chemotherapy very well. However, bevacizumab was discontinued after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy due to wound dehiscence with some drainage at the port site.\n\n【6】Two months later, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. She was seen in the clinic. Her Physical examination was unremarkable except for 2 + pedal edema. A CT scan of the chest showed acute pulmonary embolism involving the right upper lobe and posterior segment of the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries. CT scan of the chest did not reveal any pulmonary metastasis and a CT scan of the abdomen later on, revealed stable appearance of thickening of the cecum, hepatic and nodal metastatic disease. Patient was admitted to the hospital for further management with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 48-year-old female presented to emergency department with chest pain and dyspnea. She had a cardiac workup and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) which was treated medically with heparin drip for 72 hours and aspirin. A CT scan of the chest was also obtained and was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed a 1.6 cm right upper lobe nodule with hilar adenopathy. She underwent bronchoscopy and hilar lymph node biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma of the lung. A PET/CT showed uptake in right upper lobe and right hilar and right mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A mediastinoscopy was performed and pathology revealed multiple positive mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient was initially treated with chemo-radiation (cisplatin and etoposide) but progressed. She was then treated with a combination of carboplatin, taxol and bevacizumab for 4 cycles which she tolerated very well and achieved a partial remission. She was then started on maintenance bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was discontinued after 4 months due to intolerance.\n\n【9】Three months later, the patient presented with dyspnea and chest pain and was found to have an acute pulmonary embolism. She was treated with enoxaparin with a questionable compliance. About two months later she also developed neck swelling and CT scan of the neck demonstrated a right internal jugular vein thrombosis. One month later, the patient reported recurrent headaches and MRI of the brain showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, right sigmoid sinus, right jugular bulb, and upper right internal jugular vein . MRI of the brain did not show any conclusive evidence of metastasis. CT scan of the chest showed stable appearance of lung mass and lymph nodes and bilateral malignant pleural effusions.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to free VEGF and forms immune complexes (IC). Vascular endothelial growth factor is involved in cytoprotection, proliferation of endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of nitric oxide and prostacyclin .\n\n【12】Bevacizumab prevents VEGF ligand-receptor binding and down-streams signaling . Anti-VEGF therapy inhibits the development of new tumor vasculature and causes the normalization of surviving tumor vasculature and the regression of existing immature tumor vasculature . Bevacizumab has been reported to cause arterial thrombosis, recurrent PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and venous thromboembolism . Shobha Rani Nalluri et al performed a meta-analysis of 7,956 patients from 15 phase II and II randomized clinical trial (bevacizumab, n = 4,292; control, n = 3,664) and concluded that bevacizumab increased the risk of VTE, both with high and low doses and the risk may vary with tumor type .\n\n【13】Bevacizumab related/induced thrombosis may be caused by several mechanisms. First, VEGF inhibition due to bevacizumab results in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction which exposes sub-endothelial procoagulant phospholipids and tissue factor, reduces production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and increases expression of proinflammatory cytokines . All these factors enhance coagulation and thrombosis. In addition, bevacizumab forms immune complexes (IC) with VEGF. These IC can directly induce platelet aggregation and granule release in vitro and cause thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in vivo . While some bevacizumab treated patients may not experience thrombosis during the treatment period, it is possible that cumulative, localized IC assembly and platelet interactions may occur over an extended time period due to the long half-life of the drug (about 20 days; range: 11 - 50 days) . This may explain a delayed effect resulting in thrombosis even after stopping bevacizumab. Finally, VEGF is a physiological regulator of both adult erythropoiesis and synthesis of erythropoietin. Inhibition of VEGF induces normally dormant adult hepatic expression of erythropoietin which may cause thrombosis due to increase in hematocrit and blood viscosity .\n\n【14】Our patients presented with thrombotic complications several weeks after stopping bevacizumab. Our patients were at increased risk of thrombosis due to cancer and its progression but bevacizumab may also have contributed to VTE even after discontinuation. We propose that VTE in these patients could have been related to the relatively long half-life of bevacizumab, IC formation and platelet interaction as described above.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Bevacizumab treated cancer patients are at increased risk of VTE and this risk may vary with tumor type. Bevacizumab induced thrombosis usually presents as an acute complication during the treatment period. Here we present two patients experiencing VTE several weeks after stopping the drug. We speculate that VTE in these patients could be a delayed drug adverse effect related to bevacizumab. A long term follow up of bevacizumab treated patients to assess for delayed side effects and analysis of data from various studies and trials involving bevacizumab may be useful to understand the true risk and etiology of such events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "80a72cb9-3650-424e-b624-5809ecb8ad64", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP) is a rare lesion of the bone, described by Nora et al . In their original paper, all lesions affected the tubular bones of the hands and feet. In the original series of Nora et al, only two of 35 cases were localized in the long bones. Ten years after the publication of that study, Meneses et al  presented a second study from the same clinic, consisting of 65 cases, none of which were Nora’s cases. In the Meneses study, localization in the long bones was observed in 17 of the 65 cases. Subsequent reports, however, have identified lesions in the long bones . Nora’s lesion is a mesenchymal lesion of the bone, characterized by exophytic growth involving bone, fibrous tissue and cartilage. BPOP is classically a broad-based calcified lesion attached to the cortex without any periosteal new bone formation, and with an intact underlying cortical bone . This lesion, commonly observed in the short tubular bones, is localized in the long bones in approximately 30% of cases . It has been reported in cases with progressive characteristics , and it has radiological features in long bones that differ from those observed in short, tubular bones. These features have necessitated a review of this type of tumor localized in the long bones, as the characteristics and behavior of such lesions have not yet been fully elucidated. High rates of recurrence have been reported in the follow-up of these lesions, which are often considered malignant bone tumors that require the application of surgical techniques, with high morbidity rates for its treatment. As a result, it has become necessary to perform a thorough review of this disease . To this end, clinical and radiological presentations, as well as the treatment of patients with such lesions, have been reported.\n\n【2】An extensive literature review was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE  and Google Scholar. Search terms included “bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation” and “Nora’s lesion”. The search was limited to the English language and to human cases. Studies were excluded if the lesions were located in areas other than the long bones. Studies with mixed populations of lesion location were included. The following information was collected from each study: year of publication, age and sex of patients, duration of follow-up, history of trauma, symptoms, size of lesion, plain radiographs, MRI and CT images features, treatment and outcome.\n\n【3】The literature search yielded 88 articles, of which 70 were excluded, for the following reasons: 50 focused on non-long bones (hands, feet, mandible, maxilla and skull); 13 had an English abstract but were written in another language. Seven of these studies were cytogenetic analyses. This review included the results of identified studies. The years of publication were 1983 - 2012, and the total number of patients was 43. All the studies were of level IV and V. A previous published case by us was also included in this study .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】The First Patient\n\n【6】The patient was admitted to our polyclinic 2 years ago with a complaint of right knee pain. A physical examination revealed no positive findings, other than local sensitivity. Plain radiography indicated destruction and periosteal reaction in the distal lateral cortex of the femur . The patient refused further tests and treatment during this admission to the polyclinic, and was later lost to follow-up. The patient was admitted once again, at the end of the second year following her first admission.\n\n【7】In the second admission, the 21-year-old woman presented with a history of a progressive, painful, palpable mass on the posterior, lateral and anterior aspect of the right distal thigh. She reported that the mass had enlarged since she had first noticed it, and she had a history of trauma. A clinical examination revealed a hard, immobile, multilobulated mass. Using plain radiography, the lesion was observed to be large, with evidence of cortical destruction and periosteal new bone formation. The radiographs showed a calcified, osseous mass extending into the anterolateral and posterior aspects of the distal femur . A computed tomography (CT) scan of the distal femur showed cortical destruction, cortical perforation and periosteal reaction . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, lobulated mass wrapped around the knee anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly . At a macroscopic level, the multilobular mass had wrapped the distal femur, causing destruction in the cortex . In addition, the mass had perforated the lateral cortex, and medullary infiltration was present. BPOP (Nora’s lesion) was diagnosed after histopathological examination.\n\n【8】The Second Patient\n\n【9】A 19-year-old man presented to our outpatient clinic with a 6-month history of progressive pain in the posterior distal knee. The patient had a history of trauma. Plain radiographs were normal, without any disruption in the bony architecture. In the MRI, the necrotic area was of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In the distal epiphysis metaphyseal area, femoral cortical perforation and posterior medullary invasion were present due to the mass. A CT scan of the distal femur demonstrated cortical perforation. BPOP (Nora’s lesion) was diagnosed after histopathological examination.\n\n【10】The same treatment was administered for both lesions. Marginal resection was performed on the soft tissue component of the lesion. Decortication was performed on the cortical segment of the lesion, and intralesional curettage was performed on its medullary component. In addition, local and combined adjuvant therapy was administered to both the cortical and medullary regions of the lesion, with cautery and phenol. One of the patients was followed for 10 months, while the other patient was followed for 12 months. Local recurrence was not observed in either of these patients.\n\n【11】Clinical Review\n\n【12】Sex and age\n\n【13】Information on sex and age was available for 21 of 43 patients. BPOP has no gender predilection, and it can occur at any age. The age distribution of the cases was 10 - 52 years (median, 26). BPOP occurs with equal frequency among men and women (ratio of 1:1).\n\n【14】Localization\n\n【15】Of the 43 cases, 23 were located in the upper limb bones. The most frequent sites were the femur (25%) and ulna (23%), followed by the radius. Twenty cases were localized in the metaphysis of the long bones, five in the diaphysis and one in the epiphysis metaphysis; localization was not defined in 17 of the cases.\n\n【16】Symptoms\n\n【17】Thirteen patients presented with painful swelling, eight with painless swelling and one with pain only on the posterior of the knee. The remaining 21 had no documented presenting features. Trauma history was inquired about in 21 of the 43 patients, and nine indicated a history of trauma.\n\n【18】Radiological features\n\n【19】Plain radiographs were available for 20 of the cases, but only a small number of cases had CTs (n = 11) and MRIs (n = 12) performed . Radiological features of the lesions were categorized as soft tissue mass, parosteal calcification, or ossification. Changes in the endosteal and periosteal aspects of the cortex and in the cortical bone itself (cortical destruction, perforation, thickening), changes in the medullary bone (marrow involvement), the presence of a radiolucent line (zone) between the lesion and the adjacent cortex, and soft tissue extension of the lesion were analyzed.\n\n【20】Plain radiographs\n\n【21】Nine of the cases showed a well-defined, cortical-based, calcified or osseous lesion. In five of the cases, the lesion had a broad base of attachment to the host bone, as well as a thickening cortex. In three of the cases, the margin of the lesion was not clearly defined, and there were lucent areas within lesion itself. One case had a pedunculated mass, one case had periosteal new bone formation and yet another case had a soft tissue density mass. CT provided a better delineation of the relationship between the lesion and the host bone. CT scans were performed on 12 patients. In these cases, the CT showed cortical destruction and perforation, as well as a medullary pattern. In two of the patients, the cortex of the bone was normal. In six patients, the lesions showed cortical destruction or perforation. Three cases had cortical reactive sclerosis. One lesion had a calcified soft tissue mass without any disruption to its bony architecture. MRI scans were performed on 12 patients. In two patients, the MRI revealed marrow involvement, and two patients had soft tissue extension. Lesion size varied between 2 cm and 10 cm (mean 4.53 cm) .\n\n【22】Treatment\n\n【23】Information regarding surgery technique was obtained for 21 of the patients. “Simple excision” (intralesional) was performed on seven lesions, and marginal resection was performed in seven patients, with marginal resection performed on the soft tissue component in two patients. Intralesional curettage, along with local adjuvant therapy, was administered to the medullary component. Decortication, along with local adjuvant therapy, was administered to the cortical component. A wide resection was performed in two patients, “shark-bite” surgery (removal of a margin of normal bone around the lesion) was performed in one patient and “shave excision” was performed in one patient. Surgical treatment was not conducted in one of the patients.\n\n【24】Recurrence\n\n【25】Follow-up information was obtained for 13 of the 43 patients, with the follow-up period ranging 10 - 90 months (mean 30.9 months). Information about local recurrence could not be obtained for 27 of the patients. Local recurrence was observed in three of the 16 lesions. One patient experienced four local recurrences within a year. Two of the patients with local recurrence were treated successfully by a second excision, while the other patient was treated with wide excision. Eleven patients described no local recurrence. One of the patients did not undergo any surgical treatment. Other complications included AVN of the humeral head, popliteal aneurysm and fibrosarcoma. No metastases or deaths related to these lesions were reported .\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation is a rare, reactive, mineralizing and ossifying mesenchymal lesion that is typically localized on the surfaces of bones in the feet and hands. Although the frequency of the type of lesion that localizes in the long bones is not clearly known, their ratio is estimated at approximately 30%. The type of lesion localized in the long bones demonstrates behavior that is different in certain respects from lesions localized in the short bones. Lesions observed in the short bones generally lead to complaints of swelling without pain . On the other hand, cases with lesions on the long bones present complaints of painful swelling in eight of the 22 cases. Lesions occurring on long bones can have radiological manifestations distinct from those observed in BPOP in the short bones. Classically, the radiographic appearance of lesions observed in the short bones involves a well-defined pedunculated or broad-based osseous protuberance along the cortical surface of the bone . The underlying bone is characteristically normal in appearance, without evidence of medullary invasion, reactive sclerosis, or periostitis; no periosteal new bone formation is involved . Cortical and medullary continuity of the lesion is confirmed by CT. MRI can demonstrate more specific attributes of the lesion, which are associated with the normal underlying bone and adjacent soft tissues. Lesions localized in the long bones can demonstrate aggressive radiological progression. The imaging appearance of certain lesions observed in the long bones seem to be more aggressive than previously thought, demonstrating infiltration of the soft tissue at the periphery and cortical destruction along with medullary infiltration . In this study, information regarding cortical changes could be obtained only for 18 of the 43 lesions. Cortical changes (cortical thickening, cortical destruction, cortical perforation and periosteal reaction) were present in 12 (66%) of these 18 patients. In three cases, the margins of the lesions were not clearly defined, and there were lucent areas within the lesion itself. Information regarding medullary invasion and soft tissue retention (marrow involvement, soft tissue extension) could be obtained only for 17 of the 42 patients. Medullary invasion and soft tissue retention were identified in four (23.5%) of these 17 lesions. Due to their radiological features, the major challenge was differentiating these lesions on the long bones from radiologically similar conditions, especially from malignant bone tumors, such as parosteal, classic osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Taking into account the data in the literature, and based on our own opinion, we believe that this lesion observed in the long bones consists, clinically and radiologically, of four phases, and that the radiological imaging of these lesions varies according to location and stage. Initially, the lesion is located in the soft tissue adjacent to the bone, with no continuity between the lesion and the bone cortex. This stage (stage I) is similar to the radiological and clinical findings of myositis ossificans . The lesion then begins to grow slowly, forming a radiolucent line (zone) between the lesion and the adjacent cortex. In this stage (stage II), the radiological and clinical findings are similar to those of parosteal osteosarcoma . In the next stage (stage III) , and the lesion comes into contact with the cortex. Cortical thickness or cortical destruction then begins to develop. The clinical and radiological findings are similar to those of florid reactive periostitis and periosteal malignant bone tumors. In the last stage (stage IV) , and the lesion causes cortical perforation, along with medullary invasion. The radiological and clinical findings are similar to those of malignant bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma and conventional chondrosarcoma.\n\n【28】There is no disagreement regarding the histopathological features of the lesion. Histologically, the lesions are characterized by three components: a cellular cartilaginous cap, an unusual mineralized cartilaginous matrix and a fibrovascular stroma . Histologically, BPOP presents as a cartilage-capped exostosis. The cap is cellular with focal atypia, and the subchondral area is composed of fibrovascular tissue. The presence of an unusual form of calcified cartilage that stains blue on hematoxylin and eosin stain is characteristic. This feature, which has come to be known as “blue bone”, was first noted by Meneses et al . The absence of cellular atypia helps distinguish this lesion from malignant bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma.\n\n【29】Many factors have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of Nora’s lesion. Some authors have attempted to reclassify Nora’s lesion as a neoplastic process , and a specific genetic translocation has been identified . Some authors believe that the initiating event is trauma with subsequent subperiosteal hematoma . Some authors have claimed the existence of a continuum between florid reactive periostitis (FRP), BPOP, and turret exostosis . In some cases, with available follow-up imaging, Dhondt et al  noticed a radiographic evolution, from the more characteristic FRP to BPOP, and finally, to turret exostosis. In support of this theory, Sundaram et al  reported a series of three patients with presumptive diagnoses of FRP based on radiological findings. These lesions were allowed to progress, and imaging findings were suggestive of BPOP. However, histological correlation for each imaging stage was not available. Within the context of the review performed in our study, no histopathological study in support of this theory could be found. Our view is that trauma could be the triggering factor for Nora’s lesion, as 9% of the 21 patients questioned in this study had a positive history of trauma. On the other hand, this lesion may have findings that are radiologically and clinically similar to other lesions, such as MO, FRP, osteochondroma and turret exostosis. However, we do not agree with the view that this lesion represents an intermediate stage of other lesions, such as MO, FRP, osteochondroma and turret exostosis. This is because we believe that BPOP has the radiological stages mentioned above, and that each stage bears the histopathological characteristics of BPOP. One of our cases was stage III, while two others were stage IV. The diagnosis of each one of these lesions was confirmed with histopathological examination. Moreover, numerous case presentations identified at stages I and II are histopathologically diagnosed as BPOP . Stage I and III presentations of Nora’s lesion have been reported in the literature; Abramovici et al  reported two cases. The first was a lesion in the femur, which also demonstrated cortical invasion (stage III), while the second case was localized entirely within the soft tissues, with no demonstrable attachment to the underlying bone (stage I). It was postulated that this second case might reflect a very early case of histologically proven BPOP that could have been confused with myositis ossificans.\n\n【30】As it is localized in the long bones, it is difficult to distinguish this lesion clinically and radiologically from many other tumors or tumor-like lesions. Differential diagnosis considerations for this lesion include myositis ossificans, turret exostosis, florid periostitis, osteochondroma and osteosarcoma. The main differential diagnosis to be considered is myositis ossificans. This non-neoplastic lesion generally occurs adjacent to the larger muscles following trauma, and it has a centripetal pattern of ossification. It is difficult to distinguish this lesion radiologically and clinically from stage I Nora’s lesion; therefore, it must be distinguished according to histological criteria. When a cartilaginous component is present, it is distributed haphazardly. Turret exostosis and florid periostitis are related reactive processes of the bone that can have characteristics radiologically similar to BPOP. The cortical and medullary continuity in osteochondroma is uniform and without interruption. Radiologically, they can mimic malignant tumors, such as osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. It is sometimes difficult to obtain a differential diagnosis for these tumors clinically and radiologically, thus necessitating a histopathological examination for proper identification. Although it is known that this lesion is more commonly localized in the short, tubular bones within the skeletal system, we nevertheless believe that this lesion is not as uncommon to the long bones as is generally presumed. In this context, we believe that difficulties are experienced in its diagnosis due to its ability to mimic many different types of lesions radiologically. As such, a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis will likely result in the best outcome for the patient.\n\n【31】One of the most significant problems encountered with this disease is treatment. Reporting of this lesion in the long bones is particularly uncommon, with most reports being performed as case presentations. Among the rare case presentations that are reported, the lack of a common language regarding the applied treatment techniques, along with the fact that views regarding the disease etiology and the natural course of the disease are limited to assumptions, precludes the development of a common perspective regarding the treatment of this disease. There are many points that need to be answered regarding the treatment process. First of all, should the lesion be treated? Second, should the lesion be monitored? Third, if surgery is to be performed, which surgical technique should be applied? In this study, surgical treatment was conducted in all cases except one. However, despite the fact that nearly all papers are presented in a case report format, no detailed information was provided regarding the applied surgical techniques, nor was a common language used regarding the applied surgical techniques. Despite all these shortcomings, it is now known that this disease involves lesions that may be potentially progressive. Based on the currently available information, it is difficult to assess beforehand which types of lesions are capable of progression. Furthermore, although progression has been reported in BPOP, no cases of regression or spontaneous healing have been reported. As such, surgical resection should be the preferred treatment method, without resorting to disease monitoring. Due to the lack of local adjuvant therapy options, and the aggressive nature of the disease, Nora’s lesions continue to pose a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. Therefore, caution must be exercised when selecting the surgical technique to be performed. Techniques such as wide resection, marginal resection, intralesional excision and curettage have been suggested for the surgical treatment of Nora’s lesion. Intralesional excision and curettage appear to involve a high risk of local recurrence on the lesions observed in the small bones; therefore, these techniques should not be performed for the surgical treatment of the lesion. On the other hand, due to the high recurrence rate and occasionally atypical histological appearance of the lesion, we also believe that it is necessary to avoid wide resection techniques that might require serious reconstructive surgeries and which have high mortality rates, as no malignant transformations, metastases, deaths, or associated systemic diseases have been described thus far for patients with BPOP.\n\n【32】Our lack of sufficient knowledge and experience regarding this lesion, along with the fact that a common language has not been used when describing the treatment of reported cases, precludes us from presenting optimal information regarding the treatment of this disease. However, our opinion is that marginal resection might be sufficient for the treatment of this disease. By this, we mean a marginal excision that includes the resection of the reactive zone. This technique involves the removal of the pseudocapsule and periosteum, the decortication of underlying abnormal host bone, and the administration of intralesional curettage and local adjuvant therapy to the medullary component. Depending on its stages, we believe that the surgical technique to be administered in stages I and II of the lesion is marginal resection, while the administration of local adjuvant therapy (phenol and cauterization) in addition to marginal resection should be sufficient for stages III and IV.\n\n【33】Lesions observed in the small bones have a remarkable tendency to recur. Recurrence rates between 29% and 55% in a 2-year interval have been reported, and almost half of these patients experienced a previous second recurrence . No recurrence rates have been reported to date for lesions localized in the long bones. In this study, local recurrence was observed in three of 16 lesions. One of these recurrences was successfully treated with wide resection, while the other two were successfully treated with marginal resection.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】In light of the currently available information, the radiological and clinical diagnosis of this lesion appears to be difficult and complex. This is because the clinical and radiological appearance of the disease varies according to its stage, and it can mimic the radiological features of nearly all bone tumors. In this regard, the gold standard for disease diagnosis is histopathological examination. In this study, no spontaneous recovery was reported. We consider Nora’s lesion to be an aggressive lesion that causes cortical destruction and medullary infiltration, and which, by nature, is not self-limiting unless treated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2ba709f6-f930-437d-ab42-fc091ecf31c0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Intraabdominal abscesses after appendectomy are serious complications requiring surgical intervention. Moreover, they can cause subsequent complications and even fatal outcomes. Their locations vary: pelvic, subdiaphragmatic, interintestinal, subhepatic, retrocecal, intramesenteric, and so on . One of the rarest kinds of intraabdominal abscess is an abscess of the greater omentum . We present a very rare case of this complication that developed in a young adult patient after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 18-year-old male was urgently admitted on August 6, 2009 with typical symptoms of acute appendicitis 40 h after onset of the complaints. A blood test showed leucocytosis of 22.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The patient was operated on via McBurney’s approach. A large amount of purulent fluid was evacuated from the right iliac fossa and pelvis. The vermiform appendix was surrounded by part of the greater omentum. The former was gangrenous with a perforation 3 - 4 mm in diameter close to the cecal wall. The attached omentum was severely inflamed with hyperemia, edema, red-purple coloration (in parts) and fibrin adhesions. A typical appendectomy with an omental resection was performed. The inflamed area of the omentum was excised and ligated using caprone sutures 3/0. The pelvic cavity was drained and the wound was sutured.\n\n【4】Antibacterial treatment was administered (ceftriaxone 1 g twice daily intramuscularly, metronidazol 500 mg twice daily intravenously). Body temperature remained high (maximally 39 °С) for the first 3 days. On the 4th day postoperatively, a maculopapular rash appeared. A dermatologist suggested that the patient had acute allergic dermatitis as a complication of antibacterial therapy. Prednisolone and antihistamine drugs were added to the treatment regime. However, there was no improvement, and on the following day, against a background of the existing papulae and spots, small vesicles appeared. At that time, the pelvic drain was removed, and wound or intraabdominal complications were excluded. We suspected a diagnosis of chickenpox that was confirmed by the dermatologist. The patient was transferred to the infectious diseases hospital, where he was treated for the next 8 days and then discharged with clear improvement and natural evolution of the rash elements.\n\n【5】However, the patient started to complain of a dull pain in the area of the postoperative scar, accompanied by an increase in body temperature to 38 °С. He was readmitted on the 16th day after surgical intervention, with a suspected intraabdominal abscess. Examination revealed substantial tenderness in the right iliac fossa without rigidity or signs of peritoneal irritation. Examination per rectum revealed no abnormalities. A blood test showed the following: leucocytosis 17.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, erythrocytes 4.7 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L and hemoglobin 129 g/L.\n\n【6】An ultrasound (US) examination revealed a non-homogeneous hypoechoic mass in the right iliac fossa, measuring 40 × 37 mm without clear borders, plus a small amount of free fluid. Based on the typical clinical data and US findings, we stopped the examination process, avoiding computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Indications for surgery were established, and the patient consented to the procedure.\n\n【7】The abdomen was opened via the old scar. There were no purulent collections in area of the approach. The cecum and appendectomy area appeared normal. We were able to palpate a firm mass surrounded by the greater omentum or formed by the omentum in the right colic gutter. The wound was extended in the cephalad direction. During the separation of the omental mass from the lateral abdominal wall, the abscess was drained and 10 - 15 mL of pus was discharged. Finally, the mass was mobilized, and the omentum forming this mass was resected. The specimen removed was part of the greater omentum, and measured 12 × 8 cm with an abscess cavity of ovoid form measuring 4 × 3 cm . A caprone ligature was removed from the abscess cavity. After specimen removal, a cavity measuring about 5 × 5 cm appeared in the retroperitoneal fat, with mild capillary bleeding. This was packed with two gauze tampons and a rubber tube. The wound was closed up to the tampons. Bacteriologic tests showed the growth of Escherichia coli sensitive to most antibiotics. The postoperative course was uneventful. The tampons were replaced under narcosis on the 6th day, and were completely removed on the 15th day. The patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition on the 15th postoperative day.\n\n【8】On follow-up 4 years later, the patient had no complaints and was in a good condition. He now has a small aponeurotic defect in area of the scar without the clinical appearance of hernia.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】An omental abscess is a very rare complication after appendectomy. In certain monographs on postappendectomy complications and intraabdominal abscesses, this condition is not even mentioned . However, some papers on this topic have been presented in the literature. Most of them were published in the 1970s and 1980s, and almost all in Soviet periodicals .\n\n【11】An omental abscess can be considered as a particular type of omentitis. Primary omentitis develops without prior surgery as a result of torsion, ischemia, thromboembolic lesions, or hematogenous or lymphogenous transfer of infection. Secondary omentitis is usually a complication of an inflammatory process in another abdominal organ, but can develop after contamination of the omentum during surgery (for example, its resection) and after invasion by foreign bodies from the hollow digestive organs . Omentitis can be classified according to clinical course (acute and subacute), and degree of inflammation (catarrhal, phlegmonous, phlegmonous-necrotic, phlegmonous-abscessed). Secondary omentitis is diagnosed much more frequently than primary omentitis , and non-abscessed forms more often than omental abscess . Purulent omentitis after appendectomy can be considered a very rare complication. Cortesi et al  described only one case in a group of patients operated on for acute appendicitis (n = 8738), with an incidence of 0.011%. Bairov and Golovanov analyzed 18 years of data from pediatric hospitals of two Soviet cities, Leningrad and Arkhangelsk (47,859 operations for acute appendicitis), and found only 10 cases of omental abscess (0.02%) .\n\n【12】Interestingly, omentitis in general and omental abscess in particular - as a complication after appendectomy - are much more common in the pediatric population than in adults, and this has been emphasized in many relevant publications . Adult cases of omental abscess after appendectomy are extremely rare. Two cases were presented by Druianov et al , and one case by Cortesi et al . Paliuga described a patient that was operated on for intraabdominal abscesses in different locations three times after appendectomy; one of the abscesses was located in the greater omentum . In some papers on acute and chronic omentitis, there was no clear description of prior surgical interventions . Thus, in material from Soviet authors, there were six patients with an abscess in the middle of an inflamed omentum, and all had received prior surgery .\n\n【13】Purulent omentitis after appendectomy is almost always recorded in patients operated on for destructive (usually gangrenous) appendicitis complicated by peritonitis . In most cases, primary appendectomy was combined with an omental resection for secondary inflammatory involvement of the greater omentum .\n\n【14】Clinical symptoms of the omental abscess are local abdominal pain, febrile fever and signs of systemic inflammation. Palpation shows local tenderness and often a mass . These features are not present immediately after appendectomy, but are usually delayed by 7 - 8 days  to 25 - 30 days . Until that time, in most cases the patient’s condition becomes satisfactory, body temperature is normal, and inflammatory changes recorded via blood test improve . After this “lucid interval”, some patients are discharged, and are only readmitted following the appearance of the abovementioned symptoms. Previously published data show that a relapse of indolent inflammation in the omentum can be provoked by viral infection , as in our patient.\n\n【15】There are few data on the efficacy of different instrumental methods in the diagnosis of purulent omentitis. We believe it is caused by the fact that most relevant papers were published before the introduction of the most valuable visualization tools (US examination, CT, magnetic resonance imaging) into widespread clinical practice. Some authors noted the insufficient efficacy of US , except in cases in which the inflammatory focus in the omentum is located near the abdominal wall. In contrast, Bairov and Golovanov  considered US as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of omentitis. Iudin et al used electromyography for topical and differential diagnosis of secondary omentitis in 5 of 17 cases  and recommended this method. However, their recommendation is now out of date due to the high level of development of direct visualization techniques (US, CT, magnetic resonance imaging). In our case, the diagnosis was confirmed by US only, but in difficult cases CT can improve the diagnostic accuracy , as in other omental lesions, for example, partial torsions and infarctions .\n\n【16】The most effective treatment of an omental abscess is its removal within the limits of healthy tissues . The other surgical methods described in the literature (simple drainage with packing and draining of an abscess cavity, drainage combined with marsupialization of the cavity ) should be used in special situations only, for example, in a combination of omental abscess with severe perivisceritis in which omental mobilization and resection are dangerous due to the potential for bowel loop injury. The omental resection is considered as optimal surgery for the omental abscess until now . We believe, only in primary omental abscess a less-invasive intervention (the laparoscopic drainage  or the transparietal drainage under US or CT guidance) is justified. In our case, the laparoscopic surgery was much more risky than the open surgery in terms of possible bowel injury, and US-guided drainage was considered as non-reliable due to a high risk of the abscess recurrence. It was thought that an abscess was related to an infected ligature, and the simple abscess drainage without ligature removal could be unsuccessful. A similar situation can appear after the less-invasive drainage of the fecalith-contained abscess. The radical treatment in those cases is the open abscess drainage with fecalith(s) removal, otherwise the abscess recurrence is very likely .\n\n【17】The most important tool for the prevention of purulent omentitis is accurate omental resection. The omentum should be resected by small parts, avoiding the formation of large remnants, with ligation by thin threads . The resection line should be drawn on a non-inflamed area .\n\n【18】The presented case is an extremely rare case of a greater omental abscess that developed after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in a young adult patient. However, given the anamnestic, clinical and instrumental data, we can consider this case as rather typical for intraabdominal abscesses. We hope this case will remind colleagues of the possibility of this postoperative complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although the origin of Merkel cell has been debated, MCC is considered a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) due to its characteristic histopathologic appearance expressing CD56, neurofilament protein (NFP) and chromogranin A .\n\n【2】It was first described by Toker in 1972 . It is an uncommon skin neoplasm of the elderly population. The majority of patients with MCC present with localized disease at diagnosis and few patients have regional lymph node (LN) involvement and distant metastases. Although it has been previously reported in various anatomical sites, LN metastatic MCC in the absence of a primary site is extremely rare and for this reason there is no standard approach to its management .\n\n【3】Curative surgery is commonly recommended to manage localized MCC. Nevertheless, specific postoperative palliative treatments for MCC have emerged, including radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy, due to the high local failure rate and the aggressive nature of the disease .\n\n【4】We present a case of a 63-year-old patient who underwent a diagnostic biopsy of an inguinal lump at his local hospital which was proven to be an infiltrated LN by an MCC. Following his imaging staging with computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which showed only abdominal LN disease, she was referred to our department for adjuvant RT after surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 63-year-old female was admitted to her local hospital with edema of the left lower extremity and motor dysfunction. On clinical examination, a large palpable inguinal mass was identified. It was oval, lobulated, firm, fixed to underlying tissue with normal overlying skin. She reported a history of a palpable mass measuring 2 cm of 2 years’ duration in the left inguinal region with progressive growth. The patient’s medical history was not significant and no suspicious skin lesions were identified. Triplex US of the left extremity revealed normal depiction of the deep veins of the lower extremity without thrombosis but in the abdominal region, swollen rounded LNs were observed. Diagnostic workup imaging including abdominal-pelvic contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a large lobulated mass measuring 7 × 7 cm in the left inguinal area adjacent to the femoral vessels and an enlarged left external iliac LN of size 3.7 × 3 cm. The mass was compressing the left common femoral vein and remained inseparable from the vein as well as from the adductor muscles ventrally. Further diagnostic evaluation including CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrated only a cyst in the right kidney. The results of laboratory examinations, including complete blood count, renal, bone hepatic and coagulation profiles, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and CA-12-5, revealed no abnormalities. With no primary site of cancer identified, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the mass was performed. According to the histological report, it was a malignancy with extensive necrosis, but it did not result in a definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis included malignant neoplasm of small cells and lymphoma. Thus, the patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node. The biopsy specimen showed a low-grade neoplasm with morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics, which were consistent with the diagnosis of MCC. Histopathologically, the neoplastic cells were monomorphic, basophilic, small, round with ovoid vesicular nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for LMWKer, Ker20, Nf, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The tumor cells were negative for TTF1, Ker7, HMWKer, p63, Ker5/6, S-100, c-Kit and LCA. Because of the size and involvement of the femoral vessels, chemotherapy was recommended as the most appropriate curative option by the multidisciplinary team. Systemic chemotherapy was administered as six cycles cisplatin/etoposide- based combination schedule with remarkable clinical response. After chemotherapy, the CT imaging study revealed a reduction in size of the inguinal LN measuring 3.6 × 2.6 cm. The patient refused further treatment. Nonetheless, she was admitted again to the hospital 5 months later due to disease progression. The CT demonstrated the presence of the known lymphadenopathy in the left inguinal area with increased dimensions. She managed with partial left inguinal LN surgical excision due to invasion of the safenofemoral junction. The removal part was 14 × 9 × 3 cm and the histological examination showed almost complete invasion of the known malignant cells according to the patient’s history of MCC. Post-surgical PET scan showed low tracer uptake in the left external iliac node (SUVmax: 3.1) and in the left inguinal area (SUVmax: 3.5), with possible reactive etiology. Pathological tracer uptake of 18F-FDG (SUVmax: 3.4) was observed in the left adrenal gland, a finding that could be related to adenoma. There was no evidence of metabolically active lesions in the skin or internal organs. Subsequently, she attended to our Radiotherapy Department after 3 weeks so as to be delivered to her adjuvant radiation therapy. She received a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with a daily dose of 2 Gy in the inguinal region and a total dose of 46 Gy in the external iliac lymph nodes .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】It is difficult to diagnose MCC in an LN due to its similarity to other poorly differentiated small basophilic cell tumors, including metastatic melanoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic from other organs. Immunohistochemistry is necessary for the definitive diagnosis. On immunohistochemical staining, it is necessary to express the pattern of CK20 positivity along with positivity for any of the neuroendocrine markers such as, chromogranin A, synaptophysin or neuron specific enolase (NSE) and negative TTF-1 staining .\n\n【9】The origin of MCC has been debated and both neural crest cells as well as epithelial cells have been implicated. Due to the rarity of this malignancy, it has not yet been delineated in the case of metastatic to LNs unknown primary Mercel cell carcinoma (UPMCC), if the tumor arises de novo from neural cells located within the involved LNs or if the primary lesion undergoes spontaneous regression. It has been shown in MCC of a known skin primary there is clear association of the carcinogenesis process with infection from polyomavirus which is on the contrary is not seen in cases of UPMCC .\n\n【10】A chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan usually confirms LN involvement and reveals the extent of disease. Recently the role of PET/CT has been upgraded in depicting the sites of LN disease in MCC due to its high reported specificity and sensitivity, 98% and 90% respectively .\n\n【11】Currently, there is no standard approach to the management of MCC in the absence of a primary site. Mohs micrographic surgery is currently considered as the primary and complementary measure for controlling this serious disease. Since the disease is highly aggressive and the failure rate following surgery alone is high, RT is usually administered as temporary support for numerous patients with MCC. MCC cell lines have been demonstrated to be radiosensitive in vitro . Results have indicated that adjuvant RT, following initial surgery and resection for recurrent MCC and palliation is beneficial. A previous study reported that a radiation dose of 45 Gy had significant impact on local control and prolonged survival in nine patients, whereas a subset of seven patients who received < 45 Gy had a poorer outcome. MCC is considered to be resistant to chemotherapy; however, various agents have been used to treat MCC with variable results. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen is etoposide/cisplatin .\n\n【12】Although multimodal treatment with surgery, RT and chemotherapy results in excellent local control, local recurrence and distant metastases are ultimately developed, possibly owing to the characteristics of MCC or inadequate treatment. Therefore, the role of adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy and RT in MCC remains to be determined in future trials.\n\n【13】In conclusion, MCC presenting with LN involvement without an obvious primary site is uncommon and the diagnosis can be challenging. Meticulous workup for the primary focus as well as thorough pathological and immunohistochemical analysis must be carried out. Advances in understanding the origin and natural history of this rare entity would be helpful in establishing management guidelines in the future. Further investigations are needed to delineate the true natural history of this rare disease as well as the single best approach to treatment .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

MDE is an acquired skin condition of the elastic tissue generally affecting young women on the trunk and proximal extremities, rarely the thighs and face . We present a case of a patient with an unusual face presentation of this disorder, supporting the concept that MDE is an idiopathic distinct entity.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 53-year-old white woman, presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic, widespread, well-demarcated but irregularly shaped areas of skin fine wrinkling. Dermatologic examination reveals minimally raised papular yellow-skin colored lesions in chin, cheeks and forehead. These lesions were firm and linearly arranged in some areas . These lesions first appeared on forehead slowly spreading to her face. Subsequently, there was no family history of similar lesions, cutaneous disease, or connective tissue disease. In patient questioning, we learned that due to the early menopause, estradiol (2 mg) and norethisterone acetate preparation (1 mg) were used for 10 years, and that these lesions occurred in the last 1 year of drug use.\n\n【4】Histologically, basket-weave keratosis, normal epidermis, eosinophilic homogenization on mid-dermis and lymphocytic infiltration around vessels were seen on H&E section . Elastic von Gieson stain revealed focal loss of elastic fibers in the mid-dermis . Our case was compatible with MDE  because of the skin appearance of peau d’orange and histopathological findings.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】MDE is a rare, acquired condition affecting mid-dermis presented by band-like loss of elastic tissue limited to the mid-dermis  MDE and it usually affects women in their third to fifth decades of life .\n\n【7】Clinically, MDE is divided as three subtypes: type I: parallel arranged plaques of fine wrinkling to skin cleavage lines; type II: perifollicular papular protrusions with “peau d’orange” appearance; and type III: persistent reticular erythema, especially upper trunk . The characterization of this disease lesions involves the trunk and arms, and rarely, the thighs and face .\n\n【8】Histologically, band-like loss of elastic fibers in the mid-dermis is diagnostic. Inflammatory infiltrates may be present and vary in degree; elastophagocytosis and giant cells are occasionally noticed .\n\n【9】Ultra-structural studies reported macrophages phagocyte aberrant dense substance collections, loose aggregates of skeleton fibrils and degenerated elastic fibers . In addition, elastic fibers may be fragmented in MDE .\n\n【10】We still do not exactly know how elastolysis occurs. Some patients who were reported to have MDE also have an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. About one-fourth of the patients have story of oral contraceptive usage . Men get ill remarkably older than women . This interesting difference between the ages of onset may be explained by the hormone level variability between men and women . Aging is strongly related with collagen and elastin damage. Smoking is a well-known cause of aging of the skin and the face is particularly affected. Patroi et al have tried to find out if there is a connection between smoking and MDE . It is reported that MDE is aggravated by exposure to prolonged and intense UV light. Despite this, MDE is less common in areas which are considerably sun-exposed such as face and hands. Therefore, the suggestion that UV radiation is essential in the pathogenesis MDE is still suspicious .\n\n【11】Although MDE and some other inflammatory skin diseases such as urticaria, atopic dermatitis and granuloma annular are reported together, the pathogenetic relation between MDE and these diseases is unclear .\n\n【12】In differential diagnosis, pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis may resemble type II MDE. In contrast to pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis, MDE is characterized by perifollicular papular protrusions and a band-like loss of elastic tissue in the mid-dermis .\n\n【13】Finally, we reported a case with a rare localization, facial occurrence, rather than the classic full body occurrence. The lesion occurring in a highly sun-exposed part of the body may support Patroi et al’s theory that exposure to UV starts elastolysis. Besides, we believe that our case’s history of long-term usage of preperates including estrogen-progesterone may have a part in the etiological process of the lesion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

PPCM has a high risk of mortality with mortality rates reported between 1.36% and 30% despite optimal medical therapy . Recovery rates were reported as 44% for a partial recovery while 21% had complete recovery .\n\n【2】Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a form of mechanical circulatory support that are most often implanted for the management of advanced heart failure as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or as destination therapy. In select cases, an LVAD may also be implanted with the hope that it will allow time for the recovery of myocardial function. If sufficient recovery occurs, explantation of the LVAD may be possible . We describe a case of PPCM that we managed through implantation of an LVAD with the hope of allowing for myocardial recovery.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 38-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented 10 days postpartum with chest pain, shortness of breath and hypotension. The patient was G4P4 and she delivered her fourth child without complication. Several days after her delivery, the patient began to experience symptoms such as chest tightness, shortness of breath and inability to lie flat.\n\n【5】An echocardiogram was performed which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%, a left ventricular size of 6.3 cm and moderate mitral regurgitation. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Labs were significant for a B-type natriuretic peptide of 3411. Right heart catheterization revealed a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 35%. She was initially managed with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and milrinone for cardiac support.\n\n【6】She was transferred to our center for consideration of mechanical circulatory support given her severely abnormal hemodynamics. She was maintained on temporary support with the IABP with the hope that she would recover without the need for more durable mechanical assistance. However, her cardiac output remained depressed and repeat echocardiogram showed no sign of improvement. Seven days after transfer to Christ Medical Center, the patient received a HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec, Inc. Pleasanton, CA). Her hemodynamics and symptoms improved dramatically following implantation, and her postoperative course was uncomplicated.\n\n【7】She has had one readmission since implant due to ventricular tachycardia, which was thought to be secondary to volume depletion. She was successfully cardioverted and has not had any recurrence. She has been maintained on aggressive medical therapy with carvedilol, lisinopril and aldactone. She continues to do well 3 months following LVAD implantation, and her most recent echocardiogram shows an LVEF of 53% with an LV size of 5.0 cm. She is still being monitored to determine if her cardiac recovery is durable and will allow for LVAD explantation.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】PPCM is a condition characterized by new and rapid onset heart failure occurring between the last trimester of pregnancy and up to 6 months postpartum. This prevalence of PPCM is between 1:3,000 and 1:15,000 deliveries. Risk factors for PPCM include increased age, multiparity, preeclampsia, the use of tocolytics, twin pregnancy, malnutrition and cocaine abuse. The most common presentations are rapid onset cough, dyspnea and leg edema. PPCM appears similar to dilated cardiomyopathy although it presents acutely or subacutely . There is an increased risk for thrombus and arrhythmias.\n\n【10】Despite optimal medial therapy, PPCM carries a high risk of mortality with reports as high as 30% . In a case report, 44% had a partial recovery while 21% had complete recovery of their ejection fraction . Diagnosis is often clinical but is often made late and is widely misdiagnosed. Treatment includes the same medical therapy given to other forms of heart failure: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, diuretics and beta-blockers . PPCM patients who present in cardiogenic shock, which in a recent study was stated at an incidence of 13.1% of patients, require consideration of more aggressive therapies .\n\n【11】An LVAD is a device used in patients with severe heart failure to pump blood from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta . In some cases patients can recover back enough ventricular function to have the mechanical assist device removed. Less than 10% of patients were reported to have enough recovery to remove mechanical support. This is more commonly seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanism is related to multiple factors such as unloading, neurohormonal inhibition and the causation of myocardial injury . Another case report has been published involving a postpartum cardiomyopathy requiring LVAD support in which the LVAD was explanted 9 months after implantation and complete recovery of ventricular function was demonstrated 3 years later .\n\n【12】In our case, we opted for the use of an LVAD for the management of PPCM due to the persistence of cardiogenic shock despite medical therapy. Our patient has subsequently demonstrated significant recovery of her LV function, and may be a good candidate for LVAD explantation. This demonstrates the importance of early consideration of mechanical circulatory support in severe cases of PPCM that do not rapidly respond to medical therapy.\n\n【13】Learning objective\n\n【14】PPCM is a rare condition that is characterized by acute onset heart failure. It can resolve with medical therapy and time but there is often an underlying decrease in systolic function. From our case report, the patient did not have underlying cardiac disease and an LVAD was placed to provide circulatory support. These interventions temporarily alleviated the symptoms and further use of the LVAD or even transplantation will be determined after the patient is given time to recover cardiac function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "40a39ee3-9d65-4b2d-9a85-6e613487a801", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Small cell carcinoma of the ovary (SCCO) is a malignant and highly aggressive tumor, which tends to progress and spread very fast despite therapy. It is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. This type of tumor was first described in details by Dickersin and Scully in the 1980s . It mostly occurs in young women and adolescents, with a mean age of 23 yrs. (range 1 - 46)  at diagnosis. About 50% of patients presents with an advanced stage of disease at the moment of diagnosis . Two different histological varieties of SCCO have been described: one similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung, the other, more uncommon and less known, characterized by the presence of a large cell component (large cell variant of SCCO) . Approximately 60% of SCCO are associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia . Tendency to progression and recurrence are the main features of this malignancy. Many series published throughout the years highlight the poor prognosis of this tumor, despite the different treatment modalities applied. Many different therapeutical options have been considered in the treatment of SCCO, but nevertheless the outcome remains very poor and the mortality rate extremely high. A limited number of published studies are available, mainly represented by case reports . We report of three cases of SCCO with an extremely rapid progression and spreading of the disease, with ineffectiveness of the different treatment approaches utilized.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the Emergency Unit of our institution for symptoms suggesting bowel occlusion. Two weeks before she had undergone a left salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and multiple abdomino-pelvic biopsies, with the suspicion of a monolateral malignant ovarian germ cell tumor. Computed tomography (TC) scan revealed a massive, solid, abdomino-pelvic progression of disease. Therefore she underwent secondary surgery: a large neoplastic pelvic solid mass was detected, and a total abdominal hysterectomy with controlateral salpingo-oophorectomy, rectal and left large bowel nodules excisions were performed, along with omental, sigmoid and prevescical peritoneum multiple biopsies. Several neoplastic nodules of 1 - 2 cm. size in the abdominal peritoneum and diaphragmatic surface were left unresected. Microscopic examination of the surgical specimens revealed metastatic involvement from SCCO (stage IIIC G3, according to FIGO classification of gynaecological malignancies). Few days later a further abdomino-pelvic progression of disease was clinically observed and a diffuse internal mammary lymphadenopathy completely involving the sternum occurred. General conditions of the patients rapidly worsened, excluding the chance of an early adjuvant therapy. The patient died for disease progression five weeks after the first surgery.\n\n【5】Case 2\n\n【6】A 34-year-old patient presented with ascites, right pleural effusion and a right ovarian mass. Computed tomography scan revealed a 13 cm right, solid adnexal mass; serum CA 125 was 121 UI/mL, Βhcg 17 U/L, calcemia 4.1 mmol/L.\n\n【7】She underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, total omentectomy. Frozen-section histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an undifferentiated neoplasia suggestive of ovarian dysgerminoma. Through definitive histopathology report the diagnosis of SCCO  was made. Ten days after surgery she developed bowel obstruction. Computed tomography imaging documented massive abdomino-pelvic and lymphatic progression. At second laparotomy, uterus appeared completely infiltrated by the tumor, without surgical cleavage from the bladder; a left oophorectomy and ileo-transverse side to side anastomosis were performed, secondary to large bowel resection. Histological examination confirmed SCCO progression. Two weeks after surgery, adjuvant poli-chemotherapy was started according to VPBCAE regimen (vinblastin 6 mg/mq day 1, cisplatinum 90 mg/mq day 1, bleomycin 15 mg/mq day 2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/mq day 2, doxorubicin 45 mg/mq day 3, etoposide 200 mg/mq day 3, administered every 21 days). After two consecutive courses of chemotherapy a CT scan revealed massive abdomino-pelvic progression of disease. The patient soon developed bowel occlusion and died five months after diagnosis.\n\n【8】Case 3\n\n【9】A 53-year-old woman presented with a 19 × 10 × 9 cm biloculated solid ovarian cyst. Serum CA125 was 343 UI/mL. Preoperative calcium level was 3.32 mmol/L and LDH 696 UI/L.\n\n【10】She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and total omentectomy. A terminal ileum resection with ileo-colic side to side anastomosis was necessary due to intraoperative ileum perforation. A residual 5 cm neoplastic nodule, close to right internal iliac vessels, was left unresected. Histological diagnosis was of SCCO of the hypercalcemic type FIGO Stage IIIC. Three weeks after surgery, patient complained of fever and malaise. A CT scan revealed marked progression of disease: a 3 × 2.5 × 3.3 cm right IV costal metastasis associated with rib fracture was detected and several other solid nodules were also documented in both lungs, mediastinal and ascella lymphnodes, adrenal gland, pelvis, iliac and para-aortic lymphnodes and on the ileocolic serosa. Ten days later, the first course of adjuvant poli-chemotherapy regimen with PAVEP (cisplatin (P) 80 mg/mL day 1, adriamycin (A) 40 mg/mq day 1, vepeside (V) 75 mg/mq/day days 1 - 3, cyclophosphamide (EP) 300 mg/mq/day days 1 - 3 every 3 weeks) was administered. A total of three adjuvant chemotherapy courses were administered. CT evaluation performed two months after initiation of chemotherapy revealed a marked reduction of lungs nodules, a complete regression of adrenal mass but an enlargement of the costal metastasis and pelvic mass. One month later, 1 course of high-dose chemotherapy was started, consisting of carboplatin (CARBOPEC reginen: 400 mg/mq/day days 1 - 4), vepeside (450 mg/mq/day days 1 - 4) and cyclophosphamide (1,600 mg/mq/day days 1 - 4). CT scan, performed after high dose chemotherapy, documented enlargement of costal metastasis (7 cm), several liver nodules, enlargement of pelvic mass (11 × 11 × 9 cm), peritoneal carcinosis and ascites. The patient soon developed bowel obstruction and died few days later, six months after diagnosis.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】SCCO is an undifferentiated neoplasm; actually, whether the origin of tumor cells is epithelial, germinal or mesenchymatous (the cell lineage remains not clearly determined)  it is not known. The differential diagnosis includes sex cord tumors, dysgerminoma, ovarian metastasis of lymphoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma or melanoma . Moreover, there are two different varieties of small cell carcinoma of the ovary: one is similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung and the other, more uncommon and less known, includes a large cells component (large cell variant of SCCO) . Approximately 60% of SCCO are associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia that often leads the patient in seeking medical attention for nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, lethargy, weakness, confusion; despite these symptoms, clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia are rarely reported . SCCO is a prognostically very unfavorable disease. Although it seems to be both chemo and radiosensitive, leading to a high initial response rate, the disease progression-free survival is usually very short, with a median survival of 6 - 13 months (range of 2 - 23 months) , with the exception of early stages disease: in the largest published series in literature, only 33% of the patients with stage IA are alive and free of disease . Tendency to progression and recurrences are the two main features of this malignancy. Many published series throughout the years appear to highlight the poor prognosis of this tumor; more than 50% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stages disease (stage III or higher) . Approximately 30% of patients staged IA had a long recurrence-free survival compared to 10% of cases staged IC and 6.5% of women in advanced stage, respectively. As a matter of fact, when the tumor has extrapelvic spreading, survival for more than few years is reported to be almost exceptional .\n\n【13】Several different chemotherapy treatment options have been advocated for SCCO patients . Nevertheless, the prognosis generally remains dramatically poor. Few large studies have been conducted , the more significant one by Young . Adjuvant regimens were derived from epithelial carcinoma therapies, consisting of cisplatinum, cyclophosphamide with or without doxorubicine and hexamethylmelamine; in all cases only short-term favourable responses have been obtained . Paclitaxel or platinum therapy in advanced stage disease had no or little efficacy either. Long-term survivors were reported only in clinical studies using a multiagent chemotherapy approach, consisting of regimens alternating cycles with vinblastine, cisplatin, bleomycin (PVB) and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide with or without isophosphamide , or adjuvant induction therapy with PEB (the same used in germ cells tumors) followed by consolidation cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) . Another limited number of long-term survivors with advanced stages disease at diagnosis had received regimens consisting of 5 to 6 antineoplastic agents (combination of vinblastine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, adriamycin, etoposide) . Other series, the most recent of which by Pautier in 2007, describe poli-chemotherapy as first line treatment in SCCO of the hypercalcemic type followed by high dose consolidation chemotherapy leading to an exceptionally better outcome . In our experience, this therapeutic attempt was unsuccessful. The role of radiotherapy has not yet been definitely established because of the limited number of cases in literature; it has been indicated as useful in the multimodality treatment of SCCO as advocated by Harrisons in 2006 . From the literature review, currently no standard treatment for SCCO can be advocated. This depends both on the rarity of the disease and the lack of randomized controlled trials ever been performed; most of the clinical studies published are small series or case reports. In most cases the progression and spread of this disease is so fast that patients cannot receive chemotherapy or are not eligible for surgery due to terminal general conditions. Since there is no consensus on the treatment of SCCO and no success of standard therapies has been highlighted in literature, other molecules potentially effective on SCCO cells should be investigated in clinical, multi-centre studies, although the rarity, rapid spreading and poor prognosis of the disease represent objective obstacles gynaecological oncologists have to face with, in the challenge of increasing survival rates for these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is important to recognize the effect of drug reaction on the body and differentiate from primary lung pathology. We present a case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by a commonly administered medication, ceftriaxone . This patient originally presented asymptomatic, with a rapid progression and then resolution of symptoms.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】This is a 60-year-old male, receiving treatment for right hallux osteomyelitis with ceftriaxone and vancomycin as an outpatient. On a routine follow-up visit, he was sent to the hospital after presenting with a fever, as well as an incidental finding of elevated creatinine. Upon admission, only vancomycin was discontinued, and admission chest X-ray (CXR) was within normal limits . On admission day two, he developed acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation with CXR findings of right-sided infiltrate and non-specific left-sided changes . No skin rash was noted and the labs did not show eosinophilia at the time. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for microorganisms, ruling out the differential of Acinetobacter pneumonia. Ceftriaxone was empirically stopped, given the rare possibility of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. After cessation of ceftriaxone, the patient’s condition improved significantly and was extubated, CXR demonstrated improvement .\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The original differential diagnosis for this case was broad, ranging from health-care-associated pneumonia to pulmonary embolism to drug-induced lung injury. The acute presentation, however, helped limit the differential, with interstitial pneumonitis being high on the list. Possible etiologies were ruled out by negative extremities ultrasound and bronchoalveolar lavage negative for microorganisms. In this case, lack of rash and eosinophilia lessened the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction, though rapid improvement after cessation of the causative agent was supportive of this diagnosis.\n\n【6】Interstitial pneumonitis is defined as an inflammation change of the lung interstitium, including the alveolar septa, due to a broad range of etiologies. The etiology of interstitial pneumonitis can either be idiopathic or from known causes, such as drug-induced . In immunocompromised populations, interstitial pneumonitis is more commonly caused by fungal, atypical bacterial, and viral  infections . In healthy populations, the cause of interstitial pneumonitis is more commonly an extrinsic particulate; fungal or plant antigens in farmer’s lung , aerosolized metallic or organic chemicals , or even possibly radiation .\n\n【7】The presentation of drug-induced pneumonitis commonly includes dyspnea, fever, cough, and rash. Investigation will often reveal inflammatory changes on CXR or CT , and eosinophilia on lab analysis. If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is suspected as the cause of pneumonitis, the medication can be restarted after cessation to confirm the reappearance of symptoms; this however may cause the patient to require intubation and supportive treatment. As with other hypersensitivity reactions, the first step in treatment of drug-induced pneumonitis, after life supporting measures, is cessation of the drug or inhalation agent . Patients with severe disease may require treatment with corticosteroids , however, this has been shown to have no effect on long-term outcomes .\n\n【8】Conclusions\n\n【9】While hypersensitivity reactions are a known adverse effect of the use of cephalosporins, there are few reported cases of pneumonitis associated with ceftriaxone . This case is suggestive that clinicians should continue to be aware of the possibility of drug-induced pneumonitis, even in the absence of rash or eosinophilia. At this time, more investigation is required to establish the exact mechanism behind ceftriaxone-induced pneumonitis, and to determine if there is population with an elevated risk of this complication. We believe that the addition of hypersensitivity pneumonitis to the differentials of patients with similar presentations, and early recognition of this complication can reduce or even prevent significant morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "37f59249-a287-46f2-9411-735b7e2c469d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Testicular tumor is the most common solid malignancy of young men. Germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent over 95% of all these tumors. Pure seminoma accounts for 50% of all testicular GCTs . Non-seminomatous GCTs are yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma and teratoma. Other rare testicular tumors include lymphoma, stromal cell tumors and sarcomas. Primary testicular sarcomas are extremely rare. To our knowledge, 40 cases have reported in literature. In contrast, GCTs with sarcomatous components (SCs) are more frequently reported, accounting for 3-6% of testicular GCTs . However, it might be difficult to distinguish primary testicular sarcoma from GCTs with SC because there is some possibility that testicular sarcoma arises from GCT and secondly GCT regresses. Actually testicular chondrosarcoma which was of germ cell origin through showing isochromosome 12p (i(12p)) in metastatic sarcoma by cytogenetics was reported . i(12p) has been a frequent marker of GCTs and has diagnostic significance. A lot of germ cell-related tumors represented i(12p) or other 12p abnormalities by means of cytogenetic studies . i(12p) and other forms of 12p amplification are seen in the majority of testicular GCTs of adults and are present in all histological subtypes. In one report, somatic-type tumors which arose from patients who had testicular or mediastinal GCTs were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) . Six of 11 cases represented 12p amplification and the author concluded interphase FISH for 12p amplification can provide useful adjuvant diagnostic information by confirming the germ cell origin of somatic-type tumors of uncertain histogenesis. We report an extremely rare tumor, primary undifferentiated testicular sarcoma, which could be examined about 12p by FISH.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of a painless enlargement of the right testis. He did not have any urologic or constitutional symptoms. Physical examination showed no superficial lymph node swelling. An ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a right testicular multilocular mass 9.4 × 6.9 cm in size and no metastasis.\n\n【4】α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG-β) in serum were within normal limit. He was lost to follow-up but re-presented 2 years later with tumor growth to 21 cm and multiple pulmonary and bone metastases (parietal bone, cranial base and 12th thoracic vertebrae, right iliac bone and right thighbone). Afterward radical orchiectomy was performed, and chemotherapy was started without waiting for pathological diagnosis. Combination therapy of etoposide and cisplatin which was standard chemotherapy of GCT was administrated for four courses in all. Moreover, radiation therapy was added to cranial bone, 12th thoracic vertebrae and iliac bone. Comprehensive result of treatment was partial response (bone, partial response; lung, complete response). Then he died 12 months later after surgery.\n\n【5】Methods\n\n【6】Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n\n【7】Surgical specimens were fixed in buffered formalin and processed routinely. Hematoxylin and eosin stains were carried out on 4 µm thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. IHC was carried out using these antibodies: cytokeratin (AE1/AE3 and 34βE12), EMA, desmin, vimentin, myoglobin, α-SMA, MSA, c-kit, NSE, S-100, calretinin, CD99, CD30, AFP, HCG-β, PLAP, Oct4 and inhibin-α, and the Envision plus detection system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Details of antibodies are listed in Table 1 .\n\n【8】FISH\n\n【9】FISH test was performed as previously described . Multiple 4 μm unstained sections were made from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. A hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide from each specimen was examined for determination of areas for cell counting. The unstained slides were deparaffinized with three 15-min xylene washes. The slides were then hydrated using absolute ethanol washes twice for 10 min each. The slides then were air dried in a fume hood. Next, the slides were treated in 0.1 mM citric acid (pH 6.0) (Zymed, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 95 °C for 10 min, rinsed in distilled water for 3 min, and washed with 2 × standard saline citrate (SSC) for 5 min. The digestion of the tissue was performed by applying 0.4 mL of pepsin (5 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl, pH 1.5) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C for 40 min, washed again with 2 × SSC for 5 min, and air-dried.\n\n【10】Probes for 12p spectrum green and 12 centromeric spectrum orange (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) were diluted with tDenHyb2 buffer (Insitus, Albuquerque, NM, USA) in a ratio of 1:50 and 1:20, respectively. A volume of 10 μL of the diluted probed was applied to the slides in the area of interest. The slide was covered with a glass coverslip and sealed with rubber cement. The slides were placed in an opaque plastic box wrapped with aluminum foil. Denaturation was achieved by incubating the slides at 80 °C for 10 min, after which hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 16 - 18 h. The coverslips were removed and 10 μL of DAPI (Insitus, Albuquerque, NM, USA) was applied to each slide. A new coverslip was placed and the slides were examined with an Olympus IX-50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Classic seminoma specimen was used as a positive control. For negative controls, leiomyosarcoma specimens from patients without histories of GCTs were used. Criteria for signal detection were described previously . Forty cells were counted. The green signal (12p) and orange signal (12 centromere) were counted for each tumor cell nucleus, and the average number of each signal was recorded . We considered a 12p/12 centromeric ratio of 1.5 or greater as evidence of 12p amplification.\n\n【11】Pathological and cytogenetic findings\n\n【12】Tumor was measured 21 × 20 × 9 cm. Gross tumor was surrounded by tunica albuginea. Cut sections showed various parts including yellowish-white solid part, myxomatous part, hemorrhage and necrotic part .\n\n【13】Microscopically, the tumor clump lay scattered in the necrotic tissue. Tumor cells had irregularly shaped bundles of pleomorphic spindle or round cells, oval shaped, and irregularly shaped hyperchromatic nuclei with coarsely granular chromatin particles. Most of these cells had pale staining cytoplasm . These suggest a kind of sarcoma. Isolated small number of cells had large eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm with round nuclei . Spermatic cord and epididymis were remained.\n\n【14】Regarding IHC, vimentin was only positive, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3 and 34βE12), EMA, c-kit, myoglobin, S-100, CD99, CD30, PLAP, AFP, HCG-β, Oct4 and inhibin-α were negative, NSE was partially positive, and desmin, myogenin, α-SMA, and calretinin were very slightly positive on tumor cells. A few cells that had eosinophilic cytoplasm were stained by MSA . The above was appropriate to some kind of mesenchymal tumor, not epithelium tumor and germ cell tumor, because vimentin of mesenchymal maker was positive and epithelium markers, cytokeratin and EMA, and germ cell markers, PLAP AFP HCG-β, Oct4, were negative. NSE, desmin, myogenin, α-SMA and calretinin were too week to define diagnosis. MSA suggests differentiation to muscle. But it also did not give definitive suggestion because stained cells were very few. Accordingly, we considered this tumor was mesenchymal tumor, not of germ cell origin. IHC could not provide definitive evidence.\n\n【15】We added cytogenetics of FISH on paraffin-embedded tissue to detect abnormality of 12p. Tumor did not show amplification and deletion of 12p by FISH .\n\n【16】There is every possibility that this tumor is purely primary testicular sarcoma, not of germ cell origin. Final pathological diagnosis was primary testicular undifferentiated sarcoma.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Primary testicular sarcoma is extremely rare. To our knowledge, 40 cases had been reported, including 15 lieomyosarcomas , seven rhabdomyosarcomas , five spindle sarcomas , four osteosarcomas , two fibrosarcomas , two pleomorphicsarcomas , two liposarcomas , one chondrosarcoma , one kaposi sarcoma  and one undifferentiated sarcoma .\n\n【19】On the other hand, testicular GCTs with SC were relatively often reported, accounting for 3-6% of testicular GCTs . It is said that excluding these cases is important to diagnose primary testicular sarcoma because primary testicular sarcoma has better prognosis than testicular GCTs with SC . In only six cases of 41 cases (15%) including our case, they had metastasis and/or recurrence in a term of observation after treatment (9 weeks to 21 years) . However, two cases of these six cases were considered that tumors arose from tunica and epididymis and they might be cases that should be distinguished from primary testicular tumors . Treatment outcome was three deaths (7%) including one rhabdomyosarcoma, one fibrosarcoma and our undifferentiated sarcoma . Whereas Guo et al reported 74% cases of testicular GCTs with SC had metastases when diagnosed and 30% of the patients died of disease (5 months to 20 years) . Primary testicular sarcoma has apparent indolent natural history compared with GCTs with SC.\n\n【20】There is a problem about diagnosis between primary testicular sarcoma and testicular GCTs with SC. GCTs may often regress. Hence, there is possibility that apparent primary testicular sarcoma arises from GCT. Actually testicular chondrosarcoma which was ascertained to be of germ cell origin by cytogenetic analysis was reported . Therefore, we performed cytogenetics in order to judge if they were of germ cell origin or not. There are many studies which have evaluated 12p abnormalities in testicular GCTs. Rodriguez et al reported cytogenetic analysis of 120 cases of GCTs . In 90 of 120 cases, i(12p) was seen in 86% of seminomas, 89% of teratomas, 83% of embryonal carcinomas and 100% of yolk sac tumors. Bosl et al reported 101 of 171 cases (59%) of germ cell tumors yielded i(12p) . Furthermore, FISH detected i(12p) in 47 of 47 cases (100%) in this study. Moreover, studies using FISH have been performed and high positive rate was shown. Smolarek et al evaluated 11 primary GCTs and 16 metastatic GCTs using FISH . 12p overexpression was found in all 27 cases (100%). Pienkowska-Grela et al analyzed 15 testicular GCTs using FISH . 12p abnormalities were seen in 14 cases (93%). Korski et al reported that 12p abnormalities were identified in 22 of 23 (96%) primary mediastinal seminomas . Approximately conventional cytogenetics revealed i(12p) in 60-80% GCTs and FISH analyses gave higher positive rate of 93-100% of 12p amplification or anomaly.\n\n【21】Interphase FISH studies have recently been used to distinguish germ cell origin or not by identification of 12p abnormalities in somatic tumors. Kernek et al proved somatic-type metastatic tumors were originally from GCT at different parts by confirming i(12p) using FISH . Motzer et al studied the cytogenetic features of secondary somatic components in 12 cases of GCT . It showed that 10 cases represented i(12p) and one case represented 12p deletion. Kernek et al concluded FISH analysis of i(12p) is useful for establishing germ cell origin of metastatic tumors . Actually Korski et al reported a case of primary testicular GCT with rhabdomyosarcoma metastases . The i(12p) in metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma by FISH proved that this metastatic sarcoma was of germ cell origin .\n\n【22】No amplification and anomaly of 12p were seen in our case. Therefore, this tumor was not considered to arise from GCT and there is every possibility that this tumor is truly primary testicular sarcoma not of germ cell origin. This is the first case of primary testicular sarcoma which does not represent 12p anomaly by cytogenetics.\n\n【23】If this sarcoma is pure primary testicular sarcoma, good prognosis is expected because most testicular sarcomas represented good prognosis. However, this case had lung and widespread bone metastases 2 years later from first visit. This testicular sarcoma had no metastasis at the time of first evaluation. Suppose radical orchiectomy was performed, he might have been cured. Accordingly it is not clear about prognosis.\n\n【24】In order to research testicular sarcoma, testicular sarcoma should be examined about chromosome to distinguish if they were of germ cell origin or not. If possible, FISH method is better than conventional method in respect of sensibility.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The incidence is expected to increase in the coming years, with an ageing western population resulting in a greater number of traumatic injuries in patients with osteoporotic bone.\n\n【2】The vast majority of intertrochanteric fractures are treated by surgical means. A number of different methods for surgical fixation are recognized, including intramedullary nail and hip screw devices, sliding compression screw and plate devices, and external fixators. The dynamic hip screw (DHS) has been in use since the 1950’s and its use has become standard practice in the surgical treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures . Furthermore, it has been shown to be superior to cephalomedullary devices due to smaller risk of intra and postoperative femoral fracture and subsequent reoperation, with no difference in clinical outcome or rate of technical complications .\n\n【3】Complications of DHS implantation for fixation of proximal femoral fractures include osteonecrosis of the femoral head, disassembly of the screw and plate, cutting out of the lag-screw from the femoral head, bleeding complications, hematoma, and wound infection. The incidence of wound infection following DHS fixation for extracapsular femoral neck fractures has been reported to be between 5 and 16%, although the use of prophylactic antibiotics as standard has reduced this to 1% .\n\n【4】There have been a small number of reports of deep wound infection presenting with hip joint dislocation. Subluxation of the hip following internal fixation of the hip has also been reported a number of times. However, to our knowledge, a case of deep wound infection complicating internal fixation of an intertrochanteric femoral neck fracture, presenting as a painful subluxating hip joint, has not been reported.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】An 86-year-old female was referred by the GP to accident and emergency with difficulty in mobilizing and pain in the left hip three months after an uneventful fixation of extra capsular fracture of femoral neck with dynamic hip screw. She presented without fever, wound drainage, abscess formation or cellulitis. X-ray imaging performed revealed a left hip subluxation . The patient had been discharged from the hospital nearly 2.5 months ago and had no postoperative complications and the fracture has united. Her medical history revealed hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She was afebrile at presentation and did not give any history of fever in the last three months. Laboratory tests revealed normal CRP, ESR and total Leucocytic count. Her physical examination and the rest of the laboratory tests (chest x-ray, urine analysis) were normal. The patient was listed for surgery to reduce the hip with closed reduction or open reduction. When closed reduction was unsuccessful, open reduction was done which showed deep wound infection with tissue inflammation and necrosis. The internal fixation was stable and the trochanteric fracture had healed.\n\n【7】Soft tissue debridement was done to remove all infected and nonviable tissue. Fluid found and specimens of infected deep soft tissues were sent for immediate Gram’s stain, culture and antibiotic sensitivity tests. The Gram’s stain revealed numerous polymorphonuclear cells. Since the fracture had healed, the hip joint was dislocated and inflamed with part of the femoral head eroded, an excisional arthroplasty was done and reaming sent for histopathology.\n\n【8】A skeletal traction system from the tibial tuberosity was used to maintain muscle tension. The wound specimens’ cultures recovered a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sensitive to vancomycin. The patient was administered IV antibiotics for six weeks. The second stage surgery was performed at this time with Constrained Cemented Total hip arthroplasty with antibiotic loaded cement .\n\n【9】The patient had a postoperative period without complications. In the follow-up, three years after the arthroplasty, she can walk without pain or limp, the hip wound shows no signs of infection and the laboratory results are within normal values.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This case is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of deep infection of the hip joint following dynamic hip screw fixation of a femoral neck fracture, presenting with subluxation of the hip. A number of authors have reported dislocation of the hip as the presenting feature of deep wound sepsis following internal fixation of the hip, but cases of hip subluxation as a presenting feature is extremely rare. Speed and Knight  first reported a septic dislocation following hip fixation in 1956. Melton et al  reported dislocation of the hip following fixation of a pertrochanteric fracture in a valgus position. There have been several reports of atraumatic dislocation of the hip joint following internal fixation, but these have not been associated with sepsis and presented with a dislocated joint as opposed to a subluxating joint .\n\n【12】Subluxation of the hip joint has been widely reported in patients with cerebral palsy, due to abnormal mechanical stresses on the hip joint from muscle spasticity . A number of corrective and preventative procedures have been described for this problem including iliopsoas transfer with adductor tenotomy, proximal femoral resection and hip distraction with external fixation, rectus femoris tenotomy, and release or transposition of knee flexors. Hip joint subluxation has also been reported in other conditions affecting the hip such as myositis ossificans and synovial chondromatosis . However, following internal fixation for a fracture of the proximal femur, the only recent report of hip joint subluxation is that of Kaneko et al , but this was not a presentation of deep wound sepsis.\n\n【13】Wound infection following internal fixation has now been reduced to approximately 1-2% with prophylactic antibiotic regimes . In the United Kingdom, Edwards and colleagues conducted a large prospective single centre study of 3,686 patients with hip fractures, reporting an incidence of early deep wound infection of 1.2%, and of superficial wound infection of 1.2%. Interestingly, the authors reported that 71.3% of all infections were due to Staphyloccus Aureus , with Methicillin resistant strains accounting for 48.8% . These results echoed those from a Finnish study which retrospectively reviewed over 2,000 hip fracture cases, reporting an incidence of deep infection of 1.3%, with S. Aureus being the commenest causative organism. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated a significantly higher mortality risk with S. Aureus infection, compared to other organisms. It is clear that the implications of deep wound infection can be catastrophic for the patient in terms of quality of life and clinical outcome. In particular, deep infection of the hip joint has been shown to significantly affect functional outcome, prolong hospital stay and increase mortality by 10.4% . Late infection of the hip following internal fixation is less well documented however. As with other reports in adults, there was a variable time to presentation postoperatively ranging from 7 to 24 months, and S. Aureus was the commonest causative organism.\n\n【14】A number of mechanisms for subluxation of the hip joint have been described. Moorman and colleagues  reported the mechanism of traumatic hip dislocation in their clinical and radiological study of American Football players. The authors reported that a fall onto a flexed and adducted hip was the commonest mechanism, with MRI and radiographic findings often showing a posterior lip acetabular fracture with disruption of the iliofemoral ligament. The mechanism for atraumatic subluxation of the hip due to infection is not clear however. It is likely that an inflammatory process due to infection of the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments, including the iliofemoral liagament, will cause generalized instability and progressive subluxation due to weight-bearing and repetitive minor trauma. In ankylosing spondylitis, hyperostosis and ossification within the acetabulum and ligamentum teres has been shown to cause superolateral joint space narrowing and subsequent lateral subluxation of the joint . This effect of progressive lateral migration of the femoral head may have been responsible in the present case, due to infective effusion within the hip joint, accompanied by destruction of the capsule and surrounding soft tissues, pushing the femoral head laterally, resulting in similar superolateral joint space narrowing and subluxation.\n\n【15】The patient reported in the present study underwent a two-stage revision hip arthroplasty due to deep wound sepsis. A two-stage revision procedure, with antibiotic cement spacer and intravenous antimicrobial therapy, before the definitive procedure, was the prudent option in this case. The destruction of local soft tissues obviated the need for complete eradication of infection and inflammatory process, as ongoing infection and soft tissue destruction would be potentially catastrophic for the ongoing stability of the hip, as well as the functional outcome of the patient. This case highlights the difficulties presented by deep wound infection and the cost to both the patient and hospital services.\n\n【16】The present case report highlights the importance of keeping a high level of suspicion for deep infection in elderly patients with minimal clinical signs and symptoms of infection. Hip subluxation after a trochanteric fracture internal fixation is rare complication associated with high morbidity and mortality. Infection eradication holds a key for successful outcome in these cases.\n\n【17】Consent\n\n【18】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5ba9a2a5-6359-4f32-bb03-f6ed99974ec4", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Primary cervical dystonia (CD) is defined as sustained involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, repetitive and patterned movements, or abnormal postures of the neck . About half of the patients also suffer from head tremor, and for 75% the chronic dystonic activity causes painful cervical muscular hypertrophy . The prevalence of primary CD is unclear as CD is often not recognized by physicians, and no validated diagnostic criteria existed. The minimum incidence estimation was 8-12 cases per million person years . Women are affected 1.5 - 1.9 times more often than men, and the majority of these disorders begin in the middle age . The estimated number of persons having CD in the US is between 60,000 and 90,000 . During the first years after onset, some patients have periods with fewer symptoms but recovery is rare .\n\n【2】The treatment of CD has been symptomatic, and aims to relieve the involuntary movements, prevent contractures, decrease pain and embarrassment, and to improve function . The primary treatment, chemodenervation of cervical muscles with botulinum toxin injections every 3 - 4 weeks, has temporarily relieved some symptoms of 75% of patients . Also intrathecal baclofen and deep brain stimulation have been effective in randomized controlled trials. However, these invasive treatments are expensive and generally not available or possible to the greater majority of those who suffer from CD, e.g. in developing countries.\n\n【3】The efficacy and tolerability of oral pharmacotherapy for CD is poorly documented. No controlled data are available, and most published recommendations are based on empirical observations . Anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines and clozapine have decreased some symptoms in some cases , and attacks of kinesigenic paroxysmal dystonia can sometimes be controlled with anticonvulsants while non-kinesigenic symptoms are less responsive to pharmacotherapy . However, neither controlled data of oral pharmacotherapy of CD, nor reports of sustained full remission were published . Thus, it was unclear if any effective and safe oral pharmacotherapy for CD exists, and if it is possible to cure all symptoms of CD with an oral pharmacotherapy.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Herein, I report of the recovery of a 48-year-old woman who has now been symptom-free nearly 4 years during treatment with topiramate, after previously suffering from rotational lateral CD during 29 years. The patient’s symptoms begun at the age of 12 with head tremor. Her lateral, left-sided rotational dystonia began when she was 15, and increased in both social and stressful situations, and during physical activity. Her grandmother had suffered from a similar dystonia. In her twenties, the patient also suffered from social phobia, anxiety, borderline and depressive symptoms and alcohol dependence, while her dystonia was misdiagnosed as a panic disorder, and treated with amitriptylene/chlordiazepoxid and benzodiazepines. She used citalopram (up to 45 mg) and moclobemide (150 mg) temporarily but suffered from restlessness, agitation and hypomanic symptoms during them. At the age of 34, a diagnosis of CD in the Clinic of Neurology of the Central Hospital was a relief to the patient. However, her symptoms did not respond significantly to any pharmacotherapy, including botulinum toxin injections which she received regularly during 1 year. The patient achieved some relief only from benzodiazepines and alcohol.\n\n【6】At the age of 42 her lifetime health care documents were reviewed in a forensic psychiatric examination, and the patient was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder, alcohol dependence and benzodiazepine dependence. MRI study revealed no structural brain abnormalities. The left-handed patient suffered from postural and rotating left-sided CD and a slight cervical tremor; cervical muscular hypertrophy and pain, and dysphagia due to the distortion of the esophagus. She also had daily headache, and both paranoid and depressive delusions. In the forensic psychiatric hospital administration of olanzapine resulted in metabolic syndrome. Ziprasidone could not be used because of akathisia, increased tremor and an urge to twist her body. These symptoms increased in the evenings, as well as the symptoms of CD. Clozapine (150 mg/day), administered since September of 2010, relieved paranoid symptoms. Topiramate (up to 150 mg/day) was administrated as an adjuvant since August of 2011, to replace lamotrigin. Unexpectedly, the rotating and postural symptoms subsequently disappeared within less than 2 months during the increase of the dose up to 150 mg/day, and gradually also the muscular hypertrophy, cervical pain, daily headache, tremor and dysphagia recovered. During some weeks the patient still felt while swallowing as if there now was a curve in her esophagus.\n\n【7】The patient has now been symptom-free from the dystonia after nearly 4 years of topiramate 150 mg, clozapine 175 mg, fluoxetine 15 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg per day. In stressful situations, she still has very slight tremor in hands, but no abnormal movements or positions. Gradually, also her delusions and social fears have subsided. The patient is very happy of her recovery. She wishes that an article of it would encourage research and help others who suffer from this painful and distressing disorder.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This case demonstrated that some patients recover from CD and remain asymptomatic for years during treatment with topiramate. It was possible to follow the previous development of the symptoms of CD from the detailed health care data collected for the profound mental state examination in a university clinic. The author has examined the patient and discussed with her regularly since her admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital, and documented her symptoms during 6 years. No postural or rotating symptoms have relapsed this far.\n\n【10】The role of clozapine in this recovery was unclear. A small non-controlled pilot study (n = 10) reported that clozapine decreased clonic symptoms of CD but had no effect on torticollis . In the present case clozapine (150 mg/day) was administered without any effect on CD during 11 months before the administration of topiramate. In theory, it may have had some adjunctive effect on the clonic component. The small dose of fluoxetine (15 mg/day) administered 2 months before topiramate may have increased the concentration of clozapine and topiramate in the serum. However, fluoxetine was not likely to be involved in the improvement of CD after the administration of topiramate. The patient had previously used other SSRIs without any relief of the CD. It had increased restlessness, and 45 mg citalopram/day had induced manic symptoms.\n\n【11】The pathophysiology of involuntary movements in dystonia and chorea, essential tremor, myoclonus and restless legs syndrome has been associated with a reduction of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons in the basal ganglia . The reduced output results in thalamo-cortical system disinhibition, which releases the cortical motor areas generating the normally suppressed movements . Changes in the patterning or synchronization of basal ganglia output, as well as dopaminergic system dysfunction in the basal ganglia, may be involved in some hyperkinetic disorders, and also in schizophrenia .\n\n【12】Topiramate, a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide, modulates both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, as well as voltage-gated ion channels or intracellular signaling pathways . The efficacy and tolerability of topiramate has been reported with several randomized controlled studies for many neurological and psychiatric disorders, e.g. for some epileptic disorders, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and migraine, essential tremor, vascular generalized chorea, and as an adjunct to clozapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia . It has been used since 1990s for some forms of epilepsy and for migraine. There are reports of improvement of cluster headache, schizo-affective disorders, bipolar disorder, bulimia and neuropathic pain syndromes during treatment of topiramate. Clinical evidence suggests the usefulness of topiramate also in some hyperkinetic disorders, i.e. essential tremor, chorea, restless legs syndrome and myoclonus. It has also reduced symptoms in single cases of spinal myoclonus and Tourette’s syndrome . The only case report of improvement of dystonia demonstrated a marked improvement of the symptoms of a primary cervico-trunco-brachial segmental dystonia of a 46-year-old man whose CD had already responded to botulinum injections during 11 years. During 2 months treatment with topiramate (up to 200 mg/day) his trunk and upper limb dystonic component, trunk flexion and action-induced wrist extension improved considerably. The dystonic symptoms deteriorated after discontinuation of topiramate because of angle closure glaucoma, weight loss and word-finding difficulty .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】This case demonstrates that some patients recover from CD during treatment with topiramate, and remain asymptomatic for years. This is in accordance with the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of topiramate, the pathophysiological mechanisms of involuntary movements , and with the clinical evidence of topiramate in some other hyperkinetic movement disorders with similar pathophysiology . It would be important to conduct randomized controlled studies of topiramate in CD, and to define the subgroups who may benefit from it.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The clinical presentation includes ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis, conjunctival injection and relative enophthalmos. The disorder results from interruption of the normal sympathetic pathway at the first-, second- or third-order neuron . Central lesions may involve the first-order neuron; pre-ganglionic lesions such as a lung tumor can compress the second-order neuron, while involvement of the third-order neuron may occur in the area near the stellate ganglion and around the great vessels of the neck. When there is a question regarding the diagnosis and the location of the lesion causing Horner syndrome, radiographic imaging or the response to ophthalmic medications (cocaine and α-adrenergic agonists) may be used to localize the lesion . Various infectious, neoplastic and vascular pathologies may result in Horner syndrome, the spectrum ranging from life-threatening to benign.\n\n【2】Given its location deep to the vascular structures of the neck, the stellate ganglion and the sympathetic chain may be damaged during attempts at cannulation of the internal jugular vein . We present an 8-month-old child who was noted to have Horner syndrome following attempts at placement of a right jugular venous catheter. The normal sympathetic innervation of the head and eye is presented, potential etiologies for Horner syndrome are reviewed and previous reports of Horner syndrome following invasive procedures are presented.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Institutional Review Board approval for isolated case reports is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. The patient was an 8-month-old, 5.4 kg toddler with a history of an atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis and a small patent ductus arteriosus. She was admitted to an outside hospital for treatment of bronchiolitis and respiratory failure related to respiratory syncytial virus. She required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for 5 - 6 days. Following tracheal extubation, she was noted to anisocoria with the right pupil being 4 - 5 mm while the left was 2 - 3 mm. Both were reactive to light with no other focal neurologic findings. Due to parental concerns, she was transferred to our institution for further investigation and treatment. On arrival, she was on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula for the treatment of her bronchiolitis. Physical exam revealed an alert infant with no focal neurologic findings. The left pupil was 2 - 3 mm while the right was 4 - 5 mm. Both were reactive to light. She was also noted to have slight ptosis of the right eyelid. Based on her physical findings, a diagnosis of Horner syndrome was made. Computed tomography scan of the head was normal. Additional findings on physical examination included 6 - 8 old puncture marks over the right side of the neck. On review of the medical records from the outside hospital, there had been a prolonged and subsequently aborted attempt at placement of a central venous catheter into the right internal jugular vein. There was no mention of the use of ultrasound during the procedure in the medical records. Further imaging at our institution included an ultrasound of the right neck which revealed no evidence of hematoma and normal architecture of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Three weeks after the event, there has been slight resolution of the ptosis, but continued anisocoria.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Unlike the parasympathetic innervation of the head and neck, the sympathetic nerves exit the central nervous system from the thoracic spinal cord. They must therefore travel cephalad back into the head and neck region to exert their influence. The axon of the first-order neuron of the sympathetic fibers, the cell bodies of which are located in the midbrain (hypothalamus), travel caudad through the brain stem and into the spinal cord to the thoracic level. These fibers do not cross the midline, synapsing in the intermediolateral gray column of the thoracic spinal cord at the level of C7-T3 with the cell body of the second-order neuron. The second-order neuron (pre-ganglionic fibers) exits the thoracic spinal cord travelling in white rami communicantes, passes over the apex of lung within the thoracic cavity and ascends into the neck through the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (stellate ganglion), synapsing with the cell body of the third-order neuron in the superior cervical ganglion. From there, the third-order neuron (post-ganglionic fibers) travels alongside the great vessels in the neck, enters the cranium, and then the orbit to innervate the eye. Sympathetic innervation of the eye includes the dilator pupillae muscle and the levator palpebrae superioris (Muller’s muscle). Damage at any point along this pathway can result in Horner syndrome.\n\n【7】Various etiologies for Horner syndrome exist including infectious, vascular, neoplastic and traumatic causes. Given the pathway of the sympathetic nervous system, these lesions may be found within the brain, the spinal cord or the peripheral sympathetic pathway. Regardless of the site of the pathology, the clinical symptoms remain constant. Although uncommon, there are numerous reports in the literature dating back into the 1970s regarding Horner syndrome following attempts at placement of an internal jugular catheter . Other procedural-related causes of Horner syndrome have included tube thoracostomy placement, subclavian venous catheterization and epidural anesthesia as well as various surgical procedures of the neck .\n\n【8】A literature search revealed that there are 15 previously reported cases of Horner syndrome attributed to cannulation of the internal jugular vein in pediatric patients . The age range was 8 months to 17 years. These are mainly from case reports, but the development of Horner syndrome has also been described in two retrospective analyses  and two prospective studies  focusing on internal jugular cannulation in pediatric patients. Eleven of the reports describe difficulty accessing the internal jugular vein with multiple attempts required . Three cases of Horner syndrome occurred despite the use of ultrasound guidance for cannulation . Although two of these ultrasound-guided cases were described as difficult access , five cases were associated with hematoma formation at the site of cannulation . Nine of the patients were described as having complete recovery of the symptoms of Horner syndrome in from 24 h to 5 months .\n\n【9】Treatment involves general supportive care; however, imaging may be indicated if there is a question regarding the etiology. In our patient, given the concerns regarding the larger left pupil, computed tomography of the brain was obtained to rule out intracranial pathology . However, on further examination, it was determined that the pupillary abnormality was in fact a miotic right pupil. As was done in our patient, ultrasound imaging of the vasculature of the neck seems indicated as pseudoaneurysms have been reported as a complication of internal jugular line placement . Most importantly, prevention remains the primary intervention in such cases. The sympathetic chain and the vascular structures are in close proximity within the neck. The cell bodies of post ganglionic sympathetic fibers are located within one of three ganglia within the neck (superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion). In the majority of cases, the inferior cervical ganglion fuses with the first thoracic ganglia forming the stellate ganglion which lies anterior to the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and just deep to the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates variability in the anatomy and position of the great vessels in the neck. In a prospective investigation of two-dimensional suing ultrasound of the internal jugular, subclavian and femoral vein of 142 infants and children, there was a 7.7% variation for the internal jugular with the most common being a lateral or anterior position of the internal jugular vein in relationship to the carotid artery . Ultrasound has also been shown to facilitate central venous catheter placement with fewer attempts, shorter time to catheter placement, fewer carotid punctures and a higher success rate .\n\n【10】In summary, we present the development of Horner syndrome following attempted cannulation of the jugular vein in an infant. An appropriate diagnosis may limit the need for unnecessary imaging; however, if the etiology is in doubt, imaging is suggested to identify pathologic lesions along the sympathetic pathway. Given the proximity of structures within the neck especially in a child, we would highly recommend the use of ultrasound to facilitate central venous catheter placement. Ultrasound to facilitate central venous access was first reported in 1986. The literature clearly demonstrates that ultrasound-guided vascular access is being widely adopted as a technique that facilitates successful completion of the procedure while limiting the potential for adverse effects and is recognized by many as the standard of care for such procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Anorectal FB may result either from an orally ingested object that becomes impacted or more commonly due to insertion of objects through the anal canal. While mouth reception types are mostly encountered in children with mental disabilities, rectal insertive types are mostly used in middle-aged men for sexual stimulation . As a rectal FB is often associated with anal sexual behavior disorders, seeking treatment for its retrieval is often unpleasant and embarrassing for patients. FB may cause serious surgical issues due to its complications.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We present here the case of a 54-year-old man admitted to the emergency department with rectal pain and constipation. The patient reported that 12 h prior to admission, he had used stones to clean his anus after defecation, and that these stones had become impacted in the anal canal. On digital rectal examination, FB was found to be palpated at 8 cm from the anal verge. There were two FBs seen on plain X-ray of abdomen around rectosigmoid region . In lithotomy position forceps were used successfully to retrieve the FB after the anal dilatation under mask anesthesia. Stones measured 11 cm and 13 cm in length . The patient was discharged after 24 h observation.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Recently cases of rectal FBs have been encountered more frequently in clinical practice. Various objects have been described as retained rectal FBs, such as bottle, eggplant, vibrator used for sexual or erotic purposes, thermometer while applying medical treatment (as accident), irrigation catheter and enema container. Mouth reception types include dental prosthesis, needle and wood stick. Rectal pain and bleeding are the two main symptoms associated with rectal FB. It may cause perforation and acute abdominal pain . Sometimes, it can also be related with rectal and vulvar abscess. Migration of FB to urinary and genital tract has been reported. Ooi et al reported that atypical gender behavior, lax anal sphincters and bloody or mucoid rectal discharge are the factors which raise the suspicion for FB .\n\n【6】The majority of FBs can be palpated at the middle rectum. If it is not possible to palpate, endoscopic and radiologic investigation should be performed. Plain abdominal X-rays are indicated in almost all cases; CT scans should be reserved for those with potential sepsis or equivocal peritoneal signs . Unless there is a sign of peritonitis, it may be appropriate to wait several hours for spontaneous removal. In all cases, an appropriate tetanus prophylaxis and a prophylactic antibiotic are indicated. The genitourinary tract should also be examined for trauma and, if indicated, treatment. If possible, retrieval of FBs below the rectosigmoid region should be conducted transanally under sedation in the lithotomy position, using forceps and anal ecartors if necessary. If the patient cannot tolerate the pain, spinal or general anesthesia may be administered.\n\n【7】Often, use of the hand is the most convenient and easiest means of retrieving FBs from the rectum. In some cases, use of a Foley catheter, colonoscope, or Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may be necessary for retrieval. The main principle is to retrieve the FB transanally; if fails, it is better to retrieve it transanally after laparotomy with the assistance of the milking maneuver . Bak et al described a novel approach to retrieval and removal of a rectal FB utilizing a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port . Colotomy is the last option in the retrieval of FBs. If blood is detected during rectal examination, a sign of mucosal injury, the grade of injury must be evaluated after retrieval by performance of rectosigmoidoscopy or contrast studies.\n\n【8】It has been reported that primary repair, proximal loop colostomy, sigmoid end-colostomy and the Hartmann procedure, in combination with administration of wide-spectrum antibiotics according to the severity of peritoneal contamination, can be performed for the treatment of perforation. The mortality and morbidity rates of patients presenting with perforation above the peritoneal reflection have been reported to range from 2.5 to 20.0% and 20.0 to 40.0%, respectively .\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】It is important to consider that FBs in the rectosigmoid region may cause perforation, peritonitis, pararectal abscess, fistulisation and genitourinary system injuries. It is also important to remember that complications may occur during FB retrieval. Thus, unless there is a sign of peritonitis, the use of less invasive techniques is preferred for FB retrieval.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Metastases to the heart were found in 1.23% of 12,485 consecutive autopsies, compared with a 0.056% prevalence of primary cardiac tumors . In autopsies where a malignant neoplasm was identified, cardiac metastases were found in 9.7%-10.7% of cases . Noncardiac tumors may invade the heart and pericardium by means of lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination, local extension, or transvenously. Tumors that are most likely to involve the heart and pericardium include cancers of the lung and breast, melanoma, and lymphoma . These tumors may involve the heart and pericardium by one of four pathways: retrograde lymphatic extension, hematogenous spread, direct contiguous extension, or transvenous extension .\n\n【2】Whereas two- and three-dimensional (2D, 3D) echocardiography is the method of imaging most frequently used to examine the heart and pericardium noninvasively, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) offer advantages when metastatic disease is in question. Both imaging modalities provide a large examining field which allows evaluation of disease throughout the thorax .\n\n【3】We report the case of a patient with a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma with cardiac metastatic disease, diagnosed with chest X-ray and cardiac ultrasonography.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In this report we present a 68-year-old male patient who was admitted to our hospital because of weakness, dyspnea on exertion and palpitations. He was an active smoker and complained of weight loss of 25 lbs over the last three months. Physical examination and blood tests at the Emergency Department were unremarkable. However, his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and the chest X-ray revealed a right lower lung field shadow. A transthoracic echocardiogram was arranged and a large tumor was pictured in the left atrium (39.7 × 36.4 mm diameter), attached to its posterior wall . Transesophageal echocardiograph confirmed a dilated left atrium with an immobile mass in the cavity, without any signs of left atrial outflow obstruction . The patient was further evaluated with thoracic CT scanning that confirmed the presence of a right lung mass. Subsequently, a bronchoscopic study with tumor sampling was performed and there was histopathologic confirmation of a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Metastatic involvement of the heart and pericardium may go unrecognized until autopsy. Impairment of cardiac function occurs in approximately 30% of patients and is usually attributable to pericardial effusion . In literature a highly variable incidence of cardiac metastases is reported, ranging from 2.3% and 18.3% . Shortness of breath is prominent in the clinical presentation, often out of proportion to the radiographic findings, and may be attributed to a pericardial effusion or an associated pleural effusion . Presenting complaints also include cough, anterior thoracic pain, pleuritic chest pain, or peripheral edema . Arrhythmias in patients with cardiac metastases is usually the result of concomitant factors such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, or anemia; however, arrhythmia can be secondary to tumors involving autonomic fibers or encroaching on the coronary arteries . Overall, arrhythmia is the most prevalent manifestation of myocardial involvement by metastatic tumors . The occurrence of arrhythmia without an obvious trigger in a patient with known malignancy suggests the possibility of metastatic myocardial involvement. The type of arrhythmia depends on the size of the tumor and its location relative to the conduction system of the heart. In our patient, palpitation revealed persistent atrial fibrillation, while transthoracic, transesophageal echocardiograph, CT scanning and bronchoscopic study confirmed the diagnosis of a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【8】Lung carcinoma is postulated to metastasize to the heart most often by direct invasion, followed by lymphatic and hematogenous spread. The right side of the heart is more frequently involved by metastatic lesions than the left side. In this case, the most likely culprit is hematogenous spread as cancer cells had direct access through the right lower pulmonary vein to the left atrium.\n\n【9】Differential diagnosis of intracavitary mass lesions includes benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors like myxoma, and various other space occupying lesions in the form of thrombus, vegetations and foreign bodies. Infectious and non-bacterial thrombotic or marantic endocarditis can also present with similar findings. It is important for admitting physicians to bear in mind that intramural metastases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction and pericardial metastases in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion.\n\n【10】Imaging studies valuable to establish the diagnosis include (2D, 3D) transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram , CT scan, MR imaging  and angiography. Still, metastatic cardiac lesions, most of which are clinically silent, are often only found post-mortem. Other possible complications include peripheral embolism and sudden outflow tract obstruction. Sadly, the prognosis is poor if the patient is unresponsive to chemotherapy.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Real time 2D and 3D transthoraric echocardiography is a low cost, readily accessible, reproducible, non ionizing radiation and non-invasive technique that provides an indispensable tool for the diagnosis of cardiac tumors. In addition, 2D and 3D transesophageal echocardiography can frequently provide essential supplementary information, obviating the need for further expensive and time consuming imaging tests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Usually, the absence of one thyroid lobe does not result in clinical symptoms, so thyroid hemiagenesis is frequently diagnosed coincidently during the evaluation of other thyroid-related conditions. To date, approximately 330 cases have been reported, and half of them were associated with other disease in the remnant thyroid lobe. However, few cases of hemiagenesis were comorbid for multiple diseases. Because we encountered a rare case of thyroid hemiagenesis associated with Graves’ disease and a follicular adenoma, we present the case and literature review in this report.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Our patient was an 81-year-old female who was admitted for fatigue and body weight loss for 1 month. Her past medical history was significant for Graves’ disease diagnosed 6 years prior. After taking antithyroid medication for 1 year, she stopped and did not follow up until presenting with her current complaints. In the endocrinology clinic, she complained of general weakness, fatigue, and weight loss. Other significant medical history includes aortic stenosis (AS) and arterial fibrillation (AF). Also, surgical history includes left nephrectomy for kidney donation in 1993 and mitral valve replacement operation for rheumatic heart disease in 1993.\n\n【4】Initial vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg, pulse of 62/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and a body temperature of 36.5 °C. The thyroid gland was palpable with a firm and irregular margin.\n\n【5】Thyroid function testing revealed an FT4 level of 2.57 ng/dL (0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL), T3 level of 192.96 ng/dL (60 - 181 ng/dL), and a TSH level of < 0.008 μIU/mL (0.35 - 5.50 μIU/mL). Antibody testing showed antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), and TSH receptor antibody levels to be 500 IU/mL (0 - 4.9), > 1,300 IU/mL , and > 405 IU/L , respectively.\n\n【6】Ultrasound revealed a 1.7 × 1.1 cm nodule in the right thyroid lobe, free of microcalcifications with regular margins. The thyroid parenchyma on the right side was heterogeneous and hyperechoic, but the tissue on the left side was not visible on ultrasound. Notably, the right lobe was connected to a visible isthmus, and there was a 1.5 × 2.8 cm nodule with regular margins at the isthmus . A Tc-99m pertechnetate thyroid scan further characterized the left thyroid hemiagenesis, diffuse right lobe enlargement, a cold nodule on the isthmus, and a warm nodule in the right lobe . Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the large isthmus nodule was suspicious for a follicular neoplasm, specifically, Hurthle cell type, suspicious for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The aspirate was cellular and consisted almost exclusively of loosely cohesive Hurthle cells. Their nuclei were enlarged, round, and central or eccentrically located with distinct nucleoli. Their cytoplasm was abundant, finely granular, and green or red in color on Papanicolaou stain. Colloid was absent, but a lymphocytic background was focally identified .\n\n【7】After this testing, the patient was prescribed methimazole 10 mg twice per day. After 4 days, the patient’s symptoms were relieved. Thyroid function testing was performed again, and T3 level was 181.31 ng/dL (60 - 181 ng/dL), TSH level was < 0.008 μIU/mL (0.35 - 5.50 μIU/mL), and FT4 level was 1.54 ng/dL (0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL). Currently, the patient’s progress is being observed on an outpatient basis, and the isthmus cold nodule is being managed conservatively with observation due to advanced age and medical history.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Thyroid hemiagenesis is a rare congenital anomaly that was first reported in 1895 by Marshall . The prevalence of thyroid hemiagenesis has been reported to be in the range of 0.05-0.2% . It occurs three times more often in women than men. Also, hemiagenesis occurs more frequently on the left thyroid lobe, almost 80% of the time, and is found on the isthmus about 50% of the time . Consistently, this case of hemiagenesis was also found on the left thyroid lobe of a woman.\n\n【10】Embryologically, the thyroid gland is the first endocrine organ to develop, and it can be observed as early as the third week of gestation. The gland originates from the proliferation of endodermal epithelium on the median surface of the developing pharyngeal floor. It is derived from the ventral endodermal diverticulum from the first and second pharyngeal pouches and is located midline in the floor of the pharynx or in the foramen cecum. The diverticulum descends from the base of the tongue to the adult pre-tracheal position via a midline anterior path during weeks 4 - 7 of gestation .\n\n【11】The cause of thyroid hemiagenesis is unknown, although there are several possible explanations. Hemiagenesis could be a result of an impairment of descent or due to a defect of lobulation. Because there is no compensatory growth of the remaining lobe, a lobulation defect rather than impairment of descent appears to the more likely mechanism . Notably, the occurrence of hemiagenesis in monozygotic twins and members of the same family suggests a genetic component . A small but significant proportion of familial thyroid dysgenesis cases have been identified through the study of subjects with congenital hypothyroidism, and familial thyroid dysgenesis was noted in 40% of one series of patients with hemiagenesis . These findings support a possible role for genetic factors in thyroid development.\n\n【12】Based on established reports, the incidence of comorbid thyroid disease in patients with thyroid hemiagenesis is greater than 50%. Among these comorbid diseases, hyperthyroidism occurred in 8.5% of cases, and multinodular goiter was found in 2.7%. However Graves’ disease and multinodular goiter were reported in only one case .\n\n【13】This case is the first case of thyroid hemiagenesis associated with Graves’ disease and follicular neoplasm. The patient had multinodular goiter and a cold nodule on the isthmus. The follicular neoplasm was diagnosed cytologically by fine needle aspiration. Unfortunately, we did not pathologically confirm the type of carcinoma or adenoma because of her comorbid diseases, AS and AF, and her medication profile.\n\n【14】Thyroid hemiagenesis is an uncommon congenital anomaly. Because hemiagenesis is asymptomatic, it is detected coincidently during imaging for other thyroid diseases. Although thyroid hemiagenesis is a benign condition, being unaware of its presence may lead to incorrect assumptions during clinical decision-making. Thus, it is necessary to report, collect, and establish data about thyroid hemiagenesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The groups and the specific diseases associated with each group are: anginosus group, abscess formation; mitis group, septicemia in neutropenic patients and endocarditis; salivarius group, endocarditis; mutans group, dental caries; bovis group, bacteremia associated with cancer and meningitis. Anginosus group of streptococci comprises three distinct species: Streptococcus anginosus ( S. anginosus ), Streptococcus intermedius ( S. intermedius ), and Streptococcus constellatus ( S. constellatus ) . These microorganisms are found in the oral cavity and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as part of the normal commensal flora. S. intermedius is more frequently found in dental plaque, whereas S. anginosus is more frequently found in the GI tract . Infections caused by these bacteria range from minor oral infections to serious, complicated, life-threatening infections. They are commonly associated with abscess formation, bacteremia is rare and mortality rate is low. Predisposing or underlying conditions are reported as previous surgery, trauma, diabetes, immunodeficiency and malignancy, but may also be related to poor oral hygiene or the patient’s overall health condition. S. anginosus was the most frequently isolated species from clinically significant specimens . We report here an unusual presentation of S. anginosus with severe sepsis and liver abscess secondary to biliary tract perforation possibly due to cholelithiasis in a diabetic female patient. This case also emphasizes that early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotic with surgical drainage are crucial to save live and to improve patient outcome.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital, complaining of high fever, chills, sweating, headache, cough, nausea and arthralgia lasting for 1 week. She had previously been given gemifloxacin at another center. She was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis with possible intra-abdominal origin and to research other possible etiologies of fever (including endocarditis, brucellosis). On her physical examination, body temperature was 40 °C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate was 134 beats/min, respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% while she was breathing ambient air on room air. Physical examination revealed right upper quadrant mild tenderness with no distension or rebound. The rest of examination was normal.\n\n【4】Initial hematologic and biochemical laboratory data were as follows: Hb, 12.3 g/dL; leucocytes, 20,300/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 85 % neutrophils; thrombocytes, 403,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 82 IU/L (RR 0 - 32 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 41 IU/L (RR 0 - 35 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 315 IU/L (RR 35 - 114 IU/L); gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 86 IU/L (0 - 40 IU/L); albumin, 3.2 g/dL (RR 3.5 - 5.5 g/dL); total bilirubin, 1.317 mg/dL (RR 0 - 1.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, l.05 mg/dL (RR 0 - 0.3 mg/dL); sodium, 131 mmol/L (135 - 145 mmol/L); chloride, 91 mmol/L (RR 98 - 107 mmol/L); serum creatinine, 0.73 mg/dL (RR 0.5 - 1.2 mg/dL); ferritin, 901 ng/mL (RR 13 - 150 ng/mL); sedimentation rate, 107 mm/h; and C-reactive protein, 398 mg/L (RR 0 - 5 mg/L); D-dimer, 0.4 μg/mL (RR 0 - 0.5 μg/mL). Serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, syphilis, Brucella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalo virus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Entamoeba histolytica and hydatid cyst is negative.\n\n【5】Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to exclude infective endocarditis at the same day. The transthoracic echocardiographic findings suggested that it may be due to infective endocarditis, and therefore, transesophageal echocardiography was recommended. The initial antibiotic regimen was intravenous meropenem (3 × 1 g/day), intravenous gentamicin (1 × 160 mg/day) and intravenous teicoplanin (1 × 800 mg/day maintenance dose following of 2 × 800 mg initial dose) for possible intra-abdominal sepsis and endocarditis after blood culture was obtained. Performed transesophageal echocardiogram finding after 1 week was negative for endocarditis.\n\n【6】After 4 days of incubation, blood cultures taken on admission grew S. anginosus . According to the antimicrobial susceptibility results, it was sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, chloramphenicol and vancomycin, but resistant to penicillin and oxacillin. The identification of the S. anginosus at the species level was done using the BBL Crystal system. The susceptibility of the isolate was performed by the disk diffusion test. S. anginosus growth on blood agar was shown in Figure 1A , and gram stain of S. anginosus was shown in Figure 1B .\n\n【7】The patient underwent an immediate radiologic evaluation. Hypoechoic areas in the liver were identified by the ultrasonography (USG). On the next day, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The T2-weighted MR image reveals a nodule in the gallbladder lumen that may belong to calculi and a lesion at approximately 14 × 9 cm in size in the right lobe of the liver . Liver abscess with biliary tract perforation was shown in Figure 2B . It was reported that the described findings may be significant for liver abscess secondary to gallbladder perforation. The patient was consulted by general surgery and taken to exploratory laparotomy. Surgical drainage of abscess and a cholecystectomy were performed. S. anginosus was isolated from peritoneum and abscess cultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of all isolates that were obtained from blood, peritoneal fluid and abscess sample was same. The initial antibiotic regimen was meropenem, gentamicin and teicoplanin, but after infective endocarditis was excluded, this regimen was continued with meropenem only. She was discharged after 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy with cure. At 3 months, she remained well and repeated abdominal USG showed normal results.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Members of the anginosus group are part of the normal flora of human mucous membranes and are infrequent significant pathogens. These species are catalase-negative gram-positive cocci, as the other members in the genus streptococcus. Colonies are typically < 0.5 mm in diameter after 24 h incubation and can be either beta- or alpha-hemolytic, although majority of them are alpha-hemolytic and are grouped to viridans group of streptococci. They are capable of causing a variety of multiple body site infections. They also tend to form abscesses and cause hematogenously disseminated infections .\n\n【10】Bacteremia from the anginosus group is rare and usually the result of an identifiable focus of infection, such as intra-abdominal abscess, deep-seated head and neck infection, brain abscess and endocarditis. It is usually associated with underlying hepatic and biliary tract disease, neoplasia and diabetes. In the absence of endocarditis or distant focal suppurative complications, bacteremia has a good prognosis. Liver abscess and associated sepsis can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition . In one study about anginosus group of bacteremia cases, it was reported that 16 (55%) had intra-abdominal sepsis (liver abscess, cecal abscess, abdominal abscess, cholangitis/cholecystitis) . In another study, members of the anginosus group were accounted 3-15% of streptococcal isolates from patients with endocarditis . S. anginosus is the most frequently isolated species in bacteremic patients, while S. constellatus is infrequently isolated species . In our case, all blood cultures of S. anginosus were isolated. The liver abscess and biliary tract perforation limited by peritoneum were detected on the CT. There were no endocarditis findings shown by the transesophageal echocardiogram. She was diagnosed as S. anginosus sepsis with liver abscess secondary to biliary tract perforation due to cholelithiasis according to clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. At surgery the diagnosis of cholelithiasis with perforation and liver abscess was confirmed. Surgical drainage of abscess and cholecystectomy with exploratory laparotomy was performed by the general surgery. S. anginosus was isolated from culture of both peritoneal fluid and abscess specimens. Our patient’s extensive intra-abdominal disease process was considered that liver abscess is most likely as a complication of cholestasis due to gallstones. The presence of high fever and palpable right upper quadrant tenderness may indicate an acute onset.\n\n【11】Anginosus group organisms are generally susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin G are usually less than 0.125 μg/mL with occasional strains with MICs greater than 1.0 µg/mL. Penicillin resistance is rare . According to a recent study, penicillin is proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent, with only five isolates (1.7%) showing penicillin resistance and 13 isolates (4.5%) showing intermediate resistance. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was approximately 2%, and approximately 1% of isolates showed intermediate resistance . The recent increase in MICs to penicillin G suggests that initiation of penicillin G combined with gentamicin may be prudent. Alternatively, higher doses of penicillin or vancomycin could be used. Some authors suggest initial combination therapy with penicillin and an aminoglycoside because of the tolerance in some isolates. Subsequent therapy should be guided by the results of culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n\n【12】Clinically, infections caused by these bacteria have responded well to beta-lactams. Vancomycin and/or clindamycin have been alternative choice in case of beta-lactam allergies. Minimum 2 weeks of therapy (or more) should be administered in the setting of bacteremia. The longer therapy may be needed in case of liver abscess, according to the clinical response to the therapy. In addition to parenteral antimicrobial therapy, treatment of an abscess involves drainage of purulent material or surgical excision . In our case, S. anginosus strain was resistant to oxacillin. Therefore, meropenem therapy was continued. The patient was successfully treated by surgical drainage and administration of appropriate antibiotherapy.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Anginosus group often causes invasive pyogenic infections. Positive blood cultures, especially when multiple, should be evaluated for further investigation. It is also important to consider that successful treatment of these infections requires surgery and appropriate antibiotics. Antimicrobial therapy should be administered until clinical signs of infection have resolved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b2d90e08-2db0-4fdd-bfb2-a2020ebec705", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder characterized by slow gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction . Symptoms of gastroparesis are variable, nonspecific and usually include nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety and abdominal pain . It has many potential etiologies. The most common causes of gastroparesis are idiopathic, diabetic and postsurgical, although other conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and collagen vascular diseases have been associated with symptomatic delayed gastric emptying. Postsurgical gastric dysfunction and overt gastroparesis are well-recognized consequences of therapeutic vagotomy for peptic ulcers or from inadvertent vagal nerve injury after Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Vagal nerve injury has been reported in 4-40% of patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication .\n\n【2】Rarely, acute cases of gastroparesis can present as an extracardiac complication caused by vagus nerve injury following radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of refractory atrial fibrillation with the onset of symptoms as early as 3 - 24 hours(h) post-procedure . This presentation is far less common than diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis and may present a challenge for management since only a few cases have been described in the literature.\n\n【3】Here, we report a case of acute delayed gastric empting as a consequence of percutaneous catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, which improved after symptomatic treatment with prokinetic agents.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 47-year-old female, high-performance athlete, with no documented structural heart disease underwent catheter ablation for drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). No complications were detected during procedure, and the patient was discharged home after 24 h of close observation. Seven days later, patient was seen in the Emergency Department with symptoms of worsening upper abdominal fullness and abdominal distention.\n\n【6】On admission, patient denied any nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal pain. Her appetite was decreased, but no weight loss was reported. General examination revealed normal vital signs. Abdominal exam showed a non-tender but distended abdomen; bowel sounds were markedly decreased and positive succussion splash during auscultation. No guarding or rebound tenderness was elicited. The hematological profile, blood sugar, electrolytes, renal function and LFTs were otherwise unremarkable. A CT of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) and oral contrast showed severe distention of the gastric lumen containing heterogeneous congested material. However, there was no evidence of complete luminal obstruction as contrast material was observed in the mid-ileum .\n\n【7】A scintigraphic 4 h gastric emptying test (GET) was performed. The patient consumed a standard 300 g meal labeled with 3mCiTc sulfur colloid. 32% of the meal was retained at the end of 4 h (normal < 10% retention at the end of 4 h) . Diagnosis of gastroparesis was made, a nasogastric tube was inserted and the patient was started on metoclopramide HCL 20 mg IV every 8 h.\n\n【8】On the following day, the patient became less symptomatic with a significant reduction in abdominal distention. On the third day, IV metoclopramide was switched to 10 mg PO before meals. The nasogastric tube had minimal drainage, and she was able to tolerate a liquid diet.\n\n【9】The patient made an excellent recovery and was discharged home with a tapering (4 weeks) course of metoclopramide. After the patient’s oral intake improved, solid food was introduced on day 7 and she was able to tolerate it. The patient did not complain of any gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of follow-up 2 weeks after hospital discharge.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Catheter ablation has improved the treatment paradigm of atrial fibrillation, but it may be associated with significant gastrointestinal complications. This case report describes an acute presentation of delayed gastric emptying as an adverse effect of such procedure.\n\n【12】Gastric contractions and subsequent gastric emptying of digested food material to allow nutrient absorption in the small intestine are the main functions of the stomach . These are controlled by several mechanisms, but most importantly they are modulated by the central nervous system and relayed to the stomach by the vagus nerve; therefore, an intact vagal nerve is required for normal gastric function. The paraesophageal vagal nervous plexus controls gastric peristalsis, gastric motility and the pyloric sphincter. Vagal nerve fibers are thought to descend the esophagus posteriorly to the left atrium and then through the diaphragm into the abdomen within the left vagal trunk . Based on this anatomy, the plexus is at risk of injury when the radiofrequency energy used during catheter ablation is delivered to the left atrial myocardium . Injury leads to acute gastric emptying delay, causing symptoms of gastroparesis similar to those seen in patients with long-standing uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n【13】Due to the anatomic variation of the human vagal nerve plexus around the lower esophagus, it is difficult to predict which patients are at risk during the procedure . As such, the incidence is not well defined. In a recent study, 11 cases of vagal nerve injury were described following ablation out of 3,695 total study population . A larger survey involving 182 centers worldwide, reported no vagal nerve injuries after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation . The onset of symptoms varies and can occur immediately after the procedure and up to 4 days later . Most patients present for evaluation with the onset of symptoms; however, rarely some may present after several months, with alarming symptoms such as weight loss .\n\n【14】In patients with a suggestive history, a high index of suspicion is important for making the diagnosis. A GET should be performed to confirm acute gastric emptying delay. In addition, other causes of such presentation must be ruled out; patients should be screened for diabetes, thyroid disease, GERD and recent viral illnesses. A thorough medication review should also be conducted, paying attention to narcotics and anti-cholinergic agents, which may mimic symptoms of acute gastroparesis .\n\n【15】Management is no different to that of other causes of acute gastric emptying delay, and it usually entails a combination of strategies. Restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance should be the initial step. Consumption of small frequent meals that are low fat and fiber has been shown to improve symptoms. Administration of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone are also of benefit in combination with anti-emetic agents . Because pyloric spasm may be a prominent component of this syndrome, endoscopy followed by balloon dilation or by local injection of Botulinum toxin can provide relieve in patients with symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks . Rarely, symptoms may persist over 6 months; in such patients surgery has proven effective . The use of temporary gastric stimulators in patients with long-standing symptoms has not been described.\n\n【16】The chronological symptomatology that results from acute gastric emptying delay following the procedure clearly indicates that this adverse effect is a sequela of atrial ablation. The clinical course and severity of the paraesophageal vagal nerve injury can vary, but most patients recover within 4 - 6 weeks with conservative treatment. As reported in the literature, an earlier onset of symptoms seems to correlate with significant residual gastric motor dysfunction . Also, those patients who present late in their disease course are more likely to be evaluated endoscopically .\n\n【17】We describe a rare case of acute gastric emptying delay following catheter ablation for management of refractory PAF. As electrophysiologists continue to use this procedure in the management of atrial fibrillation, such cases will continue to arise. It is our intent to make gastroenterologists aware of this rare complication, to facilitate early initial diagnosis and management.\n\n【18】Abbreviations\n\n【19】GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease; IV: intravenous; GET: gastric emptying test", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "67e67fa8-2bf8-4ad9-85cb-ad0809719cfc", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Intracranial ependymomas are frequently seen in children and are mainly encountered in the posterior fossa. Considering their cell component, they are usually attached to the ventricles. Supratentorial ependymomas generally affects an older age group (mean age, 18 - 24 years) ; only sporadic and rare pediatric cases which were not attached to the ventricle have been reported in the literature. We present a case of a supratentorial intraparenchymal ependymoma in a child reviewing the pathophysiology and discussing the management for such pathology.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 6-year-old Somali girl patient presented to the emergency department with history of progressive headache and vomiting that started 3 months ago, and was associated with unsteady gait and inability to control urine in the past 3 days. There was no history of convulsions or fever.\n\n【4】On admission, she was drowsy (GCS score = 14/15), pupils were bilaterally reactive and equal, Papilloedema on fundoscopic examination had left hemiparesis and the cranial nerves were intact. Soon after admission she experienced generalized convulsions. Brain CT scan  showed right frontal lobe space-occupying lesion mainly cystic with solid component and calcifications. Both components enhanced with the contrast agent. There was surrounding edema with mass effect on the ipsilateral ventricle and obstructive dilatation of the contra lateral ventricle. MR brain could not be done. She underwent promptly a right frontal craniotomy. Aiming at brain relaxation, the cystic part was primarily tackled through puncturing using a brain cannula and an amount of 30 mL of brownish fluid was obtained. Corticotomy, until the tumor cyst, exposed the solid component which was red-grayish glistening and multilobulated with highly vascularized and friable structure. The latter was grossly removed. The cystic wall was ill-defined and firmly adherent to parenchyma, so it was spared to avoid brain damage. The lateral ventricle was not opened during the procedure.\n\n【5】Histological examination of the specimen revealed tightly packed cells with oval nuclei having granular chromatin with no evidence of mitosis or atypia. The cells were arranged around the vessels forming perivascular pseudo rosettes with multiple foci of calcification typical of ependymoma (WHO grade II) .\n\n【6】Immunohistochemical staining was positive for glial acidic fibrillary protein and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) .\n\n【7】Postoperative CT scan of the brain  showed no tumoral residue but active hydrocephalus managed by insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. The post operative course was uneventful. The patient was referred to the oncologist for adjuvant radiotherapy considering the remaining wall of the cystic component. Unfortunately she was lost of view.\n\n【8】Eight months later, the patient presented to us with persistent headache accompanied with nausea. She remained conscious without focal neurological deficit. On enquiry, it appeared that she did not have the recommended adjuvant radiotherapy for socio-economic reason. MRI brain showed recurrence of the right frontal lesion . The patient underwent surgical revision with total removal of the tumor including the solid component and the cystic one; the right frontal horn was compressed but the ventricle was not invaded. Histopathology of the specimen confirmed the same previous diagnosis with scattered cellular mitosis and mild atypia noted (still grade II). Post operative CT scan did not show any residual tumor . The post operative outcome was complicated with meningitis, thus the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was replaced with an external ventricular drainage system with adequate antibiotics prescribed. Patient cured from meningitis and we were able to wean her of the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) diversion. We thoroughly explained to the family the absolute necessity for completing radiotherapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】In 1863, Virchow defined ependymomas as tumors with ependymal cells forming ependymal rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes . They usually develop from the ependymal and subependymal cells surrounding the cerebral ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord as well as from ependymal clusters in the filum terminale. Histopathologically, ependymal tumors include low-grade tumors (for example, myxopapillary ependymoma) and high-grade tumors (for example, anaplastic ependymoma) . They comprise approximately 1.2 to 9% of all brain tumors . According to the 1993 World Health Organization classification, ependymomas are divided into the following groups: ependymoma, anaplastic (malignant) ependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, and subependymoma .\n\n【11】Pathophysiology\n\n【12】Supratentorial ependymomas without relation to the ventricular system are uncommon and their pathophysiology is still not well established.\n\n【13】As its name implies, extra-ventricular ependymomas arise outside the walls of the ventricular system. One of the etiological theories is based on the postulate of remnant nests of ependymal cells in the frontal lobe anterior and inferior to the normal extent of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles in all normal brains; these remnants come from an extension toward the frontal lobe bases of the frontal horns, so-called “olfactory ventricle”, that collapses and regresses during normal development. However, random distribution of ependymomas around the periventricular region, rather than restriction to the angles of the ventricles, suggests an alternative mechanism .\n\n【14】Diagnostic imaging\n\n【15】There is no specific MR image for intra parenchymal ependymomas. They may include calcifications in different patterns, or have heterogeneous enhancement. Differential diagnoses include oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, germ cell tumors, desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor.\n\n【16】The supratentorial ependymomas tend to be larger in size than those infratentorial. Armington et al  found that 94% of supratentorial tumors manifest with a size larger than 4 cm, while most Infratentorial ependymomas are significantly smaller at presentation. Their shape is irregular in the posterior fossa accommodating to shape of ventricle or cisterns; however they are spherical in the cerebral hemisphere. Supratentorial ependymomas often contain a cystic component, while Infratentorial ependymomas are often more solid tumors . Signal from ependymal cysts is higher than that from CSF. FLAIR sequence better visualizes the border between tumor and ventricular wall. Calcifications, ranging from small punctuate foci to large masses, are very common in both infra and supratentorial ependymomas (40-80% of cases) . Our patient presented with a tumor larger than 4 cm in size, mainly cystic with calcifications imbedded in the wall and in the solid part.\n\n【17】An uncommon Intratumoral hemorrhage in supratentorial ependymomas might be mis-interpreted as traumatic in origin following a syncope-head trauma scenario. The tumor will be betrayed by the follow up images showing resorption of the hematoma and clearly depicting the lesion. Takeshima et al. reported a case with at least 3 episodes of hemorrhage before being diagnosed . In our case we anticipate at least one attack of intra-tumoral bleeding prior to presentation based on the perioperative finding of the brownish (altered blood) contents of the cystic component.\n\n【18】Histopathology\n\n【19】Conversely to the brain infiltrating fibrillary astrocytomas, most extraventricular ependymomas are well circumscribed and well demarcated from the normal cerebral parenchyma thus amenable to total surgical excision. At histological analysis, ependymomas are moderately cellular tumors with rare mitotic figures. The tumor cells are characteristically organized in perivascular pseudorosettes and, less commonly, ependymal rosettes. They are considered World Health Organization (WHO) grade II lesions .\n\n【20】Shuangshoti S et al  found that there was no significant relation between histopathology, Ki-67 proliferation index, p53 immunolabeling, tumor ploidy, and biological behavior.\n\n【21】Treatment\n\n【22】As the tumor is amenable to total radical resection, radical surgery alone is a reasonable option as the initial treatment for solid extraventricular tumors located far from clinically eloquent brain areas. A postoperative MRI with contrast has also been recommended for further evaluation of the extent of resection . Early second-look surgery may be proposed to achieve total excision in selected patients with accessible residual tumor detected on postoperative MRI .\n\n【23】The need for postoperative adjuvant therapy has been controversial for supratentorial ependymomas. Postoperative radiation therapy must be administered in every case of partially resected ependymomas due to proximity to eloquent areas. So, in general, it is considered safe to observe the patient when postoperative CT or MR shows gross total excision, particularly when the tumor is of low grade. Besides, supratentorial ependymomas tend to recur in regions amenable to surgery. Therefore, reoperation to attempt complete tumor resection before initiation of radiotherapy should be considered .\n\n【24】It is worth mentioning that some authors recommend adjuvant radiotherapy if the tumor is cystic, even after apparently total resection. Adjuvant radiotherapy has also been suggested to be given to patients with anaplastic ependymomas . In our case we considered complementary radiotherapy as the cyst wall was incompletely removed after the first surgical procedure.\n\n【25】Prophylactic craniospinal irradiation is no longer advocated unless cerebrospinal seeding is evident on imaging or cerebrospinal fluid studies . Schild et al reported a series of 80 patients with ependymomas including 12 patients with myxopapillary subtype; in this study the craniospinal irradiation did not have an additional benefit on the survival . Considering the same series, and with a special regard to myxopapillary supratentorial ependymomas which received radiotherapy, the 5-year-local control rate was 100% with doses exceeding 50 Gy and 67% with lesser doses . When compared to the other subtypes of ependymomas, patients with myxopapillary ependymomas must be evaluated with serial follow-up because of their propensity to recur locally or metastasize even after several years.\n\n【26】The benefit of chemotherapeutic agents is still questionable. They took place particularly in children for whom radiotherapy is contraindicated or in previously irradiated subjects with an inoperable tumor .\n\n【27】Prognosis\n\n【28】Throughout the literature, three major factors were identified determining the outcome. The most important prognostic variable was the presence of radiologic residual disease, seen at postoperative MR imaging or CT. The 5-year-tumor-free survival rate was 75% and 15% for patients with no radiologic evidence of residual tumor and those with residual disease in which progression cannot be stopped, respectively .\n\n【29】Age at presentation is also a significant prognostic factor . Adults have a better five-year survival rate than children. Children less than 2 - 5 years of age, have a significantly worse prognosis than older children; in the young children, five-year survival rate is 22-40% as compared to 60-75% in older children . Prognosis in children older than five years is same as that of adults . The 5 and 10-year survival rates for adults are 57.1% and 45%, respectively .\n\n【30】When considered together, age at diagnosis along with extent of the surgical resection was better correlated to outcome .\n\n【31】The last prognostic variable is the duration of symptoms preceding diagnosis. Patients with symptoms lasting less than 1 month before diagnosis have a worse outcome than those with a more protracted course .\n\n【32】In regards to tumor location, patients with supratentorial ependymomas have generally a better survival rate than patients with posterior fossa ependymomas .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "618d6a6a-9ec9-424c-affe-b739abad81da", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between vessels and can be found in any part of the body. It can be congenital or acquired. In obstetrics and gynecology, an AVM may be acquired either following treatment of miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, or following a cesarean section. When ruptured, AVM can lead to potentially life-threatening intractable hemorrhage. It is one of the extremely rare causes of PPH and presents great difficulty in recognition and initiation of correct treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Our patient was a 40-year-old para 2 with a history of lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) in her first pregnancy. She had no other surgical or medical issues of note. Her current pregnancy had been uneventful with a planned elective repeat LSCS at 39 weeks. She presented in spontaneous labor prior to her scheduled surgery and opted for a trial of vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC). However, there was failure to progress beyond 6 cm dilatation and she underwent an emergency LSCS. The procedure was complicated due to intra-abdominal adhesions resulting in injury to urinary bladder which was repaired in layers. The blood loss during the procedure was average. The patient made good recovery and was discharged home on third day post-procedure with the indwelling urinary catheter in situ . The catheter was removed 1 week post-procedure and patient showed complete recovery. However, she presented to the emergency department on day 25 postnatal with significant secondary PPH associated with an episode of hypovolemic shock. Following resuscitation, she underwent an examination under anesthesia (EUA). Suction evacuation of the uterus was done and blood clots along with a small amount of retained products of conception (RPOC) were obtained. The blood loss was estimated as 2.5 L and she received 4 units packed red cells, 2 units fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit platelets. She was also given uterotonics such as carbetocin, prostaglandin analogues such as carboprost and misoprostol along with intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid for control of bleeding. She received broad spectrum IV antibiotics due to the possibility of endometritis. Her bleeding settled and following a period of observation she was discharged on third post-operative day. A week following her discharge, she re-presented to the emergency department of our hospital with another episode of significant bleeding. On account of ongoing bleeding, she underwent another EUA and evacuation of uterus with a possibility of proceeding to a laparotomy and a hysterectomy as a last resort. The interventional radiologist was alerted as the possibility of uterine artery embolization (UAE) was also under consideration. There was minimal curettings obtained during the evacuation of uterus which was carried out under ultrasound guidance. A pelvic angiogram done showed profuse contrast extravasation and acute bleeding from the left uterine artery . A super-selective embolization of left uterine artery was performed. Post-embolization angiogram showed satisfactory results with no further contrast extravasation . Thereafter the patient recovered well and was discharged well after a week. Currently, 6 months post-embolization, she is under follow-up for irregular periods.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】PPH is one of the most important causes of maternal mortality and morbidity . According to the World Health Organization, it affects approximately 2% of all women in relation to childbirth and is the leading cause of maternal mortality in most low-income countries . According to the MBRRACE (UK) report of December 2014, from the year 2009 to 2012, obstetric hemorrhage in the UK accounts for approximately 10% of all direct maternal deaths . It has an overall mortality rate of 0.49 per 100,000 maternities (CI 0.29 - 0.78) and a case fatality rate for massive hemorrhage of approximately 1 per 1,200 women .\n\n【6】PPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 h after birth . Severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1,000 mL or more within the same time period after birth . It may also be classified as primary and secondary . While primary PPH occurs within the period from delivery up to 24 h post-delivery , secondary PPH occurs from the period between 24 h and 12 weeks postnatal . The most common causes include uterine atony and genital tract trauma while the less common causes include uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, infection or maternal coagulopathy disorders . Ruptured uterine AVM or pseudoaneurysm as a cause of intractable secondary PPH is an extremely rare phenomenon but should be considered and looked for in intractable PPH where other common causes have been excluded .\n\n【7】Uterine AVM can be congenital or acquired, when it is also known as a “pseudoaneurysm” of the uterine artery . An acquired uterine AVM is characterized as a communication between the branches of the uterine artery and the myometrial venous plexus . It rarely affects nulliparous women without a history of uterine instrumentation or surgery such as evacuation of uterus, cesarean section, dilatation and curettage . Other than iatrogenic causes, pathologic processes such as infection, trophoblastic disease, and malignancies involving the uterus have also been found to be associated with acquired uterine AVM . In obstetric, there is another form of acquired AVM called pseudoaneurysm of the uterine arteries, which is more likely to be the cause in case of intractable secondary PPH . It is said that trauma to the uterine arteries during LSCS is commonly found to be associated with this type of vascular abnormality . The hypothesis is that it may be due to lateral extension of the lower uterine segment incision and failure to secure the apex during repair, thus leading to formation of a pseudoaneurysm .\n\n【8】Uterine AVM has traditionally been diagnosed during laparotomy or during pathological examination of the uterus after a hysterectomy . The method of diagnosing uterine AVMs has traditionally been proved to be difficult . Typical diagnostic procedures such as pelvic examination, hysteroscopy and gray-scale ultrasonography have not been found to be adequately effective in diagnosing this condition . In recent years, Doppler ultrasound studies and focused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to be useful in diagnosing uterine AVM . It provides a non-invasive method of diagnosis of uterine AVMs . MRI is mostly helpful where there is doubt in diagnosis on ultrasonography and there is an aversion to invasive angiography . The current gold standard in diagnosing uterine AVM is by pelvic angiography which maps out the pelvic vascular anatomy . It also helps to identify the bleeder and its leading “feeder” vessels whereby selective embolization can be done at the same setting as a conservative treatment option .\n\n【9】Historically, the main treatment for uterine AVMs has been hysterectomy . However, embolization is the preferred treatment with a high success rate of > 90% , most commonly the uterine artery . It also serves as an alternative option for patients seeking to preserve fertility  and major operative morbidity associated with a hysterectomy. However, it can be associated with complications including fever, neurological complications, puncture site hematomas, abscess, ischemic complications like vesicovaginal fistulas, endometrial atrophy, etc. The effect of embolization on future fertility is still unknown and is a subject of research .\n\n【10】In the case of our lady she had history of prior LSCS with last procedure performed approximately 4 weeks prior to her presentation with first of the recurring episodes of PPH. She had also undergone evacuation of uterus twice during the management of her PPH. We hypothesized that her uterine surgeries may have predisposed her to the formation of her pseudoaneurysm in her left uterine artery, a pathology which accounted for her presentation.\n\n【11】A review of literature shows that there are no known prevention measures for acquired AVM except for high clinical suspicion when a patient presents with intractable PPH with a background of recent surgical intervention, i.e. cesarean section . There must also be diligent care during surgical repair, i.e. cesarean section to reduce the risk of developing iatrogenic vascular abnormalities that may cause such rare intractable hemorrhage .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Uterine AVM as a cause of PPH unresponsive to conventional treatment methods is rare but can be potentially life-threatening. In the case of an intractable PPH, there should be high index of clinical suspicion especially in the presence of risk factors such as prior surgical intervention. Multi-disciplinary care involving interventional radiology team with use of selective UAE as treatment method should be considered should suspicion of uterine AVM arise, due to its high success rate and minimally invasive nature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "4fd4d132-c5cd-4a6f-8cca-117c50b9340d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Malnutrition is a rare, but known, cause of hepatic dysfunction. Chronic starvation can lead to a spectrum of histologic changes, ranging from glycogenic insufficiency to fatty deposition in hepatocytes. These changes are further reflected in liver biochemical derangements, previously described in patients with anorexia nervosa . While nourishment ultimately leads to the resolution of these laboratory abnormalities in most cases, physiologic changes in refeeding can also cause an acute but temporary worsening of transaminases. We present a patient who exhibited both phenomena of nutrition-related transaminase abnormalities.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 45-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a failure to thrive. She was in her usual state of health until 6 years prior to admission. She developed a poor appetite and severe food aversion, and her weight declined from 54.5 kg to her admission weight of 34.2 kg. The patient reported chronic constipation and intolerance of many foods, including oil, fats and meats. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal bloating, pain, or diarrhea. The personal and family medical histories were unremarkable. She was not on any prior medications or supplements. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. She measured 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 34.2 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . There was profound cachexia. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, or distention. A comprehensive gastrointestinal workup including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, and small bowel series, was unremarkable. Complete blood count was normal. Notable abnormalities on the metabolic panel were the sodium at 129 mEq/L (normal 135 - 148), chloride at 88 mEq/L (normal 96 - 109), and creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL (normal 0.5 - 1.2). The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 154 U/L (normal 0 - 31) and 136 U/L (normal 0 - 31), respectively. The serum bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, glucose, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin and prealbumin were normal. Psychiatry was consulted, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\n【7】The patient was started on a regular diet on day 1 of hospitalization, with estimated needs of 1,345 - 1,598 calories per day and 40 - 47 g of protein per day. However, given her gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, several tests were pursued which required alterations in her diet during the initial week of hospitalization. For the most part, she was nil per os (NPO) status or ordered for a clear liquid diet while workup was pending until day 8 of hospitalization. Thus, refeeding was determined to have started on day 8 of hospitalization. She was initially ordered a vegan diet per her request, with subsequent liberalization to a regular diet. A calorie count performed on days 14 - 16 of hospitalization revealed she was consuming almost 100% of all food trays. Total parenteral nutrition was discussed early during her hospitalization, given food intolerance and disruptions in oral nutrition; however, it was not pursued. Notably, her weight initially decreased from her admission weight of 34.2 kg to a nadir around 30.8 - 31.0 kg on days 10 - 13 of hospitalization. Her weight began to increase starting day 14 of hospitalization or day 7 of refeeding.\n\n【8】On hospitalization day 6 (i.e. before refeeding), the patient’s AST and ALT rose steeply to 671 and 362 U/L, respectively. They peaked at 750 and 638 U/L, respectively, on hospitalization day 10, 2 days after refeeding was initiated . Additional laboratory workup for the etiology of liver injury (LI) included hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, which were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper were normal. Ferritin and serum iron were mildly elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibody titers were slightly elevated at 1:20 dilution, but this was considered a false positive with negative anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. The immunoglobulin profile was also normal. Acetaminophen levels were undetectable. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was normal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed on hospitalization day 11, 3 days after refeeding; histology revealed mild glycogen depletion, marked ceroid pigment around the central veins, and scattered hepatocellular atrophy . There was no histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or significant fibrosis.\n\n【9】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【10】The patient continued to tolerate a regular diet and gain weight during her hospital course. She was eventually transferred to an Eating Disorders Unit for monitoring and treatment. She then started on the nutrition protocol for eating disorders with a slow increase in daily nutrition from 1,500 calories per day to 4,000 calories per day by day 40 of hospitalization. Over the subsequent 2 months, the patient’s weight increased from 34.2 kg (BMI 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) to 38.4 kg (BMI 16.0 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and her transaminases normalized.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Malnutrition is known to cause hepatic dysfunction and even severe liver failure . One of the first reports linking anorexia nervosa to hepatic dysfunction included two anorexic women found to have elevated AST and ALT, which resolved with increased body weights . A prospective study of 101 anorexic Japanese women found that BMI negatively correlated with both AST and ALT levels prior to refeeding .\n\n【13】Elevations in serum transaminases may stem from malnutrition-related hepatic steatosis. One hypothesis has been the impaired degradation and secretion of lipids, resulting in the depletion of several amino acids . In carnitine deficiency, for example, long-chain acyl-CoA cannot be shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation and is instead shunted toward triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis . A recent case report also noted the presence of abundant lipofuscin and hepatic steatosis in a patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who presented with severe protein-calorie malnutrition . Our patient, however, did not have evidence of hepatic steatosis on liver biopsy.\n\n【14】Another proposed mechanism of LI is starvation-induced autophagy . Autophagy involves the lysosomal degradation of cellular components into potentially reusable subunits; it has an adaptive cytoprotective role under stress conditions . In nutrient deprivation, autophagy can delay cell death by recycling endogenous metabolites and even suppressing apoptosis . An increase in hepatocyte permeability during autophagic cell death has been posited as a reason for elevated serum transaminases in the absence of significant cellular necrosis on histology .\n\n【15】Refeeding\n\n【16】Interestingly, our patient also had an acute and sharp rise in transaminase levels during her hospitalization that coincided with increased oral intake, though it preceded her increase in weight. LI during the refeeding phase is hypothesized to be related to a rapid increase in glucose availability leading to fat deposition . In a study of 67 patients with anorexia nervosa and normal ALT on admission, 32 (48%) developed elevated ALT during oral refeeding . Similar to other studies, the degree of ALT elevation was mild compared to starvation-related ALT levels prior to refeeding. One study showed that the quantity of initially prescribed calories was associated with increased odds of elevated liver enzymes in 14 patients, further implicating increased nutrition as a causative factor .\n\n【17】Normalization\n\n【18】While on the Eating Disorders Unit, our patient’s serum transaminases progressively normalized, coincident with continued oral intake and an increase in BMI. The improvement presumably stemmed from the resolution of chronic and acute insults: malnutrition and acute refeeding.\n\n【19】In summary, severe malnutrition and acute refeeding are distinct entities of LI relevant to the malnourished patient. In this case, the peak in AST and ALT occurred shortly after the start of refeeding but before the nadir in the patient’s weight, so it is unclear whether it was malnutrition or refeeding, or both, that led to the acute rise. Both are important considerations on the differential diagnosis when evaluating a malnourished patient with abnormal transaminases. Early risk stratification and close monitoring may help minimize acute hepatic injury and other serious adverse events in patients with eating disorders and malnutrition.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】Both chronic starvation and refeeding have been associated with LI. In chronic starvation, malnutrition may lead to hepatic steatosis due to impaired degradation and secretion of lipids. Starvation-induced autophagy is another potential mechanism of LI, with increased hepatocyte permeability during this phase potentially causing elevations in AST and ALT. Reintroducing nutrition may also result in rises in AST and ALT, possibly due to a rapid increase in glucose availability, though the mechanism is less clear. These liver injuries are crucial for clinicians to recognize in patients with malnutrition or those undergoing refeeding. Fortunately, they often resolve with conservative management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Intestinal BD, which is a specific subtype of BD with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, accounts for approximately 3-16% of BD cases . BD that is associated with bone marrow failure, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and anaplastic anemia, frequently has GI involvement . Moreover, concomitant trisomy 8 reportedly accounted for 54-86% of cases with BD with bone marrow failure .\n\n【2】Conventionally, the pharmacological treatments of BD include 5-aminosalicylic acid, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as thiopurines . However, many patients fail to respond to these treatments . Patients with intestinal BD have been demonstrated to respond effectively and safely to adalimumab and infliximab , but most of them who associated MDS and concomitant trisomy 8 have experienced refractoriness to conventional treatment . For these intractable cases, adalimumab and azacytidine were reportedly effective as treatment for the MDS . However, no information is currently available regarding the achievement of complete remission with mesalazine for intestinal BD associated with MDS and concomitant trisomy 8. Herein we reported a case of intestinal BD achieving complete remission with mesalazine. Differentiating MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 from drug-induced MDS by examination of the bone marrow and the cytogenetic changes is indispensable. Intestinal BD patients who develop pancytopenia would probably need sufficient doses of mesalazine for treatment.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient was a 39-year-old man who was referred to our hospital because of ileocecal ulcer, moderate right lower abdominal pain and pancytopenia. He was diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis 2 years ago because of pain, stiffness and, swelling of a few joints including the knees and ankles. Combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate was started, but it had to be discontinued because of the emergence of pancytopenia after 1 year; at that time, he was also diagnosed as acne vulgaris. The patient had no history of genital ulceration and uveitis. Physical findings revealed recurrent oral ulcerations and acneiform eruptions on his body with slight pallor but without fever. Laboratory investigations showed: white blood cell count, 1,700/μL; red blood cell count, 339 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; hemoglobin, 10.0 g/dL; platelet count, 3.3 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; myelocyte, 4%; metamyelocyte, 2%; total protein, 7.1 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 272 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 9 IU/L; immunoglobulin (Ig) G, 1,208 mg/dL; IgA, 155 mg/dL; IgM, 125 mg/dL; CH 50, 75 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 5.8 mg/dL. Pancytopenia with a left shift was seen. Human leukocyte antigens B51 and B27 were positive. Negative results were obtained from tests for -β-D-glucan, QuantiFERON and cytomegalovirus antigenemia C-7HRP . Colonoscopy and pathologic examination of biopsy specimen from the ulcer  showed the moderate inflammatory infiltrates composed of neutrophils and mononuclear cells and necrosis in the submucosa and regenerative epithelia. According to diagnostic criteria defined by the BD Research Committee of Japan, the patient was diagnosed as intestinal BD, incomplete-type, based on the presence of two major features of recurrent oral ulceration and typical skin lesions, and two minor features of arthritis without deformity and ileocecal ulcer . For the treatment of the ileocecal ulcer from intestinal BD, mesalazine at 3,000 mg daily was immediately started. Four months later, colonoscopy showed an ulcer scar at the ileocecal valve.\n\n【5】In addition, evaluation of the pancytopenia with bone marrow study showed hypercellularity with trilineage dysplastic changes, particularly with increased number of megakaryocytes that were small in size and, in part, had multiple dispersed nuclei. Cytogenetic analysis exhibited 47,XY,dup(q21q32), idem+8 . Based on these findings, a definite diagnosis of intestinal BD, incomplete-type, associated with MDS and positivity for trisomy 8, was finally confirmed. After healing of the ileocecal ulcer was achieved, two cycles of azacytidine were administered and, subsequently bone marrow transplantation was performed. The patient has done well with continuous ulcer healing at the ileocecal valve for a year.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】In this report, we presented herein a case of intestinal BD associated with MDS and positivity for trisomy 8 that achieved complete ulcer healing after administration of mesalazine for 4 months.\n\n【8】The contributory causes of MDS development secondary to intestinal BD include drug-induced MDS and episodic MDS involving trisomy 8. Treatment-induced immunosuppression has been suspected to increase the risk of malignancy . In the present case, the combination therapy of adalimumab and methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis was discontinued when pancytopenia was detected because of the possibility of developing adverse events such as hematological malignancies. Indeed, monotherapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists or methotrexate is known to increase the risk for melanomatous and non-melanomatous skin cancers, but its risk for hematological disorders, such as MDS and lymphoproliferative diseases, is not clear . Moreover, a recent meta-analysis on patients who were given immunosuppressive therapy for immuno-mediated diseases after a prior malignancy showed that the incidence rates of new primary cancer (i.e. skin cancer, melanoma, hematological malignancy, breast and solid cancers) were not significantly different among patients who did not receive immunosuppression, those who receive anti-TNF-α antagonists and those who received conventional immunosuppression with thiopurines and methotrexate . In addition, accumulated data did not show evidence that anti-TNF-α antagonists or conventional immunosuppression induced chromosomal duplications and trisomy. Analysis of 39 cases of BD associated with MDS has demonstrated the presence of the trisomy 8 allele in 6.5-16.3% of patients with primary MDS . In addition, trisomy 8 in MDS cases complicated with BD is a very common chromosomal abnormality .\n\n【9】Interestingly, dup(q21q32) as a sole cytogenetic event was reportedly associated with a leukemic transformation in MDS, and trisomy 8 was likely to be secondary to this chromosomal duplication . This suggested that the presence of dup(q21q32) may be a triggering factor for trisomy 8. Based on the above, development of MDS upon the emergence of pancytopenia was expected. The GI involvement in patients with intestinal BD associated with MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 is generally refractory to conventional medical therapies .\n\n【10】Anti-TNF-α antagonists, azacytidine and bone marrow transplantation have been reported to be effective for these intractable cases . However, in the present case, the GI involvement successfully responded to mesalazine at 3,000 mg. To our best knowledge, this was the first case of mesalazine therapy for a patient with intestinal BD associated with MDS and positivity for trisomy 8. Further study on a larger number of patients is necessary to validate the predictive factors of response to treatment, including mesalazine, anti-TNF-α antagonists and azacytidine.\n\n【11】In conclusion, upon the emergence of pancytopenia in patients with intestinal BD, examining the bone marrow and the cytogenetic changes to differentiate episodic MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 from drug-induced MDS is needed; moreover, treatment with sufficient doses of mesalazine might be helpful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e4006a4b-e234-490a-828b-90af0afae7d0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】It is over 20 years since the discovery of frequent somatic mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) . This finding led to elucidation of the pathophysiology of clear cell RCCs in terms of defective VHL gene product function leading to reduced poly-ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), accumulation of HIF1α and increased transcription of numerous HIF1α target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and erythropoietin .\n\n【2】Over the past decade, the therapeutic focus for advanced RCC has shifted from immunotherapy (using cytokines) to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies directed against over-expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF or PDGF. Several multi-targeted, predominantly anti-angiogenic small-molecule TKIs have shown robust evidence of efficacy in clear cell RCC including sunitinib , sorafenib , pazopanib  and axitinib . A VEGF-targeted monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, has also shown evidence of survival benefit in combination with alpha-interferon .\n\n【3】In the pivotal phase III trials of the above-mentioned TKIs, rates of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events were 8% with sunitinib, 19% in cytokine-pre-treated and 12% in treatment-naive patients with pazopanib, 4% with sorafenib and 4% with axitinib. The most common adverse events are diarrhea, abnormalities of liver function tests (particularly with pazopanib), fatigue, hypothyroidism, hypertension, reduced appetite, nausea and poor wound healing. Returning to vascular events, myocardial dysfunction, hemorrhage, and thrombosis (arterial and venous) also occur. Most toxicities are mild and manageable with simple supportive measures or dose reduction.\n\n【4】An understanding of the normal physiological function of VEGF provides some degree of explanation of some of the serious “on-target” adverse events of anti-angiogenic TKIs and bevacizumab. Regulation of endothelial cell integrity, migration, proliferation and apoptosis is dependent on VEGF. Inhibition of VEGF function by pharmacological manipulations may lead to reduced nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI <sub>2 </sub> ) production which favors platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and thrombosis . Interference with endothelial cell function leads to exposure of pro-thrombotic phospholipids and underlying stroma .\n\n【5】The risk of arterial thromboembolism is particularly associated with anti-angiogenic TKIs as evidenced by the very low rates of vascular toxicity associated with the mutant BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in melanoma  or erlotinib  in epidermal growth factor receptor mutant non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n【6】Here we present two cases of cerebral ischemia occurring in patients without multiple risk factors who were taking pazopanib and axitinib for metastatic RCC with differing outcomes.\n\n【7】Case Reports\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】A 58-year-old Caucasian female presented with lethargy, exhaustion and macroscopic hematuria followed by the development of nausea, leg edema and abdominal distension. Her past medical history was remarkable only for prior left shoulder surgery and bilateral oophorectomy for endometriosis. She was a non-smoker with no family history of malignancy. CT scan demonstrated a 10 × 9 cm right renal mass with invasion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the level of the hepatic confluence as well as bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and a 1 cm left upper lobe lung nodule consistent with metastasis. The tumor infiltrated the surrounding musculature. CT-guided biopsy of the renal mass only showed fibro-collagenous tissue and some atypical epithelial cells that were not diagnostic of malignancy. The patient declined repeat biopsy and based on clinical and radiological features, she commenced targeted therapy with pazopanib at 600 mg daily. WHO performance status was one. Fourteen days after starting treatment, she presented with a 3-day history of severe generalized headaches and vomiting. On neurological examination, she was withdrawn, virtually aphasic with right arm and leg weakness in a pyramidal pattern. An unenhanced CT head scan demonstrated a small area of low attenuation change in the left temporal lobe. Pazopanib was withheld. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was performed and showed clear, colourless CSF. There was no evidence of xanthrochromia, and CSF protein and glucose were within normal limits. The CSF was acellular, PCR for viral infections was negative and the opening pressure was normal. Diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain showed a shower of acute “embolic” infarcts bilaterally with a greater degree of involvement of the frontal and parietal lobes than the occipital lobes . The highest blood pressure recorded during admission was 138/81 mm Hg. Electroencephalogram showed an excess of slow activity consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Secondary prophylaxis against further infarction was initiated with clopidogrel and simvastatin. A search for cardiac sources of embolism was made but transthoracic echocardiography was unremarkable except for mild diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation) and a visible tumor mass in the IVC. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recording showed normal sinus rhythm with infrequent multi-focal ventricular ectopic beats and single supraventricular ectopic beats. Doppler ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was unremarkable. Approximately 6 weeks after the cerebrovascular event, following a gradual improvement in neurological deficits, she started further targeted therapy with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Her tolerance of everolimus was poor with symptomatic anemia, stomatitis and oral ulceration, nausea and reduced appetite. A switch in treatment to the VEGFR1, 2, 3 antagonist axitinib was briefly considered but ultimately she died from progressive disease 3 months after starting everolimus.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented with cough and exertional breathlessness on a background of frequent infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis. She was an ex-smoker with a 20 pack-year history and did not drink alcohol. CT scan demonstrated a large heterogeneously enhancing right renal mass, small bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases and a 3.3 cm right hilar mass with partial collapse of the right middle lobe. There were no hepatic or skeletal metastases. She underwent palliative nephrectomy revealing a Fuhrman grade 4 pT3a clear cell RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation and necrosis. She commenced treatment with sunitinib (50 mg daily, 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off) but the dose was reduced to 37.5 mg daily due to stomatitis and oral ulceration. Treatment was complicated by hypertension (up to 170/100 mm Hg) and ramipril 5 mg daily was instituted with good effect. After 12 months of treatment, imaging demonstrated a partial response (57% reduction in disease volume). This response was ongoing for a further 9 months, at which point she developed progressive disease with enlarging aorto-caval and right hilar lymphadenopathy and new parenchymal lung metastases. Treatment was switched from sunitinib to axitinib. She tolerated axitinib well although subclinical hypothyroidism (thyroid stimulating hormone 18.55 mU/L) developed and was treated with levothyroxine replacement (25 μg daily). Treatment was interrupted after 9 weeks due to grade 3 transaminase elevation (alanine aminotransferase 282 U/mL) and she was treated with doxycycline for a suspected infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis. Three days after stopping axitinib, she presented acutely unwell with a 12-h history of constant frontal headache, visual disturbance, nausea, left facial droop, dysarthria and left arm and leg weakness. Capillary blood glucose was 5.7 mM and blood pressure was 145/87 mm Hg. On examination, there was pyramidal weakness affecting the left upper and lower limb (MRC grade 4/5), a mild facial nerve weakness, and left homonymous hemianopia. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal examinations were unremarkable, and respiratory examination revealed expiratory wheeze and reduced air entry at the left lung base. Laboratory investigations showed platelets of 141 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> , white blood cell count 15.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, absolute neutrophil count 12.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, alanine aminotransferase 197 U/mL, alkaline phosphatase 455 IU/L and albumen 32 g/L. Contrast-enhanced CT head showed small hypodense areas in the left cerebellum and left occipital lobe. A clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was made and she was treated with 300 mg aspirin daily. Twenty-four hours later, she became drowsy, dysarthric and inattentive and neurological examination revealed complete paralysis of the left face and upper and lower limbs, a Glasgow coma score of 12/15 (eyes 4, motor 6, verbal 2), sluggish right pupillary reaction to light, eye deviation to the right as well as 4/5 muscle power in the right upper limb and 3/5 in the right lower limb. Repeat CT head revealed no new findings, but MRI of the brain demonstrated a very large right middle cerebral artery (MCA) acute infarction  with multiple small acute infarcts throughout the brain (right and left frontal and occipital lobes, left thalamus, right and left cerebellum ). Digital subtraction cerebral angiogram showed absent contrast opacification of the right MCA . At this point, enteral nutrition was started via naso-gastric tube. Her condition continued to deteriorate with the development of hypoxemia (SaO <sub>2 </sub> 91% on FiO <sub>2 </sub> 21%) and patchy consolidation throughout the right lung on chest radiograph. Despite hydration, nutrition and antibiotics, there was no clinical improvement and she died 6 days after hospital admission. The cause of death was listed as aspiration pneumonia secondary to extensive ischemic stroke.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】There is only one prior case report of an ischemic stroke in a patient with metastatic RCC on anti-angiogenic TKI therapy . This was an elderly male, previously treated with nephrectomy, alpha-interferon and 5-FU, who developed an acute ischemic stroke affecting the right parietal lobe after 1 year of treatment with sunitinib with near-complete resolution of neurological deficits (left homonymous hemianopia and left hemiparesis) within 48 h. Notably, this patient had established vascular risk factors including a heavy smoking history and hypertension, whereas one of our patients had no pre-existing risk factors and one had only a moderate cigarette smoking history.\n\n【14】A large trial-level meta-analysis of 10,255 patients receiving anti-VEGF TKIs for solid malignancies showed an absolute risk of 1.4% for a major acute arterial thromboembolic event and a relative risk of approximately three times that in patients receiving placebo, despite exclusion of patients with a major arterial event within 6 - 12 months. In patients with RCC, the relative risk was 6 . A more recent analysis of 9,711 patients from 19 randomized, controlled trials found an absolute risk of arterial thromboembolic events of 1.4% in patients receiving VEGF TKIs and an odds ratio of 2.26 with only approximately 15% of events relating to cerebral ischemia .\n\n【15】In terms of treatment-related mortality in patients with solid cancers receiving anti-VEGF therapy, a pooled analysis from 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials suggested that the relative risk of a fatal adverse event was 2.23, although haemorrhage and myocardial infarction accounted for almost two-thirds of treatment-related fatalities and death due to ischemic stroke was extremely rare (1 in 2,461) .\n\n【16】In both the cases described, we believe that the neuroimaging findings, namely small scattered areas of infarction in multiple arterial territories, are entirely consistent with direct endothelial damage at the arteriolar or capillary levels due to pharmacologic inhibition of physiologic VEGF function. In case 1, the primary kidney cancer remained in situ and there was tumor/thrombus in the IVC and therefore the differential diagnosis of paradoxical embolism entering the right side of the heart and shunting through a right-to-left communication (such as patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect) to the cerebral circulation has to be considered. However, the fact that the patient was treated with therapeutic doses of low-molecular weight heparin and the unremarkable ECG and transthoracic echocardiogram argue against this possibility. Neither case showed features of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, another form of neurological toxicity associated with anti-angiogenic TKIs .\n\n【17】In both cases (particularly with sunitinib), cerebral infarction occurred soon after initiation of treatment (2 and 9 weeks) which suggests direct toxicity rather than an indirect mechanism via conventional risk factors such as hypertension or hypothyroidism-associated hyperlipidemia. Patient 1 had, however, received 18 months of sunitinib without vascular toxicity. Of some interest, headache and nausea were presenting features in both cases and these symptoms are very unusual in ischemic strokes in general.\n\n【18】These cases raise pertinent questions. We believe that patients with a distant history of acute arterial thrombotic events (peripheral, cerebral, and cardiac) should be carefully counselled regarding the risks and benefits of palliative treatment with anti-angiogenic TKIs and that in such patients risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus should be tightly controlled, in conjunction with the patients’ primary care physician, prior to treatment starting. In this regard, the synergistic hepatotoxicity with pazopanib and simvastatin should be considered . The fact that fatal ischemic stroke can occur should encourage greater consideration of the active surveillance approach initially for asymptomatic patients with low-volume, slowly progressive metastatic disease rather than immediate treatment. It also remains uncertain whether treatment with low-dose anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, clopidogrel or dipyridamole would be an appropriate primary prevention strategy in patients treated with anti-angiogenic TKIs in view of the well-documented increased risk of hemorrhage. If the patient described in case 2 had presented for medical evaluation within 4.5 h of symptom onset, would thrombolytic treatment have been indicated and safe to administer?\n\n【19】There was no evidence of thrombotic micro-angiopathy in either patient, although this has been described in association with anti-angiogenic TKI treatment previously . Axitinib can be associated with elevations in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit which might pre-dispose to arterial thrombosis , but our patient was not polycythemic. Efforts should be made to identify biomarkers of the small subset of patients who develop clinically significant vascular toxicity as some degree of vascular dysfunction appears to be near-universal in TKI-treated patients with up to 80% of patients with advanced cancer developing troponin I elevations on anti-angiogenic therapies in one study .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】These two cases illustrate that cerebrovascular ischemic events can occur in association with anti-angiogenic TKI treatment in an unpredictable fashion, within a few weeks to months of commencing treatment, and in patients who have few conventional risk factors for arterial thrombotic disease nor any prior history of such events. The pattern of vascular damage suggests widespread drug-induced endothelial damage at the arteriolar and capillary levels mimicking the picture of cardiogenic embolism. We believe that patients should be thoroughly counselled prior to treatment regarding the risk (albeit very small) of potentially fatal stroke. It is important that modifiable vascular risk factors are addressed prior to treatment. Further research is required to ascertain whether antiplatelet agents might be appropriate as primary prophylaxis in TKI-treated patients and whether the benefit would outweigh the increased hemorrhagic risk . As novel therapeutic strategies emerge for metastatic RCC, such as immune-checkpoint blockade , the potential vascular toxicity of drugs such as pazopanib and axitinib may become particularly important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Assessment of normal structures and exclusion of abnormal findings are crucial before intra-cardiac procedures. Echocardiographically, a Chiari network formation appears commonly as a highly mobile whip-like structure in the right atrium which could easily be confused for thrombus formation or valve vegetation. 3D transthoracic echo has been shown to have an increased role in differentiating these findings.\n\n【2】Entanglement of catheter devices in the Chiari network is a serious concern and can increase the complexity of procedures. Potential consequences include breaking of the net-like structure initiating an embolus or prolapsing structure into the tricuspid valve causing regurgitation. Local insult and abrasion via catheter introduction could lead to increased risk of thrombus formation or altered electrical activity leading to dysrhythmia. Catheters, guide wires and pacemaker leads have the potential to damage or get entangled in both identified and unidentified Chiari network. Discovering the existence of this abnormal structure pre-procedurally may alter the course of diagnostics or treatment, and allows the medical team to have a heightened sense of awareness during any given procedure.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 92-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure decompensation. She had a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease with stent placement, peripheral vascular disease with femoral artery embolectomy, history of DVT, pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, seizures, and dementia. Upon initial examination, her blood pressure was 116/60 mm Hg, pulse was 90 and irregular, respiration was 16, O <sub>2 </sub> saturation was 95% on 2 L nasal cannula, and was afebrile.\n\n【5】Echocardiogram demonstrated an abnormal whip-like structure in the right atrium consistent with a Chiari network . Additional echo findings were mildly calcified aortic valve with regurgitation, moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with mild dilation, mitral calcification, thickening, and mild regurgitation. Also present was moderate to severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension that was estimated to be > 60 mm Hg. As this patient was identified as a candidate for cardiac catheterization (right and left), we were subsequently compelled to inform the cardiac team of the prominent presence of the network.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】In weeks 3 - 8 of embryological development, the sinus venosus and atrium undergo a plethora of changes with the eventual involution of one communicating side of the sinus venosus . However, as first described by pathologist Hans Chiari in 1897, a remnant of this sinus venosus can persist in the right atrium . Its configuration and size can vary with a net-like structure being the most described arrangement . Prevalence of this abnormality has been reported from 2% to as high as 10% in various studies and is usually incidentally found .\n\n【8】A few studies have postulated that this fenestrated net may act as a filter for thrombus formation entering into the right atrium . However, other studies have demonstrated trapped thrombi forming a complex within the Chiari network which can be refractory to thrombolytic therapy . Additionally, further studies have suggested that the web of the formation could actually encourage new thrombus creation . To date, there is no surgical indication to remove an asymptomatic Chiari network.\n\n【9】Previous case reports have described massive right atrial thrombus formed on a Chiari network, leading to intermittent tricuspid obstruction . In one report thrombus had formed after the use of a Hickman catheter for the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy . Another case reports cardiac catheterization in a 51-year-old man with secundum atrial septal defect, and catheter entrapment within the area of the inter-atrial defect . At thoracotomy, the catheter was found to be caught by and looped within a Chiari network involving the septal defect, a hitherto unreported complication of cardiac catheterization . A guide wire having been entrapped by the Chiari network prior to an intended radiofrequency ablation procedure has also been reported .\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Central venous catheters (especially right atrial catheters) for large bore access or venous sampling, right heart pressure catheters, ablation catheters, invasive electrophysiological study catheters and internal cardiac cardioversion catheters are frequently utilized in the hospital setting. Procedures deploying these devices present their own set of risks without anatomic abnormalities. When considering inserting and removing guide wires, sheaths, and other parts of intra-cardiac catheters, the threat of getting entangled within the varied construct of a Chiari network is high. Therefore, careful pre-procedural echocardiographic evaluation is paramount in mitigating potential adverse effects of cardiac-based procedures which may occur as a result of this not uncommon finding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The dental university hospital, where instruments and products are manipulated in the mouth, is an environment of risk . Dental objects that have been swallowed include dental prostheses and endodontic instruments. Ninety percent of ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract uneventfully. However, the ingestion of foreign body can sometimes cause serious complications . Treatment depends on the type and size of the object and its location .\n\n【2】During dental treatment, we must be aware of practices that decrease the risk of accidentally swallowing an object. In the doctor’s office, patients must be guided to prevent such occurrences.\n\n【3】Previously, accidental foreign body ingestion during a routine dental procedure was reported by different groups . However, ingestion of multiple foreign bodies during a routine dental procedure is uncommon. The purpose of this article was to describe a clinical case of accidental ingestion of concomitant crown and piece of tray. Some clinical implications are discussed, mainly emphasizing the care needed to prevent such an accident.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 77-year-old Japanese man with no significant previous medical history presented at the emergency service of our hospital following the accidental ingestion of a crown during a routine dental impression procedure. His general condition was very good, without dyspnea, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. On examination, he was hemodynamically stable with no evidence of airway compromise, respiratory distress or abdominal tenderness. Pharyngolaryngo fiberscopic analysis revealed normal suggesting passage of the foreign body into the esophagus. On a plain abdominal X-ray study, there was suspicion of crown and something in the stomach . An erect chest X-ray was normal (data not shown). Urgent esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy could retrieve the foreign body. And surprisingly, we recognized concomitant crown and piece of tray ingestion .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Ninety percent of ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract uneventfully. Approximately 10% necessitate endoscopic removal while only 1% will ever require surgical intervention. Impaction may occur at sites of anatomical or physiological narrowing such as the lower esophageal sphincter, ileocecal valve or areas of stricture formation. If the blunt object has passed into the stomach and is less than 6 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter, there is a 90% chance of spontaneous passage through the pylorus and ileocecal valve . Passage of a sharp foreign body into the stomach requires immediate attempts at endoscopic retrieval, as the risk of perforation on reaching the ileocecal valve is approximately 35% . In our case, we selected the urgent endoscopic retrieval, because the sharp foreign body was suspicious on the radiographic study.\n\n【8】Previously, accidental foreign body ingestion during a routine dental procedure was reported by different groups . However, ingestion of multiple foreign bodies during a routine dental procedure is uncommon. Here, we describe a clinical case of accidental ingestion of concomitant crown and piece of tray. Previous reports about multiple foreign bodies include magnet , coin , and so on. Accidental ingestion of concomitant crown and a piece of tray is relatively rare.\n\n【9】The best option is to prevent accidents. Prevention for sharp objects such as root canal file is to use dental floss and then rolled up on the finger to allow ready recovery in case of deglutition or aspiration . This is already practiced for other dental objects such as transpalatal arches , and bands . However, in this case, this situation is not suitable, because the patient swallowed a piece of tray in addition to a crown. We think that dentist should not use old tray.\n\n【10】In conclusion, we describe a clinical case of accidental ingestion of concomitant crown and piece of tray in this case. Although multiple accidental ingestion is relatively rare, we should recognize this possibility in dental university hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "58a9a110-1a00-4ade-a1a2-01f0deebe351", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Aortic Stenosis is a condition characterised by abnormal narrowing of the aortic valve outlet. Whilst some patients may be asymptomatic, those with moderate to severe stenosis often present with exertional dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope and heart failure. Less commonly described complications of aortic stenosis include disorders of conduction. This case report describes a patient with previously undiagnosed aortic stenosis presenting with isolated presyncopal episodes.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 62-year-old gentleman with no cardiac history was admitted with a 3 weeks history of recurrent presyncope. These episodes occurred on moderate exertion, lasted only a few seconds and resolved with rest. He denied symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness but did report an awareness of intermittent palpitations, which he described as a ‘heavy thud in the chest,’ mainly in bed at night.\n\n【4】Examination was generally unremarkable, with the exception of mild systolic hypertension 165/80 mmHg and a soft, grade 3/6, systolic murmur over the precordium radiating to the neck. Initial investigations including full blood count, electrolytes and thyroid function were normal. His resting ECG  showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis. There was right bundle branch block morphology and the PR and QTc intervals were normal. The patient was admitted and monitored for 24 hours before being discharged with plans for outpatient echocardiography and Holter monitoring.\n\n【5】The patient was readmitted the following week with further presyncopal episodes on exertion. History and examination were unchanged. His baseline ECG was almost identical, except a prolonged PR interval of 210 ms was noted. Routine monitoring again revealed no abnormality. The patient suggested that he could try to replicate his symptoms through exercise. Under supervision, he walked briskly along the corridor without any symptoms. After two minutes rest, he had an episode of presyncope and an ECG confirmed second degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type II), and a prolonged ventricular pause of approximately 6 seconds .\n\n【6】An urgent echocardiogram was arranged. The aortic valve was found to be moderately thickened and calcified with restricted opening. Continuous wave Doppler velocities suggested a peak gradient of 70 mmHg in keeping with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. In addition, mild aortic regurgitation was noted. There was mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved systolic function. No other structural abnormalities were identified. Coronary angiography demonstrated only minor coronary artery disease.\n\n【7】A dual chamber pacemaker was implanted 2 days after admission. Atrial pacing at the time of pacemaker implantation confirmed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction up to 130 beats per minute. The patient was discharged the following day with plans for early review and reassessment of his aortic valve. He has had no further episodes of presyncope since discharge. His nocturnal palpitations have resolved and he can exercise freely without breathlessness or angina.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Syncopal or presyncopal symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis are well recognised and thought to be caused by heightened left-ventricular baroreceptor activation. The development of these symptoms is an important marker of increased mortality and often prompts referral for aortic valve replacement. However, calcific aortic valve disease is also associated with impaired atrioventricular node conduction, particularly in cases with marked annular calcification .\n\n【10】This case serves as a reminder to consider investigating patients with aortic valve stenosis for conduction disease if they present with isolated syncope or presyncope. This also raises the dilemma of when it is sensible to exercise patients with significant aortic stenosis. Generally, guidelines discourage formal exercise testing in symptomatic patients , but, as we have demonstrated, this approach risks missing a significant and treatable alternative diagnosis.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report presyncopal symptoms on exercise related to transient AV node block, in the presence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "23b52479-23b8-49f7-a1a6-7920f69cc7ea", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a rare neoplasm of follicular dendritic cell differentiation. Because of its rarity, a high index of suspicion is necessary for timely diagnosis. Because presentation is often localized, there is still no standard treatment for advanced disease.\n\n【2】We report a case of FDCS of the tonsil (an uncommon site of involvement) with multiple cervical lymph node metastases. Accurate pathologic diagnosis was crucial in the choice of systemic therapy, which afforded significant clinical response even in the third-line setting. In addition, close collaboration between the head and neck surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and pathologists was instrumental in achieving good disease control.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 53-year-old male electrical technician presented with a painless enlarging neck mass of 11-month duration. He denied having any constitutional symptoms and only complained of dysphagia. He was a 40-pack-year smoker and only occasionally drank alcoholic beverages. He had a previous diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism, for which he had been under monitoring. Pertinent family and surgical history were negative.\n\n【5】Initial evaluation\n\n【6】A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck showed a 10 × 5 cm mass at the left carotid triangle, and a 3.2 × 2.2 cm mass at the left tonsillar fossa causing compression deformity to the base of the tongue and soft palate. Punch biopsy of the tonsillar mass revealed an undifferentiated malignancy. Immunohistochemistry was negative for cytokeratin, leucocyte common antigen (LCA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), synaptophysin, chromogranin and 34βE12, diffusely positive for vimentin, and focally positive for S-100, favoring malignant melanoma. However, subsequent immunohistochemical staining with HMB-45 and melan-A was negative, leading to a classification of undifferentiated sarcoma.\n\n【7】Chest and abdominal CT scan were negative for distant metastases. His complete blood count as well as kidney, liver and thyroid function tests was within normal limits. The case was discussed in the hospital head and neck multidisciplinary conference consisting of head and neck surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and pathologists. The tumor was deemed unresectable due to its attachment to the great vessels; hence, a sequential chemoradiation approach was planned.\n\n【8】Initial treatment\n\n【9】He underwent chemotherapy with six cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), resulting in 80% tumor regression and resolution of his dysphagia. Unfortunately, he was lost to follow-up and was unable to pursue radiotherapy. Eight months later, he returned with re-enlargement of the mass to 6 × 5 cm. He remained free of distant metastases and underwent two cycles of dacarbazine (250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , days 1 - 5), with only stable disease as response.\n\n【10】Approach to diagnosis\n\n【11】The relatively long-time interval to progression in the setting of an undifferentiated histology prompted pathological re-evaluation of the tumor. The tonsillar location of the tumor and its close association with lymphoid tissue suggested a hematolymphoid origin. In particular, suggestive morphologic features  and the lack of staining for LCA favored a diagnosis of a histiocytic or a dendritic cell tumor rather than a lymphoma. Staining for CD34 was performed to rule out a myeloid tumor, while staining for CD21 and CD1A was used to support a diagnosis of FDCS or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, respectively.\n\n【12】Immunohistochemistry was performed on the original specimen revealing that CD1A and CD34 were both negative. On the other hand, the tumor exhibited diffuse staining for CD21, confirming the diagnosis of FDCS.\n\n【13】Subsequent treatment\n\n【14】The patient underwent three cycles of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , days 1, 8) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , day 1), resulting in 50% regression as best response . This allowed dissection of level IB-V cervical lymph nodes, which found disease in 10/23 nodes. He subsequently underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the neck (60 Gy) and primary radiotherapy to the tonsillar mass (70 Gy), with weekly gemcitabine (400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) as a radiosensitizer.\n\n【15】Treatment outcome and follow-up\n\n【16】Treatment-related toxicities included radiation dermatitis to the involved neck and swallowing dysfunction for which he was enrolled in a swallowing rehabilitation program. At 8 months post-treatment, he has attained significant improvement in swallowing function without any sign of disease progression.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】FDCS\n\n【19】FDCS comprises < 0.4% of all soft tissue sarcomas. They exhibit morphologic and immunophenotypic features of follicular dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells that reside in primary and secondary B-cell follicles. Under the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, FDCS is classified under histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms together with histiocytic sarcoma, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Langerhans cell sarcoma .\n\n【20】The cause is unknown for most patients with the disease, although a small minority may present as an inflammatory pseudotumor-like variant that has been linked with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. This variant tends to occur in women with an intraabdominal presentation, is associated with constitutional symptoms, and is observed to have a more indolent behavior. Another 5-10% may coexist or be preceded by a diagnosis of Castleman’s disease, suggesting a link with this benign lymphoproliferative disorder. Autoimmune conditions, particularly paraneoplastic pemphigus and myasthenia gravis, have been observed as well . Our patient had a history of subclinical hyperthyroidism, although this has normalized at the time of evaluation and no workup for autoimmune etiologies was performed.\n\n【21】Epidemiology\n\n【22】The mean age of diagnosis of FDCS is 49 years (ranging from 9 to 90 years), with men and women being equally affected. Extranodal involvement comprises 65% of reported cases, while nodal involvement is seen in 25%, and a combination of both nodal and extranodal in the remaining 10% . Eighty-five percent of cases present with early disease, while distant metastases are encountered in only eight percent . The liver and spleen are the most common extranodal sites involved, while only 35 cases of tonsillar occurrence have been reported in literature .\n\n【23】Pathologic features\n\n【24】Morphologic features of FDCS consist of spindled to ovoid cells forming fascicles, whorls, sheets or vague nodules, often with intermixed small lymphocytes. Misdiagnosis is common because as a rare tumor, it is often not considered in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell neoplasms. Depending on the location of the tumor, differential diagnoses may include inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lymphoma, schwannoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and other histiocytic or dendritic cell tumors .\n\n【25】Staining for follicular dendritic cell markers such as CD21, CD35, CD23, KiM4p or CAN confirms the diagnosis . FDCS can also have variable staining for vimentin, CD68 and S100, but is consistently negative for cytokeratins, CD31, CD34 and CD1a . For the present case, immunohistochemical expression of vimentin and S100 led to an initial consideration of malignant melanoma, especially since it can also present with a whorling pattern with intermixed lymphocytes . However, confirmatory stains melan-A and HMB-45 were negative. The correct diagnosis was established months later when pathological re-evaluation raised the suspicion for a dendritic cell neoplasm based on the tumor location and its morphologic features.\n\n【26】Management of localized disease\n\n【27】Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for localized FDCS. A review of 147 patients with localized disease showed that patients who underwent surgery had a significantly better survival compared to those who had other treatment modalities . The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is much less clear. Analyses of retrospective data regarding adjuvant therapy for localized FDCS have failed to demonstrate benefit in terms of recurrence rates, metastasis or survival .\n\n【28】Systemic therapy for advanced disease\n\n【29】For locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy can achieve effective disease control. Reported cases of advanced FDCS with available treatment and outcome information are summarized in Table 1 . Out of 34 cases (including our patient), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy was used as the first-line regimen in 53%, resulting in complete response in four and partial response in 10 patients. Unfortunately, our patient has already been given a total dose of 360 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of doxorubicin before the diagnosis of FDCS was established.\n\n【30】Other regimens that were used include those that are used for lymphomas (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) , dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin (DHAP) , etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (EPOCH) , etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin (ESHAP) , ifosfamide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and prednisolone (IGEV) ) and soft tissue sarcomas (doxorubicin, ifosfamide and mesna (AIM) , ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) , gemcitabine and docetaxel (Gem/Doce) ). Notably, all three sarcoma regimens have been demonstrated to induce complete response, with the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel resulting in complete response in the third-line setting in one case . Thus, this combination was the one chosen for our patient, which resulted in a 50% regression of the tumor as a third-line treatment.\n\n【31】Some oncologists favor treating FDCS with a sarcoma regimen such as Gem/Doce over CHOP. This is based on the observation that follicular dendritic cell precursors are of vascular stromal rather than of lymphoid origin. Furthermore, it is theorized that the response of FDCS to CHOP may involve the depletion of B lymphocytes that release growth factors to follicular dendritic cells, rather than directly causing cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Its mesenchymal origin and the behavior of FDCS being more similar to an intermediate grade soft tissue sarcoma rather than a lymphoma give support to this perspective . At present, comparative studies investigating the response of FDCS to different chemotherapy regimens do not exist.\n\n【32】Of interest, one patient was found by immunohistochemistry to have a tumor that expressed CD117, wherein treatment with a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin for eight cycles together with imatinib resulted in a complete response . In another patient, detection of a BRCA2 mutation allowed treatment with the combination of carboplatin and veliparib to achieve disease stability . These examples highlight the fact that there is much more to be learned about the biology and optimal treatment of this rare malignancy.\n\n【33】Remarkably, there have been few cases wherein significant clinical response was still achieved after multiple lines of treatment. For example, a 44-year-old woman with metastatic FDCS had complete response with CHOP, and subsequently with ESHAP, and lastly with the combination of gemcitabine, vinorelbine and dexamethasone after presenting with multiple recurrences. At 29 months after completion of treatment, she remained free of any evidence of disease . Another patient continued to achieve effective disease control after six lines of different treatment regimens .\n\n【34】Radiotherapy for advanced disease\n\n【35】Radiotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in the management of advanced FDCS, especially in cases wherein the site of recurrence is localized. In this scenario, the patient may be spared from chemotherapy and still achieve a long disease-free interval, and possibly have a chance for a cure. The three reported patients  who had radiotherapy of localized recurrence remained free of metastatic progression at the time of last follow-up, which extended to as long as 6 years post-treatment for one patient .\n\n【36】For this reason, we opted to proceed with primary radiotherapy of the tonsillar mass for our patient, especially since the cervical node metastases have been successfully controlled by surgery. Adjuvant radiotherapy to the dissected neck, with gemcitabine as a radiosensitizer, was done because the size and number of affected lymph nodes were considered high risk for local recurrence. While the treatment goal remains to be palliative in nature, it was judged by the multidisciplinary team that radiotherapy would confer benefit to the patient because of the high-risk features mentioned.\n\n【37】Prognosis\n\n【38】FDCS is now considered by some as an intermediate-grade soft tissue sarcoma, given its tendency for recurrence and distant metastasis. Tumor size of ≥ 5 cm and high histologic grade have been found to be associated with a lower disease-free and overall survival . In a review of 97 cases of FDCS of the head and neck, the incidence of locoregional and distant recurrence was 38% and 7%, respectively. In this population of patients, locoregional recurrence rate was found to be significantly lower among patients who underwent neck dissection and among those who received adjuvant radiotherapy .\n\n【39】Survival is worse among patients with metastatic or recurrent disease (median of 2.69 years) compared to those with localized disease (median of 9.8 years) . Nevertheless, review of reported cases shows that it is sensitive to available chemotherapy regimens, wherein complete response can be achieved even in the metastatic setting. Our patient responded favorably to a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy, although long-term follow-up is not yet available at the time of writing of this report.\n\n【40】Learning points\n\n【41】For the case presented, pathologic diagnosis was crucial in selecting effective therapy and in determining prognosis. Even for advanced FDCS, response to systemic treatment may still be achieved in the third-line setting, and this can be achieved with regimens used for lymphoma or soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】Tonsillar FDCS represents an uncommon location for a rare type of sarcoma, with only 35 such cases reported in literature. Majority of cases present as localized disease where surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. While no standard of treatment exists for advanced disease, we demonstrate in this case that good disease control may still be achieved through a well-coordinated approach consisting systemic therapy, surgery and radiotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although an obvious vessel at risk due to its vicinity with thoracic structures, iatrogenic injury to the subclavian artery during thoracic surgery is much less well described.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 42-year-old lady underwent a difficult palliative left pneumenectomy for a T3, N1, M0, G2 squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung. Surgery was complicated by the fact that the patient had a large cavitating abscess involving most of the left hemithorax associated with the tumor. A very experienced thoracic surgeon performed the case and noted several times during the surgery the difficulty of the dissection due to adhesive tissue. During apical dissection, the left internal mammary artery was torn from the subclavian artery which led to significant intra-operative hemorrhage of over 1 L. In order to gain rapid control, a surgical clip ligator was used successfully to control hemorrhage. The rest of the procedure went uneventful.\n\n【4】The patient went from recovery directly to the ward. Whilst on the ward, the patient reported pain near the left clavicle and throughout the left arm, parasthesia and reduced power in the hand and forearm. The clinical team examined the patient and found a cold arm with no peripheral pulses. The vascular team was quickly contacted and on review, it was clear the patient had an ischemic arm with evolving neurology. An urgent bedside arterial duplex was performed by a vascular radiologist. Due to surgical emphysema, the proximal subclavian artery was not demonstrated however the distal subclavian artery demonstrated very low velocity ischemic flow, continuing into the brachial and radial arteries . An urgent CT angiogram was performed which confirmed complete occlusion of the first part of the left subclavian artery immediately after the origin of the left thyrocervical trunk due to surgical clips .\n\n【5】In view of the fact that the arm was acutely ischemic with neurology, an urgent left carotid to distal subclavian bypass was perfomed using right-sided cephalic vein.

It is most often associated with other major injuries and is usually diagnosed postmortem . We present a case of non-traumatic pericardial rupture into the right pleural space and lung parenchyma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 65-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension and alcohol abuse presented to the hospital with complaints of one month of fever with intermittent chills, shortness of breath, and sharp retrosternal chest pain. He had been treated at an outside hospital first with antibiotics and then with two weeks of intravenous and oral steroids for a diagnosis of pericarditis. On arrival, he stated that over the preceding twenty-four hours he had coughed up reddish to dark-brown sputum which had initially been copious but had subsided by the time of our examination. On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished. He was febrile (38.3 °C) with pulse 82/min, blood pressure 148/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 20, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. On chest auscultation, air entry was decreased at both bases. Cardiac examination was unremarkable.\n\n【4】Initial laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis (17 K/µL), elevated ESR , and hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dL). Renal function was normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in all leads. Chest radiograph showed bilateral pleural effusion with airspace disease in the right middle and lower lobes which were new when compared with a radiograph obtained 2 days earlier .\n\n【5】A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion circumferentially with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Left ventricular systolic function was estimated to be normal. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed right middle lobe consolidation with a right-sided pleural effusion. There was a pericardial effusion and pericardial enhancement consistent with pericarditis. There was also a breach of the pericardium abutting the right middle lobe of the lung .\n\n【6】Compared to a CT done 1 week earlier the pericardial effusion was larger and the pericardial defect and right middle lobe consolidation were both new. A cardiac MRI obtained 2 days later confirmed the CT findings and showed a significant decrease in the pericardial effusion compared to the CT chest and a focus of air within the pericardial sac adjacent to the area of consolidation, consistent with decompression of the pericardial fluid into the right pleural cavity and adjacent lung parenchyma .\n\n【7】On analysis, the right pleural fluid was a neutrophil-predominant exudate. Both a tuberculin skin test and TB neutrophil gold test were negative. The ANA was positive at a titre of 1:160. The ds-DNA, anti-smith, RNP and anti-Centromere antibodies and SCL-70 were negative. Pericardial biopsy and drainage were performed. Pericardial fluid cytology was negative for any malignant cells and culture was negative for any bacterial, fungal or tubercular elements. On pathologic examination of the pericardium there was an increase in non-specific fibrous connective tissue. Treatment for idiopathic pericarditis with NSAIDS initially and then colchicine was initiated. He improved over time, and a repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of the pericardial effusion.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous pericardial rupture into the lung and pleural space. It occurred in the absence of any history of trauma. From the sequence of events, we presume that the productive cough which immediately preceded this diagnosis represented the coughing up of pericardial fluid (pericardiohydroptysis). Aggressive work-up including pericardial biopsy failed to reveal a specific etiology. The patient recovered with conservative management.\n\n【10】Four major studies  have addressed the investigation of large pericardial effusions of unknown etiology. In the largest of these studies, 37% of patients with moderate and severe effusion had cardiac tamponade. The most common diagnosis was acute idiopathic pericarditis (20% of patients) followed by iatrogenic effusion (16%), neoplastic effusion (13%), and chronic idiopathic pericardial effusion (9%) . Our patient had acute inflammatory signs initially suggesting an acute inflammatory pericarditis. The non-specific biopsy and negative laboratory studies lead us to categorize this as an acute idiopathic pericarditis. Resolution with NSAIDS and Colchicine supports that diagnosis.\n\n【11】Rupture of the pericardium is a rare clinical finding traditionally considered to be indicative of an injury severe enough to crush or pierce the thoracic cage . Most patients never reach the hospital, and those who do often have severe associated injuries . A pericardial rupture should be suspected in a patient with severe blunt trauma to the chest . However to our knowledge there are no prior reports of spontaneous non-traumatic pericardial rupture into the pleura and lung parenchyma . The lack of a specific diagnosis such as tumor or infection which might cause local invasion and focal pericardial weakness makes the case even more unusual. In two series on large pericardial effusions tamponade was reported in 44% and 37% of patients respectively. There were no cases of pericardial rupture as a complication reported in them, the mechanism by which our patient’s pericardium appears to have decompressed .\n\n【12】The diagnosis of most pericardial ruptures described in literature was made intraoperatively as an incidental finding  or due to a high index of suspicion based on the nature of chest trauma. Once pericardial rupture is recognized, treatment is relatively simple and effective. Pericardial closure with nonabsorbable interrupted sutures is usually all that is needed . A small opening should be left for drainage. A defect in the pericardium can be closed with a Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene patch . The prognosis of these patients depends on the management of their associated cardiac contusion and other injuries. If, however, the pericardial rupture is not recognized and treated it could be-life threatening due to cardiac herniation .\n\n【13】In our patient, the rent was small and closed spontaneously. Pericardial fluid was sampled, a biopsy taken, and a drain left in situ. Recovery was uneventful. A follow up echocardiogram done after 6 months showed complete resolution in the pericardial effusion.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】To our knowledge, this is the only reported case of a pericardial rupture into the pleural space and lung parencyma from a non-traumatic cause. The progression or natural course of pericardial rupture is not known and hence the optimal management not defined . The case is unique as idiopathic pericarditis and pericardial effusion has been associated with pericardial tamponade as a common complication in most series and not pericardial rupture .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In the last decades C. striatum is becoming an emerging agent, a multidrug-resistant pathogen with the capacity to form biofilms that can cause infection of endovascular devices .\n\n【2】Cardiac device-related infective endocarditis (CDRIE) is defined as an infection extending to the electrode leads, cardiac valve leaflets, or endocardial surface that can result either from pocket infection extending to intracardiac electrodes, or any portion of the device may become infected due to secondary bacteremia resulting in the formation of vegetations. The latter can be found anywhere from the insertion vein to the superior vena cava, on the lead, tricuspid valve, in the right atrial or ventricular endocardium . The presence of infective material along the lead course may not provide typical vegetations of measurable size so that normal transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) do not rule out CDRIE . Treatment includes both prolonged antibiotic therapy associated with complete hardware removal . Corynebacterium spp. is rarely identified as a pathogen in CDRIE infection . A literature search in PubMed revealed only five case reports of C. striatum CDRIE . Although an increased risk of CDRIE has been described in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators compared with permanent pacemakers , all cases described in the literature refer to pacemaker patients, this case being the first case description of CDRIE by C. striatum in a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) patient. On the other hand, in all cases described in the literature , the pacemaker was removed in the first inpatient days, with a good outcome despite the patient’s age and comorbidities. In this case, due to the patient’s poor performance status and comorbidities, the surgical intervention was refused at first. The patient was managed with medical treatment only, but despite clinical improvement, he had recurrence of the infection a few weeks later. The device was removed only on the second CDRIE by the same agent with a good outcome despite the patient’s overall condition.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We present the case of a diabetic 48-year-old man with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, associated with heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction, complete heart block (CHB), and permanent atrial fibrillation. The patient had a past cardioembolic stroke with left hemiparesis and had a record of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with suprapubic cystostomy due to urethral stenosis. A CRT-D generator (Quadra Assura MP St Jude Medical) was implanted the year before due to CHB with a single lead pacing cardioverter-defibrillator implanted (ICD), due to QRS < 120 ms and high probability of widening in the near future.\n\n【5】One month earlier he was admitted in the emergency department (ED) for fever and low back pain, being discharged with a UTI diagnosis and ciprofloxacin.\n\n【6】Again, he was admitted in the ED with fever, severe low back pain, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination, fever (39.1 °C), painful palpation of the lumbar spinal apophysis, and absent cardiac audible murmur, or cutaneous embolic phenomena were remarked. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with complete left bundle branch block with QRS > 150 ms, and TTE was unremarkable for the presence of vegetations. Prior blood cultures (BC) identified C . striatum , with sensitivity to tetracycline and vancomycin, and resistance to gentamicin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin G; so did a new pair of BC with the same sensitivity profile. Vancomycin therapy was initiated. BC collected on the second day of antibiotic was sterile. Ten days after admission TEE showed vegetation at the auricular face of the tricuspid valve, in the posterior leaflet, +/- 6 mm, heterogeneous contours, with two mobile projections with +/- 6 mm, with no apparent device lead involvement .\n\n【7】Lumbar computed tomography (CT) scan showed irregularities in the L1 - L2 vertebral platforms, which were absent in the previous examination, 1 month earlier. Due to the incompatibility of the CRT-D device, it was not possible to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, a lumbar spondylodiscitis diagnosis was presumed.\n\n【8】TEE was repeated (day 29) in the fourth week of vancomycin therapy, similar to the previous one namely regarding the presence of vegetation. Surgical removal of the CRT-D device was proposed, but the patient was considered as having a very high overall surgical risk. So he was managed with medical treatment alone. He was discharged after completing 49 days of vancomycin, with clinical resolution and serial negative blood cultures.\n\n【9】Again, 42 days after hospital discharge, the patient was readmitted, in cardiogenic shock, with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and ischemic hepatitis requiring dobutamine. As soon as dysfunctions improved he was transferred to our nursery. Again, BC showed the presence of C. striatum , with the same sensitivity profile and presumptively sensitive to daptomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.023 µg/mL). Neither TTE at admission nor TEE performed 5 days after, showed cardiac vegetation. Vancomycin was started (day 3), requiring several adjustments due to frequent toxic levels. The patient developed acute kidney injury (day 12) suspecting renal toxicity due to vancomycin; and therapy was changed to daptomycin10 mg/kg. A systolic murmur not present at admission was noticed (day12), and TTE was repeated with evidence of vegetations adhering to the device lead in its auricular path near the tricuspid valve . Daptomycin therapy was continued without new febrile events or elevated inflammatory markers, and with sterile serial BC. On the 81st day of daptomycin (inpatient day 93), the patient underwent surgical intervention with the removal of CRT-D and implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) (Quadra Allure MPP St Jude Medical), with epicardial electrodes and the device placed in an abdominal loca . ICD was not implanted due to the absence of therapies in the past, in addition to frailty and life expectancy < 1 year. Electrode tips were sterile. He completed 15 days of daptomycin after the intervention. No evidence of recurrence of infection was found in follow-up consultation 6 months after discharge.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Although C. striatum is commensal from the skin, it is becoming an emerging infectious agent, a multidrug-resistant pathogen with the capacity to form biofilms . In the presence of bacteriemia and cardiac devices, CDRIE should be suspected even in the absence of typical vegetations in the TTE and TEE . The treatment combines prolonged antibiotic therapy and device removal .\n\n【12】Corynebacterium spp. is rarely identified as a pathogen in infective endocarditis , and there are only five case reports of C. striatum CDRIE whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Most of them (4/5) were treated with vancomycin and all of them with device removal within the first inpatient days. In the case of our patient, despite the assumption of resolution of the bacteremia, clinical improvement, and a 6 weeks course of antibiotics, on the first hospitalization, the infection was not resolved with medical treatment alone with recurrence of bacteremia imposing the withdrawal of CRT-D despite the high surgical risk.\n\n【13】Regarding medical treatment, daptomycin 10 mg/kg body weight for 6 weeks was successfully used in one case described by Guerrero et al , in which spondylodiscitis also coexisted, as in the case of our patient.\n\n【14】It should be noted that only in one of the described cases, vegetations were detected in the TTE, being the TEE necessary to confirm the diagnosis in most cases. Since C. striatum is a pathogen capable of forming biofilms, in the presence of bacteremia and endovascular devices, the suspicion for infection should be high and the diagnosis must be pursued, as shown by Szymanska et al .\n\n【15】This case demonstrates that in the presence of CDRIE the removal of the device is fundamental to treatment’s success and must be pursued to control infection source. On the other hand, it shows that daptomycin is a suitable option for the treatment of infective endocarditis by this pathogen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "fe595bea-411d-499c-a0ff-e4bfe9c4a261", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The new synthetic street drug, 25-I (25I-NBOMe or 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-\\[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl\\]ethanamine), is a full agonist of the serotonin 2a (5-HT2a) receptor. 25-I, known as “Smiles,” “synthetic LSD,” or “Nbomb” has gained popularity due to its low cost and easy portability. It is administered on paper tabs placed in the mouth and is used recreationally for its psychedelic properties. It can present with sympathomimetic and serotonergic symptoms . Reported adverse effects include multi-organ failure, hypertension, tachycardia, aggression, hallucinations, seizures, hyperthermia, acidosis, and acute kidney injury . Among the 12 reported cases in the medical literature, three have died . There are multiple deaths reported in media and Internet sources . Patients described in the literature have been treated with supportive care alone as there are no established treatment regimens. We report a case of late-onset multiple organ dysfunction and type B lactic acidosis following 25-I ingestion treated with a novel approach of vitamins for mitochondrial support, plasmapheresis, and pharmacologic reduction of free radicals.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 16-year-old male was found obtunded outside of a drug house. In the emergency department he was febrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with a Glasgow coma score of 7. He developed seizures requiring benzodiazepines and intubation.\n\n【4】He was given benzodiazepines and dexmedetomidine for agitation and suspected serotonin syndrome. An epinephrine drip was briefly required for hypotension. Lactate level initially peaked at 2.6 mEq/L 16 h post-ingestion. He also became hemodynamically stable and creatinine decreased from 1.45 to 1.04 mg/dL.\n\n【5】The patient then developed a new lactic acidosis about 30 h after admission, which rose to 8.5 mEq/L . Initial mixed venous saturation (S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ) was normal (46-72%) but later unexpectedly rose to 93%; this coincided with peak lactate. At this time he had an arterial total O <sub>2 </sub> concentration (TO <sub>2 </sub> c) of 19 mL O <sub>2 </sub> /dL blood (vol%), and an elevated venous TO <sub>2 </sub> c of 17.8 vol%; the arterial-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO <sub>2 </sub> ) was therefore 1.2 vol%, much lower than expected , indicating impaired oxygen utilization. The patient developed multiple organ dysfunction, including hypotension, oliguria and increases in creatinine and hepatic transaminases. This change was presumed to be caused by a defect in aerobic metabolism, despite adequate substrate delivery. To manage this metabolic uncoupling, thiamine 100 mg daily, levocarnitine 100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 h, and coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ-10) 120 mg every 8 h were given for 14 days. Additional treatments included N-acetylcysteine (NAC), per acetaminophen toxicity protocol, and one session of plasmapheresis with 2 L 5% albumin and 2 L fresh frozen plasma as replacement.\n\n【6】Subsequently, lactate levels and S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> returned to physiologic levels, 60-76% by 60 h after ingestion. Other markers of organ injury and dysfunction also improved.\n\n【7】The patient’s serum levels of 25-I were 25.1 pg/mL before plasmapheresis and 30.6 pg/mL after. The concentration of 25-I in the pheresis fluid was 20.1 pg/mL. 25-I was also detected in the urine at admission . He made a full recovery and admitted to taking 25-I.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Our patient’s presentation of hypertension, tachycardia and altered mental status was consistent with previous reports of 25-I ingestions . However, the late development lactic acidosis and multi-organ dysfunction has not been reported. This second phase of illness was successfully managed with a novel combination treatment strategy to target metabolic uncoupling and promote drug clearance with plasmapheresis.\n\n【10】Lactic acidosis is most often caused by inadequate substrate delivery, type A lactic acidosis, with cardinal features of poor perfusion and low S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> . Our patient had a high S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> and no signs of hypoperfusion, suggesting adequate substrate delivery with decreased oxygen uptake by tissues; the low AVDO <sub>2 </sub> is congruent with this. The patient had signs of end-organ dysfunction, rising creatinine and transaminases, oliguria and hypotension. This is most consistent with type B lactic acidosis, caused by a defect in the aerobic metabolism pathway leading to anaerobic metabolism, decreased ATP production and lactic acidosis . The heart, liver and kidney are all metabolically active organs that are at risk of injury in the setting of decreased ATP production.\n\n【11】Treatment of type B lactic acidosis focuses on restoring normal mitochondrial function and addressing the mechanism . We used a cocktail of vitamins and co-factors based on established treatments of mitochondrial disorders associated with lactic acidosis . Thiamine, vitamin B1, is a co-factor in multiple steps in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, including the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl Co-A can then enter the citric acid cycle. Levocarnitine aids in the transport of long chain fatty acids in the mitochondria where they are broken down into acetyl-CoA. Co-Q10 is part of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in the mitochondria. These vitamins support aerobic metabolism in the mitochondria.\n\n【12】Free-radical mediated injury may occur as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction . To mitigate this, we treated with the free-radical scavenger NAC, using dosing standards for acetaminophen-associated liver injury. Plasmapheresis was used to clear any drug that was potentially protein bound. It is not known how 25-I is bound or metabolized.\n\n【13】In the literature on 25-I intoxication, there are no similar reports of late-onset type B lactic acidosis. The exact cause of this patient’s metabolic failure and most appropriate management regimen were unclear, so multiple approaches were employed. The patient may have had an active metabolite of 25-I. Despite a relatively high level of 25-I in the urine at the time of presentation (2.28 ng/mL), the low level of 25-I at the time of lactic acidosis support this theory.\n\n【14】As detection of 25-I is not on standard drug screens, it should be part of the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with a clinical picture similar to our patient. Testing using mass spectroscopy is used on a research level at a few select centers .\n\n【15】We present a case of 25-I ingestion causing type B lactic acidosis successfully managed with vitamins to support mitochondrial function, plasmapheresis for toxin removal, and NAC to scavenge free radicals all in an attempt to reverse the mitochondrial uncoupling process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "c49bae1e-dd59-46ee-a4e1-af87359fce79", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an infrequent mechanical but portentous complication following myocardial infarction. VSD was first described by Latham in 1846 ; it is known to develop in approximately 1% of cardiac arrest survivors after acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  and generally occurs 1 week after the acute event . Medical management alone is lacking and surgical intervention is usually the only option. Assorted guidelines for surgical techniques have been described, requiring the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The 30-day mortality ranges from 23% to 42% . The development of shock is the most important predictor of mortality. Persistence of class IV cardiogenic shock in VSD is associated with 100% mortality . VSD, characterized by hemodynamic compromise, is treated by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) followed by early surgical repair .\n\n【2】Recently, an off-pump closure technique called the Hamburger procedure was performed as an alternative to open procedures that require CPB and ventriculotomy .\n\n【3】The aims of our presenting case were to describe how a post-infarct VSD may be repaired without CPB and to highlight the importance of shunt measurement using oximetric methods for VSD closure in the absence of TOE.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 75-year-old patient arrived at a province hospital with an AMI and was treated with thrombolysis. Two hours after his admission to the cardiology unit, the patient suffered cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 30 min. He was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated for further management of his condition. During his hospital admission, he underwent angiography, which showed a distally occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery and rest coronary arteries with no critical stenosis.\n\n【6】A week later, it was noted that he had a pansystolic murmur and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) using a Vivid 7 Pro confirmed a 2.5 cm antero-apical VSD, an akinetic ventricular apex, Qp/Qs 6.33, and an ejection fraction of 20%. Because of agitation upon awakening, the patient underwent a brain CT, which showed an ischemic shock, however, without neurological semiotics.\n\n【7】To manage his hemodynamic instability, inotropes were added, an IABP was inserted and diuretics and nitrates were commenced. Due to deterioration, 2 weeks after his admission, the patient underwent an off-pump Hamburger post-infarct VSD repair in an emergency base and in the absence of TOE (as the only TOE was out for repair), under the guidance of oximetry measurements.\n\n【8】VSD closure was assessed using the ratio of the volume of pulmonary flow (Qp) and systemic flow (Qs) for shunt quantification.\n\n【9】In our case, before intervention, the aortic blood oxygen saturation was 99%, mixed venous blood oxygen saturation was 61%, the left atrial blood oxygen saturation was 99%, and the pulmonary artery blood oxygen saturation was 92%. The ratio Qp/Qs was approximately 6.33.\n\n【10】After median sternotomy, the heart was approached in order to perform a posterior-anterior septal plication in the use of four double-armed teflon felt sutures.\n\n【11】The teflon strip was preloaded with sutures; then, starting from above and aiming for the anterior part of the septum, the needles were passed through the posterior (inferior) interventricular septum and then through the second teflon and back again where they were tied smoothly. The sutures run close to the LAD to ensure plication of the thicker left ventricular wall  .\n\n【12】During intervention, new oximetric measurements were made showing great improvement in the shunt size as flow ratio Qp/Qs was less than 2.0 after the last sutures were made.\n\n【13】Soon after surgery, the patient began to improve and his inotropes were discontinued. During his 1-month follow-up, the patient was found to be asymptomatic and mobilizing independently. A year later, the follow-up showed the patient to be well and a defibrillator was inserted according to the guidelines.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】During intervention, new oximetric measurements were made showing great improvement in the shunt size as flow ratio Qp/Qs was less than 2.0 after the last sutures were made, which results from the following Qp/Qs = (SatAO - SatMV)/(SatLA - SatPA) = / = 1.93.\n\n【16】Normally, this ratio is 1 as the volume of blood that is pumped to the lungs (Qp) is equal to the volume of blood that is pumped to the body (Qs). In patients with left-to-right shunts, the Qp/Qs ratio is greater than 1. In general, a Qp/Qs ratio of 1.5 or less is considered a small shunt; a Qp/Qs ratio of 1.5 - 2.0 is considered a moderate shunt; and a Qp/Qs ratio of more than 2 is considered a large shunt. The Qp/Qs ratio can be calculated if the blood oxygen saturation is known for the mixed venous return, pulmonary artery, left atrium, and aorta. The formula is Qp/Qs = (SatAO - SatMV)/(SatLA - SatPA), where SatAO is the aortic blood oxygen saturation, SatMV is the mixed venous blood oxygen saturation, SatLA is the left atrial blood oxygen saturation, and SatPA is the pulmonary artery blood oxygen saturation.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The Hamburger procedure was a competent method for the repair of a post-infarct VSD. By bringing the two ventricles close using teflon supported plication sutures, the defect almost vanished.\n\n【19】As the Hamburger procedure is a short time off-pump technique, potential sequelae of CPB were eliminated. As the urgent treatment of this patient was of paramount importance, the use of this procedure proved to be more beneficial compared to the alternative longer, more complex open patch repair requiring CPB and ventriculotomy.\n\n【20】Although the right way is to repair the VSD under CPB and under TOE to exclude residual shunt, in this case, we attest the importance of the use of oximetry in the absence of TOE in guiding VSD closure when the Hamburger procedure is utilized. Extra sutures were added to the initial ones under the guidance of oximetric measurements so as to ensure that a satisfactory closure was achieved. Several days later, TTE was used in the post-operative period in order to show that there was no residual VSD prior to discharge.\n\n【21】The Hamburger procedure is a useful alternative method for antero-apical post-infarct VSD repair. In this particularly unstable case, the Hamburger procedure proved to be the best choice, so it may be an accepted, useful and valuable technique in similar cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These two histological types constitute 75% of all primary tracheal malignancies . History of smoking is frequently together with SCC of trachea but no such correlation has been shown for ACC. Clinical course and treatment response of ACC is different than other malignant tumors .\n\n【2】Of people having these rare carcinomas, 4 were operated; three had adenoid cystic carcinoma and one had tracheal schwannoma. We analyzed the experience of our clinic based on these four cases and compared this with those of the reported cases.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Four cases were operated for primary tracheal tumors. There were three female patients and one male patient with a mean age of 39.2 years (range 21 - 56 years). None of the patients had a history of smoking. The most common symptoms were dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis. Three patients had a preliminary diagnosis of bronchial asthma and had received related treatment. In the thorax computerized tomography (CT), all patients demonstrated narrowing of the tracheal air column and signs of mass lesions. In the bronchoscopic evaluation, the tumor had cervical localization in one case and thoracal tracheal localization in three cases. Two cases had more than 50% narrowing and the other two had near total obstructions. All cases underwent tracheal segment resection through median sternotomy and had primary end-to-end anastomoses.\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】For the last three years, 21-year-old female patient experienced cough, dyspnea and sputum production (of around 1 cup a day) and occasional blood in sputum especially during winter months. Following a flu infection experienced 10 days ago, her complaints increased and the patient admitted to our hospital. In her history, the patient did not report any smoking. In her physical examination, she had widespread inspiratory and expiratory ronchi and clubbing of fingers. In arterial blood gas analysis (ambient air) pH was 7.46, pO <sub>2 </sub> 54.6 mmHg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 33.5 mmHg and SO <sub>2 </sub> 90%. In respiratory function tests, FVC was measured as 3.73 (99.1%),FEV1 1.13 (34.8%) and FEV1/FVC 35.5. The patient was hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of bronchial asthma. In her thorax CT, a nodular opacity of 1 cm was identified at the superior level of the aortic arcus with protrusion to tracheal lumen. In her bronchoscopy, a lesion was identified 8 cm distal to the entrance of the trachea; it was protruding to the lumen towards left posterolateral and anterior sides while narrowing it up to 60%. The lesion measured nearly 4 cm in length; it had a lobulated appearance and its surface was covered with mildly granular mucosa. Pathological examination of the bronchoscopic biopsies obtained from the lesion was reported as adenoid cystic carcinoma. A decision was made to operate the patient. Partial sternotomy and left hemi-clamshell incision starting from 4th intercostal space and extending to anterior axillary line were performed. Pericardium was opened and superior and inferior pulmonary veins were freed. The apex of the heart was elevated and inferior pulmonary ligament was incised. After a tracheal incision performed 1 cm above the carina close to the distal margin of the lesion, left bronchial system was intubated from the operative field ensuring ventilation. Tracheal segment harboring the lesion was totally excised. Tracheal incision was performed under the guidance of peroperative fiberoptic broncoscopy. Tracheal anastomosis was performed with 2/0 absorbable sutures (PDS, Ethicon) in a continuous fashion obtaining an end-to-end anastomosis. The patient was followed up for a week without any problems, it was provided that she had flexion of the neck and was discharged on postoperative day 8. Pathological specimen contained tumor at its surgical margin. She was referred to radiation oncology for radiotherapy. In control bronchoscopy performed at postoperative second month, anastomosis was solid, tracheal lumen was open and there was minimal fibrosis of the anastomosis line. The patient is at year 7 after the operation and is being followed up without problems.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 43-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic after experiencing shorthess of breath for nearly a year and having hemoptysis for about a month. Her history revealed that she was not a smoker and we learned that she has been receiving medical treatment with the diagnosis of bronchial asthma for about a year. In her physical examination, there was stridor. In her bronchoscopy, there was a tumoral mass lesion of about 2 cm obstructing the lumen about 6 cm distal to the vocal cords. Pathological examination of the biopsies performed from the lesion was reported as adenoid cystic carcinoma. ESR was 12 mm/hr. In the analysis of arterial blood gases (with 2 L/min O <sub>2 </sub> ), pH was measured as 7.41, pO <sub>2 </sub> 175.2 mmHg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 42.9 mmHg and SO <sub>2 </sub> 99.5%. A decision was made to operate the patient. Median sternotomy was performed and the trachea was explored. With a 2 cm circumferential resection performed at the tracheal region below the innominate artery, tracheal segment containing the tumor was excised . Tracheal incision was performed with the guidance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tumor was seen to protrude outwards from the membranous wall of the trachea. End-to-end tracheal anastomosis was performed with continuous 3/0 absorbable sutures (Monocrylat, Ethicon). Pediculated mediastinal adipose tissue was wrapped around the anastomosis. Regional lymph node anastomosis was performed. The patient was followed up for a week without problems ensuring neck flexion and was discharged on day 10. She was referred to radiation oncology to receive radiothreapy. Control bronchoscopies were performed on postoperative day 22 and at month 12. The anastomosis was found to be solid and the tracheal lumen was open . The patient is at month 20 postoperatively and free of problems.\n\n【9】Case 3\n\n【10】37-year-old female patient having complaints of cough, dyspnea and hemoptysis for about a year was admitted to our clinic. In her history, she had received medical treatment with the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and she did not smoke. In her physical evaluation, she was normal. Thorax CT revealed a mass having lobulated contours with homogeneous contrast enhancement narrowing the trachea at its right lateral border . ESR was 7 mm/hr. Respiratory function tests measured FVC as 2.22 (77%), FEV1 as 1.65 (66%), and FEV1/FVC as 74. In her bronchoscopy, there was a mass of about 4 cm. It was localized 4 cm distal to the vocal cords and 4 cm proximal to the carina. Pathological examination of the bronchoscopic biopsy obtained from the mass was reported as adenoid cystic carcinoma. A decision was made to operate the patient. Following the exploration performed with median sternotomy, pericardium was opened. After hilar freeing, 5 cm tracheal segment containing the tumor was excised with a peripheral incision . Tracheal incision was performed with the help of peroperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Tracheal end-to-end anastomosis was performed with continuous 3/0 absorbable sutures (PDS, Ethicon) and regional lymph node dissection was performed. The patient was being followed up by ensuring neck flexion; however, she developed subcutaneous emphysema on postoperative day 5. Bilateral pleural effusion that was identified on control thorax CT was drained with a thin catheter. In control fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the patient had partial separation of the anastomosis and she died of abrupt tracheal hemorrhage (tracheovascular fistula) on postoperative day 11.\n\n【11】Case 4\n\n【12】56-year-old male patient experiencing dry cough and fatigue for the last two months was admitted to our clinic. His history was not unusual and his phycial examination was normal. ESR was 3 mm/hr. On thorax CT, there was a solid noduler lesion of 3 x 2 cm with regular borders located 3 cm proximal to the level of bifurcation while neighboring the trachea posteriorly. In his bronchoscopy, proximal trachea was normal. At the distal level, there was a nodular mucosal lesion covered with mucosa with significant vascularity and a shiny surface 3 cm proximal to the carina. The lesion caused narrowing of the lumen from lateral and posterior thereby creating an hour glass appearance . Pathological examination of the bronchoscopic biopsies obtained from the tracheal lesion was reported as mesenchymal tumor. A decision was made to operate the patient. Median sternotomy was used for entry. The part of the trachea harboring the tumoral mass was excised 3 cm circumferentially . Peroperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed during the excision provided guidance. End-to-end tracheal anastomosis was performed with continuous 3/0 absorbable sutures on the posterior part (PDS, Ethicon) and with single 3/0 absorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon) that were tied outside for lateral and anterior parts . Regional lymph node dissection was performed. Thymic tissue was covered on the anastomosis. The patient was followed up for a week without problems ensuring neck flexion and was discharged on postoperative day 8. After a long follow-up, the pathological material that was excised was reported as schwannoma. Control bronchoscopy was performed on postoperative day 15. Anastomosis was found to be solid and tracheal lumen was open, yet there was mucosal wall irregularity on the anastomosis line. The patient is at the 26th postoperative month and free of any complaints.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Of our 4 patients, three had ACC and one had schwannoma. Treatment was achieved with circumferential tracheal resection through median sternotomy and end-to-end anastomosis. There was no gender preference in other report for ACC  but all of our cases were women. As expected, patients with ACC did not smoke.\n\n【15】Most common symptoms were dyspnea, hemoptysis and cough. Other symptoms were dysphagia, weight loss, stridor, sore throat and wheezing. In order for the dyspnea that is significant during exertion to appear, there needs to be significant airway narrowing (75% obstruction). Due to their slow developmental pattern and silent nature, tracheal tumors can remain unidentified for months and even for years. Furthermore, these patients can frequently be treated for asthma or other erroneous diagnoses due to chronic cough, hoarseness and difficulties in expelling the secretions . Three of our cases had histories of medical treatment due to diagnoses of asthma. Specifically, in patients having unsuccessful treatment histories with symptoms like dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis after having a preliminary diagnosis of asthma, differential diagnosis should include primary tracheal cancer.\n\n【16】In chest radiography, tracheal tumors are located in relatively blind fields. That is why the diagnosis is delayed until the tumor is identified via CT or bronchoscopy. Chest radiogram reveals abnormalities in only 1/3 of the patients and laryngoscopy in only 25%, therefore airway CT or bronchoscopy should be performed for patients experiencing diagnostic problems. Bronchoscopy does not only serve diagnostic purposes, it can be used for the palliation of the airways after diminishing the tumor size or placement of stents in selected unresectable patients . Thorax CT identified narowing of the tracheal air column in all patients. Bronchoscopic examination was performed in all cases and proximal half of the trachea was identified as cervical while distal half was identified as thoracic. As shown by bronchoscopic examination, one case had cervical and three cases had thoracal tracheal localization. Three cases had more than 50% narrowing of the lumen and one patient had near total obstruction.\n\n【17】Treatment of choice for primary tracheal cancers includes surgical resection; however this modality is not free of risks or sequelae . Radiotherapy is appropriate as an adjunct but its use by itself is not successful. Brachytherapy, photodynamic treatment and criotherapy are other alternatives used for palliative purposes .\n\n【18】Although complete resection is the preferred treatment for adenoid cystic carcinomas, it is not usually possible to perform this due to delays in the diagnosis. It is difficult to ensure the negativity of the surgical margins due to spreading of the tumors alongside submucosal and perineural structures . In resections of tracheal segment that are longer than 6 cm, complete resection might not be possible due to anastomotic insufficiency . However, the prognoses of ACC patients who undergo surgery are more favorable than those with squamous carcinomas. For most cases, adjunct radiotherapy together with surgery is the preferred treatment . Instead of making a resection that would leave the anastomosis under tension, one could accept microscopic tumor positivity at the surgical margin as experienced in case 1 and could recommend radiotherapy.\n\n【19】Primary tracheal schwannoma is less common than ACC. For such cases, complete resection should be the preferred surgical option. Recurrences are rare after complete resections and prognoses of such cases are favorable . Case 4 underwent complete resection for tracheal schwannoma and is being followed up without recurrences in postoperative year 3.\n\n【20】For cases requiring large tracheal segment resections, different tracheal freeing manuevers are employed. During median sternotomy, such approaches necessitate upward rotation of the cardiac apex. Such manipulations might lead to hemodynamic disturbances and cardiac problems. In patients in need of large tracheal resections, limited operative field can be enlarged by complementing partial median sternotomy with hemi-clamshell incision to serve the need for manipulations geared at freeing as performed in case 1. In tracheal surgery, cervical approach is preferred for lesions with cervical localization, and right posterolateral thoracotomy incision to be performed from fourth intercostal space is recommended for lesions with thoracic localizations. If partial median sternotomy was to complement the cervical incision, this would allow for interventions throughout the full length of the trachea. Median sternotomy was used in all of our cases. Under the guidance of a flexible peroperative bronchoscope, tracheal segment resection and anastomoses were performed.\n\n【21】Meticulous surgical planning and employment of freeing procedures allow for secure resections of nearly 50% of the tracheal length in selected patients . During recent years, the possibility of using tracheal transplants through studies in related tissue engineering  is promising for the purpose of long tracheal segment resections. However, as anastomotic separation has a fatal course, if closure would not be possible without creating a tension, surgical resection should not be attempted at all. In anastomoses performed under tension or in cases with disrupted tracheal vascular support during dissection, separation of the tracheal anastomosis can develop. By giving rise to infections, such complications can have fatal courses as experienced by a tracheavascular fistula resulting in death in our third case.\n\n【22】In conclusion, for primary tracheal tumors, surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Together with the increases in the size of the segment to be resected, the rate of fatal complications will increase. For cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma, resections allowing for secure anastomoses and postoperative radiotherapy would be the proper approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It’s an uncommon site of primary melanoma with almost equal male to female ratio and with an average age of presentation between the fifth and the sixth decades of life . Anorectal melanoma occur poor prognosis with high metastatic potential. Breast metastasis from anorectal melanoma is exceptional, only two cases were described in the literature . We report the third case of metastatic breast from primary anorectal melanoma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in March 2007 with a 6-month history of rectal bleeding, tenesmus and weight loss. Physical examination revealed an ulcerative mass about 4 cm above the anal sphincter, without evidence of invasion in the sphincter. Proctosigmoidoscopy, with multiple biopsies, confirmed digital findings and concluded on anorectal melanoma. Pre-operative CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed no distant metastasis. Serum levels of tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (ACE) and Ca 19-9 were within normal ranges. A typical abdominoperineal resection (APR) was performed. The pathologic stage was III Α according to the AJCC TNM classification. No adjuvant treatment was performed. Eighteen months later, the patient presented with 1-month history of a rapidly growing mass in the upper quadrant of the right breast. Physical examination confirmed a 3-cm diameter, firm and not fixed lump. There was no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy. Mammograms showed a well-defined mass lesion, not obviously malignant . Core biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n【4】Immunohistological control proved to be negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2, and revealed positive HMB-45 and EMA. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no metastatic disease. The patient underwent mastectomy without axillary lymp-node dissection. After surgery, she received Six cycles of dacarbazine chemotherapy regimens. One year after the mastectomy, she is well with no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Anorectal malignant melanoma is an aggressive malignant tumor. Most patients with such melanomas complain for bleeding, pain, or an anal mass.\n\n【7】Metastases occur via lymphatic and hematogenous routes and it has been reported that 38% of patients have already metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis .\n\n【8】Lymphatic spread to mesenteric nodes is more common than to inguinal nodes while lungs, liver and bones are the most frequent sites of distant metastases. Metastases in the breast is very unusual and very rare localization of metastasis in anorectal melanoma. There are only two cases reported in the literature.\n\n【9】Breast metastases from extramammary primary tumors are uncommon, accounting for approximately 1.3-6.6% of all malignant mammary tumors . Apart from hematopoietic neoplasms, cutaneous malignant melanoma is one of the most common neoplasms with which secondary involvement of the mammary parenchyma is known .\n\n【10】Clinical and radiological features mean it is often quite difficult to differentiate between a primary and a metastatic mammary neoplasm. Mammography shows an irregular mass with no calcifications. Correct management of metastatic disease to the breast can prevent unnecessary mutilation.\n\n【11】This rare incidence of metastases to the breast from tumors without any anatomical connection to the breast raises questions about the possible underlying mechanisms for such events.\n\n【12】It seems that breast metastases from malignant melanoma probably occur more frequently in younger than in older women . The predilection for metastatic spread to the breast in premenopausal women may be due to hormonal influences in the translocation of melanoma cells to the breast parenchyma. However, our patient, and also the two cases which were be reported on 1999, concern a post menopausal women .\n\n【13】The finding of anorectal melanoma that has metastasized to the breast requires complete evaluation for diffuse metastatic disease, because in most cases it is associated with wide dissemination, in particular to the brain, lung, and liver.\n\n【14】It is essential to recognize that malignant tumors in the breast might be metastatic melanomas, so as to avoid unnecessary surgery. It is widely accepted that wide excision is sufficient to control all metastatic tumors of the breast.\n\n【15】It is very important for both surgeon and pathologist to consider the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma. The treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma in the breast is excision of the lesion with clear margins, followed by systemic therapy for the primary disease, obviously after comprehensive evaluation of the staging.\n\n【16】Despite sporadic promising reports, regardless of surgical approach, metastatic anorectal melanoma remains a highly lethal malignancy with five-year survival less than 20% .\n\n【17】To our knowledge, only two cases of anorectal melanomas which have metastasized to the breast were reported in the literature. Our case is unusual not only in that the primary site is the anorectum, but also it was very succefully managed with one year free survival.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They are without any sex predilection and of a broad spectrum of symptoms and signs .\n\n【2】Their prevalence rate is 15 - 18 per 100,000 persons . Its pathologic basis is abnormal where arterial blood enters venous blood flow without going through capillary bed. Absence of capillary system, which impedes direct arterial blood flow through low-diametric arterials, can lead to significantly increased blood flow and in turn tortuous expansion of the vascular bed .\n\n【3】Physiopathologic process during AVM evolution generally ends in hemodynamic disturbance in a part of brain beside overflow in AVM bed, causing steal of blood from normal part of brain. Hence, AVM not only is revealed in imaging but also affects normal brain tissue .\n\n【4】These lesions (AVM) generally are non-hereditary but their pathologic process begins in the fetal period. The affected baby with the congenital lesion is normal and may have no symptoms until only after years because of the tininess of the lesion .\n\n【5】Symptoms and signs are secondary to mass effect and hemodynamic disturbance, while edema and hemodynamic disturbance depend on the location, growth rate and related complication of AVM (e.g. hemorrhage, etc.) .\n\n【6】The most serious complication of AVM, which causes a clinical disaster, is intracranial hemorrhage secondary to vascular bed rupture .\n\n【7】Brain cortex mechanical or hemodynamic disturbance causes seizure because of pathologic discharges of a series of affected neurons .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】The patient was a 45-year-old female epileptic case who was under treatment since 10 years ago with unknown etiology. This time, she was referred to neurologic department by a series of symptoms which had begun since last month including ataxia, forgetfulness, and fluctuating visual problems. She was alert and under treatment by antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine) for seizure with unknown etiology.\n\n【10】Physical examination revealed ataxic gate wide base gate, left-sided homonymous lower quadrantanopia, and loss of venous pulse in ophthalmoscopy.\n\n【11】Laboratory data including CBC, electrolytes, blood sugar, kidney and liver function tests, and electrocardiography were normal.\n\n【12】Axial brain CT scan was performed: a suspected lesion size of (22 × 24 mm) in right-sided parietooccipital area was seen . Brain MRI and CT angiography revealed a heterogeneous lesion size of (22 × 26 mm) with serpentine appearance in right-sided parietooccipital area without objective sign of edema and mass effect in favor of vascular malformation. MRA and MRV imaging was normal. The patient underwent antiepileptic drug.\n\n【13】All symptoms subsided and the patient was discharged with closed follow-up. Three times of CT angiography during 6 months revealed no enlargement of lesion, and there was no recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】This abnormality usually becomes symptomatic at young age and middle age, although it has also been found symptomatic at both extremes of 5 - 50 years age range .\n\n【16】The most frequent symptom and sign on admission is symptom secondary to hemorrhage, headache, seizure and focal neurologic sign . Because of the nature of lesion, all symptoms have fluctuation . This case was in older age with misleading symptoms dissimilar to classic ones, e.g. defective visual field and fluctuating ataxia. New onset seizures in adulthood should not be overlooked because there may be usually an important lesion in the brain as its etiology especially vascular malformation . Selective imaging in this lesion includes brain MRI and CT angiography . In clinical practice, it must be mentioned that in solid occupying lesions (SOLs), lumbar puncture is contraindicated because of the danger of brain herniation.\n\n【17】Treatment\n\n【18】There is a broad spectrum of recommended managements including microsurgery , radiosurgery with Gama knife (GKS) , and neurointerventional method (coil and embolization) . Combined treatment, GKS with coil or embolization, can reduce mass lesion and reduce the size of AVM and result in a better outcome in patient management .\n\n【19】It is important that the interventional method for cavernous AVM be usually done through venous access.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】In the referred patient, central nervous system (CNS) vascular malformation is highly probable because of neurologic problems especially fluctuating focal neurologic symptoms (seizure, focal paresis, visual field defect and cerebellar sign), CNS steal syndrome and chronic headache syndromes whose headache rhythm and period have changed recently. It is important to know that primary imaging for these patients may not clearly define the lesion or be falsely negative. Therefore, we advise MRI/MRA/MRV, CT angiography and even conventional angiography in these situations.\n\n【22】Treatment plan for these lesions is based on location, distribution of vascular malformation, age, accompanying lesion and malformation progress in serial imaging.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "dd5d205e-3cf0-400f-9036-8e70dbe3db6f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Women with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia often have no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) by invasive coronary angiography when compared to men. Microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) with open coronary arteries is associated with a female predominance, pain that can be disabling, and inconsistent responses with use of conventional anti-ischemic therapy . MCD should be diagnosed and treated adequately due to compromised quality of life and increased association with adverse cardiac outcomes . Ranolazine has been observed to improve the symptoms of myocardial ischemia and improve the quality of life in such patients . MCD appears to be a key contributory mechanism for myocardial ischemia in women with no obstructive CAD and significant symptom improvement is seen with ranolazine .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 27-year-old woman was referred by her treating cardiologist for a 10-year history of exertional midsternal stabbing chest pain with shortness of breath and fatigue. Her symptoms began at age 17, and she was initially treated for pericarditis with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was subsequently treated for myocarditis after high coxsackie viral titers was identified 4 years later. Her work-up for autoimmune disease was negative, and her TSH was normal. Cardiac catheterization at age 24 revealed normal coronary arteries with no coronary anomalies. Echocardiography showed normal right ventricular and left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, possible anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse and normal valves. There was no pericardial effusion or thickening. She had no cardiac risk factors including no history of diabetes, hypertension, or family history of premature CAD. She underwent adenosine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), in which she developed chest discomfort from the adenosine infusion, but resting and stress ECG showed no abnormalities or ischemia. Adenosine-induced first-pass hypoperfusion of the subendocardium was visualized in mid-anteroseptum, anterior and anterolateral wall segments . There was also circumferential subendocardial hypoperfusion in the distal left ventricle, which was measured as a reversible perfusion defect of 19% with quantitative myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) of 1.5 (normal MPRI > 1.8). Pericardium was normal thickness with no pericardial effusion .\n\n【4】Due to her abnormal stress CMRI and persistent symptoms, she then underwent CRT to evaluate endothelial-dependent, nonendothelial-dependent and smooth muscle coronary vasomotor pathways, as previously published . Coronary angiography again showed normal appearing coronary arteries, with no luminal irregularities, no spasm, no bridging, and a normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 7 mmHg. She developed moderate to severe chest discomfort during catheter manipulation in the coronary arteries and during contrast infusion, consistent with a cardiac nociception abnormality. Coronary flow reserve to intracoronary adenosine was abnormal at 1.8 (normal > 2.5), consistent with nonendothelial-dependent microvascular coronary dysfunction. Intracoronary acetylcholine testing showed 0% dilation (normal response > 0%) consistent with endothelial-dependent macrovascular coronary dysfunction, although coronary blood flow increased by 72%, which was within normal limits, indicating normal endothelial-dependent microvascular function. Response to intracoronary nitroglycerin revealed 40% dilation (normal ≥ 20% dilation) consistent with normal smooth muscle function.\n\n【5】She had previously been treated with metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily, verapamil ER 100 mg daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed and had persistent symptoms. Following her CMRI and CRT, she was treated with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily, carvedilol CR 20 mg daily and isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg three times daily. After 3 months’ treatment, her angina improved from 9/10 to 5/10 in severity. Repeat CMRI scan was also improved, with a faster rate of myocardial enhancement seen in the consecutive cine images, a decrease in perfusion defect to 13% and an increase in MPRI to 3.3 .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】This case highlights the clinical importance of diagnosing MCD and improvement of symptoms with the anti-anginal medication ranolazine. Ranolazine is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of angina, and was shown to significantly improve angina scores in women with MCD in a pilot study . The beneficial effects of ranolazine are proposed to be a consequence of its action to reduce sodium entry into myocardial cells through sodium channels and maintaining the sodium -calcium homeostasis . Identification of angina caused by MCD is crucial due to the associated major adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Approximately 50% of women with symptoms of persistent chest pain, evidence of ischemia and presence of no obstructive CAD have been found to have MCD . Since stress testing with echocardiography and nuclear perfusion imaging may reveal normal wall motion and normal myocardial perfusion, first-pass perfusion CMRI has been used to identify and measure subendocardial perfusion defects in patients with suspected MCD . As patients with MCD do not typically have vascular territory perfusion defects as seen in patients with epicardial CAD, visual interpretation of the CMRI scans may be challenging, and quantitative measurements of MPRI may be necessary to evaluate the speed and intensity of the myocardial enhancement.\n\n【8】The current management for the treatment of MCD includes controlling symptoms, improving quality of life and reducing hospitalization. Cardiac rehabilitation can be initiated to minimize symptoms. Statins may improve endothelial function through their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties or through their ability to restore vascular nitric oxide and thus endothelial-dependent relaxation of coronary resistance vessels. Beta blockade, particularly with atenolol, has been shown to improve functional capacity and reduce angina episodes in patients with MCD . The role of nitrates and calcium channel blockers for management of MCD is not yet supported by evidence, even though these medications are first-line therapy for vasospastic angina .\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】Women with signs and symptoms of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease often have MCD that carries an adverse prognosis. Anti-anginal medications should be used to alleviate symptoms, and novel anti-anginal, anti-ischemic medication, ranolazine, can be used as a treatment strategy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Simultaneously, a dramatic decrease in arterial blood oxygen saturation in a sitting or standing position is easily observed and related to a simultaneous change in arterial blood gas sample (orthodeoxia) .\n\n【2】Although pulmonary or hepatic diseases may be the causes of POS , the most common etiology is cardiac and related to an interatrial communication without constant right-to-left (R-L) pressure gradient but with an R-L shunt that occurs preferably in the upright position .\n\n【3】We present a case of POS associated with an occult patent foramen ovale (PFO) and an ectatic aorta followed by a review of the literature.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 87-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency medicine department complaining of severe dyspnea within the last 3 h. She denied cough, sputum production or fever. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 130/56 mm Hg, pulse was 79 beats per minute and respiration rate was 32 breaths per minute. Pulmonary auscultation was clear. Cardiac examination revealed a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border. The oxygen saturation was 87% breathing at room air. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) at room air showed pH 7.55, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 23 mm Hg, pO <sub>2 </sub> 46 mm Hg. With a high flow mask, her oxygen saturation improved to 91%. Analytic study showed no relevant changes. Coagulation study was normal. Chest roentgenogram revealed an apparent dilated aorta with clear lung fields. Electrocardiogram was in sinus rhythm without any other electrical changes. Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary CT angiography showed no parenchymal or vascular problem. She was admitted to our Internal Medicine Intermediate Care Unit for further evaluation.\n\n【6】Her past medical history was significant for a pulmonary embolism 3 years ago. At that time, the chest CT with angiography showed a central bilateral pulmonary embolism and the transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. She was submitted to thrombolysis with subsequent resolution of hypoxemia.\n\n【7】Some months after this event, she was admitted to our Internal Medicine Department due to pyelonephritis. During her stay, frequent periods of dyspnea and desaturation with poor response to oxygen therapy were noticed, which prompted further evaluation. Ventilation-perfusion scan did not show any perfusion amputation. Chest CT showed some bronchiectasis and fibrotic striatae in both pulmonary bases, without interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary function tests and electromyography were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an aneurysmatic interatrial septum without apparent interatrial communication, no pulmonary hypertension and normal biventricular function.\n\n【8】Chronic hypoxia was assumed to be probably due to previous pulmonary thromboembolism. She was discharged with domiciliary oxygen therapy and oriented to pneumology outpatient consult.\n\n【9】When we first saw the patient in our Intermediate Care Unit, we noticed the symptoms appeared to worsen on moving from supine to erect position. Pulse oximetry showed a decrease in the oxygen saturation to less than 80% in the upright position and an increase to more than 90% in the recumbent position.\n\n【10】This worsening was confirmed through ABGs in both positions, revealing marked orthostatic desaturation . This pattern was consistent with platypnea-orthodeoxia.\n\n【11】Having the information of the previous two transthoracic echocardiograms, we decided that the best course of action was to first exclude an intracardiac shunt. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography with agitated saline in the supine and erect position did not show an intracardiac shunt but indicated a possible extracardiac R-L shunt. This led us to make a new chest CT with angiography in a venous and an arterial phase to exclude intrapulmonary shunts. Again, the exam was negative for shunts but revealed an aneurysmatic aortic root (44 mm) already present in previous chest CTs.\n\n【12】At this point, we had a patient with POS, without liver disease, significant pulmonary disease or apparent intracardiac shunt.\n\n【13】Keeping in mind the aneurysmatic interatrial septum and a transthoracic echocardiogram with agitated saline suggesting the presence of a shunt, we decided to do a transesophageal echocardiography that showed an aneurysmatic interatrial septum with phasic protrusion to the left atria, associated to a PFO with a low magnitude left-to-right shunt. The inferior vena cava flux was turbulent and directed to the atrial septum. We could not confirm an inversion of the shunt due to poor collaboration of patients in a Valsalva maneuver.\n\n【14】We proceeded to a cardiac catheterization that showed normal pulmonary artery pressure (15/6 mm Hg) and normal right atrial pressure (5 mm Hg).\n\n【15】The patient’s PFO was closed percutaneously using a 22 mm septal occluder device placed in the interatrial septum. A post-procedure echocardiographic bubble study was negative for shunting.\n\n【16】The patient’s dyspnea immediately resolved. Her oxygen saturations on room air in the upright position improved to more than 94% and she was discharged completely asymptomatic.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This syndrome was first reported in 1949 by Burchell in a case of intrathoracic arterial venous shunt . Later, in 1969 and 1976, Altman and Robin respectively, used the terms platypnea-orthodeoxia to describe a syndrome, at this time, mostly in patients with hepatic or pulmonary diseases . It was only in 1984 that Seward and colleagues reported a series of patients with POS related with interatrial communications with R-L shunts without pulmonary hypertension .\n\n【19】There are three known causes for POS, namely, cardiac, pulmonary and hepatic ones. The physiopathological mechanisms involved are mediated by intracardiac shunts, pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and ventilation/perfusion mismatch .\n\n【20】When POS is caused by a cardiac disease, there is an anatomical and functional component working together to cause an R-L shunt without a constant R-L pressure gradient. So, anatomically, we find an interatrial communication as a PFO, atrial septal defect (ASD) or an atrial septal aneurysm with septal fenestration.\n\n【21】Because left atrium pressure is higher than right atrium pressure, there is no R-L shunt through a PFO or a small ASD. But, this kind of shunt can occur if we add a functional component that inverts the flow through the shunt.\n\n【22】A transient pressure elevation in the right atrium (hemodynamic explanation) induced by physiological maneuvers (posture change, inspiration, Valsalva maneuver, and cough)  and some diseases (right ventricular myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, constrictive pericarditis and pericardial effusion ) can provide this functional premise.\n\n【23】In the same way, some anatomical distortions can change the blood flow direction through the shunt (flow phenomenon) like in conditions such as emphysema, pneumonectomy, kyphoscoliosis and aortic aneurysm or elongation .\n\n【24】In the presence of this last condition, orthostatism could stretch the interatrial communication, augmenting the flow through the shunt or it could displace the atrial septum towards the horizontal position directing the blood flow from the inferior vena cava to the atrial septum, thereby extending the shunt .\n\n【25】PFO is present in about 25-30% of healthy individuals  but is normally asymptomatic. In our patient, PFO was accompanied by an elongated, ectatic thoracic aorta and kyphoscoliosis. Because aortic root dilatation is a progressive and age-dependent process, this patient just developed symptoms of POS much latter in her life.\n\n【26】Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how an ectatic aorta induces POS. Such an enlargement seems to be able to alter atrial septal geometry promoting a more direct pathway for the blood to flow from the vena cava to the interatrial communication or making the interatrial septum more mobile and permeable if there is an underlying defect .\n\n【27】Even though this article is not focused on the non-cardiac causes of POS, we are going to make a brief reference to pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and ventilation/perfusion mismatch as physiopathological mechanisms involved in pulmonary and hepatic causes.\n\n【28】The presence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunts is another mechanism behind POS and we can find it, for example, in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations/fistulae. Blood passes through pulmonary arteriovenous shunts without being oxygenated in the lungs. When the patient is in the upright position, gravity increases blood flow in the lung bases. Usually there are a great number of shunts in the lower lung fields, so the upright posture will increase the arteriovenous shunt, with consequent POS .\n\n【29】On the other hand, in the hepatopulmonary syndrome, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD) is the structural abnormality behind reduced arterial oxygenation in the setting of liver disease. IPVD increases pulmonary blood flow without changes in alveolar ventilation inducing a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. At the same time, there is an increased passage of mixed venous blood, through intrapulmonary shunts, into the pulmonary veins. IPVD is more common in the lung bases that normally are already overperfused (zone three phenomenon), especially in the upright posture, resulting in an exacerbation of the ventilation-perfusion mismatch as well as in arteriovenous pulmonary shunt and consequent POS .\n\n【30】POS is in fact a rare disease, but probably underestimated, and its diagnosis may be particularly difficult unless there is a high index of suspicion. The key to the diagnosis is a good clinical history and physical exam with relatively simple tests (comparison of pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analyses performed with the patient in different positions) but most of the diagnostic procedures will be falsely negative when they are done in the supine position.\n\n【31】When an intracardiac R-L shunt is suspected, contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography after injection of agitated normal saline in the supine and upright position is very sensitive, and allows definitive establishment of diagnosis in most cases . In our patient, these exams were not conclusive and even misdirected our study to an intra-pulmonary shunt. This false negative result with saline contrast has been already described by some authors and is a relevant pitfall to account when trying to diagnose PFO . A contrast tilt-table transesophageal echocardiography in lying and upright position may be needed. In some few cases, the shunt was seen only on Valsalva maneuvers .\n\n【32】Percutaneous closure of the intra-atrial communication is very effective as the treatment of choice in most cases. After the procedure, most patients will have a complete resolution of their symptoms and will be able to resume a normal life .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

GBS has a low incidence of 0.5 - 2 cases per 100,000 children under 18 years old. It is rare in infants . GBS is deemed to be an autoimmune disease, and infections caused by Campylobacter jejuni , cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are reported as important triggers . The diagnosis of GBS is clinical and supported by neuroconductive studies, as well as the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Established treatment regimens include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PE) in older children and adults. However, efficacy and safety of these treatments have not been established in infants . The prognosis for childhood GBS is often favorable .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A previously healthy 11-month-old boy was referred to a pediatric hospital with a history of weakness and difficulty feeding for 10 days. He developed fever and diarrhea 2 weeks before the onset of weakness. He was treated with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for 7 days. Two days after the diarrhea started, he presented weakness in the lower extremities and at 24 h in both arms, and later inability to sit, feed and support the head.\n\n【4】Pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. He had achieved normal motor milestones. After 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding, solid foods were started. All vaccinations had been administered. He was vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Hemophilus influenzae B , hepatitis B and rotavirus 4 months ago. He had no other health problems. The parents were healthy and not consanguineous. No family history of autoimmune diseases was reported.\n\n【5】On initial examination, he was in the 50th percentile for weight, length, and head circumference. The vital signs were in normal ranges according to his age. He was wide awake, making eye contact. On detailed neurological examination, pupils were isochoric and responsive to normal light. No abnormalities of cranial nerves were detected. He had flaccid paralysis with absence of inferior and superior deep tendon reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement in the lower extremities, whereas there was only proximal muscle contraction in the upper extremities. Plantar reflexes were absent. He responded to painful examination of the skin on the lower and upper extremities with grimaces. Other tests of the system were normal.\n\n【6】Laboratory studies that included complete blood count, biochemical parameters, and coagulation profile were normal. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an increase in the protein count (119 mg/dL) and the cell count was in the normal range. Gram stain revealed no cells or microorganisms, and the cerebrospinal fluid culture was sterile. Stool culture was negative. Electroneuromyography revealed normal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, greatly reduced amplitude of action potentials, and an absence of F responses consistent with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), a variant of GBS.\n\n【7】Patient received IVIG at 2 g/kg single dose. Twenty-four hours later, evidence of proximal muscle contraction in upper and lower extremities, 72 h later horizontal movement of the lower extremities when gravity is eliminated. Two weeks later proximal movements against gravity overcome in upper and lower extremities, and he can hold his head. One month later he can grasp a toy but still has inability to stand alone.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】GBS is an acute immune-mediated peripheral polyneuropathy; it is the most common cause of flaccid paralysis in children, characterized by progressive, symmetrical weakness, paresthesia and areflexia, hyporeflexia or both .\n\n【10】It is more frequent in the adult population with an increase of 20% for every 10 years of increase in age after the first decade of life. In pediatric ages it is observed less frequently, and rarely in children under 2 years of age . A high index of suspicion is required in children under 2 years of age considering differential diagnoses such as acute cerebellar ataxia, transverse myelitis, spinal cord compression, tick-borne paralysis, botulism, trauma, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, poliomyelitis, and additional myopathies .\n\n【11】There are cases reported in children under 12 months with neurophysiological findings compatible with peripheral polyneuropathy where the diagnosis of GBS was excluded. Royden et al reported three cases, a 16-day-old male with symptoms from birth in which it was not possible to differentiate between a congenital error of myelination vs. GBS; another 11-month-old male who had a history of SABIN application, 3 weeks later developed respiratory failure and depended on ventilation up to 2 years of age. The third case of a 4.5-month-old girl with feeding difficulties, generalized hypotonia with ventilatory dependence, was identified, where the presence of botulinum toxin type A was determined in both stool and honey .\n\n【12】In 1959 Merril et al reported the first case of an 8-month-old infant in a series of 37 patients with GBS , while Cantalini et al in 1960 reported a 2-month-old patient with GBS treated with dexamethasone, prior to the use of IVIG .\n\n【13】Anecdotal cases with ages under 12 months are reported in the literature of GBS, with great diversity in their clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, treatment and evolution. Table 1 shows GBS cases younger than 12 months .\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】GBS is a rare disease, and individual studies often lack a sufficient number of cases to make age-specific incidence estimates. The symptoms, clinical course, and paraclinical findings in childhood GBS have rarely been investigated in non-gait children. GBS is an entity that is considered serious that requires multidisciplinary management to prevent complications from occurring and thereby improve the prognosis of patients. Upon arrival at the emergency department, all patients should be carefully evaluated, looking for signs of autonomic and respiratory dysfunction. It has been seen that the pediatric patient has a better prognosis compared to the adult. Approximately 80% of patients who have suffered GBS are symptomatic within a period of 6 months and 20% persist with a moderate neurological sequela. It has been proven that the initiation of treatment in the early stages of the disease produces a faster recovery and consequently fewer sequelae.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "90f1ac43-0e81-4ebf-8d2b-74b3c331fe8c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Dyspnea is a frequently encountered symptom in medicine. It is one of the main reasons of presentation in the emergency department and one of the most common causes of hospitalization . Dyspnea is also a complaint of nearly 4% of patients seeking treatment in the ambulatory care setting, and population samples have determined the prevalence of dyspnea to be between 17% and 38% . Platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is traditionally defined as dyspnea or hypoxemia observed when changing from a recumbent to an upright or seated position . Although there are several potential causes for this phenomenon, POS is classically described as resulting from right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) . The precise mechanism of shunting through a PFO despite normal intracardiac pressures, however, remains obscure .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further investigation of deteriorating shortness of breath. Her symptoms were present for the last 3 months and were felt to have slowly worsened over time.\n\n【4】The patient had been diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in 2010. Right heart catheterization at that time revealed an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure of 47 mm Hg and a normal wedge pressure (PAWP or PC) of 12 mm Hg. Cardiac index was reduced (1.77 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly elevated (12 Wood Units). A rheumatic arthritis with symmetric involvement of multiple joints and positive CCP-antibodies was also known since 2009. For treatment of her arthritis, the patient received methotrexat once a week. As no other etiology for PAH was found, the patient’s disease was classified as Dana Point group 1. She was referred to our PAH clinic for specific therapy. Sildenafil was not tolerated and bosentan led to a drastic elevation of GOT and GPT. Ambrisentan, on the other hand, was well tolerated, improved 6-min walking distance by 35 m (from 180 to 215 m) and decreased NT-proBNP plasma levels. Ambrisentan monotherapy was continued through the years 2010 to 2013 as the patient’s general condition stabilized and dyspnea was reduced.\n\n【5】As a result of the PAH, the right ventricle was dilated and the right ventricular systolic function declined. With 17 mm, TAPSE was within the normal range. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function showed no abnormalities.\n\n【6】At presentation, the patient revealed no alarming clinical signs: RR 100/60 mm Hg, temperature 36.8 °C, and blood glucose 106 mg/dL. On blood gas analysis, pO <sub>2 </sub> was found to be 59 mm Hg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 43 mm Hg, BE +6 mmol/L, pH 7.45, and SO <sub>2 </sub> 90%. Blood chemistry provided the following parameters: troponin 15.6 pg/mL, NT-proBNP 126 pg/mL, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, sodium 140 mmol/L, and CRP < 0.5 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm (95 beats per minute) with a known right axis and peaked P waves as a result of the pulmonary hypertension . The chest X-ray had no signs of pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion or pneumonia .\n\n【7】The patient described increasing shortness of breath while standing with an improvement when changing to a recumbent position. To substantiate this perception, continuous measurements of heart rate and oxygen saturation in lying, sitting and standing positions were obtained. Results are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【8】For further investigation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed, combined with continuous registration of heart rate and oxygen saturation. Agitated saline contrast was used to search for intracardiac shunts . As a significant right-to-left shunt would increase left atrial pressure and reduce pulmonary venous flow, the latter was also evaluated by Doppler echocardiography. The goal was to elucidate the potential role of the previously diagnosed PFO in the pathophysiology of the clinical symptoms.\n\n【9】In lying position, there was no relevant transition of NaCl bubbles from the right to the left atrium. Accordingly, the flow in the pulmonary veins was not compromised. This was in line with the fact that oxygen saturation reached 89% in lying position, compatible with the patient’s pulmonary hypertension and not suspicious of any right-to-left shunt. When moving the patient to an upright position with the TEE probe in place, the oxygen saturation dropped to 81%. Agitated saline contrast was applied once again, but failed to provide any evidence of intracardiac shunting. Furthermore, pulmonary venous flow was unchanged under these conditions as well. Contrary to our expectations, the PFO did not seem to account for the POS. Thus, the diagnostic workup was extended. Pulmonary function testing revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subsequently, inhalative anti-inflammatory/anti-obstructive treatment and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy was initiated. Within 2 weeks, the patient’s symptoms resolved.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】POS is an uncommon condition characterized by dyspnea and arterial desaturation upon assuming an upright position . The syndrome was originally described in patients with pulmonary disease without intracardiac shunts .\n\n【12】Current knowledge relates POS to intracardiac shunting, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or a combination of these .\n\n【13】In the case of anatomical interatrial discontinuities (e.g. PFO, atrial septal defects), a functional component modified by positional changes is required as well. Functional components include conditions that increase right atrial pressure, stretch the interatrial septum and/or redirect blood flow through the interatrial communication.\n\n【14】Anatomical as well as functional conditions may lead to intrapulmonary shunting. Arteriovenous anastomoses, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and grossly distended pulmonary capillaries are potential causes of anatomical shunts. Functional shunts are due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, that is, hypoventilation of normally perfused segments or hyperperfusion of normally ventilated segments. In either case, insufficiently oxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood, thereby resulting in overall desaturation. The mechanisms affecting the degree of intrapulmonary shunting and their relation to positional changes are not fully understood. Clearly, in the upright position, pulmonary perfusion shifts from the apical to the basal parts of the lungs. Right ventricular preload is reduced, and pulmonary artery pressure drops. The effect on pulmonary venous pressure is less predictable, considering the plethora of modifying factors, such as left ventricular function and compliance, left ventricular pre- and afterload, heart rate valvular function. Irrespective of other potential mechanisms, the apico-basal shift of pulmonary perfusion upon standing aggravates the functional significance of any basally located pathology . More pronounced anatomical or functional intrapulmonary shunting in the lower parts combined with a reduced potential for compensation in the upper parts of the lungs will then result in significant deoxygenation. In line with these considerations, our patient also revealed a basal predominance with respect to his COPD.\n\n【15】The diagnosis of POS is based on the following criteria: 1) platypnea, 2) orthodeoxia (SpO <sub>2 </sub> < 90%), 3) existence of an interatrial or intrapulmonal communication, and 4) right-to-left shunt. Our patient presented with typical symptoms, and the previously diagnosed PFO seemed to provide the pathophysiologic basis. However, contrary to expectations, we were unable to demonstrate a hemodynamically significant right-to-left shunt across this interatrial discontinuity. As described by Desouza et al , tilt TEE with agitated saline contrast solution is the most effective diagnostic tool for this purpose. In rare cases, a shunt is only seen with Valsalva maneuver, which could not be performed in our patient because of his apparent shortness of breath. However, if this shortness of breath would have been related to an interatrial right-to-left shunt, it would have had to be present under just these conditions. In the absence of an intracardiac shunt, contrast-enhanced echocardiography, perfusion scan (scintigraphy) with macroaggregated albumin or pulmonary arteriography might be used to detect intrapulmonary shunting . Based on the favorable clinical course, we refrained from respective diagnostic procedures in our patient.\n\n【16】If POS is definitely related to intracardiac shunting, closure of the interatrial communication represents definitive treatment. In 2001, Rao and colleagues  reported on percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects and PFOs in platypnea orthodeoxia patients via femoral approach. A jugular approach is feasible as well . Transcatheter closure immediately improves oxygen saturation in upright position. Platypnea resolves completely . Symptomatic improvement is seen in > 95% of patients. In light of this effective treatment option, it is tempting to proceed with respective interventions once an interatrial communication has been detected. However, this case clearly demonstrates that a PFO might be an “innocent bystander”, where closure would not affect the underlying pathophysiology. Instead, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, an intervention could even be detrimental by preventing preload reduction through right-to-left shunting.\n\n【17】In patients with intrapulmonary shunting, the underlying pulmonary disease must be treated to reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Closure of small airways or microatelectasis have been suggested as potential causes of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in platypnea orthodeoxia , possibly reversible with CPAP ventilation. Both, mechanical ventilation and application of end-expiratory positive airway pressure (PEEP) tend to increase right-to-left shunting with worsening of hypoxemia. Our patient experienced a gradual improvement in oxygenation while on mechanical ventilation with PEEP application and also during non-invasive bi-level ventilation.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Awareness and careful clinical evaluation are clues to the diagnosis of POS. Although an interatrial communication is frequently involved in the underlying pathophysiology, it might also coexist without any causal relationship. Thus, a functional analysis of all potential components is required before deciding on a specific therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0a8431be-6383-46fa-a50f-50b53b496dae", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Mesalazine, also known as mesalamine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is a widely used and a well-established first-line treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It belongs to the class of aminosalicylate drugs and exerts its therapeutic effects directly within the gastrointestinal system. The precise mechanism of action of the drug remains uncertain. However, the possible mechanism of action of mesalazine is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, thereby impeding prostaglandin formation, that results in decreasing signaling via PPAR-γ pathway leading to decreased activity of nuclear factor κB . By interrupting this cascade, mesalazine contributes to the reduction of colonic inflammation . Upon oral administration, mesalazine is primarily metabolized in the gut, resulting in localized actions in that region. As a result, the incidence of systemic side effects is relatively low, with most adverse reactions being gastrointestinal in nature, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that while rare, mesalazine can potentially give rise to certain complications beyond the gastrointestinal system. These less common adverse effects include pancreatitis, blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cell counts or function), and cardiovascular complications . These manifestations may arise due to various mechanisms of action exhibited by mesalazine. Many potential sites of action include the inhibition of interleukin-2 and lipoxygenase, which are important inflammatory mediators .\n\n【2】Myocarditis, although rare, represents a significant and potentially hazardous complication of mesalazine therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly recognize and differentiate it from extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Early recognition and discontinuation of the medication are of utmost importance, as it can potentially save lives. In this context, we present a case study of a 32-year-old male patient who developed acute myocarditis shortly after initiating mesalazine treatment.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 32-year-old male without prior cardiac history presented to the emergency department (ED) with an intense 8 out 10, central chest pain. The pain had been radiating to the left shoulder and the back over the previous 24 h. Concurrently, the patient experienced mild dyspnea and generalized weakness. There was no associated cough, fever, or other flu-like symptoms. Past medical history included a recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC), about 12 days ago, with the initiation of mesalazine 1.5 g b.i.d. On examination, the patient was afebrile and normotensive with normal oxygen saturation and normal heart rate. The cardiovascular and respiratory examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray demonstrated clear lung fields with normal cardiothoracic ratio. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with concave ST-segment elevation in I, II, V4-6 . Elevated cardiac biomarkers suggestive of myocardial damage were observed, with a troponin-I level of 6.53 ng/mL (normal range < 0.5 ng/mL) and with a CK-MB of 65 IU/L (normal range < 25 IU/L). In addition, further laboratory analysis revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration of 105 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL) and others blood tests within normal parameters (including leucocytes and eosinophils concentrations). The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a normal-size left ventricle (LV) with normal systolic function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 55-60%. The global longitudinal strain was normal at 20.6%. Furthermore, the TTE did not show any evidence of pericardial effusion and no significant valvular disease was detected.\n\n【6】It is noteworthy to mention that during the first few days of admission, the patient experienced recurring episodes of chest pain. However, upon discontinuation of mesalazine, the symptoms subsided. The troponin-I levels demonstrated a characteristic decline, reaching 2.53 ng/mL, as measured 3 days after admission.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Following the TTE, the patient underwent a coronary angiogram, which revealed unobstructed coronaries . Based on the above findings, the working diagnosis was acute myocarditis. Considering the patient’s clinical history, presentation and the absence of significant coronary artery disease, the differential diagnoses for the myocarditis included viral myocarditis, extraintestinal manifestation of UC, autoimmune processes, or drug-induced myocarditis. These possibilities highlight the importance of considering various etiologies in myocarditis cases and conducting a thorough evaluation.\n\n【9】During the patient’s hospitalization, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed, which revealed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the basal lateral and apical septum wall segments , indicating the presence of myocardial edema. These findings are consistent with the inflammatory process associated with myocarditis. Additionally, subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was observed in the same areas . This finding indicates areas of scar tissue or fibrosis within the myocardium, which can occur because of inflammation and damage during myocarditis. Also, there were areas of patchy LGE distribution throughout the left ventricle. This pattern of enhancement is characteristic of myocarditis, as the inflammatory process often affects different areas of the myocardium in a non-uniform or patchy manner . Importantly, despite the presence of these inflammatory and scar tissue findings, the CMR confirmed that the left ventricle was normal in size and demonstrated preserved ejection fraction.\n\n【10】Based on a comprehensive evaluation incorporating the CMR findings, the temporal relationship between mesalazine initiation and the onset of cardiac symptoms, as well as the subsequent clinical improvement observed upon discontinuation of the medication, a conclusive diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis was made.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】In terms of symptomatic management, patient was treated with analgesia, while mesalazine was discontinued, as a working diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis was suggested.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】The patient was discharged a few days later, exhibiting complete resolution of symptoms and remaining entirely asymptomatic. As part of the discharge plan, a crucial recommendation was provided to the patient to abstain from lifelong usage of mesalazine. Subsequently, a follow-up CMR was conducted 4 months later, revealing a marked improvement and significant resolution of the previously observed findings . This approach ensured appropriate patient care, monitoring, and management, resulting in the successful resolution of myocarditis-related symptoms and favorable cardiac recovery.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium and can manifest as an acute, subacute or chronic process . It exhibits a diverse range of clinical presentations and outcomes, reflecting the polymorphic nature of the disease. Myocarditis primarily affects a young and healthy individual, with a higher prevalence among males . It encompasses a broad spectrum of etiological factors, resulting from exposure to either discrete external antigens such as viruses, which are considered the most common cause, such as coxsackie, and also other microorganisms such as bacteria and parasites. However other external triggers, like toxins or drugs can cause myocardial inflammation. Furthermore, the disease can be activated by internal triggers, such as auto-immune conditions, as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . This wide array of potential causes underscores the complex nature of myocarditis and its multifactorial origin. Clinical presentations include a wide range of symptoms, varying from mild fatigue, palpitations, and chest pain to more severe manifestations with the development of arrhythmias and syncopal episodes. In rare cases, more lethal complications may arise with the presence of fulminant myocarditis, which can be manifested as acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and even sudden cardiac death . Approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with myocarditis may later develop a chronic inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) . In the majority of cases, myocardial inflammation gradually subsides and leads to complete resolution of the disease. However, in the specific case of DCM, persistent inflammation can initiate remodeling mechanisms that contribute to the degeneration of myocardial cells and the replacement of damaged myocardium with fibrotic tissue. As disease progresses, this fibrotic transformation can lead to myocardial dilatation, global remodeling of the left ventricle, and chronically reduced ejection fraction. These pathological changes ultimately characterize the clinical presentation of DCM. This phenomenon has been observed in animal models of myocarditis induced by viral infections and autoimmune conditions .\n\n【17】The diagnosis of myocarditis traditionally required a histologic diagnosis; however, endomyocardial biopsy remains largely underutilized in the clinical practice, as it possesses limitations with a diagnostic yield as low as 35% . These limitations arise from the patchy distribution of inflammation observed in some cases, as well as the challenge of accessing the epicardial and mid-wall layers where inflammation often predominates . Consequently, clinical suspicion together with laboratory and imaging criteria, such as CMR, has been used to secure the diagnosis of myocarditis.\n\n【18】Emerging evidence suggests a potential association between IBD and an increased risk of developing myocarditis compared to the general population . Although it is not entirely clear, it is thought to be related to the underlying inflammation that is characteristic of the disease, as inflammation can affect various parts of the body, including the heart, and may contribute to the development of the disease. Another, rare but plausible explanation is toxicity from mesalazine. The distinction between these causes can be difficult and demanding; however, it is crucial, as the early cessation of mesalazine can prevent any long-term dysfunction. The precise mechanisms, through which mesalazine may contribute to heart damage, are not fully understood. It is suggested that cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction is the cause rather than a direct cardiotoxic effect. This is supported by the definitive resolution of disease following the discontinuation of the drug and by eosinophilic infiltration on endomyocardial biopsy specimens . An additional supporting evidence of hypersensitivity reaction to mesalamine is the occurrence of rare cases presenting with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, angioedema, skin rashes, and hypereosinophilia . Mesalazine has been shown to inhibit the activity of COX1 and enhance the metabolism of arachidonic acid into lipoxygenase products such as leukotrienes. The excessive production of lipoxygenase products can contribute to a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade, thereby promoting the development of allergic myocarditis . This process involves the release of cytokines that stimulate eosinophils, leading to inflammation. Another potential mechanism is through humoral-mediated hypersensitivity response. In this scenario, antibodies produced against mesalazine can cross-react with heart tissues, leading to inflammation . Furthermore, mesalazine has been found to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which disrupt mitochondrial membrane. This causes mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent release of cytochrome c, eventually leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and eventually to cardiovascular dysfunction .\n\n【19】Sometimes it is challenging to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis caused by mesalazine because there are no physical findings, symptoms, or laboratory tests that are pathognomonic for mesalazine-induced cardiotoxicity. The diagnosis is based on clinical features, with symptom onset typically occurring within 2 - 4 weeks of initiation of treatment and by the early resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the medication . Simultaneously with the cessation of the medication, the clinicians should rule out other causes of myocarditis like cardiotoxicity of IBD, viral myocarditis and vasculitis.\n\n【20】Moreover, it is important to highlight that a recent retrospective study by Chen et al investigated the potential association between the dosage of mesalazine and the occurrence of myocardial injury. The study findings revealed no apparent link between the dosage of mesalazine and the occurrence of myocardial injury. Additionally, increasing the dose of mesalazine did not lead to a shorter onset time for cardiotoxicity . These observations suggest that there is no apparent dose-dependent relationship between mesalazine and the development of myocardial injury or the timing of cardiotoxic manifestations.\n\n【21】Echocardiography is a valuable tool in the evaluation of acute myocarditis due to its ability to aid in distinguishing it from other conditions causing myocardial disease. However, there are no specific findings for acute myocarditis on TTE. The most common pattern is a dilated, spherical ventricle with reduced systolic function. Of note, a pericardial effusion usually signifies myopericarditis. In recent years, CMR has gained significant popularity for its effectiveness in detecting myocarditis. The visual manifestations of myocardial inflammation include the presence of edema, hyperemia, capillary leakage, necrosis, and fibrosis . The intensity and severity of these alterations are based on the level of underlying myocardial inflammation and the timing of the CMR in relation to the natural course of the disease, as it progresses from an acute or subacute phase to a healed or chronic state. This temporal progression of myocardial inflammation, which often lasts days to weeks before eventual resolution, narrows the optimal window for diagnostic imaging sensitivity to only a few weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. So, performing CMR in the early stages of myocarditis is considered essential . The assessment of CMR findings in myocardial inflammation is frequently done using the revised Lake Louise Criteria (LLC). According to the revised criteria, CMR provides strong evidence of acute myocardial inflammation for the definite diagnosis of myocarditis, in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. It demands at least one T1-based marker of nonischemic myocardial injury (abnormal T1 mapping, increased extracellular volume, or LGE) and at least one T2-based marker of myocardial edema (abnormal T2 mapping or regional abnormalities on T2-weighted imaging) . Myocardial edema arises as a consequence of acute inflammation during the initial phases of myocarditis and is commonly observed in the septum or lateral wall in a non-vascular distribution, although any myocardial wall can be affected. In contrast to edema seen in acute infarction, which primarily involves the subendocardial layer, edema associated with myocarditis tends to spare this region and predominantly affects the subepicardial and mid-myocardial layers of the cardiac tissue. Additionally, the detection of LGE indicates the presence of tissue inflammation, necrosis and early fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis is widely acknowledged as a significant contributor to the development of ventricular arrhythmias, as it promotes the formation of re-entrant circuits and also has been associated with an increased risk of LV remodeling, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Worsened outcomes have been associated with a larger extent of LGE in myocardial imaging, defined as either LGE involvement in more than two LV segments, LGE exceeding 10% of LV mass, or LGE exceeding 17 g . In addition, the presence of LGE in the anteroseptal region has also been linked to unfavorable clinical outcomes . These findings highlight the significance of LGE as an important marker in myocardial imaging for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation in patients with myocarditis.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Mesalazine is established as the primary treatment for patients with mild to moderate UC and remains the cornerstone of maintenance therapy. In the context of IBD, cardiac involvement can manifest as an extraintestinal manifestation or may be associated with mesalazine treatment itself. Mesalazine-induced myocarditis typically presents within a few days to weeks following initiation of the medication.\n\n【24】When a patient presents with cardiac symptoms and mesalazine-induced myocarditis is suspected, CMR is recommended as a diagnostic modality. CMR aids in establishing the diagnosis by visualizing inflammation in both the myocardium and pericardium.\n\n【25】Timely recognition and diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis are of utmost importance due to its potential life-threatening nature. Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, prompt discontinuation of mesalazine is advised. Following cessation of the medication, symptoms generally resolve, and cardiac function can improve.\n\n【26】Learning points\n\n【27】Myocarditis is a rare, underdiagnosed complication of mesalazine, which occurs early after initiation. Clinicians should be wise to this rare yet life-threating cause of myocarditis and establish the diagnosis on time, as the early cessation of mesalazine would lead to resolution of the symptoms and can improve cardiac function.\n\n【28】CMR is considered the gold standard non-invasive diagnostic modality for confirming the diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis. Its utilization not only aids in establishing an accurate diagnosis but also plays a pivotal role in guiding clinical decision-making and subsequent follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Another way of transmission is the ingestion of the dairy products prepared with the milk from infected animals. Brucellosis manifests itself with high fever, shivering and pain in the muscles and large joints .\n\n【2】Osteoarticular involvement is the most frequently observed complication of brucellosis . Osteoarticular involvement includes spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteomyelitis, peripheral arthritis, bursitis, and tenosynovitis . In this article, a case of brucellosis with a combination of sacroiliitis and dactylitis is presented.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 47-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with pain in his right hip that started 10 days ago. There was also a diffuse swelling in the 3rd finger of his left hand . The patient described fever, night sweats, widespread muscle pain and fatigue that continued for the last two weeks. He did not have any history of trauma, psoriasis, diarrhoea, urethritis or any familial inflammatory arthropathy. During his physical examination, his temperature was 39 °C, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, heart rate 98/min, and his respiration rate was 18/min. Other systemic examinations gave normal results. The locomotor system examination revealed diffuse swelling and pain in the 3rd finger of his left hand. The right sacroiliac joint was positive in terms of the compression and Mennell’s tests and the Fabere sign. The patient’s laboratory tests revealed his leukocyte count as 8 K/uL, sedimentation rate as 21 mm/h, CRP level 32 mg/dL (0 - 5 mg/dL), ALT value 116 mU/L and AST value as 99 mU/L. The serum uric acid and calcium levels and urine test results were within normal limits. The rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and HLAB-27 tests were negative. However, the Rose Bengal test gave a positive result and Wright’s seroagglutination test was also positive for a 1/320 titre. Blood and urine cultures were obtained from the patient. On the 7th day of the blood culture, Brucella melitensis growth was detected. No infectious agents were observed to grow in the urine culture. While no pathologies were detected in the PA chest X-ray, the radiography of the left hand indicated a soft tissue swelling in the third finger. In the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), marked fluid retention was observed around the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons at the level of the proximal phalanx of the 3rd finger of the left hand. Imaging with an intravenous contrast agent revealed contrast retention at this point . The image was interpreted as diffuse inflammation in the digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons. In the MRI performed due to the pain in the patient’s right hip, the fat-suppressed T2-weighted images revealed diffuse hyperintense subchondral areas on the side of the right iliac bone facing the sacroiliac joint . Contrast retention was also observed at this point during the intravenous contrast imaging performed. The image was interpreted as right sacroiliitis. Based on the patient’s complaints and the findings at hand, reactive brucella dactylitis and sacroiliitis was diagnosed and treatment was started with a combination of doxycycline (200 mg/d), rifampicin (600 mg/g), streptomycin (1gr/d) and indometacin (100 mg/d). On the 10th day of his treatment, the patient’s temperature dropped to normal and the swelling and pain in his finger healed completely. On the 19th day of his treatment, the pain in his right hip was markedly reduced. While the streptomycin treatment was ended on the 21st day, doxycycline 200 mg/d, rifampicin 600 mg/d and indometacin 100 mg/d were continued until the end of the 8th week. The patient was discharged after four weeks’ hospital stay.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The frequency of osteoarticular involvement in brucellosis varies between 0-85% in the literature. This ratio has been reported as 21.3% in Spain , 28.5% in Iran , 42% in Greece , 47.7% in Saudi Arabia  and 59.2% in Macedonia . In the studies conducted in Turkey, the frequency has been observed as 33.7-43% in the Mediterranean region , while it was 46.5% in the middle Anatolian region . However, in a study conducted by Gur et al  in our region, this frequency was found as 69%.\n\n【7】Sacroiliitis is the most common type of osteoarticular involvement  which usually occurs unilaterally , although there are reports claiming that bilateral involvement occurs more frequently . Our patient also had unilateral sacroiliac joint involvement. In B.melitensis infections, 20-80% of the patients reveal findings suggesting musculoskeletal system involvement . Also, Ariza et al  have demonstrated that the sacroiliac joint is the most commonly involved joint in patients where a B. melitensis infection is predominant. Similarly, the blood culture of our patient with sacroiliitis also indicated B.melitensis growth.\n\n【8】Dactylitis is characterised with arthritis in the small joints of the fingers and toes . Inflammation along the finger flexor tendons, edema and enthesitis form the basic pathologies . Although dactylitis or ‘sausage fingers’ forms the characteristic feature of arthritis, this condition may also be observed in reactive arthritis, sarcoidosis, gout or flexor tendon sheath infections . Although dactylitis often occurs as an inflammation both in the joints and the flexor tendon sheaths of fingers and toes, it may also be observed in the form of isolated flexor tenosynovitis . Patients with brucellosis may develop bursitis and tendinitis in the periarticular region . Dactylitis in a patient with brucellosis was previously reported by Ozgocmen et al . Also in our case, we evaluated the diffuse swelling in the 3rd finger as brucella dactylitis and detected a diffuse tendon inflammation at the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis in the MRI.\n\n【9】In a recent study, multiple articular involvement has been reported in 17% of the patients with brucellosis; with sacroiliitis and spondylodiscitis in 10 patients, sacroiliitis and peripheral arthritis in 4 patients, and sacroiliitis and bursitis in one patient . As far as we know, our patient is the first case in the literature where a sacroiliitis and dactylitis are simultaneously observed. Moreover, except for the patients with brucella spondylitis , response to the treatment is good and fast in patients with osteoarticular involvement . We have also observed a good response to the triple antibiotherapy in our patient.\n\n【10】In conclusion, dactylitis is an important feature of inflammatory arthritis and unusual complication of osteoarticular brucellosis. And also dactylitis may be found with sacroiilitis in patients with brucellosis.\n\n【11】Disclosure of Interests’ Conflict\n\n【12】All authors declared no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood sample can be affected by many reasons, one being the presence of metabolically active cells like white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets leading to spurious or pseudo hypoxemia . We present a case of blast crisis due to acute myelogenous leukemia ((AML) presenting with spurious hypoxemia which improved after leukapheresis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 85-year-old elderly female with past medical history of diabetes, hypertension and recent diagnosis of AML was admitted to our ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute respiratory failure. She received recent chemotherapy at outside hospital. Her chest X-ray was normal, thereby, ruling out pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism was high with acute hypoxemia in a cancer patient with unimpressive chest X-ray. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show any right heart strain pattern. On arrival, she was clinically in shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and had WBC count of 455,000/µL. Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) on admission after endotracheal intubation showed pH of 6.64, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 67 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 29 mm Hg on 100% FiO <sub>2 </sub> but pulse oximetry read SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100%. Her ICU course was complicated by septic shock, multi-system organ failure and refractory metabolic acidosis. Oncology service was consulted, and patient underwent emergent leukapheresis for blast crisis with improvement in WBC count to 140,000/µL. Her ABG improved to pH of 6.89, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 30 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 351 mm Hg with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100% on pulse oximetry. Her PO <sub>2 </sub> improved dramatically after leukapheresis and removal of WBC from the blood. Family soon opted for comfort care measures, and she developed asystolic cardiac arrest and died.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Hypoxemia is a serious condition commonly seen in the ICU patients. Underlying physiologic derangements include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, hypoventilation, shunt and abnormality of diffusion capacity . ABG is a common test employed to diagnose hypoxemia. Hypoxemia can be true or spurious. Common clinical conditions leading to hypoxemia in ICU include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome and congestive heart failure. Pseudo hypoxemia or spurious hypoxemia is an entity where laboratory abnormalities of PaO <sub>2 </sub> are not a true reflection of patient’s bloodstream oxygen tension. Causes of inaccurate measurements of PaO <sub>2 </sub> include improper sampling, delay in transport with failure to cool the specimen, presence of bubbles in the sample, elevated cell count, blood gas analyzer malfunction or miscalibration or methemoglobinemia . Spurious hypoxemia has been reported in patients with hyperleukocytosis or thrombocytosis in the setting of hematological malignancies . It was first described in 1979 by Fox et al and was coined leukocyte larceny . This is due to the presence of high number of metabolically active WBCs with elevated consumption of dissolved oxygen in the arterial blood samples . The rate of oxygen consumption by WBCs is typically not important clinically in majority of patients with normal blood counts. Spuriously low PaO <sub>2 </sub> measurements are common when WBC count exceeds 50,000/µL or with severe thrombocytosis. This entity is not very well described in the critical care literature with not many cases reported in ICU setting \n\n【6】Patients with hyperleukocytosis in the setting of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia or blast crisis can develop true or spurious hypoxemia. Causes of true hypoxemia in these patients include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary leukostasis, leukemic infiltration, hemorrhage and drug-related toxicities. Inconsistencies between SpO <sub>2 </sub> with pulse oximetry and PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood can help to differentiate spurious hypoxemia from these causes. In leukocyte larceny, SpO <sub>2 </sub> is normal and PaO <sub>2 </sub> is low. Cooling of blood sample on ice and rapid analysis can help reduce the discrepancy.\n\n【7】Pulse oximetry is the most accurate method to assess oxygenation in patients with hyperleukocytosis . It measures hemoglobin saturation directly and is unaffected by the plasma oxygen tension. Understanding the concept of spurious hypoxemia in patients with hematologic malignancies will help to prevent unnecessary tests like CT scans and ventilation/perfusion scans to rule out pulmonary embolism, minimizing ICU admission of these patients and saving hospital resources and costs.\n\n【8】Our patient did not undergo these expensive tests for the workup of pulmonary embolism as PaO <sub>2 </sub> improved after leukapheresis.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】ICU physicians should be vigilant about the concept of pseudo/spurious hypoxemia and leukocyte larceny in patients with leukemias and blast crisis. Causes of true hypoxemia still need to be ruled out in the correct clinical setting. Pulse oximetry is the most reliable and easy method to clinically assess oxygenation in patients with leukocyte larceny.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

After one episode of postpartum thyroiditis, there is a 70 percent chance of recurrence with subsequent pregnancies . There has previously been a case that reported recurrent postpartum thyroiditis after each of three pregnancies . The risk of spontaneous abortion in thyroid antibody-positive women is two- to four-fold greater than in antibody-negative women . Postpartum thyroiditis can also occur after spontaneous or induced abortion , but a case of three documented episodes of postpartum thyroiditis, one of which developed after a spontaneous abortion, in a single patient has not yet been reported in the literature.\n\n【2】In this article, we report a patient with recurrent postpartum thyroiditis after each of three pregnancies, one of which developed after a spontaneous abortion.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 33-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for treatment of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism with goiter at a local medical clinic and treated intermittently with levothyroxine. Physical examination of the neck revealed a diffusely enlarged and non-tender thyroid gland. Ultrasonography (US) was carried out using a real-time linear array 10 MHz transducer. The thyroid US demonstrated a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with a 0.3 × 0.4 cm hypoechoic nodule in the right thyroid. The serial change in thyroid function tests (TFT) and the titer of autoantibodies over time are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【5】The patient gave birth to her first child. About one year before delivery, the results of a TFT were within normal limits with an increased titer of thyroid autoantibodies . Two months after delivery, the patient complained of feeling unwell with palpitations. Laboratory examination showed that T3 was 331.6 pg/mL, (normal range: 65 - 181 pg/mL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.009 µIU/L (normal range: 0.35 - 5.50 µIU/L), free thyroxine (FT4) was 3.76 ng/dL (normal range: 0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL), antithyroglobulin was 39.0 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), antimicrosomal antibodies were 167.4 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) was < 1 U/L (normal range: 0 - 10 U/L). Two months later, her TSH was 61.764 µIU/L and she was started on levothyroxine. Five month later, her TSH level returned to a normal range and levothyroxine was stopped.\n\n【6】The patient lost her second pregnancy to spontaneous abortion at 16 weeks of gestation. The patient had not been taking levothyroxine before conception or at the time of miscarriage. Three months after pregnancy loss, TFT revealed that T3 was 206.3 pg/mL, TSH was 0.273 µIU/L, and FT4 was 1.63 ng/dL. Two months later, her TSH level and titer of autoantibodies were markedly increased. She was restarted on levothyroxine and remained euthyroid . Her second child was born. During this third pregnancy, she was taking levothyroxine and her thyroid function remained normal throughout. Three months after delivery, the patient complained of heat intolerance and irritability. Laboratory tests showed an elevated FT4 and a low TSH . Tc-99m scintigraphy showed nonvisualization of both thyroid lobes, and 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake was 0.2% , which suggested destructive thyroiditis. The patient was treated with a beta-blocker during this thyrotoxic period. During this thyrotoxic event, she developed postpartum thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism with an eventual return to normal thyroid function .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Postpartum thyroiditis causes lymphocytic inflammation of the thyroid within the first few months after delivery, and the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis in iodine-sufficient areas ranges between 5-7% . The disease is most common in women who have a high serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentration during the first trimester of pregnancy or immediately after delivery  and in patients with a previous history of postpartum thyroiditis . The present case is of a woman living in Korea, which is an iodine-sufficient area . The patient also had high titer of thyroid autoantibodies with a previous history of postpartum thyroiditis. Postpartum thyroiditis usually presents in one of three ways: transient hyperthyroidism alone, transient hypothyroidism alone, or transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and then recovery. Stagnaro-Green  reported that hypothyroidism occurs in 43 percent of patients before the recovery phase, hyperthyroidism in 32 percent, and hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism in 25 percent. Only one-third of patients with postpartum thyroiditis develop the classic triphasic thyroid hormone pattern of transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and then recovery , which the present case exhibited in all three episodes. Hyperthyroidism usually occurs two to ten months after delivery, most commonly at three months, with recovery taking place over the next two to three months . In the present patient, hyperthyroidism occurred two to three months after delivery. Hypothyroidism occurs between two and 12 months after delivery, most commonly at six months , and in the present case, hyperthyroidism occurred four to five months after delivery. Most patients have normal thyroid function at one year , and all three episodes in the present case recovered within one year.\n\n【9】Abortion is a common clinical problem, and several studies have revealed a strong correlation between presence of thyroid antibodies and spontaneous abortion . Bagis et al  reported that 50% of thyroid autoantibody-positive women and 14.1% of thyroid autoantibody-negative patients had a history of spontaneous abortion. Othman et al  found that patients with postpartum thyroiditis and persistent hypothyroidism had a higher rate of spontaneous abortion than those patients who returned to a euthyroid state. In the present case, the patient was thyroid autoantibody-positive with postpartum thyroiditis. Therefore, both of these factors could have influenced the spontaneous abortion. There have been many other reports of postpartum thyroiditis that have developed after pregnancy loss . Postpartum thyroiditis that develops after abortion may also be associated with presence of thyroid autoantibodies .\n\n【10】In summary, patients with postpartum thyroiditis with presence of thyroid autoantibodies have an increased risk of recurrence of thyroiditis and spontaneous abortion. Therefore, patients with postpartum thyroiditis should be carefully assessed during all pregnancies following the first instance of thyroiditis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

When polyarthritis is also present, this represents a rare disease known as pancreatitis panniculitis polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome. Due to the absence of abdominal symptoms in most cases of PPP syndrome, a delay in diagnosis is not unusual . Alcoholism is one of the most common causes of chronic pancreatitis, and alcoholics often present with gouty arthritis. PPP syndrome in these patients may therefore be misdiagnosed. We report a case of arthritis being initially treated as gouty arthritis before the correct diagnosis of PPP syndrome was established.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse for at least 20 years, chronic pancreatitis with many acute episodes over 5 years, and gouty arthritis, presented with pain, swelling, and erythema involving the right thumb, right 4th metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and left heel  for 1 week.\n\n【4】Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were administered initially for presumed gouty arthritis; unfortunately, the symptoms progressed. The right knee, right heel, and left 3rd and 5th MTP joints became painful, swollen, and erythematous. The right knee joint was aspirated, and examination of the synovial fluid was positive for monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 8 hours were continued; however, purulent fluid developed over the right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel, and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Aspiration was performed from left heel, followed by administration of oxacillin 2,000 mg IV every 6 hours. The fluid culture grew Escherichia coli , so the antibiotics were changed to gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and cefazolin 1 g IV every 8 hours; methylprednisolone was tapered to 40 mg IV once a day. However, the patient developed a fever, and purulent fluid continued to accumulate in bilateral knees, right thumb, right 4th MTP joint, left heel and dorsum of the feet bilaterally. Arthrocentesis was again performed from right knee, and synovial fluid examination this time failed to show MSU or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The synovial fluid culture was negative. Due to an elevated white blood cell count (WBC 22,500/µL) with a left shift (neutrophils 90.1%) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 15.4 mg/dL, cefazolin was changed to ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g IV every 6 hours. Methylprednisolone was tapered and switched to oral prednisolone 5 mg twice a day. Gentamicin 80 mg IV once a day and colchicine 0.5 mg PO twice a day were continued. Fever persisted, and new erythematous nodules formed on the thighs and upper arms bilaterally . A skin biopsy was then performed. While awaiting the pathology report, the antibiotics were changed to cefpirome, and prednisolone and colchicine were continued. The right thumb required debridement due to the persistence of purulent fluid, and vancomycin was prescribed. The skin biopsy pathology report showed fat necrosis as well as ghost cells, which suggested pancreatic panniculitis.\n\n【5】After the pathology report, serum amylase and lipase levels were 4,840 U/L and 7,200 U/L, respectively. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan identified edema involving the pancreas with peripancreatic fat infiltrations. Interestingly, the patient denied abdominal pain throughout the entire hospitalization. The amylase and lipase continued to increase (7,520 U/L and 12,200 U/L, respectively). A third arthrocentesis was performed on the right knee. Synovial fluid showed amylase 1,970 U/L, lipase 1,260 U/L, cholesterol 79 mg/dL, and triglycerides 78 mg/dL. A Sudan stain performed on aspirate from the left heel lesion was negative. All antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient received nothing by mouth for 48 hours. He was then started on a low-fat diet; however, the serum amylase and lipase remained significantly elevated (13,180 U/L and 21,900 U/L, respectively). The erythematous nodules over the thighs and upper arms subsided gradually, and the purulent fluid accumulated over the dorsum of the feet also decreased. The patient was discharged on December 21, 2009.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Many cases of PPP syndrome have been reported. Although there are some patients with panniculitis and elevated serum lipase levels without pancreatic disease , most patients with PPP syndrome have acute or chronic pancreatitis , and some have pancreatic tumors or ischemic disease . The patient discussed in the case report had a history of chronic pancreatitis with many acute flare-ups over a 5-year period.\n\n【8】The typical patient with PPP syndrome is a middle-aged male with heavy alcohol use. Approximately two-thirds of patients present either without abdominal symptoms or with only mild symptoms, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and a poorer prognosis . Our 49-year-old male patient with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol use matches the aforementioned criteria for PPP syndrome. The lack of abdominal symptoms combined with his history of gouty arthritis and presence of MSU crystals in his right knee synovial fluid led to an initial diagnosis of gouty arthritis. Without the presence of erythematous nodules in the first few days after admission, pancreatic polyarthritis was not included in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【9】A symmetric or an asymmetric polyarthritis that includes both the small and large joints is typical for PPP syndrome; however, a few cases of oligoarthritis or monoarthritis have also been reported . Although there is no case report of coexisting gouty arthritis, septic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis with PPP syndrome, these diseases should all be considered in the differential diagnosis because their initial presentations may be similar.\n\n【10】Elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes can induce fat necrosis in the joint and adjacent periarticular tissues and lead to arthritis . Thick creamy synovial fluid with a high viscosity is typical for PPP syndrome . Microscopic examination can reveal birefringent crystal-like structures, which are due to the presence of lipid crystals . We identified elevated pancreatic enzyme levels in synovial fluid aspirated from the knee joint and checked the cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well. However, the Sudan stain of the aspirate was negative, and microscopic examination failed to reveal evidence of lipid crystals.\n\n【11】The serum pancreatic enzyme level does not always correlate with the severity of the arthritis, but it does correlate with the progression of the fat necrosis . However, in our case, the serum amylase and lipase levels increased gradually after PPP syndrome was diagnosed, and the arthritis and erythematous nodules slowly improved. Based on this case, amylase and lipase may not be suitable markers for the progression or improvement of PPP syndrome.\n\n【12】There is currently no case report with PPP syndrome coexistent with gouty arthritis, in both multiple joint involved, and we reported the case to illustrate the difficulty associated with establishing the correct diagnosis prior to the appearance of erythematous nodules. Physicians should consider PPP syndrome in a patient with polyarthritis and a history of pancreatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide with 5-year survival rates of 5.0-26.2% and the eighth most common cancer worldwide . There are two major types of esophageal cancer: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) . EAC arises from the distal third of the esophagus and is commonly found in Caucasian men . ESCC arises from the proximal two-thirds of the esophagus and is commonly found in African Americans and Caucasian females .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old white female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and generalized anxiety disorder was referred to our gastroenterology clinic by the pulmonologist for an abnormal finding on the computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. The patient was evaluated by her pulmonologist for a chronic cough of 1 year duration. Despite three courses of antibiotics, the cough continued to worsen.\n\n【4】She denied any medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, or aspiration pneumonitis. She denied any tobacco smoking or second hand smoking exposure. She consumed two drinks of alcohol on the weekend. She works as a pharmaceutical representative and was on medical leave due to the severe cough during the nights.\n\n【5】She denied any fever, chills or night sweats. She denied any chest pains, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. The patient’s vital signs were unremarkable. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for a scattered bibasilar expiratory wheezing in the anterior and posterior lobes.\n\n【6】Recent laboratory workup included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.1 cells/mL, hemoglobin of 15.1 g/dL, platelets of 279 /mm <sup>3 </sup> , absolute eosinophils of 0.30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, and auto-eosinophils of 4.8%. Other blood tests revealed Na of 138 mEq/L, K of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 61 unit/L, AST of 29 unit/L, ALT of 16 unit/L, and a total bilirubin of 1.0 mg/dL.\n\n【7】Sputum Gram-stain and culture revealed 2+ WBCs, 1+ epithelial cells, normal oropharyngeal flora isolate, and +3 probable Escherichia coli (E. coli) susceptible to cefazolin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, and trimethaprim/sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【8】The CT scan of the chest  revealed a markedly abnormal thickening of the thoracic esophagus in the proximal, mid, and distal esophagus that is suspicious for esophageal neoplasm.\n\n【9】An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure was performed using an Olympus video gastroscope. The scope was advanced into the esophagus and almost immediately, a 22 cm friable fungating mass was seen . There were multiple esophageal masses, which appeared separate. Esophageal biopsies were obtained from three different sites, 25, 30 , and 35 cm  from the incisors.\n\n【10】The pathology report of the mass located at the 25 cm revealed an invasive adenocarcinoma . The biopsy that was obtained from the 30 and 35 cm revealed an adenocarcinoma in situ .\n\n【11】Unfortunately, the patient declined further management and passed away 9 months later.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】This case is unique due to a number of atypical features. Firstly, the patient had respiratory symptoms rather than gastroenterology symptoms. The most common symptoms for esophageal cancer are dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss . Our patient presented with a chronic cough. Esophageal cancer can present with respiratory symptoms of cough and lung infection . This mechanism is commonly due to the presence of an acquired tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), which the patient did not have. In the literature, there was a case of an esophageal cancer in a patient presenting with acute respiratory symptoms rather the chronic, without a history of respiratory disease or acquired TEF .\n\n【14】Secondly, EAC arises from the distal third of the esophagus . The unusual location and distribution of the tumor in our case was very rare. The first friable mass was located at 22 cm from the incisors, which is part of the proximal two-thirds. The lesions were diffuse and extending down 35 cm from the incisors.\n\n【15】Thirdly, common risk factors for EAC are Barrett’s esophagus caused by chronic GERD, low socioeconomic status, obesity, and male gender . Higher alcohol consumption was not associated with increased risk of EAC . Our patient did not have any risk factors to suspect esophageal cancer.\n\n【16】In the review of the literature  , 16/21 patients presented with atypical symptoms of either metastatic or non-metastatic esophageal cancer.\n\n【17】Endoscopy with biopsy is the diagnostic test of choice for esophageal cancer . Staging of esophageal cancer should first be done with CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT . If the patient is a surgical candidate, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) should be used to determine the locoregional extent of disease .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】We present a case of an atypical feature of esophageal cancer. It is important for clinicians to keep esophageal cancer in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with the symptoms previously mentioned.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The usual manifestations of this disease are protean and may involve multiple organs including skin, peripheral and central nervous systems, kidneys, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss are commonly seen as well . On rare occasions, PAN may affect only one organ of the body, also referred to as isolated PAN . On most occasions, isolated PAN can be treated with surgical excision of the affected organ or with a short course of systemic corticosteroids . We describe a case of PAN simulating a clinical picture of acute febrile epididymo-orchitis with resolution of symptoms following orchiectomy and systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 62-year-old Caucasian male presented to the hospital with a three-month history of pain, swelling and redness around the left testicular region. Prior to coming to the hospital, he had been seen by his primary care provider on three different occasions. He was initially diagnosed with orchitis and then with epididymitis. He had finished two courses of outpatient antibiotic treatments with levofloxacin and amoxcillin with no relief in symptoms. A month prior to his hospitalization, he was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. One week prior, he was started on a tapering dose of prednisone and his symptoms flared back again which made him come to the hospital. His past medical history was significant for a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and gastritis. His past surgical history was significant for right middle lobectomy for bronchiectasis. The patient had a 50 pack year smoking history but had quit a few months prior to hospitalization. There was no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. His home medications included albuterol inhaler and famotidine taken on an as needed basis. On examination, the patient was afebrile and normotensive. A complete physical examination was unremarkable except for the left scrotal area which was warm, erythematous, and exquisitely tender to palpation. Significant laboratory data included an elevated ESR at 85 and an elevated C-Reactive protein (CRP) at 10.5. All other laboratory data including complete blood count, liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. A scrotal ultrasound was obtained which revealed a shrunken left testes, normal blood flow through the testes, and increased blood flow in epididymis consistent with epididymitis. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, the patient continued to have progressive testicular pain and swelling. A urology consult was obtained and left orchiectomy was performed. Pathology analysis of the excised testicle and adnexa showed fibrinoid necrosis of medium and small sized arteries associated with PMN’s, a brisk lymphoid infiltrate and occasional eosinophils and plasma cells. The angiocentric and destructive inflammation was present within the testicle, epididymis, and the loose connective tissue around the vas deferens. No thrombi or gross infarcts were seen . Additional laboratory studies including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), serum complement levels, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibodies, cryoglobulins, perinuclear and cytoplasmic ANCA, and HIV were negative. The patient was started on high dose corticosteroids with resolution in his symptoms.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Polyarteritis Nodosa, as a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium and small sized blood vessels, was first described by Kussmaul and Maier in 1866. The extent of testicular involvement seen in PAN is reported to be between 38% - 86%, however, clinical symptoms are noted in approximately 18% of the patients with systemic PAN . On rare occasions, systemic PAN presents with testicular involvement as the first sign . Rare case reports of isolated testicular PAN have been described . However, almost all of these patients had complete remission after surgical removal of the affected testicle with no requirement for either corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. In the case report by Warfield et al, the patient had a relapse of his underlying disease in the contralateral testicle and he required long term therapy with steroids to achieve remission .\n\n【6】The exact etiopathogenesis of PAN is unknown. Isolated PAN of the testes may occur concomitantly with other connective tissue disorders . Local immunostimulation following exposure to antigens or infectious agents may contribute to the development of isolated PAN .\n\n【7】The clinical presentation of testicular PAN is variable. It may be completely asymptomatic or present with features of pain, swelling and/or a local mass in some cases. This clinical presentation frequently leads to a misdiagnosis of acute orchitis, torsion, or neoplasm . Clinical presentation of isolated testicular PAN is similar to systemic PAN with testicular involvement. Laboratory data usually is non-specific. Histological analysis of biopsy specimens remains the mainstay of diagnosis. The histological analysis of testicular PAN is also similar in both forms, however, the existence of infarcts in the affected testis is seen more often with systemic PAN . Because it is unlikely to have systemic progression without evidence of underlying connective tissue disorder or cryoglobulinemia, a serological profile to include ANA, complement levels, ANCA, and Hepatitis panel was recommended within the pathology report and was negative .\n\n【8】Whether our patient had isolated PAN of the testis or systemic PAN with initial testicular involvement cannot be determined at this moment. He, however, would require close monitoring with special attention to the development of any other symptoms suggestive of a vasculitic process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "4e2450ad-86b4-46a7-9add-83b45d2c7bcf", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Abdominal pain is a biomedical problem facing numerous unspecific or idiopathic etiologies. Similar situations happen with human arterial hypertension. In many instances, these two medical conditions correlate . If these medical conditions are improperly treated, the outcome is often fatal. This complexity gets worse when unexpected and remote anomalies debut. Together, it makes more difficult to understand and bring under control not only altered nociception and disturbed blood pressure but associated unclassical chemosensory dysfunctions.\n\n【2】For the first time, a patient who had both local and remote adrenal mass-associated complaints that were refractory to conventional medications is reported. Importantly, a singular nanopathophysiological picture surfaces from the nanodisturbances associated to the radiologically identified mass here. In fact, the novel pathophysiological picture presented here allowed us to explain not only the sudden and pharmacologically resistant arterial hypertension, the abruptly altered abdominal nociception, and the unexpected olfactory loss that accompanied the somatic anomalies experienced by this patient but also the rather quick post-surgical recovery of the abovementioned triad of complains.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 33-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room (ER) of a university hospital located in Colombia, South America. The patient complained of abrupt abdominal pain 10 days before admission. The pain was described as excruciating cramping, that started in the epigastrium and radiated in a band-like form to the lower back and right paraspinal areas. Incidentally, the patient mentioned that she noticed loss of smell on the same day her abdominal pain started. No hematemesis was reported. The rest of her past medical history was unremarkable.\n\n【5】The patient arrived to the ER conscious, hydrated and afebrile. At that time her blood pressure was 220/140 mm Hg. Her heart rate was 141 beats/min. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min. Diarrhea and persistent emesis of food content occurred during the day of admission to the ER. After this episode, bilateral loss of smell was confirmed by the patient. Soft depressible abdomen with tenderness in the epigastrium and bilateral fist positive percussion was noted. The remaining physical evaluation was unremarkable.\n\n【6】A presumptive diagnosis of pancreatitis and hypertension emergency was done. Intravenous tramadol and dipyrone did not relieve pain. Hypertension did not resolve after a number of medications administered following international guidelines (e.g. labetalol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and amlodipine). Having at front a challenging case, a number of evaluations were done, as explained below.\n\n【7】Statistical analysis and ethics\n\n【8】T-test was used to analyze heart rate, blood pressure values, pain measures and smell scores obtained before and after surgery . P value was set at 0.05. Written and informed consent from the patient was obtained before doing all of the laboratory evaluations.\n\n【9】Laboratory investigations\n\n【10】Blood count, blood electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, clotting times, thyroid hormone levels, alanine aminotransferase, serum amylase and lipase were measured. Adrenal function tests (e.g. ACTH levels, cortisol rhythm and dexamethasone suppression tests) were not considered at admission. However, due to the uncontrolled and chaotic symptoms, a 24-h urinary metanephrines test was ordered 4 days after admission to the ER.\n\n【11】Alanine aminotransferase was slightly elevated (55.1 U/L). Mild hypokalemia (2.5 mEq/L) was found. Metanephrines (vanillylmandelic acid: 6.3 mg; homovanillic acid: 5 µg/mg of creatinine) as well as other laboratory tests was within normal limits.\n\n【12】Imaging studies\n\n【13】M-mode two-dimensional echocardiogram was done to rule out cardiac incidentaloma. Hepatobiliary ultrasonography was performed to rule out acute pancreatitis. Since the findings obtained with the mentioned studies were inconclusive, a dual-phase intravenous contrast computed tomography of the abdomen was performed. Infusion rate was kept constant during tomography at 3 - 5 mL/s .\n\n【14】Ecography showed a slight and unspecific increase of pancreas echogenicity. No dilation of intra- or extra-hepatobiliary tract was observed. The abdominal tomography showed a regular uniform mass. It had well-demarcated margins and homogeneously low density. No calcification, necrosis or cystic degeneration was observed. The size of the mass was of 4 cm diameter. It was located within the left adrenal gland . No hypervascularization was found on arterial-phase CTs. These findings were compatible with adrenocortical adenoma. No further images were needed .\n\n【15】Needle biopsy\n\n【16】Fine needle aspiration was made under CT. Direct smears were air dried for staining (Stat Lab, Lewisville, TX, USA), and assessed immediately by a cytopathologist. Immunostaining was performed at the time of cytologic diagnosis. Antibodies against pancytokeratin, A103, calretinin, inhibin, vimentin, synaptophysin (SNP), chromogranin A (CGA), S-100, and HMB-45 were used. The sources and the dilutions of these antibodies followed those published elsewhere .\n\n【17】No mitosis or anaplastic changes were present. Necrosis or calcifications were not seen. Lipid-laden cells arranged in nets were reported. Cortical adenoma was diagnosed. The mass showed widespread SNP and CGA reactivity . P450c21 (steroid 21-hydroxylase)  was not tested due to lack of technical facilities for testing this antibody . A wider discussion on the macroscopic and cytological features on background content, cellularity, architecture, cell shape, cytoplasmic and nuclear features as well as immunostaining will be done elsewhere.\n\n【18】Autonomic function\n\n【19】The heart rate in beats/min and the blood pressure in mm Hg were measured at rest, while lying down for 3 min , during three consecutive days each. For our analysis, we include the data obtained at 8:00 am.\n\n【20】Heart rate (140.3 ± 2.08 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (219.6 ± 2.51 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (123.3 ± 8.96 mm Hg) were abnormally increased before surgery. Both of these measurements returned to normal values immediately after resection of the mass  (heart rate: 83.6 ± 3.05 beats/min; systolic blood pressure: 123.3 ± 8.96 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure: 85.6 ± 3.5 mm Hg) remaining similar during the rest of hospitalization. The changes in values obtained after surgery were statistically different to the values obtained before mass removal (systolic blood pressure: T-test (t) = 25.0595; degree of freedom (df) = 2; P = 0.0016; diastolic blood pressure: t = 32.6000; df = 2; P = 0.0009; hear rate: t = 25.9248; df = 2; P = 0.0015).\n\n【21】Nociceptive evaluation\n\n【22】Self-report of pain was measured using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Verbal anchors at either end were used (0 mm = no pain; 100 mm = “as bad as can possibly be”). The administration of this tool is easy, and it is considered a sensitive and accurate measure of pain intensity. Advanced reading levels are not required by the subject to quantify the pain . Pain ratings were made at the same time when blood pressure and heart rate measurements were made.\n\n【23】The abdominal pain declared by the patient before the surgical procedure (VAS: 9.6 ± 0.47) went away post-surgical adrenal mass excision . The post-surgical values obtained with the VAS were much lower (1.33 ± 0.47), and different statistically compared to those obtained before surgery (t = 25.0000; df = 2; P = 0.0016).\n\n【24】Olfactory quantification\n\n【25】A validated version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) was administered. The UPSIT is comprised of four booklets, each containing 10 microencapsulated odorants with one odorant per page . A multiple-choice question with four response alternatives per item is located above each odorized strip and the subject must choose the alternative that best represents the perceived smell. The UPSIT was administered before and after surgery , two times each. The picture identification test (PIT), a test analogous to the UPSIT except that there are pictures rather than odors serving as test stimuli, was also administered after the application of the UPSIT . This test was applied along with the UPSIT to be certain that the obtained scores were not confounded by cognitive problems or the lack of knowledge of the concepts employed in the UPSIT.\n\n【26】The UPSIT scores measured before surgery (22.5 ± 0.5) were lower than the values obtained in a sample of healthy subjects, who had similar ethnic background to the patient reported here . The smell scores improved after surgery (33 ± 1). The improvement observed in olfactory function was significant (t = 21.0000; df = 1; P = 0.03). The PIT score was within normal limits before (39/40) and after (39/40) surgical procedure .\n\n【27】Surgical procedure\n\n【28】Removal of adrenal mass was done using laparoscopic adrenalectomy by lateral transabdominal approach . The tumor was found to be encapsulated, firm, lightly yellowed, and slightly lobulated. The mass had a 4 cm diameter, and weighed 87 g. The cut surface was yellowed ruling out lipofuscin pigment. No perioperatory complications were reported during 5 days of follow-up. However, notable improvements of autonomic, nociceptive, and olfactory function were found after mass removal. Patient was lost after being discharged from the hospital.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】We have presented a unique patient who had complaints in apparently unrelated morphologic and physiologic bodily regions. However, novel neurobiological commonalities allow us to definitively explain the medical ailments of our patient. More noteworthy, this case opens a new window to understand deregulation of nociception, blood pressure, smell function linked to novel SPN and CGA biomarkers.\n\n【31】In clinical grounds, the suspicion on the pancreatic involvement at patient’s admission was difficult to sustain due to the multisystemic involvement and the normal laboratory values. Pain surfacing as acute pancreatitis-like syndrome in the presence of chaotic clinical findings similar to those found in our case may be the first manifestation of a pheochromocytoma (PCC) , a catecholamine-secreting tumor, originating within the adrenal medullary chromaffin system . However, the levels of catecholamines in 24-h urine collection, specifically metanephrines , were normal in our case. The classical “six Ps”, namely pain (headache), pressure (arterial hypertension), perspiration, palpitation, pallor, and paroxysm, which are classical clinical biomarkers in PCC , were also lacked in our case. Moreover, the “rule of 10s” also reported in PCC, namely, 10% extra-adrenal, 10% bilateral, 10% malignant and 10% familial, did not apply to our patient either . Since no hypervascularization was found on arterial-phase CTs, the diagnosis of PCC was completely abandoned. Lastly, the lack of thyroid and parathyroid involvement made multiple endocrine neoplasia diagnosis unlikely as well  .\n\n【32】Macroscopically speaking, a “mass effect” diagnosis from the adrenal medulla could simplistically be done to explain the autonomic dysfunction presented by our patient. It is widely known that when an adrenal mass appears, it induces alterations elsewhere in the adrenal gland, being the adrenal medulla secondarily; as a result, related symptoms appear. However, the normal metanephrine values found in our case indicated that the adrenal medulla of our patient was not compromised. A conclusive way for identifying macroscopic abnormalities of the adrenal gland is to perform contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the abdomen . The radiological imaging clearly showed a large adrenal mass , which fulfilled the radiological and pathological criteria of similar masses classified as adenoma. Noteworthy, the adrenal mass found in this case was larger in diameter compared to frequently discovered adrenocortical adenomas, usually measuring less than 3 cm . Although the mass may be incriminated as responsible for the chaotic clinical picture of our patient, a more elaborate explanation could be worked out at this time.\n\n【33】Mixed cortical adenomas, the benign tumors most frequently found in the adrenal cortices, are often associated with unclear clinical presentations, similar to the signs and symptoms reported here . It has to be remarked that the mentioned adenomas often mimic PCC  . Noteworthy, tumor markers such as SNP and CGA, found in our patient, have also been reported in mixed cortical adenomas . However, associations between these nanobiomarkers, pain, arterial hypertension and smell dysfunction had never been reported.\n\n【34】SNP is a glycoprotein found in small and medium diameter neurons and neuroendocrine cells. It is an essential component of synaptic vesicles  that play a key role in synaptic transmission . This protein mediates inflammatory pain in rats, and is critical in pain hypersensitization . Such nociceptive regulation is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 acting on presynaptic SNP in the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons that modulates abdominal nociception . Noteworthy, increased levels of SNP in spinal cord neurons correlated with nociception measures, which lowered when this protein was inhibited . Altered SNP found in the ileum of guinea pigs  is downregulated by alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor .\n\n【35】Germane to acetylcholine receptors involvement, alpha-3 nicotinic receptor , regulates CGA, a protein stored and co-released with catecholamines . CGA potentiated the visceromotor response to the nociceptive action of capsaicin which modulates C-fiber activity . These findings were due to the action of CGA on spinal neuronal transmission. In rats, CGA was significantly increased in saliva of rats exposed to chronic pain . Humans diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome also showed significant higher levels of CGA measured in saliva . When neuroendocrine neoplasm like the one reported here appears, secretion of autocrine growth factors through voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channels  is implicated in the aberrant spinal processing of nociception mediated by nanoproteins such as CGA. To remark, CGA-associated function and dysfunction is mediated at the brainstem level, mainly over a region that encircles the nucleus of the tractus solitarius , which is strongly synaptophysin reactive , and it is heavily involved in autonomic regulation under normal conditions . These mechanisms are paradoxically altered under pathological and stressful situations .\n\n【36】The aforementioned micro-pathophysiological mechanisms involved in autonomic function and nociception processes follow neural pathways other than those modulated by the classical medications used to treat these anomalies . These facts would explain why the symptoms of our patient were resistant to the classical medications administered as well as why they went away only when the adrenal tumor was removed. These statements are further supported by descriptions done elsewhere on patient who was initially misdiagnosed as having ependymoma that resulted to be a paraganglioma, after the histological results of the mass removed were rechecked . Interestingly, this tumor was positive for SNP and CGA . Also, this patient had clinical symptoms very similar to those found in our patient, including chaotic arterial hypertension and altered nociception resistant to classical medications . Noteworthy, the symptoms exhibited by the patient reported by Hong et al  normalized “immediately after resection of the tumor”. Smell function was not reported in this patient, nor has been studied in any other patient having dysfunctional any of the molecular biomarkers aforementioned.\n\n【37】In light of the discussed, we found that smell function is relevant in our patient for a number of reasons. First, SNP and CGA are found in olfactory pathways of healthy animals and humans . Second, olfaction is heavily regulated by acetylcholine neural transmission, including the alpha 3 and alpha 7 subunits, which modulate SNP and CGA function . Third, should the nanocholinergic machinery become altered, then olfactory disorders appear . Fourth, unquantified smell dysfunction has been reported from patients harboring synaptophysin and CGA dysfunction associated nasal dysfunction . Fifth, olfactory disorders have been detected by patients suffering neural disorders-associated cholinergic neurotransmission days before their actual disease surfaced . Sixth, quick and impressive plastic changes of olfactory function following clinical improvement similar to the trend reported here have been found in disorders associated nanocholinergic dysfunction . Seventh, the smell function in our patient was impaired before mass removal, regaining the olfactory function after surgical procedure, all of which was reflected in the UPSIT scores. Of note, PIT scores were within the normal range, reflecting a good understanding of the cognitive elements of the UPSIT.\n\n【38】Altogether, these findings support that olfactory dysfunction may well be a novel, “unclassical” and early biomarker for “classical” disorders such as pain and hypertension originated from aberrant function of nanomolecules such as SNP and CGA located in the adrenal gland, or elsewhere in the body. Lastly, a novel way to describe findings found in a single patient is presented that may re-orient current practices of reporting biomedical case reports.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

CML accounts for about 15% of adult leukemia cases with slight predominance observed in men . The median age at presentation is about 50 years of age. The disease manifests in three phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. Presentation of biphasic transition of chronic leukemia directly to blast crisis is seen in aggressive disease courses and is associated with poorer response to treatment and worst outcomes. We present to you a case of a 41-year-old lady with CML who presented with diffuse adenopathy and was found to have biphenotypic presentation of leukemia.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A pleasant 41-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized body aches, fever, night sweats, and axillary adenopathy. The patient has known history of CML diagnosed 6 years prior to presentation and was initiated on imatinib treatment with good initial response to treatment but poor compliance thereafter. She was doing well until a week prior to presentation, when she developed fatigue and noticed swelling in her left axillary region. At the time of presentation, patient had stable vital signs. Physical examination was only remarkable for diffuse adenopathy. Remainder of the physical examination including cardiac and pulmonary systems was unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed elevated white blood cell count of 30.4 g/dL with lymphocytic predominance (48.8%). Pathologic review of peripheral smear was remarkable for leukocytosis with predominance of blasts. Bone marrow aspirate demonstrated profound hypercellularity with lymphoblasts > 70% consistent with lymphoid blastic phase. Immunohistochemical markers were positive for CD34, CD79a, PAX5 and TdT. Axillary lymph node biopsy demonstrated morphologic, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical findings consistent with CD34-positive blasts which were weakly positive for myeloperoxidase and CD7 and negative for PAX5 expression consistent with myeloblasts . Chromosomal analysis revealed presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion, without mutation in the kinase domain, with additional expressions of MYC gene and notable trisomy of chromosome 8 and MLL gene rearrangement. Given the history, patient’s presentation and pathology findings, the patient was determined to have CML with acute biphenotypic blast crisis transformation with extramedullary involvement. Salvage therapy was initiated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD <sup>+ </sup> ) imatinib regimen and intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. First cycle noted improvement in counts with acute decline from 107,000/µL to 60,000/µL. Evaluation for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant was initiated. A second cycle of the above regimen did not show signs of cytological response. The patient subsequently developed a subdural hemorrhage in the context of thrombocytopenia and expired during the course of the week.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】CML is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of mature and maturating granulocytes. Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor . The pathogenesis of the disease is associated with the fusion of two genes: BCR on chromosome 22 and ABL1 on chromosome 9. This translocation, t(9; 22)(q34; q11), produces an abnormal chromosome 22 referred to as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which harbors the fusion gene, BCR-ABL1. The dysregulated, continuously activated tyrosine kinase protein product of this chromosome is implicated in the pathogenesis of symptoms .\n\n【6】CML has a triphasic clinical course: a chronic phase, which is present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 85% of patients; an accelerated phase, in which neutrophil differentiation becomes progressively impaired and leukocyte counts are more difficult to control with treatment; and blast crisis, a condition resembling acute leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts proliferate in an uncontrolled manner . The usual presentation is in the chronic phase. Blast crisis usually occurs in bone marrow; about 10-16% cases present with extramedullary involvement at the time of disease transformation from chronic phase. Common extramedullary sites include lymph nodes, bones, skin, testis, and nervous system. Presence of disease in such sites is associated with a significantly poorer response to therapy and survival .\n\n【7】Acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL) is rare and is mostly seen in the pediatric population . The incidence of ABL in adults ranges from 1% to 20% of acute leukemias . There are no set diagnostic criteria for ABL. The European Group for Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL) proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for ABL .\n\n【8】Studies of ABL have suggested that these leukemias may arise by malignant transformation of a pluripotent stem cell. The finding of a significantly greater percentage of biphenotypic cases with CD34 <sup>+ </sup> (a marker of immature blast cells) expression compared to non-biphenotypic cases, as seen in our patient, supports the concept that this transformation process occurs at a step close to the hematopoietic progenitor cell . Furthermore, the t(q34;q11) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality described in ABL .\n\n【9】The development of ABL, as was the case here, is believed to be derived from marrow stem cells which have the capacity to express antigens from more than one cell line. These cells have notable immunohistochemical fingerprint with notable expression of CD79a, which serves as transmembrane signal modulator early during the course of B-cell differentiation. Other common associations for the development of ABL include the increased expression of MLL gene product (myeloid/lymphoid leukemia) which plays a key role in the establishment of progenitor cells during hematopoiesis. The MLL gene product itself has two unique characteristics in that the N-terminal of MLL protein product forms a fusion protein with the C-terminal of over 40 different partners, including itself, and MLL rearrangements are found in both ALL and AML, whereas most other translocations are lineage specific thus allowing for dual lineage proliferation and development of leukemic symptoms seen in both AML and ALL . Such findings were seen in our patient who presented with profound anemia and thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, fever and night sweats as well as invasion of extramedullary tissue .\n\n【10】Other factors implicated in the pathogenesis of ABL are compliance to therapy. The Adherence Assessment with Glivec: Indicators and Outcomes (ADAGIO) study has shown that non-adherence to imatinib therapy is shown to have higher correlation with poorer outcomes, likely secondary to accumulation of somatic mutation leading to resistance and thus subsequent transformation from a chronic state to an accelerated phase and subsequently a terminal blast crisis . As seen with this patient, interruption of imatinib treatment contributed to the development of far more aggressive disease course characterized by biphenotypic expression and extramedullary involvement .\n\n【11】Treatment of ABL is challenging and the optimal therapy for this sub-type of leukemia remains unclear. A case series by Xu et al showed that the relapse rate in ABL patients was significantly higher than that in AML patients, while the complete remission (CR) rate after relapse was lower than that in AML patients. Also observed was low CR rate after relapse in ABL patients when compared with ALL patients . Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment for ABL patients, regardless of the existence of any known prognostic factors, with the exception of non-remission (NR) as long as the disease is sufficiently controlled until HSCT .\n\n【12】Management of CML with acute transformation to ABL with blast crisis is a widely debated topic in the hematology/oncology realm as no clear regimen has been shown to have definitive benefit in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Selection of ALL specific versus AML specific protocol for treatment has yet to be explored. Studies are currently being conducted to select the best course regimen with focus on HSCT as treatment modality; however, the aggressive nature of the disease challenges designs of such study protocols .\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】The prognosis of ABL patients is poor when compared with de novo acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ABL patients showed a much higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression, complex abnormal karyotype, extramedullary infiltration, relapse, and resistance to therapy after relapse. Further studies are needed to determine the prognostic factors of ABL and treatment modalities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Many Cushing’s disease (CD) patients have peroxisome proliferator activator receptor - gamma (PPAR-γ) in their adenomas. Ambrosi et al  reported that some patients with CD respond to the insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, with a reduction in both urinary free cortisol and plasma ACTH. Suri and Weiss  reported, in a small series, that pioglitazone monotherapy was ineffective in ameliorating Cushing’s disease. These cases we present are the first report of amelioration of ADH with metformin either as monotherapy or in combination with pioglitazone. Our findings, if corroborated in larger, randomized controlled trials, could explain why the reported prevalence of subclinical hypercortisolism (SH) in Type 2 diabetics has recently declined and could offer an alternative medical treatment for some ADH patients. If expanded to larger studies, our findings may also explain why SH is more commonly encountered in in-patient series (in whom insulin sensitizers are typically held on hospital admission) than in ambulatory series in which these agents are generally continued. Our findings may also help to explain why the preponderance of SH reported in Type 2 diabetics is of autonomous adrenal rather than ACTH dependent origin.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We reviewed the records of three women (aged 40, 50, and 67 years) from our endocrine clinic who were diagnosed with ADH. Our patients had clinical features of type 2 DM, as well as facial mooning, plethora, hirsutism, acanthosis, hypertension, menstrual irregularity, post-menopausal osteoporosis, depression, and abdominal striae. Not every patient had all of these features.\n\n【4】ADH was documented in all 3 patients by a combination of an elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), a non-suppressed plasma ACTH, a positive low dose dexamethasone suppression test, a normal high dose dexamethasone test, and in one case, pituitary imaging consistent with adenoma. Plasma ACTH was measured by chemiluminesence, urinary free cortisol (UFC) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and serum cortisol by chemiluminesence. Adequacy of 24 hour urine collection was assessed by creatinine and volume. Pituitary imaging was by gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Patient 3 had a prominently sized pituitary but no well defined adenoma. Patient 2 had a 3 mm adenoma as observed on the MRI.\n\n【5】Prior to investigation, differential diagnosis included: 1) polycystic ovarian syndrome; 2) post-menopausal ovarian hyperandrogenism (hyperthecosis); 3) non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia; and 4) glucocorticoid resistance syndrome.\n\n【6】Each of the patients gave their informed consent for the use of insulin sensitizers (IS), after discussing the potential risks and benefits of such treatment as well as alternative treatment as well as for the follow-up laboratory determinations and imaging. In the 2 patients who are diabetic, it was explained that insulin sensitizers were part of standard treatment for Type 2 diabetes, but not for ADH. It was explained to the second and third patients that the first patient had experienced biochemical and clinical improvement with insulin sensitizers and we hoped to see if they would realize similar benefits.\n\n【7】If treatment was initiated with metformin, it was started at 500 mg/day and titrated at each visit until both UFC and glucose were controlled, a total daily dose of 2,000 mg/day was reached, or the maximum tolerated daily dose was reached. In one patient UFC and glucose control had not been achieved, hence, pioglitazone starting at 15 mg/day was added. Patient 1 was on metformin 500 mg bid. Patient 2 was on metformin 1,000 mg bid and pioglitazone 15 mg daily. Patient 3 was on metformin 1,000 mg bid. All patients tolerated their treatments well.\n\n【8】Baseline clinical characteristics of patients along with the on-therapy observations are listed in Table 1 . All patients initially had elevated UFC levels and elevated or inappropriately non-suppressed plasma ACTH. After treatment with insulin sensitizers, all patients decreased their UFC levels and their Plasma ACTH levels . In patient 1 UFC fell from 193.2 to 19.6 µg/day - an 89.9 % decrease. Plasma ACTH fell from 47 to 40 pg/mL - a 14.9 % decrease from baseline. Patient 2’s UFC fell from 110 to 2.8 µg/day - a 97.5 % decrease. Her plasma ACTH fell from 35 to 28 pg/mL - a 20 % decrease. Patient 3’s UFC fell from 376.4 to 7.8 µg/day - a 97.9 % decrease. Plasma ACTH went from 34 to 27 pg/mL - a 20.6 % decrease. Also observed in patient 3 was a negative low dose dexamethasone suppression test on insulin sensitizers.\n\n【9】No adverse effects on body weight, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, or fluid retention were observed as a result of the IS therapy. None of the patients experienced symptoms of adrenal insufficiency on treatment, despite quite low UFC. On insulin sensitizer treatment our patients also experienced amelioration of facial mooning, plethora, striae, hirsutism, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.\n\n【10】In general, the on-therapy plasma ACTH and UFC were checked on the following clinic visit (2 - 3 months). Effects of the insulin sensitizers were observable as early as 2 months after treatment initiation in 1 patient and approximately 8 - 12 months after treatment initiation in 2 patients. As of November, 2012 all 3 patients continue to have normal UFC and plasma ACTH levels.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Although it has been previously reported that patients with CD have PPAR-γ in their adenomas , a recent study found that the anti-proliferative effect of the glitazones on anterior pituitary cells is independent of the PPAR-γ . The exact mechanism by which the glitazones may reduce the plasma level of ACTH and the UFC is not completely understood. It has been proposed that PPAR-γ agonist binding to its nuclear receptor inhibits the synthesis and secretion of ACTH in the adenoma, however, this does not adequately explain why rosiglitazone monotherapy is effective in some patients, while pioglitazone monotherapy is not ; nor does it explain why, in patients who do respond to rosiglitazone monotherapy, the reduction in UFC is of a greater magnitude than the reduction in plasma ACTH. It also does not explain why some patients who have PPAR-γ positive adenomas have no clinical/biochemical response to rosiglitazone monotherapy. PPAR-γ has also been reported to be present in the adrenal cortex , however, this does not explain the response to metformin monotherapy seen in some of our patients or the enhanced response to the glitazones seen in others with the addition of metformin.\n\n【13】While it is well known that ADH is an important cause of insulin resistance, our data suggest that the converse may be true in some patients-that insulin resistance may be a cause as well as a result of ADH. There appears to be considerable cross-talk between insulin and the adrenal cortex. We have reported other adrenal disorders which are ameliorated with either metformin or glitazones , including non-classical adrenal hyperplasia, drug-induced adrenal hyperandrogenism, primary hyperaldosteronism, and classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Insulin resistance has been reported in both non-classical and classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency . Non-classical aldosterone synthase deficiency is ameliorated by exercise and weight loss which improve insulin sensitivity, while non-classical 11-hydroxylase deficiency may be ameliorated by Roux-en-y gastric bypass, which is also an insulin sensitizing treatment .\n\n【14】Possible mechanisms of action for metformin in the treatment of ADH may be extrapolated from the observed anti-neoplastic, anti-hyperplastic effects of this drug reported by Buzzai et al  and reviewed recently by Ben Sahra et al . It has been shown that metformin selectively inhibits p53-deficient tumor cell growth in isogenic HCT 116 colon cancer cell line xenografts, an action that is associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Metformin suppressed mitochondrial electron transport, which was compensated for by an increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis in p53 replete, but not in p53-null tumor cells.\n\n【15】Epidemiologic studies show a decreased cancer incidence in metformin-treated patients. Metformin decreases insulin resistance, thereby indirectly reducing serum insulin concentration, which should be beneficial because insulin promotes the growth of many types of cancer cells, both directly by binding to the IGF-1 receptor and indirectly by decreasing the concentration of IGF-binding protein, thus increasing serum free IGF-1. Metformin activates the AMPK pathway, a major sensor of the energy status of cells, which, in turn downregulates the mTOR pathway, which has been implicated in the control of protein synthesis and cellular proliferation and which is activated by mitogen-responsive pathways, for example, RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT. Metformin has also been shown to decrease the cross-talk between insulin and the G-protein coupled receptor which serves as a receptor for a number of growth factors, including IGF-2, EGF-1, and PDGF. Since ADH involves cellular proliferation, both at the level of the pituitary, resulting in corticotroph adenoma or hyperplasia, as well as in the adrenal cortex, resulting in ACTH-dependent hyperplasia, it is plausible that metformin may inhibit cellular proliferation at both sites.\n\n【16】Since metformin has its most dramatic effect on p53 null tumor cells it is worth noting that 50% of corticotroph adenomas have been reported to harbour p53 mutations .\n\n【17】Recently there has been some controversy concerning the prevalence of SH in patients with Type 2 DM . The older reports tend to report a higher prevalence of SH in Type 2 DM cohorts. Terzolo et al astutely point out that earlier series disproportionately screened hospital in-patients-a sicker, more stressed population than the routine visit ambulatory Type 2 DM patients that they screened. Severely stressed patients tend to have more transient disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis than ambulatory patients . Unlike the series reported by Mullan et al  they appropriately excluded patients taking thiazolidinediones, because, as they noted, this class of drugs suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. When patients are admitted to the hospital, not only are they sicker and more stressed, but because of that fact, oral agents such as metformin and thiazolidinediones are usually held and replaced with insulin, potentially unmasking SH which was actually being treated with the insulin sensitizers. Earlier studies on the prevalence of SH in Type 2 DM patients are likely to have included a lower percentage of patients on insulin sensitizers, even in ambulatory patients, simply because they were not yet in such general use. Terzolo et al also note that the preponderance of SH patients in their series and in other series are those with autonomous adrenal disease (adenoma or nodular hyperplasia), rather than ADH. It is tempting to speculate that insulin sensitizer treatment may select out those patients with autonomous adrenal disease, while actually treating and thereby masking, a number of patients with ADH, much like antibiotics may select out bacterial strains resistant to the antibiotic. Our findings suggest that if screening for CD is done in the Type 2 DM-pre-diabetic population it should be accomplished before initiating treatment with insulin sensitizers.\n\n【18】Limitations of this paper include: small patient number, absence of male patients, and relatively short period of follow-up. Strengths of this study include: consistent direction of response of UFC and plasma ACTH to insulin sensitizer therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "90c28161-d13b-40ff-966b-9da911010f51", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a condition that is fairly common, potentially severe, but occasionally difficult to diagnose, as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. By some estimates, DILI may account for 10-50% of all cases of acute hepatitis and nearly 25% of cases of fulminant hepatic failure . When acetaminophen overdose is excluded, DILI is reported to be the cause of 7-15% cases of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe . DILI can be classified as intrinsic or idiosyncratic. In intrinsic DILI, drug hepatotoxicity is predictable, dose-related, and occurs within hours to days after ingestion. In idiosyncratic DILI, the injury is unpredictable, rare, and can occur even weeks after exposure. While idiosyncratic DILI may occur infrequently for a given drug, it is still a significant concern, particularly in drug development. Hepatotoxicity was the basis for 32% of drug withdrawals from the USA between 1975 and 2007 . The diagnosis of DILI requires a clear history of drug ingestion and exclusion of other potential causes of liver injury. There has long been a link between the use of androgenic anabolic steroids and liver injury . However, there are only a few reports of DILI related to the use of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), and only one reported secondary to enobosarm, a SARM. We present a case of a patient who developed DILI after using an over-the-counter muscle-building supplement that contained enobosarm. In this case presentation, we aim to present the limited but growing evidence of the liver toxicity of SARMs that can be found in many over-the-counter muscle-building supplements.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 31-year-old man presented to our primary care office with itching and dark-colored urine for 1 week. He had no personal or family history of liver disease. He reported consuming one alcoholic drink, either one beer or 2 oz of liquor, on average per week. He reported no sick contacts, no current or previous illicit drug use, no unprotected sexual intercourse, and no recent travel. The patient denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers or chills. He had never experienced similar symptoms before. The patient reported that 3 weeks prior to the presentation, he had started taking an over-the-counter muscle-building supplement that contained the main ingredient enobosarm, a SARM. There were no other ingredients in the supplement. After taking the supplement for 2 weeks, he developed itching throughout his body and dark-colored urine. He did not have a rash or yellowing discoloration of his skin or eyes .\n\n【5】On physical exam, the patient appeared healthy without distress. His vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 118/76 mm Hg, pulse of 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oral temperature of 98 °F, and room air SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 98%. His body mass index (BMI) was 33.86 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . The abdominal exam revealed no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, no tenderness, and no distention. There was no jaundice or scleral icterus. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.\n\n【6】Diagnostic tests at the patient’s initial presentation were notable for elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 346 U/L, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 110 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 123 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL. The serum albumin was 4.9 g/dL and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.0, both within normal limits. The rest of his comprehensive metabolic panel, and complete blood count showed no abnormality.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】The differential diagnosis of our patient’s initial presentation included DILI, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hereditary hemochromatosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson’s disease, biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy, choledocholithiasis, Mirizzi syndrome, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and acute hepatitis A virus infection.\n\n【9】Hepatitis A and C virus antibody tests were negative. Hepatitis B virus surface antibody was positive while hepatitis B surface antigen, core antibody and e-antigen were negative, consistent with prior vaccination. His baseline liver tests conducted 3 years prior as part of routine blood tests were all within normal limits. Toxicology screening tests were negative. A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound with venous Doppler demonstrated an enlarged fatty liver, with a length of 199 mm at the mid-clavicular line. There was normal venous flow and there were no discrete lesions, gallstones, or bile duct dilation.\n\n【10】The other results were notable for normal serum iron level, serum ferritin level of 447 ng/mL, negative anti-smooth muscle antibody, negative anti-mitochondrial antibody, normal ceruloplasmin level, negative anti-nuclear antibody, negative human homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) gene testing, and normal gamma-glutamyl transferase.\n\n【11】We conducted a detailed analysis of the differential diagnosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was a possibility in this patient given a BMI of 33 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , though it is typically asymptomatic and would not cause this degree of elevation in liver enzymes. Other, less common conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and Wilson’s disease were excluded on the basis of negative laboratory testing. While the ferritin was slightly elevated at 447 ng/mL, the transferrin saturation was 21%. In men with hereditary hemochromatosis, the transferrin saturation is typically greater than 45%. This suggests that ferritin was elevated as an acute phase reactant rather than due to iron overload. This was also supported by a negative HFE gene testing. Primary biliary cirrhosis was less likely due to the alkaline phosphatase level being less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Primary sclerosing cholangitis was also thought to be less likely due to the hepatocellular pattern of liver injury, with an R factor of 7.5. Choledocholithiasis and Mirizzi syndrome could cause elevations in aminotransferases, but would typically present with a right upper quadrant pain in addition to symptoms and laboratory findings of cholestasis. Moreover, these diagnoses were ruled out due to negative ultrasonographic findings. Biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy was thought to be less likely in an otherwise healthy young man and there was more of a hepatocellular injury pattern rather than cholestasis. Acute biliary obstruction was also ruled out based on the ultrasonographic findings. Budd-Chiari syndrome was also less likely given the lack of abdominal pain in the patient’s presentation, and a normal flow through the hepatic vein on the ultrasonography. An acute viral hepatitis was also ruled out based on the negative serological test results. We finalized the diagnosis as DILI secondary to enobosarm ingestion, given the appearance of the patient’s symptoms shortly after ingestion of the over-the-counter muscle-building supplement which contained enobosarm as the main ingredient.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】The muscle-building supplement containing enobosarm was discontinued. A short course of cyproheptadine was prescribed to alleviate itching which offered symptomatic improvement. The patient was advised to avoid consumption of alcohol-containing beverages and over-the-counter supplements.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】The patient was followed up in the office weekly for 2 weeks followed by monthly for 3 months, and subsequently at 6 - 12 months. Both the itching and dark-colored urine resolved in the weeks following the patient’s discontinuation of enobosarm supplement use. A repeat laboratory testing was obtained 3 days after the initial presentation. Aminotransferases showed improvement, with ALT 184 U/L, AST 36 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 101 U/L, and total bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL. Another follow-up liver profile after 7 days showed further improvement, with ALT 90 U/L, AST 24 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 95 U/L, and total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL. A liver biopsy was initially planned, however due to the rapid improvement of his symptoms after cessation of enobosarm and the favorable trend of the follow-up diagnostic studies, the patient and the care team decided not to pursue the liver biopsy. A follow-up liver profile 10 months later showed normalization of the ALT and AST at 25 U/L and 18 U/L, respectively .\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Diagnosis of DILI can be challenging, as it requires exclusion of other causes of liver disease, as well as a clear history of drug exposure. There should also be improvement in liver injury following cessation of the drug, and recurrence of injury with repeat challenge with the drug, though this is generally not recommended. There are numerous drugs and chemicals either proven or implicated as causes of liver injury. Many herbal and dietary supplements contain chemical compounds that are included on that list. Androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) are among the compounds that are known to cause a range of liver injuries, from transient transaminase elevations, to acute “bland cholestasis”, to peliosis hepatis. Long-term use of AAS has also been linked to the development of hepatic tumors . SARMs, on the other hand, are compounds that bind to androgen receptors, akin to the action of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs) on estrogen receptors.\n\n【18】Enobosarm, also known as Ostarine or MK-2866, was first discovered in the 1990s, and has been studied for use in treatment of cachexia, osteoporosis, breast and prostate cancers, and stress urinary incontinence . In animal studies, enobosarm increased muscle mass and bone density while having limited effects on other androgen-responsive tissues including the prostate and seminal vesicles. The animal studies also found that the prostate size was reduced in male rats at doses that increased muscle mass. In a phase I study in 48 healthy 18- to 45-year-old males and 23 elderly males with truncal obesity, Dalton and associates administered enobosarm for 14 days and reported increased lean body mass and favorable tolerability profile without clinically apparent adverse effects . Interestingly, in the phase II trial of enobosarm for treatment of cachexia, increases in ALT were noted in 20.8% of the individuals taking the highest and most effective study dose of 3 mg . In 2017, the United State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to several supplement manufacturers for including SARMs in products marketed and labeled as dietary supplements. The warning not only noted the potential for liver toxicity, but it also suggested an increased risk of heart attack and stroke .\n\n【19】There are only a few published case reports of SARMs being implicated as the causes of liver injury. Flores et al published a case series of two patients who developed liver injury after taking SARMs. In the first of those cases, an otherwise healthy 24-year-old patient consumed the gym product Ligandrol for 9 weeks. He also had an additional history of binge-consumption of alcohol. The patient had similar elevations in ALT and AST as observed in our patient, along with elevation of total bilirubin . However, our patient’s bilirubin levels were in the normal range, and he consumed alcohol socially and occasionally. In the second case, a 49-year-old man consumed RAD-140 for 4 weeks, 4 months prior to presentation. He was also on venlafaxine for 11 months. He had a mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic liver injury, and was treated with ursodiol and cholestyramine after cessation of venlafaxine and RAD-140. Both patients’ liver enzymes normalized in the subsequent months . Lastly, there is one recently published report of a patient developing liver injury following enobosarm use. In that report, the patient had been using a supplement containing enobosarm for 2 months. Interestingly, analysis of the liver tests revealed an R factor of 0.8, indicating a predominant cholestatic liver injury. He also underwent a liver biopsy, with histopathologic findings of hepatic ductular reaction with minimal inflammation and significant cholestasis. The patient in that case had a similar improvement in liver injury over several months after he stopped taking the supplement . The discrepancy between the types of liver injury observed in that case and the one presented here may be due to the duration or quantity of enobosarm use.\n\n【20】A liver biopsy in the case of our patient could have helped to define the mechanism of liver injury caused with enobosarm either by demonstrating a similar histopathology, or by revealing an alternative pattern of damage. However, a biopsy would have been invasive and would not have been likely to change the diagnosis or management in this case, given the improvements in the patient’s liver enzymes. For these reasons as well as the patient’s preference, a liver biopsy was not pursued. Additionally, our patient’s causality assessment scores by Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method was 7, which falls into the category of “probable” (score 6 - 8) . When comparing RUCAM to other causality assessment instruments, the other terminology that corresponds with “RUCAM probable” is documented as “highly probable” . Further analysis of the study by Dalton and associates, in which they recruited 120 healthy elderly men (aged greater than 60 years) and postmenopausal women and conducted a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial to evaluate the role of enobosarm in lean body mass and physical function, revealed noteworthy observations . Although the authors concluded a dose-dependent improvement in total lean body mass and physical function, and found similar adverse effects between the intervention group and the placebo group, nevertheless one subject in the intervention group discontinued the trial due to rise in a four times upper limit of normal rise in the ALT. Additionally, there were seven other subjects in the intervention group who demonstrated smaller rise in the ALT, as well. The effects of 1.0 or 3.0 mg of enobosarm on lean body mass have also been studied in another randomized, controlled phase II trial; however, the study did not report any particular liver-related adverse events .\n\n【21】Although the exact mechanism of liver injury due to enobosarm is unclear, several possible mechanisms have been suggested based on the observations made in the DILI associated with other SARMs. Idiosyncrasy happens to play a major role in the majority of the cases of DILI due to other SARMs. The rarity of reported cases of DILI secondary to enobosarm, a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the liver tissue in the few reported cases of other SARMs, and lack of association between the length of use and the severity of the liver injury make the idiosyncratic immune response as the most plausible mechanism of liver injury. The biochemical response in the form of mixed-type hepatocellular-cholestatic injury and the reported histological findings in the few reported cases with other SARMs indicate combined targeting of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes by the immune response, which can be explained by the idiosyncratic immune response .\n\n【22】We conclude that our patient suffered a DILI caused by the muscle-building supplement containing enobosarm. The laboratory findings on presentation suggested a hepatocellular pattern with predominant transaminase elevation. Our case report highlights the need for further study of the liver damage caused by SARMs in light of their increasing popularity and potential for misuse as body-building products.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】SARMs, such as enobosarm, are an emerging class of compounds that have the potential for both therapeutic and recreational use, but appear to carry a risk of liver injury.\n\n【25】Patients presenting with abnormal liver enzymes should be asked about their use of supplements, particularly those patients involved in weight-lifting and muscle or body building.\n\n【26】Further research is needed to characterize the effects of enobosarm on the liver.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They may develop at any age but are most common in younger to middle aged adults but unclear gender predisposition . They are relatively slow growing masses with a strong predilection for sensory nerves. Schwannoma are mostly benign; however, less than 1% can underdevelop in a malignancy called neurofibrosarcoma.\n\n【2】There are 25-50% of schwannomas occurring in the head and neck area  and only 1% occurring intraorally. Though the majority of schwannomas are idiopathic, trauma is suggested as a factor in papers written by Wilkinson et al  and Brody et al  in vertebral fracture and thyroidectomy, respectively. Schwannomas may also be associated with certain syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis in certain cases .\n\n【3】Diagnosis is centered on biopsy with microscopic features of solitary, well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesions confined to the subcutis. Characteristic presences include Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Antoni A is composed of spindle-shaped Schwann cells in an interlacing fascicle with Antoni B consisting of loose meshwork of gelatinous and microcytic tissue with large, irregular spaced, thick-walled vessels. Mitotic features may also be present. S100 protein is strongly expressed by most cells of schwannoma along with vimentin and myelin.\n\n【4】MRIs are the first-line imaging of choice as they have fairly predictable signal characteristics: T1 is either isointense or hypointense, T1 C+ (Gd) intense enhancement, T2 heterogeneously hyperintense (Antoni A: low; Antoni B: high), T2\\: hemosiderin present in larger tumors, along with useful signs such as split-fat, target and fascicular sign.\n\n【5】We present and report a rare case of a schwannoma presenting on the upper lip.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 29-year-old male professional footballer presented to our OMFS outpatient clinic after being referred by his GP due to a persistent swelling on his upper lip.\n\n【8】The patient presented with a swelling on the upper lip, which had been present for over 2 years. He associated this with an accidental elbowed to the face in a football match by an opponent. The swelling had been asymptomatic since but in the past 3 months, the patient noticed an increase in size of lesion, which was of concern to the patient. He is fit and well individual with no underlying medical condition and topical antibiotic cream for his acne was noted.\n\n【9】On examination, a 3 cm blueish-tinge, firm mobile but well-circumscribed swelling was noted on right side of the upper lip midline with a submucosal component as well . Clinical photography and an incisional biopsy were arranged for the patient.\n\n【10】The incisional biopsy was completed under local anesthetic by linear incision into the labial mucosa and blunt dissection submucosal towards the swelling. The lesion was observed to be solid, white in color and non-cystic. A specimen was sent to our pathology laboratory and biopsy site was closed with 4.0 vicryl rapide.\n\n【11】Two weeks later, the pathology result revealed a “well-circumscribed subcutis with intersected bundles of monomorphic spindle cell with focal palisading”, i.e. schwannoma. The patient was informed of the pathology result with a proposed plan of excisional biopsy of the lesion under general anesthetic.\n\n【12】The excisional biopsy was completed via an intraoral approach with access to the lesion achieved by blunt dissection following elliptical mucosal incision along previous biopsy site . The lesion was delivered whole with overlying mucosal tissue and measured 3 × 2.5 × 1.7 cm . The surgical site was closed in levels and the patient made an uneventful full recovery. The second biopsy result confirmed the previous diagnosis of schwannoma.\n\n【13】At 6-week follow-up, the patient had experienced mild hyperexcitability of sensory nerves characterized by an “itch” feeling and slight unevenness of the upper lip on smile. However, these issues have been completely resolved at 6 months review.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】We hypothesize that a previous impact injury to the upper lip as result of his profession may be the cause of his development of this tumor.\n\n【16】This case report represents a rare condition in itself but we also found less than 20 cases of schwannomas occurring on the lip that has been reported in the English literature.\n\n【17】Less than 1% of schwannomas occur intraorally and they develop 45-52% on the tongue, 13% on the cheek, 20% on buccal/vestibular mucosa and 19% on lip and gingivae .\n\n【18】It is possible that other disorders will appear with similar clinical picture, so the need for a biopsy of the suspected lesion cannot be emphasized enough to rule out other conditions.\n\n【19】The differential diagnoses of schwannomas include lesions such as lipomas, hemangiomas, eosinophilic granuloma, epidermoid and dermoid cysts, epithelial hyperplasia, granular cell tumor, leiomyoma, and lymphangioma.\n\n【20】The treatment for benign schwannoma consists of total surgical excision. Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI may be helpful diagnostic and treatment tools, for the estimation of tumor margins, the lesion composition, and the determination of whether there is infiltration to surrounding structures . The recurrences as well as the malignant transformation are rare events.\n\n【21】However, a differentiation between schwannoma and neurofibroma is important, as the latter may be a manifest of neurofibromatosis which may precipitate a more thorough examination of the other parts of the body .\n\n【22】A better understanding of trauma-induced schwannoma, especially intraorally, may add to the clinical care of patients with this rare disorder as this is a lesion not encountered often in practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Those that occur in children or young people, are caused by vigorous activity , usually in the context of contact sport and as a result of sudden contraction of the iliopsoas muscle . However, those seen in adults in the absence of previous trauma, should raise the suspicion of a neoplastic process . We present the case of a patient who presented an isolated fracture of the femoral lesser trochanter as the first manifestation of metastatic lung cancer.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Sixty-nine year old male patient, smoker (55 packs/year), with a history of diabetes mellitus and a surgically treated right lumbar disc herniation 10 years before admission, who walked with a cane because of weakness in right leg. He presented in the emergency department of our hospital with moderate intensity pain at the right hip that worsened at night and had started two months before consultation.\n\n【4】Physical examination showed tenderness in the right greater trochanter area, preserved active and passive mobility of hip though painful in the entire range of motion. Examination of the respiratory system showed hypophonesis in left hemithorax. Complete blood count had leukocytosis with neutrophilia and hyperglycaemia. Hip X ray revealed a displaced isolated right lesser trochanter fracture . Chest radiograph showed the presence of a collapsed right lung and left pulmonary hilum tumor .\n\n【5】On suspicion of lung cancer with bone metastasis and pathological fracture of the lesser trochanter, hospitalization at the Department of Pneumology was decided. During hospitalization tumor markers analysis (CA 125, CYFRA 21.1, SCC, neuron-specific enolase) were performed and bronchoscopy revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma. Bone scintigraphy with technetium 99, showed lytic lesions in the left iliac crest, rib cage, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and an irregular captation site at the right proximal femur region corresponding to fracture . The CT scan demonstrated enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, rib and vertebral metastases.\n\n【6】The case was discussed by the tumors interdisciplinary committee, and prophylactic surgery of the right hip by intramedullary nailing and, subsequent possible chemotherapy were decided. Due to the rapid deterioration of the patient’s lung function, elective surgery could not be performed and 19 days after hospitalization, the patient died of respiratory failure.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Isolated fractures of the femoral lesser trochanter in adults are rare . There are 33 cases reported in the literature . In the first study which was conducted by Bertin et al , 36 cases of isolated fractures of the lesser trochanter were collected, of which only 4 were in adults with no history of direct trauma or fall. Of these, all were secondary to metastases: one thyroid, one pancreatic, one prostate and one adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. All patients were in good general condition before the diagnosis of the fracture. This paper also mentions that retrospectively reviewing the radiographs, obvious radiographic changes suggestive of metastasis were missed.\n\n【9】In a radiological study Phillips et al  collected, 4 cases of metastasis. In these cases, primary tumors were: colon, prostate, bronchial adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. In the largest study conducted on tumor processes of the proximal femur by James and Davies , 295 cases were identified retrospectively over a period of 20 years. Of these cases, only 15 were atraumatic fractures of the lesser femoral trochanter. Metastases were the most common cause (60%), and the most common primary tumors were: breast, bronchus, kidney, bladder and melanoma. The remaining cases (40%) were diagnosed of myeloma, Ewing sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and giant cell tumor of bone. The study also noted that incidence of 5% of the lesser trochanter avulsion fractures was probably enlarged because the study was conducted in an orthopedic oncology center.\n\n【10】As for primary tumor lesions of bone, Afra R, Boardman DL  were the first to describe the avulsion of the lesser trochanter as a primary manifestation of non-metastatic cancer, which corresponded to chondrosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma  and solitary plasmacytoma . Finally, a single case of leukemia in a patient with avulsion of the lesser trochanter as a primary lesion has been published . After a review of the literature Rouvillain JL et al, state that the etiology of Isolated fractures of the femoral lesser trochanter in adults with no history of trauma is metastatic most of the times, accounting for 70% of cases . The most frequent primary causes are: myeloma (9%), chondrosarcoma (9%) and Ewing sarcoma (6%) .\n\n【11】To diagnose these lesions, an antero-posterior and axial hip radiograph are necessary. It is important to take into account that an older patient with this type of injury and no history of trauma, should raise the suspicion of an underlying neoplastic process. After diagnosis, many authors recommend a magnetic resonance imaging to study the trochanteric region and display the extent of tumor infiltration to plan tumor resection . In our case it was not performed due to advanced stage of the primary tumor. To rule out other bone metastases, some authors recommend a technetium-99 scintigraphy . In the case presented it allowed the diagnosis of rib and vertebral metastases.\n\n【12】Finally, treatment of these patients depends on the stage of primary tumor, as discussed previously. In advanced stages, prophylactic fixation associated with palliative treatment of tumor is the most recommended treatment . In patients with single metastases or controlled primary tumor, resection of the lesion and proximal femoral prosthetic replacement is recommended. In this sense Rouvillain et al report a case of resection-reconstruction by megaprosthesis of the proximal femur in a patient with an isolated fracture of the femoral lesser trochanter secondary to metastatic lung adenocarcinoma . In the case presented, prophylactic nailing was planned but it was not performed because of the patient’s respiratory rapid deterioration.\n\n【13】In conclusion, in an older patient (adult) with an isolated lesser femoral trochanter fracture, without traumatic history, an underlying neoplastic process must be suspected. Because metastatic infiltratyive processes are the most common cause of these fractures, thorough medical history and additional tests need to be performed in order to diagnose the primary lesion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "cbda039b-c0e0-426b-ba44-9674a59d5627", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Chronic constipation refractory to medical management is a life altering condition. There are several surgical options to consider that have been well described in the United States, such as a total or segmental colectomy . Morbidities and mortalities are associated with these invasive procedures. European literature describes a minimally invasive procedure that has been successfully used to treat children and adults with chronic constipation called the Malone stoma with antegrade colonic enemas . Here we present a case where a laparoscopic Malone stoma with antegrade colonic enemas has resolved the patient’s chronic constipation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】L. K. is a 22-year-old African American female who presented with chronic constipation and recurrent fecal impaction for several years. Her past medical history, surgical history and social history were unremarkable. She was scheduled for a colonoscopy. Under sedation, fecal material in the rectum was palpable as a large abdominal mass extending to the level of the umbilicus. The patient was disimpacted and required hospitalization for further treatment. A gastrografin enema and computed tomography (CT) scan were normal except for a large dilated atonic rectum.\n\n【4】Further outpatient workup included a colonic transit study, defecating proctogram, and anal manometry. On the colonic transit study, all 24 markers were identified in the descending colon on day 5, consistent with abnormal hindgut transit. The patient was unable to evacuate on the defecating proctogram. Anal manometry showed normal sphincter function, but reproducing a rectoanal inhibitory reflex was difficult due to the megarectum. The patient remained on a bowel regimen of 17 g of polyethylene glycol daily for two months. She had another episode of severe impaction requiring bimanual disimpaction under anesthesia. An anal myectomy was done. Ganglion cells were present throughout the specimen, which ruled out Hirschsprung’s disease.\n\n【5】She was scheduled for an elective proctocolectomy with a J-pouch and diverting ileostomy. When the peritoneal cavity was opened, the anatomy was found to be abnormal. The bladder and uterus were intra-abdominal. The rectum was extremely dilated and full of hard stool. The sigmoid was very redundant. The small bowel was noted to be infantile and poorly developed with the mesentery too short to create a J-pouch. The procedure was changed to a total proctectomy with coloanal anastamosis and a diverting loop colostomy in the proximal redundant sigmoid colon. Her post-operative course was uneventful and the colostomy functioned well. However, a colonic transit study that was performed with the loop colostomy in place was abnormal. After explaining the inherent risks, she underwent a colostomy reversal two months later. Her chronic constipation returned as expected, and another colonic transit study was performed. Twenty-one rings were retained in the transverse colon on day 5, again consistent with colonic inertia. A gastrografin enema was done because the patient had not had a bowel movement in 2 weeks. There was no mechanical obstruction, but there was an anastomotic stricture. She had a sigmoidoscopy with dilation of the coloanal stricture. Her bowel regimen with daily polyethylene glycol was continued and she was symptom free for 6 months. She developed fecal incontinence, so her bowel regimen was modified. Her severe constipation returned and continued for the next 3 months. A laparoscopic Malone stoma was performed for antegrade colonic enemas.\n\n【6】Six years have passed since the laparoscopic Malone ostomy was created. The appendiceal ostomy has been used with a bowel regimen of one liter of warm water irrigation on days 1 and 2 followed by polyethylene glycol on the 3rd day, then repeated on a continual basis. The patient has had successful treatment of her colonic inertia with this regimen with no residual constipation or fecal incontinence.\n\n【7】Review of literature\n\n【8】The Malone stoma was first described for children in 1990 in England. The 21 children studied had either chronic constipation or fecal incontinence. Mean age of the children in the study was 12 years old, ranging from 18 months to 18 years. Fifteen of 21 children showed significant improvement, with 12 of these patients showing complete resolution of constipation or fecal incontinence . Other studies have shown success rates of treatment with the Malone stoma with antegrade enemas to vary from 50-95% . This technique has been shown to be a safe and acceptable treatment option for chronic constipation and fecal incontinence. Many children also achieve high functional scores with this technique. According to Schell et al, 85% of patients achieved the maximum benefit from the surgery with a 6-year follow-up period . Although the original surgery was conducted in children, adults have had successful treatment with this procedure in repeated studies .\n\n【9】The stoma may be created by either laparoscopic or open surgical procedures. Two 5-mm ports may be used to eviscerate the appendix in the right lower quadrant. One port is for the camera, and the other port is for a bowel grasper. A third port may be placed if needed. A small Rocky Davis incision may be used in an open technique to eviscerate the appendix. The appendix is brought out through a skin incision and an ostomy is fashioned by securing the mucosal surface to the skin with absorbable 3-0 sutures. If an appendectomy has been previously done, a cecal flap or sleeve may be created with a stapling device and used for the stoma. There are several different techniques for creating the stoma . An 18 Fr catheter is used to intubate the lumen of the appendix and is left in place for 2 - 4 weeks until a well healed tract is established . The stoma requires daily intubation in order for the tract to remain patent. The patient intubates the stoma and allows the bowel irrigant to lavage the colon. After the lavage is complete, the catheter is removed and either a band aid or small gauze is used to cover the stoma. Stomal stenosis is the most common complication associated with this procedure and is most often treated by dilating the tract with Hegar dilators . Other complications include stomal leakage (3%), channel obliteration (3%), stomal prolapse (1%), infection, pain and bleeding .\n\n【10】The bowel regimen is individually tailored. Some patients require 500 to 2000 mL of water to be flushed through the stoma daily . This is usually alternated with polyethylene glycol ranging from every other day to once every several weeks . The bowel regimen is altered until a successful treatment is established . The average time from instilling the solution until complete colonic emptying is 30 to 60 minutes .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The Malone stoma is a rarely utilized surgical procedure in the United States for chronic constipation, however this technique should be in every surgeon’s armamentarium. This procedure is safe and effective for the treatment of chronic constipation . Patients with significant health comorbidities tolerate this minimally invasive procedure well. This makes the procedure more attractive for elderly patients who may not be able to undergo a major abdominal operation, such as a total colectomy. This is also an option for patients with pelvic floor dysfunction, and combined colonic and rectal inertia. The author has performed several restorative proctocolectomies for inertia; however the patients often have significant morbidity from continued pelvic floor dysfunction . These patients show little to no improvement in symptoms from a traditional proctocolectomy.\n\n【13】This procedure is well described in Europe and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the long term effectiveness of the surgery. Most of the literature describes the surgery on children; however the Malone stoma has been successfully used to treat constipation in adults . The procedure can have a fair number of complications, and as always, the risks need to be weighed against the benefits for every individual . More studies need to be conducted in the United States to determine the patient population that would have the most benefits from the surgery.\n\n【14】In conclusion, the Malone stoma with antegrade continence enemas is an effective treatment for adult patients with chronic constipation and fecal incontinence. This 22-year-old patient’s medical options for her chronic constipation had been exhausted. Surgery was her only chance for a normal lifestyle. Her infantile anatomy made the initial proposed surgery impossible to perform. This patient was an ideal candidate for the Malone stoma with antegrade colonic enemas. She has now been free of constipation for 6 years and enjoys a normal lifestyle with her daily bowel regimen. This technique has been utilized for pelvic floor dysfunction, as well as colonic and rectal inertia with good results. The bowel regimen is tailored for each patient. More studies need to be performed in the United States, but this European surgery should be considered for the treatment of intractable chronic constipation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

CU is very rare and generally benign. The disease may be classified into acquired and familial disorders. The acquired types are further categorized as primary acquired, secondary acquired, and atypical acquired . Secondary acquired cold urticaria (ACU) occurs most frequently with primary and secondary cryoglobulinemia, e.g. secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphosarcoma, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, hepatitis C virus infection and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy . The specific association of CU and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma has not been reported. Therefore, we want to present a patient with CU which was diagnosed as marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a 1-year history of urticarial rash, itching and angioedema on the parts of his body after exposure to cold. He also defined complaints of dyspnea especially in the upper airways and cramps in the stomach by drinking cold water/beverages. There were no associated constitutional symptoms, such as fever or arthralgias. He had no family history of atopy and CU. His physical examination was normal. An ice cube test that applied to on right forearm skin for 5 min resulted in the development of a wheal and angioedema (6 × 5 mm) within 4 min of removal and persisted for 1 h. CU diagnosis was confirmed by applying ice cube test . We observed purpuric lesions on the lower extremities of the patient after exposure to cold weather. His hemoglobin and hematocrit values were 12 g/dL and 35.6%, respectively. Biochemical screening, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid function tests, anti-thyroid autoantibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, immunoglobulin (Ig) IgA, IgM, ANA, anti-ds-DNA, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, serum folate, vitamin B12, ferritin and iron level, C1 esterase inhibitor, C1q, basal tryptase level, urine tests and peripheral blood smear were normal. There were no parasites in the stool sample. Sputum, throat, blood and urine cultures were negative. Total IgE level was 50.6 kU/L, and inhalant allergens mix specific IgE (UNI-CAP 100, Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) was also negative. His hepatitis B and C panel investigations were negative. C-reactive protein was high (19.7 mg/mL (normal range: 0 - 3 mg/mL)). Serum complement levels were low (C3: 0.864 g/L (normal range: 0.9 - 1.8 g/L); C4: 0.0179 g/L (normal range: 0.1 - 0.4 g/L)). Serum cryoglobulin and direct coombs tests were positive. Serum IgG level was low (IgG: 5.6 g/L (normal range: 7 - 16 g/L)). Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated a polyclonal pattern of hypogammaglobulinemia (gamma globulin level: 9.3% (normal range: 11.1-18.8%)). Serum kappa level was low (1.65 g/L (normal range: 1.7 - 3.7 g/L)), urine kappa level was high (14.6 mg/L (normal range: 0.7 - 1 mg/L)), and serum and urine free lambda were normal. Beta-2 microglobulin was high ((4.49 mg/L (normal range: 1.09 - 2.53 mg/L)). A skin biopsy was performed from the lesion which was induced with the cold test. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was diagnosed by the examination of the pathologic specimen . A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a left supraclavicular mass (33 × 18 mm) that partially surrounded the artery in the upper mediastinum and a soft tissue mass (67 × 30 mm) which surrounded inferior vena cava and supressed aorta at retroperitoneal region. There were enlarged lymph nodes, adjacent to the supraclavicular mass, in both supraclavicular, periaortic, paratracheal, subcarineal, right hilar, both internal mammarian chain region and many pathologic lymph nodes in left gastric, periportal, aortakaval, para-aortic and right inguinal lymphatic region and splenomegaly. The patient was scheduled for diagnostic laparoscopy. Pathological lymph nodes were excised. Microscopically, the lymph node was infiltrated by a tumor in a nodular pattern composed of small lymphoid cells surrounding the germinal centers . Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections by using Ventana automated immunostainer. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD20, BCL2 and kappa light chain . These findings were consistent with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The bone marrow biopsy showed nodular paratrabecular lymphoid infiltration expressing CD20 and kappa light chain .\n\n【4】The patient was referred to hematology clinic with a diagnosis of stage 4 marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. After four cycles of chemotherapy, our patient’s cold urticarial symptoms and skin lesions were completely improved as well as disappearance of enlarged lymp nodes in the CT.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The exact incidence of the CU is unknown, but of all the cases, over 90% are classified as idiopathic . Although ACU is usually considered benign, several concerns should be addressed in patients with these disorders . The incidence of secondary ACU associated with cryoglobulinemia is low. Approximately 3-4% of all cryoglobulinemias are associated with ACU . Type I cryoglobulins are single monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG) always linked to B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders . These monoclonal proteins can form cold-induced aggregates that may mediate inflammatory vasculitis, which is characterized by cold-induced symptoms. Serum complement measurements in patients with secondary ACU and IgG cryoglobulinemia revealed decreased levels of classic and alternative complement components. IgG cryoglobulins may have been responsible for complement activation, release of C5a and C3a, and degranulation of mast cells. CU cryoglobulins could represent IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies that react with IgE attached to mast cells. Cold temperature may favor the interaction of IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies to IgE attached to mast cells, causing mediator release .\n\n【7】Autoimmune manifestations also occur frequently in the course of lymphoproliferative malignancies. They may sometimes be the first sign of the malignancy . Most of the organs can be targeted by an immune process due to the lymphoproliferative diseases. They include skin diseases (paraneoplastic pemphigus, vasculitis, urticaria, peripheral and central nervous system involvement (polyneuropathy, multifocal neuropathy), hematological manifestations (immune cytopenia, acquired bleeding disorders), rheumatologic diseases (arthritis, systemic vasculitis, myositis) and renal lesion (cryoglobulinemia, glomerulopathies)) . Autoimmune manifestations are observed in all lymphoma subtypes and seem particularly prevalent in marginal zone lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma .\n\n【8】We found positive ice cube test in our patient. His clinical manifestations supporting secondary ACU with cryoglobulinemia consisted of purpuric lesions especially involving lower extremities after cold exposure. He was anemic, his C-reactive protein was elevated, and serum C3 and C4 complement levels were decreased. He had type 1 cryoglobulinemia, positive direct coombs test. His beta-2 microglobulin was also elevated and polyclonal pattern of hypogammaglobulinemia was shown in serum protein electrophoresis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was confirmed with skin biopsy. Thoraco-abdominal CT findings revealed pathologic enlargement of the lymph nodes. The patient was diagnosed as a case of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.\n\n【9】This observation suggests a possible association and reminds us that patients with unexplained CU may have serious underlying disease. Therefore, we believe that they should be submitted to additional investigations. In conclusion, CU cases should be evaluated more carefully with regard to unusual disorders.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2d9ba6b6-a0ba-45c6-bc60-0995f2a1b7fd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Microscopic colitis (MC) is characterized, clinically, by chronic or recurrent watery diarrhea without bleeding. There are well-defined histological findings and normal or nearly normal macroscopic findings on colonoscopy . Collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) are the two major histological forms of MC. They have nearly the same clinical and macroscopical colonic mucosal findings . Pathogenesis of MC is unknown . The most widely postulated hypothesis is, the inflammatory disorders arising from epithelial immune responses to intraluminal dietary or bacterial contents, environmental risk factors such as drugs, have been suggested as a cause of this process, include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, simvastatin, selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors, acarbose, biphosphonates and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) . We report a case of lansoprazole-associated LC with a constipation dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a concomitant disease.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 64-year-old woman with abdominal pain and mild weight loss was referred to a gastroenterologist. The patient fulfilled ROME III criteria. She presented a history of abdominal discomfort associated with improvement with defecation, constipation, bloating and gas for about 20 years but more frequent for the past 4 - 5 years. The patient reported receiving PO lansoprazole 30 mg/day to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease for nearly 1 month. The medical history report also revealed that the patient was not receiving any concomitant medications or treatments at the time. After listening to the story of the patient and physical examination, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and biochemical tests were performed. An abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, fever, arthritis, dermatitis or signs of malabsorption were not found on physical examination; there were not abnormalities on initial laboratory tests including anemia, thyroid dysfunction, increased sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, presence of occult blood in stool or other abnormal biochemical findings. The patient had negative results on serological tests for coeliac disease (transglutaminase and endomysial antibody) and normal serum IgA levels. In patient with the alarm signs such as weight loss, advanced age of onset, family history (cancer), colonoscopy was done. Appearance on colonoscopy was normal, but biopsies showed LC . Lansoprazole therapy was ceased. Eight weeks later, endoscopic and histological normalization was ascertained.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】MC is regarded as a common cause of chronic watery diarrhea, accounting for approximately 4-13% of patients presenting with this symptoms . LC and CC are the two major subtypes of MC with increasing prevalence of 10 - 15.7/100,000 and 14.4/100,000 . Increased awareness of the disease among clinicians and increased use of several drugs that cause MC are some of the causes of more frequent diagnosis. Since the growing incidence of MC seems to parallel the rise in the use of PPIs, it is essential to understand the association between MC and PPIs. A recent study from Netherlands found that 11.8% of the population had at least one prescription for PPIs in 1 year .\n\n【6】Initially, lansoprazole has been found to be associated with MC . The frequency of lansoprazole-associated MC is unknown, at least 0.7% was found to develop MC . There are several studies which further highlight the association between the PPIs and MC. Most common mechanisms are inhibition of colonic proton pumps which affect the local electrolyte balance, induction of smooth muscle relaxation that inhibit contractile activity, increased paracellular permeability and alteration of intestinal microbial flora .\n\n【7】Almost all the studies lansoprazole associated with MC are mentioning the watery diarrhea and normal or nearly normal macroscopic colonic mucosa. There are some studies designed as a retrospective analysis of colonic biopsies show that LC or CC were not confined to the patients just with diarrhea as a presenting symptom, but were also present with normal bowel movements and constipation. Wang et al mentioned 12 patients fulfilled the histological criteria but not the clinical criteria for classic LC and classified them as having atypical LC . Nooroudien et al retrospectively reviewed non-malignant colon mucosal biopsies with 20 cases of LC, and mentioned the most common presenting complaints of them were chronic diarrhea in 9/20 cases, abdominal pain in 7/20 and constipation in 3/20 . Neal et al studied clinicopathological association and prevalence of LC in 100 asymptomatic, non-gluten sensitive adults who underwent screening surveillance colonoscopy for previous colonic polyps as a control group without a clinical symptom, and none had abdominal pain, weight loss or altered bowel habits. Of the 100 asymptomatic patients 4% had classic LC with no clinical symptoms . One recent study to investigate the incidence of LC in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis found that 20 of 50 patients had LC. Only five of the patients had diarrhea; the other 15 patients were asymptomatic. In a recent study, Yeon et al reviewed patients’ histological reports receiving PPIs who had no symptoms of diarrhea and matched the controls. The intraepithelial lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the PPI group than controls. They suggested the findings as an early stage of the disease even before the onset of the symptoms .\n\n【8】In a large retrospective study, celiac disease, IBS and thyroid diseases were found to have a higher occurrence in MC compared to controls . The symptomatic overlap between IBS and microscopic colitis makes the diseases difficult to be diagnosed clinically and suggests that a colonoscopy is imperative . Almost all the studies, which were trying to show the association of MC and IBS were made with patients who have diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D) . In a recent study patients previously diagnosed as IBS reported 6.07% MC with 5.27% of LC and 0.8% of CC. While other authors found the incidence of CC 7.2% and LC 2.2 % among the patients diagnosed as IBS . There are few reports about the constipation predominant IBS and MC. Carmona-Sanchez et al reviewed 155 patients with IBS-D and 145 with IBS-C. Both groups were matched from the standpoint of age, gender ratio and time course of disease. MC was detected in 28 patients with IBS-D and in one with IBS-C (18% vs. 0.7%, P < 0.0001) .\n\n【9】Our case illustrates a rare condition of MC, without any symptoms of diarrhea and concomitant with constipation dominant IBS. Although lansoprazole is a widely prescribed drug for gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, the frequency of lansoprazole-associated MC is not well-estimated for subjects without symptoms of diarrhea. We think that the incidence of lansoprazole-associated MC is higher than known incidence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Although > 96% of SRCs occur in the stomach, the rest arise in other organs, including the breast, gallbladder, pancreas, urinary bladder, and large bowel . Since the first description of SRC by Laufman and Saphir , the incidence of SRC has become 0.6/100,000 individuals . The incidence continues to slowly increase with improvements in diagnostic capabilities. Unfortunately cases detected and treated at early stages are rare. Clinical symptoms usually appear late and, signet-ring cell carcinomas are commonly detected at advanced stages. In this case report, we present our experience with a signet-ring cell carcinoma of the duodenal bulb with metastasis to the colon and ovary detected at a late stage in a 25-year-old Hispanic female along with a review the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 25-year-old Hispanic female was admitted to the Howard University Hospital with four weeks complaint of epigastric, peri-umbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety and ten pound weight loss. The patient also reported a two day history of jaundice. Past medical history included pancreatitis and a history of recently diagnosed ovarian mass. She had a family history significant for a cousin diagnosed with leukemia. The patient denied tobacco, alcohol or any illicit drug use. On physical examination, the patient was found to have icterus, bilateral cervical adenopathy more prominent on the left, and bilateral lower quadrant tenderness. Pelvic examination revealed a ballottable right adnexal mass.\n\n【4】Laboratory study results showed a total bilirubin of 19.0 mg/dL with a conjugated picture, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of 131 and 116 MU/ML, respectively (normal < 55 MU/ML) and alkaline phosphatase 914 MU/ML (normal 30 - 165 MU/ML). Amylase and lipase were 354 U/L and 468 U/L respectively (normal 28 - 100 and 22 - 51 U/L). Hemoglobin levels during admission ranged between 8 - 10 g/dL (normal 12 - 15 g/dl).Tumor markers obtained revealed an elevated cancer antigen-125(CA-125) at 458 U/mL (normal < 20 U/mL), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9 526), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 85 ng/mL (normal < 2.5 ng/mL) and alpha fetoprotein level of 55.8 ng/mL (normal < 6.1 ng/mL).\n\n【5】Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated moderately diffuse ascites, mild hepatomegaly with moderately diffuse heterogeneity of the parenchyma without evidence of a solid mass. There was extra-hepatic ductal dilatation without evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged right ovary. Subsequent computerized tomography of abdomen and pelvis confirmed moderate ascites, a diffusely heterogenous liver with numerous ill-defined foci. Bilateral heterogeneous adnexal masses with the largest being on the right measuring 5.5 × 4.0 cm were observed. A heterogeneous large kidney with decreased function was noted. There was small to moderate diffuse adenopathy.\n\n【6】Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the right adnexal mass revealed poorly differentiated mucin producing adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring features . Immunostains revealed expression of CK7, CK20 and CDX2 which suggested a site of origin in the upper gastrointestinal tract . Bidirectional endoscopy was then performed. Upper endoscopy revealed an exophytic mass lesion extending from the duodenal bulb and obstructing distally appearing to involve the ampulla and causing jaundice . No obvious mass was noted in the stomach. Colonoscopy revealed multiple masses in the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon the largest being a 5 cm exophytic lesion. There was no evidence of familial adenomatous polyposis. Biopsy of these lesions also revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring features displaying lymphatic invasion .\n\n【7】Medical oncology was consulted and palliative care measures were recommended. Chemotherapy was not recommended secondary to the patient’s overall poor performance status and significantly elevated liver tests. Biliary stenting and ureteral stenting was suggested for palliation. Unfortunately, the patient died before within a few days of admission.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Signet ring carcinoma of the duodenum was first described by Sekoguchi et al in 1979 . Histologically, the origin of signet-ring cells remains unknown. One theory regarding the etiology is that the signet cells are thought to originate in ectopic gastric mucosa found in the duodenum. Another theory is that the signet ring cell carcinoma arises from gastric type metaplastic epithelia. These metaplastic changes are considered to be a protective response to acid production and can usually be seen in the duodenal bulb . In our case the endoscopy revealed a mass extending from the duodenal bulb and obstructing the ampulla. This was histologically consistent with poorly differentiated signet ring cell adenocarcinoma.\n\n【10】Signet ring cell tumors generally carry a poor prognosis regardless of site of origin with greater that 80% of SRC diagnoses present with advanced (stage III or IV) disease .\n\n【11】Duodenal cancers commonly occur in the ampullary or periampullary regions of the descending duodenum ; however, these tumors are occasionally found in other portions of the duodenum . If caught early, the preferred treatment for resectable lesions in the second and third portions of the duodenum is a pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of adjacent tissues, including regional lymph nodes .\n\n【12】The most frequent clinical findings of duodenal cancer include epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, postprandial bloating, weight loss. There can be signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stool and iron-deficiency anemia .\n\n【13】Unfortunately, most symptomatic patients with duodenal cancer have advanced lesions at presentation. As a result, these patients have a poor prognosis, with overall 5-year survival rates ranging from 20% to 40% . Factors affecting patient survival include the histologic grade of the tumor (the degree of differentiation and the nuclear grade), depth of invasion, presence or absence of nodal or distant metastases, duration of symptoms, and location of tumor in the duodenum (distal lesions have a better prognosis) .\n\n【14】Ovarian metastases occur in about 3% of all CRC patients and make up between 5% and 10% of all CRC metastases. The best known tumor of this type is the signet-ring adenocarcinoma (Krukenburg tumor) of gastric origin . Carcinomas of the colon, appendix and breast are the next most common site of origin. This case is unique in that the small intestine (duodenal bulb) is not a frequent site of origin of Krukenburg tumor.\n\n【15】The limited number of cases of signet cell cancer reported in the duodenal bulb precludes any conclusions about survival associated with this histological variant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is the most common muscular disorder associated with reported sudden cardiac death . Mortality rate is 7.3 times greater than the general population with the mean age of death at 53 years . Unfortunately, there is no correlation between severity of disease and the amount of cardiac involvement . Cardiac conduction delays and blocks are also a common manifestation of this disease, in up to 90% of patients, potentially leading to lethal arrhythmias . This case report exams this progressive process and aims to expand on early recognition, timing and prevention of these complications.\n\n【2】Learning objectives\n\n【3】1) Raise awareness for cardiac screening in patient with myotonic dystrophy for primary care providers, cardiologist, and neurologist.\n\n【4】2) Consider primary prevention in patients with myotonic dystrophy and conduction abnormalities.\n\n【5】3) Treatment of severe conduction abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【6】4) Demonstrate the range of electrocardiogram abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【7】5) Recognize signs and symptoms of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 58-year-old Caucasian male with significant past medical history of myotonic dystrophy and no significant cardiac history presented to emergency department with intermittent atypical chest pain while endorsing associated palpitations, weakness, and fatigue for 2 weeks. Previous medical records confirmed a diagnosis of Mobitz type I second degree AV block on EKG performed the previous week. During his admission, cardiac enzymes including troponin I and proBNP were within normal limits. Multiple episodes of sinus bradycardia were noted on telemetry with a follow-up EKG revealing first degree AV block. Over the course of 7 h, the patient became symptomatic with dizziness and altered mental status, while his vital signs showed a heart rate of 32 and blood pressure of 64/32. Serial EKGs were performed showing a conversion into complete heart block and junctional escape rhythm. The patient was resuscitated with dopamine for hemodynamic stability. Emergent permanent pacemaker placement was performed without complication. Following an uncomplicated recovery, echocardiogram and nuclear stress testing showed no structural or identifiable ischemia.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Myotonic dystrophy is a rare condition from a triplet expansion on chromosome 19q13.3 with reported incidence in around 1 in 8,000 worldwide. The chromosomal expansion mutation results in a gain of function mutation for involved cells. This gain of function is expressed as the common features associated with this rare disease. The disease is slowly progressive with physical features of increased muscle weakness and muscle atrophy commonly involving distal, smaller muscle groups. This clinical presentation can be congenital, juvenile, adult or late onset depending on the severity of the disease.\n\n【12】Cardiac conduction abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy range from benign first-degree heart block to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Subsequent studies found that 20-30% of patients die of cardiac causes and 33% are sudden cardiac death. Recent data suggest that myocardial fibrosis and infiltrative adipose tissue involving the myocardium affects the electrical conduction system. The rates of EKG abnormalities are significantly higher than the general population. Multiple abnormalities include widening of the QRS complexes, abnormal Q waves, bundle branch blocks and bradycardia. Given the progressive nature of the disease and identifiable findings, regular cardiac monitoring and yearly monitoring with EKG is recommended.\n\n【13】Abrupt appearance of heart block may contribute to sudden cardiac death . It has been established that sudden cardiac death may occur despite pacemaker implantation . Electrophysiological studies with prophylactic pacemaker placement and ICD is recommended for those at risk for severe bradycardia, high degree AV block or malignant ventricular arrhythmia. There is a class I recommendation for device placement for the high risk patients but unfortunately prophylactic pacing is rarely pursued, even though lower mortality and increased survival rates have been shown . Patient with high risk EKGs, defined as PR interval greater than 200 ms and/or QRS duration greater than 100 ms, who underwent invasive implantation of a prophylactic pacing device showed a significant survival benefit of 9 years when compared to their non-invasive counterparts .\n\n【14】Increased awareness among general practitioners and appropriate coordination of care involving with fields of neurology and cardiologist would benefit these patients long-term survival.

{"seq_id": "4daeea6b-51f0-4f68-bc32-681b71607eb0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Clinical use of pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) dates to the early 1970’s . Due to controversy regarding the utility of PAC, widespread use has declined in recent years . PAC use however can still be found in select patients, including those undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation . Clinicians utilizing PAC must recognize potential complications and understand treatment options. We present 2 patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) complicated by PAC knotting.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Two males, ages 41 and 63 years, presented for combined liver and kidney transplant and OLT, respectively. Both patients had abnormal preoperative coagulation laboratory studies . Anesthesia was induced and intubation performed uneventfully in both cases.\n\n【4】In each patient, a 9 French double lumen central venous introducer was placed in the right internal jugular vein utilizing dynamic ultrasound guidance with good visualization of anatomy. Multiple attempts at placement of an 8 French oximetric pulmonary artery catheter were unsuccessful. Upon attempted removal of the PAC, resistance was met at roughly 25 cm in each case. Intraoperative fluoroscopy was performed, revealing a knot in the distal PAC . Repeated attempts to unravel the catheter by passing a pacing wire down the distal port of the PAC were unsuccessful. Given the projected delay for interventional radiology assistance that would have resulted in increasing donor organ ischemic time, percutaneous removal was performed in both cases.\n\n【5】Under fluoroscopic guidance, traction was applied to the PAC and the knot size was reduced against the introducer. A guide wire was passed down the distal lumen of the introducer, exiting the same lumen as the PAC, thereby bypassing the knot. Next, the introducer and PAC were removed with traction en bloc  with the guidewire left in the IJV. A new introducer was placed over the guidewire and a new PAC inserted without complication on the first attempt. Location of the new introducer and PAC were fluoroscopically confirmed. Both patients then underwent transplantation without complications and experienced uneventful postoperative courses.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Complications related to PAC use have been reported in up to 24% of cases; however, PAC knot formation is exceedingly rare . Of the intravascular catheters used today, PAC account for 64-67% of knotted devices . Although significant controversy exists regarding use of PAC in surgical and nonsurgical patients, it is important for the clinician to understand their potential complications.\n\n【8】Knotting of PAC is thought to occur when passage into the pulmonary artery is unsuccessful and looping occurs within the right ventricle . This looping over of the PAC may be due to insertion of an excessive length of the PAC . Inability to obtain a wedge pressure should prompt retraction to 30 cm and reattempt flotation into the pulmonary artery . After multiple unsuccessful attempts, providers will often completely retract and reinsert the PAC. If resistance to retraction is encountered, there should be a concern for knotting of the catheter, or entanglement around cardiac chordae or valves. The distance at which resistance is encountered may help differentiate between these complications, with the former occurring when resistance is met at lesser distances of PAC insertion, as encountered in our cases. Fluoroscopic evaluation can also assist with diagnosis and PAC knot location as noted in our cases.\n\n【9】Several strategies for both surgical and nonsurgical knotted PAC removal have been described . Insertion of a core-guided wire through the PAC under fluoroscopy is often a first step in attempt to unravel the knotted catheter . Utilization of a pacer wire is another option and was unsuccessfully employed in both of our cases. Unsuccessful attempts at un-knotting the catheter prompt consideration of alternative removal techniques. One technique involves ligating the PAC and replacing the initial introducer with a larger introducer over the ligated PAC. With this technique the knot is contained within the lumen of the larger introducer, after which both the knotted catheter and introducer are removed simultaneously . Assistance of interventional radiology may be utilized, but may be difficult to arrange in a timely fashion, especially given the after-hours nature of many liver transplantations. Interventional radiology techniques include the use of a retrieval basket, pigtail catheter, loop snare, or endomyocardial biopsy forceps inserted through an alternate venous access site to secure and remove the knotted catheter which is ligated and pulled through the introducer . The retrieval device is then retracted and a small skin incision is made to remove the knotted catheter, or, for larger knots, a venous cutdown is performed . Primary surgical removal performing a cutdown and venotomy at the initial insertion site has also been described . For large and complex knots, surgical removal is often the only option and is performed via cutdown or open procedures, occasionally requiring cardiopulmonary bypass .\n\n【10】Patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) present additional challenges such as coagulopathy and significant time constraints, making traditional and potentially more time-consuming knotted PAC removal techniques less ideal. The after-hours timing of both liver transplantations coupled with the need to reduce donor organ ischemic time limited available options compared with elective surgical patients. The percutaneous technique used in our case report carries a theoretical risk of complications such as venous laceration and uncontrolled bleeding upon removal of the knotted catheter . We decided this risk was mitigated by the ability to insert a new introducer through the original puncture site into the internal jugular vein by maintaining patency with a guidewire. Intraoperative fluoroscopy demonstrated the knot diameter after retraction against the introducer was not significantly larger than that of the introducer diameter.\n\n【11】In conclusion, PAC knot formation is a rare, yet potentially serious, complication. Clinicians caring for patients with such devices must be able to recognize this complication and tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Patellofemoral pain syndrome seems to be the most common cause in young patients and athletes in particular, but other intra-articular knee pathologies like plica syndrome, and a variety of periarticular pathologies such as patellar tendinopathy, peripatellar bursitis, Sinding-Larsen-Johansson’s and Osgood Schlatter’s lesions, and Hoffa’s disease, are also presented with anterior knee pain . Soft tissue tumors, although rare, can also present with anterior knee pain .\n\n【2】A case of a glomus tumor located in front of the tibial tubercle, in a patient being treated for 2 years for chondromalacia of the patella, is reported.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 28-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining of pain in the front of his right knee for approximately 2 years with gradually worsening over the recent 8 months. The patient had been treated for chondromalacia of the patella with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy and home exercises. There was no history of trauma. Pain increased with movements of the right knee, such as walking or squatting, and it was relieved by resting, especially when the knee was slightly flexed.\n\n【5】The patient walked freely and without limping. A detailed physical examination of the knee revealed patellofemoral pain, as well as a point of tenderness on palpation localized in the front of the tibial tubercle. A soft tissue mass in front of the tibial tubercle not fixed with the surrounding tissues was found. The knee was otherwise normal and had a normal range of motion.\n\n【6】Plain radiographs were normal. Ultrasonography of the right knee revealed an oval-shaped hyper/hypoechoic mass with multiple blood vessels in the surrounding area and clear margins. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a small soft tissue mass measured (dimensions: 24 × 10 × 20 mm) on the front of the tibial tubercle. The mass had intermediate signal intensity similar to muscles on T1-weighted images  and also intermediate signal intensity similar to surrounding fat on T2-weighted images . On T1 with fat saturation images the mass had high signal intensity (absence of fat) . Finally, there was an increased similar intensity of the mass after contrast medium administration (consisted of hypervascularity).\n\n【7】The patient was treated with excision of the mass under local anesthesia. Macroscopically the mass was a soft, bluish colored round, and with smooth surface, 1 cm in diameter, with visible capillaries passing through. The patient recovered without complications. Immediately after operation, the pain disappeared and a few days later the patient was walking freely without crutches.\n\n【8】Histopathologic examination of the mass revealed a glomangioma composed of uniform round or polygonal cells with regular nuclei and pale or eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged around vascular structures . The glomus (“epitheloid”) cells were immunohistochemically positive for vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin and negative for keratins and desmin.\n\n【9】At the time of the last follow-up, 2 years post-operatively, the patient is free of any symptoms.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Glomus tumor, first described in detail by Masson in 1934, is a rare benign vascular tumor from the neuromyoarterial canal system called the Sucquet-Hoyer canals of the glomus body in the skin . They are rare and represent less than 1.6% of all benign soft tissue neoplasms , usually found between ages 30 and 50 and are more common in women than men with a ratio of 2:1 . As much as 70-75% of these tumors involve the hand , and their typic location is to the distal parts of the phalanges and nail beds .\n\n【12】Apart from their typical location in the subungual region, ectopic locations are not uncommon . In the lower limb these lesions have been described in the ankle , the heel pad  and the knee .\n\n【13】Two clinical presentations of these tumors can be indentified: solitary and multiple . The etiology of a solitary glomus tumor is unknown, whereas the etiology of multiple glomus tumors is associated with an autosomal dominant heritable mutation localized to chromosome 1p21-22 .\n\n【14】One of the distinguishing features of glomus tumors is the presentation of the classic triad of symptoms: 1) hypersensitivity to cold, 2) paroxysmal severe pain and 3) pinpoint tenderness to blunt palpation . According to the largest retrospective study by Van Geertruyden et al  bluish discoloration was present in 28% of patients and pulp nodule occurred in 33% of patients. Although these symptoms are quite characteristic, many patients with glomus tumors do not present with this classic triad.\n\n【15】There are three main clinical tests used to diagnose glomus tumors, such as the love pin test, in which positive result is the patients’ experience of severe pain. The Hildreth test, involves applying a tourniquet to the base of the suspected area and repeating the love pin test. A positive result is the lack of pain in the patient . The third is exposure to cold, which should produce pain related to cold sensitivity . Nevertheless, these tests have limited use, as they are not 100% specific .\n\n【16】Other diagnostic tools available include MRI (which is the most sensitive)  and ultrasound which is useful for the purpose of building a differential diagnosis .\n\n【17】Clinically, glomus tumors can be confused with neuromas, arthritis or gout, and differential diagnosis also includes melanoma, blue nevus and angioma . Misdiagnosis delays appropriate treatment. The treatment is surgical with marginal excision , which should result in a dramatic resolution of symptoms as occurred in our patient.\n\n【18】Glomus tumors around the knee have been reported in variable locations: in the lateral aspect , in the medial aspect , in the popliteal fossa , medial to the tibial tuberosity , proximal and medial to the patella , in the patellar ligament , medial to the patellar ligament  and in front of the patellar ligament . It has been also found in intra-articular but extra-synovial locations like in the fat pad  and beneath the plica synovialis .\n\n【19】Delay in diagnosis of glomus tumors around the knee is common and has been reported to range from 4 months to 40 years from the onset of symptoms . Some of the patients do not present with the classical symptoms  or with other concomitant pathologies of the knee thus delaying the diagnosis of the glomus tumor .\n\n【20】Our patient presented with two of the classic triad signs: pain and point tenderness, but did not relay a history of cold sensitivity. It has been noted that only about 50% of patients had all components of the classic triad of signs . Although there was no other knee pathology in our patient, the anterior knee pain was attributed to patellofemoral pain and miss-leaded the treating physician for a long time. This should be a reminder to be aware of atypical locations of glomus tumor to avoid misdiagnosis, which prolongs the serious pain of the patients.\n\n【21】To avoid making a wrong diagnosis, a high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis and the MRI scanning can be helpful in investigating an unexplained knee pain or a painful lump around the knee . The use of MRI to image these tumors has been described as the method of choice; however, it does not yield a detailed image of the tumor, just an adjunct to allow more precise localization . Use of advanced imaging techniques is, therefore, only partly helpful and must be used in conjunction with clinical assessment of a joint, which can have a multitude of reasons for being painful .\n\n【22】In conclusion, although knee glomangioma is rare, it could be a cause of anterior knee pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Patient had a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. He was admitted for anorexia, prostration and fever with 1-month evolution. He reported having chronic cough. There were no other lung-related symptoms relevant for this case. Physical examination showed no relevant changes. Chest radiograph presented left reticular infiltrate and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of an endoluminal image, in left ULB, favoring the presence of a foreign body . Bronchoscopy revealed the presence of an intravenous injection needle in the region of ULB, with granulation tissue around it . The object was removed by rigid bronchoscopy .\n\n【5】In the second case, the patient was a 47-year-old male, a former intravenous drug user with a history of intravenous consumption. Patient had HIV infection in AIDS stage and HCV infection. He was admitted for study of cough with hemoptoic sputum with 2 months of evolution and associated pleuritic pain and weight loss. Physical examination showed no relevant changes. Chest radiograph presented no significant alterations. Chest CT showed a foreign body in the main bronchus and left ULB . Bronchoscopy revealed a foreign body (intravenous injection needle) located in the ULB . Removal by rigid bronchoscopy was performed.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】After reviewing the history, we assume that the needles may have been aspirated during a period of unconsciousness, immediately after drug injection. Since the location of foreign body is often the right bronchial tree and, in both cases, the otherwise was found, led us to conclude that the position in which individuals were injected was possibly related to the location of the object. Both patients preferentially used the left arm venous circulatory system for administration, bended to the left side and holding the needle with their mouth while applying the tourniquet on the arm, leaving the left bronchial tree more exposed during FBA.\n\n【8】The explanatory two clinical cases with FBA resulting in the same location, the same history of drug addiction and the same technique of administration of drugs, aim to highlight a possible explanation for the atypical location of the foreign body and draw attention to a subtle clinical and imaging presentation, and therefore the crucial high grade of clinical suspicion is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The involvement of different layers of the intestinal wall usually gives rise to different clinical manifestations. The mucosal form, which is the most common EG subtype, presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal blood loss, anemia and weight loss secondary to malabsorption. The muscularis form is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils predominantly in the muscularis layer, leading to thickening of the bowel wall, which might result in gastrointestinal obstructive symptoms. The subserosal form occurs in a minority of patients with EG, and it is characterized by exudative ascites with higher peripheral eosinophil counts compared with the other forms . The etiology of EG is unknown and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. EG has features of allergy and immune dysregulation but does not clearly fit into the category of allergic or immune disorder . The diagnostic criteria for the EG are well defined. They include gastrointestinal symptoms, eosinophilic infiltration in at least one area of the digestive tract demonstrated by biopsy, absence of eosinophilic infiltration in other organs outside the digestive tract and absence of parasitic infections .

Sigmoid and descending colon diverticulosis without features of acute diverticulitis are present.\n\n【10】Hospital course\n\n【11】The patient was kept nothing per mouth with intravenous fluids and intravenous analgesia. Surgery team was consulted and due to the severity of symptoms they decided to proceed with laproscopic procedure. During the procedure, the ileum was distended with thickened bowel wall. Several centimeters proximal to the ileocecal valve, there was a puckering which appeared to be stricture with some ulceration with no obvious cobble stoning. The colonic mucosa was tan-pink to red, smooth and glistening, and displays prominent irregular folds. Right hemicolectomy was done and the tissue was sent for pathologic evaluation.\n\n【12】Pathology\n\n【13】Dense infiltrate of eosinophils in the muscularis propria suggests EG . Small areas of ischemic damage are present. Neither granulomas nor parasitic forms are identified.\n\n【14】Post-procedure course\n\n【15】The patient had a prolonged postoperative ileus requiring TPN for few days; however, his ileus ultimately did resolve and he was able to tolerate his diet. He was discharged home later on.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】EG is a rare, chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the bowel characterized by the presence of peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic infiltration of one or more layers of the intestinal wall . Clinical features depend upon the most prominent layer of visceral wall involvement by eosinophils, i.e. mucosal, muscular or serosal . Approximately 57.5% have mucosal, 30% muscular and 12.5% (sub) serosal disease, respectively . Although the disease may affect all ages, typical presentations are in the third through fifth decades. EG tends to have an equal gender distribution, 50% of patients may be atopic and 50% may have a history of food intolerance of allergy . Mucosa-predominant disease is manifested as non-specific abdominal discomfort, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy , whereas muscularis-predominant disease leads to bowel wall thickening and intestinal obstruction. Cramping and abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting occur frequently. It can also present as an obstructing cecal mass or intussusception . In contrast, subserosa-predominant disease more commonly results in eosinophilic ascites and markedly elevated counts of eosinophils in peripheral blood . Peripheral eosinophilia occurs in a variable number of EG patients (20-90%), and is not a reliable prerequisite for diagnosis . The endoscopic appearance in EG is non-specific, including erythematous, friable, nodular and occasional ulcerative changes . In the muscular form, endoscopy may appear normal. Most EG cases have been diagnosed on surgical, full-thickness biopsy or resection performed for obstruction or suspicion of malignancy . Radiographically, there is no pathognomonic appearance of EG, the appearance being identical to Crohn’s enterocolitis, with thickening and flattening of the valvulae conniventes (most common), strictures, filling defects, ulceration, polypoid lesions and rigidity of the ileocecal valve . The mainstay of treatment in non-obstructive disease is a trial of dietary avoidance of food allergens, but if the symptoms persist or are severe, then corticosteroid therapy is recommended . Prednisone at a dose of 20 - 40 mg daily for 8 weeks can yield a good response. Budesonide is an alternative steroid with fewer systemic side effects . Surgical treatment is required for patients with intestinal perforation and/or obstruction .\n\n【18】In our case, the patient had small bowel obstruction due to a stricture and small bowel wall thickening caused by EG requiring surgical intervention. The patient was followed up later on with complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【19】In conclusion, eosinophilic enteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ileitis. Patients, with muscular form of EG, usually present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction due to small bowel wall thickening and rarely stricture formation. Surgery is the treatment of choice in the presence of obstruction. To our knowledge, very few cases with this entity have been reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is a disorder associated with chronic alcohol consumption and characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum . In many cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also reveals hemispheric white matter lesions . Clinically, patients may present with reduced consciousness, emotional and psychotic symptoms, depression and apathy, hemiparesis, ataxia and often coma and death .\n\n【2】Before brain imaging was available, the disease was characterized as acute, subacute and chronic . In 2004, Heinrich et al described two clinical subtypes of MBD: type A predominantly characterized by stupor and coma, pyramidal symptoms and radiological involvement of the entire corpus callosum; type B, with slighter impairment of consciousness level and partial or focal lesions of the corpus callosum .\n\n【3】In 2001, Helenius et al reported that about 250 new cases have been reported since the original description of the disease, over 200 of them had died, 30 severely demented or bedridden, and only 20 favorably recovered . Nevertheless, there have been some reported cases with clinical and imaging improvement .\n\n【4】We report a case of acute MBD with extensive brain involvement, severe impaired mental status and poor prognosis.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 56-year-old female patient was admitted to our institution after being found lying at home with impaired consciousness. She had a history of chronic alcohol intake for about 30 years, with several unsuccessful attempts to alcohol detoxification, and had a gait disturbance for the last week. There was no history of fever, vomiting or seizure, and was last seen the day before in her usual state of health.\n\n【7】On examination, the patient was found to be malnourished and was in a coma, unresponsive to painful stimulation, pupils were of normal size and normal reacting, muscle tone was increased (with the exception of the left arm which was flaccid) and bilateral positive plantar reflex. Signs of meningeal irritation were absent. Laboratory results revealed macrocytosis (105.4 fL) without anemia, normal renal function and normal ion and glucose count. She had a folic acid deficiency (3.8 ng/mL). There was no elevation of C-reactive protein and hepatic liver tests were normal with the exception of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (99 U/L). pH was normal although she had an increased anion gap with urinary keto acids. Ethanol was below 10 mg/dL. Cerebral CT scan showed no lesions and cerebral spinal fluid had normal cell count. She was treated with intravenous fluids, folic acid, thiamine and B complex vitamins.\n\n【8】The cerebral MRI 2 days later showed extensive lesions with hyperintense on long TR sequences involving the cerebellar hemispheres, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, the pontine tegmentum, the central tegmental tracts and midbrain . It also revealed the involvement of periventricular subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the entire corpus callosum with restriction of water diffusion . Some lesions involved the gray matter, particularly bilaterally precentral cortex and thalamus. On the basis of clinical history and imaging features, the diagnosis of MBD was made.\n\n【9】There was no improvement in neurological status and the patient evolved with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Given the poor prognosis of the disease, the extent of injuries and poor nutritional status of the patient, it was decided not to escalate therapy with ventilatory support. The patient died the fifth day of hospitalization.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MBD is seen most often in individuals with chronic alcoholism; however, some cases have been reported in malnourished patients with no history of alcoholism . Although chronic alcoholism and nutritional deficits are commonly associated with the disease, etiology is still controversial .\n\n【12】In our case, the patient had involvement of the entire corpus callosum and presented with coma and pyramidal tract symptoms which are compatible with the A type of MBD, usually associated with poor prognosis . Treatment with thiamine, folic acid and other B complex vitamins has been described in several patients with favorable outcome , and a review of CT/MRI confirmed MBD cases revealed a linear trend for better outcomes among patients treated with thiamine . However, vitamin therapy was also used in cases where there was no clinical recovery , as in the present case.\n\n【13】MBD is a rare complication associated with alcohol consumption and should not be forgotten. Despite the poor prognosis, an early diagnosis using MRI and prompt supportive therapy may enable a better outcome. Further studies are needed to clarify the etiopathogenesis of the disease and help define an effective treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5e670fbe-1d3b-492f-aff9-467289395945", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed prognosis and life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected patients. Opportunistic infections and other immunodeficiency-associated conditions are minimized, and patients can live longer. However, HAART can determine some quite debilitating side effects  such as the HIV-1-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) . Its primary characteristic is an increase of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), often accompanied by a lipoatrophy of the subcutaneous tissue in the face, arms, and legs . In addition, adipose tissue may accumulate in pubis, neck or trunk  and in dorso-cervical area (buffalo hump) . Etiopathogenesis of HARS is still unknown. Infection stage, host factors and HAART exposure are involved . <sup>“ </sup> Buffalo hump” is a common presentation of HARS and can cause significant disfigurement to the patient. A recent study estimated in 6% its prevalence among HAART-treated patients . Buffalo hump may result from alterations of the adipocytes at those sites. In fact, these cells express the brown fat uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) gene, thus suggesting disturbances in the brown-versus-white adipocyte differentiation pattern . Another hypothesis is the involvement of adipocyte mitochondrial disturbances  with a site-specific compensatory response to metabolic dysregulation, or an enhanced local toxicity elicited by HIV-1 itself and/or by HAART. Although medical treatments including recombinant growth hormone and anabolic steroids  have been used with improvements, surgical approach remains the mainstay of correction of buffalo hump .\n\n【2】HIV-1 infected individuals are at increased risk of developing non-AIDS cancers, particularly those associated with infections and smoking. Non-AIDS cancers were greater among men than women and among those with AIDS than those without AIDS; however, no substantial difference was observed by HAART era. Patients having a history of tobacco or alcohol abuse, should be carefully examined for head and neck tumors that are likely to be more aggressive . In uninfected general population, laryngeal cancer accounts for 2% of all cancers and 60% of those of the head and neck and occurs most frequently in males . In HIV-1 patients laryngeal cancer incidence is 1.5 times greater than in general population . Clinical course of the tumor may be more aggressive and this may be related to an impairment of immune surveillance mechanisms secondary to HIV-1 .\n\n【3】Treatment of laryngeal cancer involves many disciplines and requires more caution in HIV-1 patients.\n\n【4】We describe the outcome of a HIV-1 infected subject under rescue HAART, who developed a laryngeal cancer in the setting of a buffalo hump and metabolic disturbances. The relationship between the overlapping pathologies is analyzed.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】On March 1990, a 68 year-old heterosexual man presenting with severe thrombocytopenia and recurrent herpes zoster was diagnosed as having a HIV-1 infection stage B3, according to the Centers for Disease Control classification system . A generalized lymphoadenopathy with CD4+ T cell count of 180 cells/µL was present and a zidovudine-based antiretroviral therapy was started. Hepatotropic virus serology (HAV, HBV and HCV) was negative. Familiarity for hypertension and dyslipidemia, and tobacco smoking were also present. Up to 2000, he changed several antiretroviral treatments, from mono-dual therapies with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to protease inhibitor (PI)-based triple combination treatments (including indinavir). A partial immune recovery was observed and plasma HIV-RNA levels sometimes reached undetectable values, with occasional high triglyceride and cholesterol levels. A fat redistribution was also evident, with VAT increase and lipoatrophy on arms and legs, and an initial buffalo hump. On January 2001, treatment was replaced with lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine-fixed dose (inconsistent compliance and virological failure), with worsening in fat redistribution and lipid levels, needing lipid-lowering therapy. In November 2007, patient showed a severe immunodeficiency (CD4+ 13%, 120 cells/µL) with 56.000 copies/mL of HIV-RNA so, based on the results of a genotypic resistance test, darunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir + tenofovir and lamivudine/zidovudine fixed-dose were started. Three months later, plasma HIV-RNA reached undetectable levels (< 50 copies/mL) and CD4+ raised to 19% (202 cells/µL). Subsequently, hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation was diagnosed and an anti-arrhythmic, anticoagulant and anti-platelet therapy added to HAART, but patient developed an ischemic stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory. In November 2008, after an acute bronco-pneumonia, he was treated for a left carotid stenosis (85%) and developed a reactive depression with behavioral changes. On April 2009, HAART was simplified with darunavir/ritonavir plus raltegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir fixed-dose. Viro-immunological assessment showed HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL, CD4+ 18% (295 cells/µL), and normal metabolic parameters. On December 2009, triglycerides and cholesterol were uncontrolled despite the lipid-lowering treatment, whereas buffalo hump determined a functional limitation in head and neck movements. Moreover, patient referred recent onset of persistent cough and dysphonia with dysphagia. A fiberscope examination showed an exophytic neoformation with irregular limits (diameter 2 cm) in the laryngeal epiglottis face. A CT angiography confirmed the neoformation (2.2 × 1.8 cm) in the supraglottic region involving the laryngeal side of epiglottis (with infiltration of the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic fat) and extension to the right epiglottal ear pocket; no thyroid cartilage erosions or nodes involvement; severe lipodystrophy of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the submandibular, retronucal and dorsal region (antero-posterior diameter 7.4 cm, transverse 16 cm, longitudinal 8.8 cm.). The tumor staging was T3N0Mx. Histological examination showed an infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. According to the 2008 American Cancer Society guidelines , patient underwent a radiation therapy (RT) and platinum-based chemotherapy (CHT) protocol, without HAART discontinuation. The treatment was well tolerated, with only a grade 2 dysphagia and mucositis. A CT scan showed the laryngeal cancer disappearance without significant changes in the buffalo hump mass (antero-posterior diameter 6.0 cm, transverse 15 cm, longitudinal 8.8 cm), despite patient’s 5 kilograms weight loss . Immune activation and metabolic profiles were assessed by plasma concentrations of IL-6 (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), leptin (Adipogen International, SOUTH KOREA), adiponectin (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and resistin (Adipogen International, SOUTH KOREA), using commercially available kits, being these cytokines a marker of altered lipid and glucose metabolism in HIV-1 patients receiving HAART.\n\n【7】Two measurements were performed: the first one before the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer and the other one during the second year of follow-up .\n\n【8】All assays were performed in duplicate. Low adiponectin with high leptin and IL-6 levels were found before cancer diagnosis. At the second determination similar results were found. Patient’s metabolic profile was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), using the standardized formula (fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5), and by the body mass index (BMI) calculation. HOMA-IR index was 0.24, whereas BMI resulted 30.06 (slightly high). Patient then entered in a follow-up program with bimonthly clinical and fiberscope examination in the first year, quarterly in the second year, then every six months. He is currently followed on regular basis, and no signs of relapse are present; HIV RNA levels are always < 50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts are increased from 89/µL (12%, nadir post-CHT) to 273/µL (18%).\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Causes of metabolic alterations and adipose tissue modifications in HIV-1 patients during HAART are different and controversial, in fact antiretroviral drugs, hormonal changes and cytokine level alterations are involved. Moreover it has been hypothesized that adipocyte functions may play an important role in the development of HARS-associated metabolic abnormalities. Adipocytes are metabolically and hormonally active, secreting proteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, TNF-α, IL-6, and leptin . Some antiretroviral drugs inhibit differentiation and induce insulin resistance and apoptosis in adipose cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PIs and NRTIs increase secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, which are involved in altered adipocyte functions, and decrease production of adiponectin, a positive modulator of insulin sensitivity. Adipocytes also produce a protein (resistin) that plays an important function as a link between obesity and insulin resistance. Adiponectin is a structural homologue of the TNF-α family of trimeric cytokines with anti-inflammatory properties that antagonize those of TNF-α . These disorders probably result in an increased release of free fatty acids by insulin-resistant adipose tissue. In fact, similar alterations are observed in fat and serum from HIV-1-infected lipodystrophic patients under HAART .\n\n【11】A cytokine production alteration plays a pivotal role in the development of insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and abnormal fibrinolysis, those are frequently described in metabolic syndrome. Hyper-insulinemia, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) also characterize this syndrome, often occurring in HIV-1 patients. Moreover, adiponectin negatively correlated with BMI, whereas its reduced levels have been associated with insulin resistance, high cholesterol and hyper-triglyceridemia and these alterations are involved in increased immune activation, responsible of the progressive immune depletion and, possibly, of the increased risk of malignancies. In fact, our patient showed impaired cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, reduced adiponectin levels and high pro-inflammatory cytokine production, as described in HIV-1 lipodystrophyc patients. Moreover, HOMA index and BMI value were slightly high, as described in patients with mild obesity. These findings strongly suggest the need to monitor patient for early detection of type-2 diabetes. RT/CHT protocol showed no impact on metabolic abnormalities, as well as on cytokine levels, that remained unchanged during follow up.\n\n【12】The risk of non-AIDS cancers among HIV-1 infected patients is much higher than in uninfected population, even after adjusting for age, gender, and race. Potential causes of this trend could be related to differences in lifestyle and rates of traditional cancer risk factors among HIV-1 patients, as well as to other viral infections (or HIV-1 itself), immune deficiency and immune activation .\n\n【13】In HIV-1 infected patients RT, and especially CHT, may cause life-threatening complications such as acute toxicity reactions . Subjects with a good performance status can be safety treated with standard radical RT if the CD4+ T cell count is > 200 cells/µL . Occasional reports of laryngeal cancer presenting a response to RT in HIV-1 patients with severe immune-suppression are described . Following surgery, AIDS patients may have worse wound healing and a greater tendency to contract infections. In this case, a combined RT/CHT approach was chosen taking in account the neoplasm staging and the presence of severe immune suppression at the diagnosis, not allowing patient to tolerate a surgical treatment. Furthermore, concurrent RT plus cisplatin is the standard organ-preservation protocol in patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer . Neck and buffalo hump adipose tissues did not hamper an effective RT response of the laryngeal cancer. Furthermore, the fatty mass volume was not affected by RT, as showed by the CT-scans and described for normal adipose tissue. Even if in previous reports buffalo hump was assimilated to a tissue with a high proliferation activity , our observations indicate that in this context adipocytes have a metabolic profile similar to those present in other sites.\n\n【14】The peculiarity of the case described lies in the relatively rare occurrence in a HIV-1 infected subject of a laryngeal cancer with long disease-free survival after RT/CHT, the concurrent buffalo hump with metabolic syndrome, and the lack of opportunistic complications despite iatrogenic worsening of immunodeficiency. In the past decade we observed only 4 cases of laryngeal cancer, including the present one, in a cohort of 800 subjects with HIV-1 disease. All were presenting an advanced TNM staging and died within 6 - 12 months from the diagnosis. The not aggressive trend observed in this subject, despite several concomitant pathologies, may be probably related to TNM staging (T3N0Mx) and early diagnosis. Furthermore, presence of a high performance score and lack of severe immunodeficiency before RT/CHT, with a low grade toxicity observed, and the protective role exerted by HAART could all have contributed to the favourable outcome.\n\n【15】Since it has been hypothesized that in HIV-1 infected patients lipodystrophy would be a marker of early metabolic syndrome, a correct management of HIV-1 infected patients need to individualize antiretroviral therapy, choosing drugs with lower metabolic impact, as recommended in current guidelines . Furthermore, considering the HAART-related life expectancy increase and the presence of lifestyle-related risk factors, it is important in HIV-1 infected patients to implement an expanded and accurate screening for an early detection and treatment of cancers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, there is a concomitant increase in concern and sensitivity for associated opportunistic infections . These agents suppress activity of TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine crucial for human response to infection. In fact, several opportunistic infections have been described in association with therapy with anti-TNF . The first randomized anti-TNF trial has described only one case of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Since then, there has been growing evidence that anti-TNF therapy increases the risk of TB infection, with a possible difference between the three anti-TNF drugs used: infliximab and adalimumab with higher associated risk than etanercept .\n\n【2】Screening for latent TB prior to initiation of therapy has reduced the incidence of active TB, although it is not completely preventable. There are cases of disease reactivation even after adequate treatment at the start of biological therapy. The possibility of active TB should always be considered in cases with suggestive clinical features or suspect imaging findings, even after chemoprophylaxis . Portugal has an intermediate incidence of TB (22 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016) compared to the rest of Europe; as a result, patients on anti-TNF therapy will have, therefore, a higher incidence of infection . Different from the presentation of the infection in immunocompetent patients, an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated with TNF blockade is more commonly as an extrapulmonary presentation. As described by Keane et al, of the 70 documented cases of TB infection with anti-TNF treatment, 57% were extrapulmonary and 25% disseminated .\n\n【3】We report a rare case of extrapulmonary TB in a patient using adalimumab.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】This was a 59-year-old woman, Caucasian, with a previous history of osteoarticular TB (Pott’s disease) at the age of 7 years old. Since then, she had no history of infection or contact with other TB patients.\n\n【6】She was diagnosed as Behcet’s disease with a 23-year-old history of outbreaks of oral ulcers. Since the age of 55 years, she started with severe gastrointestinal manifestations, irresponsive to corticosteroids and infliximab. She began adalimumab treatment 3 years ago with clinical improvement. Before anti-TNF therapy, she completed 9 months of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis.\n\n【7】The patient presented with high fever, asthenia and night sweats for 1 month, without other symptoms associated. Blood tests were innocent, with a slight protein C elevation. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Pulmonary X-ray and abdominal ultrasound didn’t reveal any findings. After 2 weeks of the first symptoms, she complained with left pain, without trauma associated. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left psoas muscle mass (diameter 4 - 14 cm with calcifications) . She was submitted to percutaneous drainage of the abscess and the microbiologic study revealed nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which was also detected in cultures.\n\n【8】The patient began treatment with classic association of antibiotics that included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 9 months with complete resolution of the abscess .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The introduction of anti-TNF therapy drastically altered the approach to immune-mediated diseases. TNF plays a key role in host defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , mediating granuloma formation and homeostasis and consequent bacilli content in latent TB infection . Consequently, a number of cases of TB have been documented in patients under anti-TNF therapy such as etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab . This risk appears to be 3 to 4 times higher with infliximab and adalimumab when compared to etanercept . It is believed that most cases are consecutive of latent TB reactivation and therefore, in countries with high or intermedium incidence, the screening is recommended before initiation of therapy and treated accordingly. Several studies have shown that chemoprophylaxis of latent TB before or during anti-TNF therapy reduces the risk of reactivation and consequently more severe forms of infection .\n\n【11】In clinical trials prior to the screening for TB, only 7 cases of active infection were reported in Europe. After the introduction of the screening in adalimumab clinical trials, there was an increase in the number of cases to 23 cases until 2005 and 59 cases until 2014 .\n\n【12】In the present case, the active infection was documented despite screening and treatment of latent TB, and is a rare extrapulmonary presentation.\n\n【13】The psoas abscess was first described in 1881 and remains a rare infection in developed countries. It can be termed as primary if the focus is unknown or by hematogenous spread or secondary if there is an abdominal or retroperitoneal infection. It is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus , or other agents present in intestinal flora . The immunosuppression is one of the major associated risk factors and for this reason, agents such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be considered.\n\n【14】Although several cases of extrapulmonary infection have been described , the authors only found one case of muscular TB in patients with adalimumab in literature .\n\n【15】This case highlights the importance of the high suspicion threshold for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In immunocompromised patients, the clinical presentation is usually very subtle, extrapulmonary and rare forms are more frequent and may progress rapidly to more severe forms. Adequate early and therapeutic diagnosis will allow improving the long-term prognosis with resolution of the infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2c7f60a4-78a0-44b6-b38f-26a39fed4bfd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The teeth eruption is defined as the occlusal or axial movement of the teeth from its developmental position within the jaw to its functional position in the occlusal plane . The impacted teeth are known as the teeth which cease to erupt before emergence to the oral cavity. Insufficient space, early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space, crowding of arches and rotation of tooth buds are the common and important reasons attributed to delayed eruption. Excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth is also one of the most common causes, with eruption cysts being relatively rare .\n\n【2】Complete lack of eruptive force can be the reason for unerupted tooth when the normal number of teeth is present radiographically, although this is debatable, since few workers have debunked this claim . Syndromes, metabolic, and hormonal disorders are also other causes of multiple impacted permanent teeth. Finally crowding and rotation of tooth buds can also lead to impacted teeth .\n\n【3】The objective of this study is to increase the importance and awareness of cases of multiple unerupted (impacted) teeth in which multiple etiologies need to be discussed and investigated.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 34-year-old Saudi male patient reported with a chief complaint of missing teeth and compromised aesthetics. The patient was of normal build with no previous medical history. Dentally, all of the maxillary erupted teeth were treated endodontically. He had no relevant family history and this was his first prosthodontics visit. On further enquiry the patient revealed that he had loss of deciduous teeth with no eruption of permanent teeth. On examination, a total of 13 teeth were present in the patient’s oral cavity exhibited with fluorosis and arrested caries . The patient had multiple impacted permanent teeth with only the permanent maxillary central and lateral incisors, mandibular central and lateral incisors, right maxillary second molar and second premolar, left maxillary second premolar, and mandibular first molars are present. The incisal length of the maxillary central incisors appeared reduced, reduced vertical dimension of occlusion, pseudo class III malocclusion and the patient had a deep palatal vault. When orthopantomogram (OPG) was performed, it demonstrated impacted, unerupted, and missing mandibular third molars . Skull X-rays did not reveal other anomalies , and the chest X-ray was unremarkable .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Epidemiological studies have reported dental impactions to affect 25% to 50% of the population . Multiple impactions are seen rarely and are usually associated with systemic conditions. Guided eruption of many teeth with the help of coordinated multidisciplinary management is needed for patients with multiple impactions .\n\n【8】There are numerous eruption-regulating molecules having similar and overlapping functions, which ensure that even the absence of a single factor does not interrupt the event of eruption . But defect in some genes may be responsible for this condition. EGF, EGF-R, CSF-1, CSF-1R, IL-1, IL-1R, c-Fos, NFB, MCP-1, TGF-β1, PTHrP, Cbfa-l (now called Runx2), OPG, and RANK/RANKL are the major tooth eruption molecules. Stellate reticulum is the site for few molecules with the majority of the eruption molecules residing in the dental follicle .\n\n【9】While most eruption defects are part of a genetic syndrome, they can also be non-familial, as in the case in primary failure of eruption (PFE). In PFE localized failure of eruption of permanent teeth exists with no other systemic involvement.\n\n【10】Hence, it is likely that genes like CSF-1, NFB, and c-fos are the genes responsible for the eruption defect .\n\n【11】The causes of tooth impaction are divided into generalized and localized. Cleidocranial dysplasia is the most common syndromal cause of tooth impaction. Common reasons like lack of space, prolonged retention or early loss of deciduous tooth, abnormal position of tooth bud, presence of alveolar cleft, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, alveolar or dental trauma, and dilacerations of teeth falling into the localized category .\n\n【12】Multiple impacted teeth are usually present in syndromes. The differential diagnoses in case of syndromes are cleidocranial dysostosis, Gardner’s syndrome, Gorlin-Sedano syndrome, and Yunis-Varon Syndrome .\n\n【13】In the case of cleidocranial dysplasia the patients usually exhibit high-arched palate with prolonged retention of the deciduous teeth leading to subsequent delay in eruption of the permanent teeth. Though both the intraoral features were present in our case, the abnormalities of skull and shoulder girdle along with multiple supernumerary impacted teeth were absent. Gardner’s syndrome that also presents with multiple impacted teeth was ruled out as associated signs like multiple epidermoid cysts and other lesions were absent. Gorlin-Sedano syndrome represents as short hands, foot bones with short and straight collar bone along with multiple impacted teeth . Features of Yunis-Varon syndrome are agenesis or hypoplasia of clavicle, severe micrognathia, digital anomalies, hypodontia, spinal defects, and impacted teeth. Both the syndromes presented with multiple impacted teeth but were ruled out from our case as other symptoms were not present.\n\n【14】In the case of hormonal disorders, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism are to be considered.\n\n【15】Estimation of T3, T4, and TSH is required for diagnosing hypothyroidism where there is low serum T4 and elevated TSH. Evaluation of total serum calcium concentration and serum parathyroid hormone is required for hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. There is decrease of serum calcium in both and elevation of parathyroid hormone in pseudohypoparathyroidism and decrease of hormone in hypoparathyroidism.\n\n【16】Metabolic disorders like Vitamin D deficiency rickets are also associated with impacted teeth. In our case, further investigations were needed to rule out metabolic and hormonal disorders. Failure of eruption could also be due to crowding of supernumerary teeth , but that was not observed in our case.\n\n【17】Dental history and radiographic examination in this case ruled out partial anodontia. The medical and family histories along with extraoral examination were not suggestive of any syndrome or metabolic disorder.\n\n【18】Only a few cases of non-syndrome multiple impacted teeth were reported . In those studies the predominant explanation was that some physical barrier led to impaction and non-eruption of teeth .\n\n【19】Duration and results of treatment in less frequent cases of multiple impactions is a major concern when compared to more frequent single tooth impaction cases . Multidisciplinary approach would be the appropriate choice as treatment involves aesthetics, functional, and oral health problems . In case of multiple impacted teeth, orthodontic extrusion may be attempted. In view of the pathological potential of the impacted teeth, surgical removal is recommended. Rehabilitation of the patient with fixed dentures needs to be planned with the help of a prosthodontist and implantologist. Obtaining stable results along with enhanced esthetics, oral health, and function would be the objective of the treatment .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9ca175cb-6ee9-4579-ad16-163315f0266a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Ependymoma is a glial neoplasm arising from ependymal cells inside the fourth ventricle and encircles the central canal in the spinal cord . Ependymoma accounts for 2-9% of all glial neuroepithelial tumors . The incidence rate of ependymoma is higher in children. But it is much less seen in adults . Anaplastic ependymoma is the most aggressive form . Anaplastic ependymoma accounts for 8.6-11.5% of all ependymoma . According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2007 classification of central nervous system tumors, low-grade ependymoma was grade 2 and anaplastic ependymoma was grade 3 . Ependymomas located outside the ventricles are called ectopic, cortical, lobar or extra-ventricular ependymomas .\n\n【2】Supratentorial extraventricular anaplastic ependymoma (SEAE) arises outside of the ventricles, having any connections to the ventricles. SEAE is a very rare pathology . There are only 47 cases of SEAE in the literature . We found 20 reported cases or case series that had the same characteristics as this study prior to June 2014  . Only one reported case dealt with pregnancy . We report a case of a patient with an SEAE that presented with a pregnant and purely cystic appearance on MRI and computed tomography (CT).\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 28-year-old female had no complaints during the first 6 months of her pregnancy, but in the last 3 months, she suffered increasing headaches and involuntary spasms in her right arm. In the 2 weeks before the birth, severe headaches and loss of control complaints started. In the first week postpartum, the monoparesis in the right arm increased more and a speech disorder, due to dysarthria and focal seizure, presented. With these complaints, patient was admitted to the neurosurgery clinic; on cranial CT images in the second week postpartum, a pure cystic mass about 3 × 4 cm in size was shown inside the left superficial precentral gyrus . The tumor appeared as a hypointense cystic mass on the T1-weighted MRI and hyperintense on the T2-weighted MRI images . However, there was not a solid part of, nor were there connections to, ventricles . There was minimal surrounding peritumoral brain edema . After an injection of gadolinium, enhancement was peripherally ring shaped .\n\n【5】In surgery, a left temporoparietal craniotomy was performed. After opening the dura flap, we stayed in front of the precentral gyrus and reached 2 - 3 mm distance from the cortical sulci to the mass. We encountered the mass without a capsule and the solid part. There was minimal necrosis and the cyst fluid was clear. The ventricle was not opened. The initial surgical view was suggestive of metastases or tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS). The cyst wall was scraped. Eventually, gross total resection was achieved.\n\n【6】In a histopathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin staining, a high mitotic index and perivascular pseudo-rosettes were detected. The percentage of anaplasty inside the tumor was above 75%. The tumor was also diffusedly stained with GFAP, S-100, and CD99  . It was diagnosed as a WHO grade 3 anaplastic ependymoma .\n\n【7】In the postoperative term, dysphasia and monoparesis in the right arm decreased. However, 2 months after the operation, it was seen that the mass had grown larger  and a second resection was carried out . The cranium was not closed after the operation. Four months after the second operation, the patient’s headaches gradually increased. When the epileptic seizures could not be controlled with medication, a third resection was carried out . In the final operation, the cranium defect was enlarged and the skin was closed after a large duraplasty on the brain . It was observed that the cystic mass reformed in the next 3-month period . Within this period, the patient’s general condition was good, except for the hemiparesis on the right side and behavioral changes. The mass content was aspirated twice with punctures. The patient chose not to accept radiotherapy. At the end of 9-month medical and surgical treatment, cerebral herniation developed and the patient’s death occurred . Patient with pregnancy depression could not be given any medical chemotherapeutic drugs. In spite of everything, the aggressive growth of the tumor could not be prevented.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Intracranial ependymoma is commonly located in the posterior fossa and children, accounting for 10% of pediatric brain tumors . However, they are relatively rare in adults. Supratentorial ependymomas are usually not related to the ventricular system. They are frequently located adjacent to the cortical surface, similar to our case . Supratentorial ependymomas in adults are unusual lesions, often found to be of the anaplastic variant . While the tumors that form in the lateral ventricle expand toward the cerebral tissue, tumors may also sometimes appear purely in a cortical location . The described tumor (SEAE) is extraordinarily rare. And SEAE is likely located in the frontal and parietal superficial cortexes .\n\n【10】There is a hypothesis that extraventricular or cortical ependymomas may form from the insertion of an embryonic ependymal tissue remnant into the cerebral cortex during the brain parenchyma’s development . Within this, it has been reported that, although they generally form in the nervous system, they also very rarely form extracranially . It is thought that extracranial ependymomas grow when the patient is carrying an embryo from remnants in the neural tube or multiply from teratomas . It has been reported that, from the remnants left in the neural tube, ependymomas may develop in the sacrococcygeal extraspinal region, ovaries, para-ovarian tissues, the omentum, the posterior mediastinum, and even in the lungs . In the literature, there are very few ovarian ependymoma cases reported .\n\n【11】Supratentorial ependymomas generally originate from the third or, less likely, lateral ventricle walls and grow from there . During their growth, they might reach the cerebral cortex surface and even hold onto the pial surface . When the SEAE has a cortical location, they may not be detected until they reach a very large size . SEAE just like other cortical tumor lesions, generally causes seizures. There might also be complaints, such as focal neurological deficit, vomiting, and headache, all related to intracranial pressure . As in our case, it has been reported that the clinical features appear as they expand toward the cortex’s surface .\n\n【12】As they do not have typical images radiologically, it is not possible to distinguish supratentorial glial tumors . While normal white matter is iso- or hypointense around the lesion on non-contrast T1 MRI, it might appear as hyperintense on T2 images. Signal heterogeneity exists in focal lesions, and necrosis focals are often found on these tumors. They are contrasted at variable rates, but, generally, they have a necrotic surface, both on CT and MRI, with medium contrasting on the centers . Generally, they might have both solid and cystic components of larger than 4 cm . Due to their location and radiological features, low-grade astrocytoma must have a histopathological differential diagnosis from glioblastoma multiforme, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, ganglioglioma, and oligodendroglioma . Furthermore, in the first detection of the case, it was thought that its superficial, purely cystic appearance and minimal peritumoral edema might belong to tumefactive multiple sclerosis . We waited to see whether the patient would respond to the methasone. When no change was seen in the lesion-control MRI, a surgical resection decision was made. The necessary histopathological differential diagnosis is shown in Table 2 .\n\n【13】In the histological aspect, tumor cells characteristically contain perivascular pseudo-rosettes, and, to a lesser extent, ependymal rosettes . In a pathological examination, according to the WHO classification, ependymomas are divided into four groups. They are classified as subependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, classic ependymoma, and anaplastic ependymoma. Anaplastic ependymoma, as found in our case, has characteristics of high cellularity, variable nuclear atypia, significant mitotic activity, significant vascular proliferation, and cellular structure defects, and is reported as a WHO grade 3 malignant character tumor . As the high-grade intracranial malignant tumoral lesions have an abnormal and fragile vascular structure, they may cause spontaneous bleeding . In our case, due to the increasing clotting tendency effect of pregnancy, intra-tumoral bleeding may not have formed. No intra-tumoral bleeding was shown in the MRI or computed tomography (CT) images of this case.\n\n【14】In our review of the literature, it was seen that SEAE emerged frequently as high-grade tumors in adults. Because of this, the prognosis is poor for SEAE. While median survival is 15 years in low-grade tumors, in high-grade tumors, the maximum survival is 1.5 years . In the literature, the 5-year survival rate without recurrence is 75%, but, in those characterized as aggressive, this period is less than 31% . The severe negative prognostic criteria are determined as: a young age, incomplete tumor resection, histological anaplasia, and supratentorial localization . It is reported that it is necessary to carry out an as-large-as-possible resection for SEAE characterized as anaplastic to reduce or eliminate recurrence . But it relapsed after all resections. Due to their high mitotic activities, they are radiosensitive and postoperative radiotherapy is definitely recommended . There are some who recommend radiotherapy, especially when incomplete resection was carried out, in only high-grade cases . The patient had just completed her pregnancy and refused radiotherapy due to the worry that there may be adverse effects on the baby.\n\n【15】Co-occurrence of the pathology that presented with the pregnancy made us think that there was a relationship between them. There is multiplying from teratomas by means of pluripotent stem cells and their occurrence from embryonic origin remnants made us think that pregnancy had an effect on the formation of this tumor. Is it possible that the stem cell remnants inside the cerebral cortex, which have an ability to multiply and differentiate, were stimulated during the pregnancy? Possibly due to this, the clinical findings of this case appeared in the last trimester of the pregnancy. The role of hormone receptors in the growth of meningiomas that are meningotelial central nervous system tumors is known . The presence of progesterone receptors was detected in 61% of meningiomas . In this case, progesterone sensitivity like that of meningiomas was not detected using immunostaining.\n\n【16】Ependymoma patients have molecularly distinct diseases and that the heterogeneity seen on the chromosome level also applies at the gene expression level . Different age-related immunohistochemical patterns and genetic variations have been found associated with the outcome of ependymoma patients; the main biological mechanisms are still unclear . Therefore, direct effect of pregnancy was not found.\n\n【17】The relation between pregnancy and ependymoma was mentioned by Schweitzer et al in cauda equina ependymoma 15 case series . Jaeger et al reported a lumbar ependymoma case that was first diagnosed in pregnancy . The most frequent period in which lumbar ependymomas are seen is the third and fourth decades of life; this period is also compatible from a fertility angle. Is it possible that there is a factor in pregnancy facilitating the growth of ependymomas and their becoming symptomatic? The physiological changes occurring in the body that provide enough blood support to the placenta during the normal period of pregnancy consist of systemic vasodilation and rising cardiac output . This condition results in an increase of perfusion in almost every organ in the body. Increased blood flow may lead to the provision of necessary blood support for the growth of an anaplastic tumor. The increase of headache in the last trimester of the pregnancy shows that the mass effect of the tumor had become evident in the final trimester. Only one similar case was found in the literature. However, the tumor had occurred during the first trimester and located infratentorially in the fourth ventricle  .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】SEAE is rare in all studies and there are no absolute proofs about the etiology of SEAE . However, from a neurological perspective, the evaluation of cases with severe headaches occurring during pregnancy can contribute to the early diagnosis of cranial pathologies of this kind. More comprehensive studies on pregnancy and neuroglial tumors to be carried out in the future will provide us with more benefits in determining the cause-and-effect relationship of these two conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b2505bf4-d494-4838-a8b7-d0994ebbc40b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is a well known disorder which manifests with benign tumors in various organ systems, including tubers and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) of the brain, lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) of the lungs, rhabdomyomas of the heart, facial angiofibromas, as well as angiomyolipomas (AML) of the kidneys . It afflicts nearly 40,000 individuals in the USA . Nearly 80% of patients with TS have renal manifestations . TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressor genes. In patients with TS, a germ line mutation is usually present in TSC1 or TSC2 but a “second hit” leads to inactivation of both alleles of one gene. Inactivation of both alleles of TSC1 or TSC2 is required for the manifestations of TS to develop . The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Only 20% of patients with TS have a positive family history; while the other 80% of patients have de novo mutations . The products of TSC1 and TSC2 are hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These two gene products inactivate Rheb, which is a protein vital in regulating cellular growth and cell cycle progression, and thereby, inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a serine/threonine protein kinase. The mTOR forms either mTOR complex 1 or complex 2. The mTOR complex 1 is rapamycin-sensitive; mTOR complex 2 is rapamycin-insensitive. The mTOR complex 1 has an integral role in cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. The absence of hamartin or tuberin, due to a mutation in TSC 1 or TSC2 respectively, leads to unregulated increase in mTOR activity which in turn leads to the manifestations and progression of different Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) lesions .\n\n【2】Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis\n\n【3】The renal manifestations of TS are either mesenchymal in origin (angiomyolipomas) or epithelial in origin (carcinomas, oncocytomas, or cysts). By far, renal angiomyolipomas have been the most studied of all renal manifestations of TS. Renal angiomyolipomas are non malignant lesions composed of vessels, smooth muscle, and fat. The incidence of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with TS is roughly 55-75% . Renal angiomyolipomas are the second leading cause of death in patients with TS . Initial management of renal angiomyolipomas is monitoring of growth with periodic ultrasound (US) or cross sectional imaging studies such as contrast enhanced MRI or CT scan. Major risks associated with renal angiomyelolipomas include hemorrhage, compression of adjacent renal parenchyma, compression of adjacent organs, and kidney failure. Lesions larger than 4 cm in size are more likely to develop hemorrhage compared to smaller ones . Progressive growth of renal angiomyolipomas or conversion to malignant renal tumors may lead to loss of renal function in approximately 5% of TS patients . To date embolization and/or surgical resection have been the mainstay of treatment of renal angiomyolipomas .\n\n【4】Management of patients with TS with mTOR inhibitors\n\n【5】In the last decade, mTOR inhibitors have emerged as a potential systemic treatment strategy to halt the growth of renal angiomyolipomas and to prevent life threatening complications such as bleeding, which becomes more prevalent with increase in the size of these lesions . The mTOR inhibitors bind the receptor protein FKBP-12. Immunosuppressant drugs also bind FKBP-12. The binding of mTOR inhibitors to FKBP-12 forms an inhibitory complex with high affinity for mTOR complex 1 but not for mTOR complex 2 . The proteins S6K1 and 4EBP1 play a key role in coordinating translation factors and ribosomal activity. The inhibitory complex formed from the binding of an mTOR inhibitor and FKBP-12 affects S6K1 and 4EBP1 which in turn results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and impairment of cell proliferation in renal angiomyiolipomas . Case reports in patients with TS have shown that treatment with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (rapamycin) effectively controls renal angiomyolipoma-associated bleeding, halts growth, and reduces the volume of renal angiomyolipomas . These studies suggest a role of mTOR inhibition in the regression of renal angiomyolipomas and in the management of extra renal manifestations of TS. Everolimus is an oral derivative of sirolimus (rapamycin) with improved pharmacokinetics including better bioavailability and CNS penetration compared to sirolimus (rapamycin) .\n\n【6】The present report describes two young adult female patients with sporadic TS, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas (AML) and other manifestations characteristic of TS treated with everolimus 10 mg per mouth daily. The radiographic changes of renal angiomyolipoma lesions and clinical outcome with everolimus are described and discussed.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】The first patient is a 20-year-old Hispanic female with a history of sporadic TS who initially presented to our center to establish care for the management of her TS and bilateral renal AML. The patient was diagnosed with TS after presenting with a seizure at 2 months of age. She had a prior embolization of an AML lesion of the right kidney three years prior at an outside facility. On presentation she had multiple skin angiofibromas predominantly on her face and displayed mild cognitive deficits. An MRI of the brain showed cortical tubers, white matter lesions, and subependymal hamartomas which were largely unchanged from prior scans. SEGA lesions were not identified. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest did not show evidence of lung lymphangiomatosis or cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma. Several small AML lesions of the liver were identified. The patient initiated treatment with everolimus 10 mg per day. She tolerated oral mTOR inhibitor therapy very well without serious adverse events. The main side effect was a mild and transient rise in the serum triglyceride level to 204 mg/dL compared to 131 mg/dL one month prior. The hypertriglyceridemia improved with diet control. Six months after initiation of therapy, there was noticeable improvement in the patient’s skin angiofibromas. A baseline cognitive assessment was not obtained; therefore, we do not have an objective comparison to validate the improvement in the patient’s mood and cognition reported by the patient’s caregiver. Thirteen months after initiation of everolimus, a contrast enhanced MRI of the brain was unchanged compared to the baseline study. New brain lesions were not identified. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained at two weeks and eleven months post therapy initiation. In the right kidney, a fatty mass arising from the lower pole and extending into the perinephric space was seen. The mass involved the lower half of the right kidney. Due to its amorphous shape and indistinct margins, accurate measurements could not be obtained. The mass had an initial density of -88 Hounsfield units (HU), slightly higher than the density of the surrounding perinephric fat. The mass was consistent with a large renal AML lesion. After eleven months of treatment with everolimus, the density of the right renal AML lesion decreased to -99 HU, likely reflecting an increase in fatty component. The renal mass had become isodense with the surrounding perinephric fat and its margins were no longer visible. There also appeared to be less linear densities suggestive of a reduction in vascularity. A right renal hilar AML lesion, measuring 2.8 cm × 2.1 cm in cross section and 1.8 cm CC in the initial CT scan of the abdomen increased in size to 3.2 cm × 2.2 cm in cross section and 2.4 cm CC on the CT scan of the abdomen done eleven months after oral mTOR inhibitor therapy initiation. This right renal hilar AML lesion also appeared more fatty and less vascular. Its density was 5 HU in the initial CT scan of the abdomen and had decreased to -86 HU in the CT scan done eleven months after initiation of everolimus . Numerous, smaller renal cysts appeared grossly unchanged in the initial and follow up CT scans of the abdomen. In the left kidney, the renal hilum was markedly splayed by a conglomerate of fatty AML lesions, which also showed an increasing amount of fat content and a decrease in vascularity in the CT scan of the abdomen done after eleven months of treatment with everolimus . An AML lesion in the left renal hilum projecting medially, measured 4.9 cm AP and 8.7 cm × 4.9 cm on coronal view in the eleven month post therapy CT scan of the abdomen compared to 4.8 cm AP and 7.9 cm × 4.8 cm on coronal view on the initial CT scan of the abdomen. After eleven months of treatment with everolimus the density of the left renal hilar AML lesion described above decreased from -54 HU to -86 HU consistent with an increase in fatty content. This mass also appeared less vascular . A mass in the mid segment of the left kidney projecting anteriorly, measured 3.9 cm AP and 4.8 cm × 5.3 cm on coronal view in the eleven month post therapy CT scan of the abdomen compared to 4.8 cm AP and 4.1 cm × 4.7 cm on coronal view on initial CT scan of the abdomen. After eleven months of treatment with everolimus the density of the left renal hilar AML lesion described above decreased from -77 HU to -96 HU. This mass also appeared less vascular  (depict as M2). The mass in the mid lower segment, measured 5.4 cm AP and 5.7 cm × 5.3 cm oblique on coronal view on CT scan completed eleven months post therapy compared to 4.8 cm AP and 5.8 cm × 5.1 cm oblique on coronal view on initial CT scan of the abdomen. After eleven months of treatment with everolimus the density of the left renal hilar AML lesion described above decreased from -78HU to -94HU. It also appeared less vascular.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】The second patient is a 24-year-old Asian female who was diagnosed with sporadic TS at the age of 3 months after presenting with seizures. More recently she had developed severe and sudden abdominal pain due to acute bleeding into a right renal pseudoaneurysm associated with a large AML lesion for which she underwent emergent right renal coil embolization. The patient reported a history of chronic seizure disorder. A contrast enhanced MRI of the brain showed multiple cortical and subcortical tubers as well lesions highly suggestive of SEGAs. A contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest showed multiple pulmonary cysts and nodules not characteristic of LAMs. Also, the patient had innumerable facial angiofibromas. She underwent a repeat embolization of the right kidney AML lesions five months after the initial embolization. Subsequently she was prescribed oral everolimus 10 milligrams (mg) daily. Treatment was associated with mild to moderate superficial oral ulcerations one month after treatment initiation of everolimus for which the oral mTOR inhibitor was held for one week. The patient had complete resolution of oral mucosal superficial ulceration and reinitiated treatment with everolimus 10 mg per mouth daily. Six weeks after initiation of everolimus, contrast enhanced MRI of the brain showed stable TS lesions. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at one month and five months after initiation of everolimus were compared to a baseline CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained prior to initiation of everolimus. The baseline contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen showed an AML lesion involving the mid segment of the right kidney measuring 4.5 cm × 4.5 cm in cross section and 3.5 cm CC. Three months after treatment with everolimus, this AML lesion had decreased in size to 1.9 cm × 1.9 cm in diameter and 1.8 cm CC. Five months after treatment with everolimus, the same lesion was stable and measured 2.0 cm × 2.0 cm in diameter and 1.8 cm CC. Of note, the radiographic density of the right renal mid segment AML lesion increased during treatment with everolimus. The radiographic density was 240 HU after five months of treatment with everolimus, markedly increased from 125 HU and 107 HU in the CT scans obtained after three months and prior to initiation of everolimus therapy respectively. The increase in the radiographic density of the right renal AML lesion suggests a decrease in its fatty component and/or increase in vascularity . An AML lesion located in the mid right kidney measuring 4.0 cm × 4.5 cm on the initial CT scan prior to everolimus therapy was noted to have a central lucency, which indicated either necrosis or hemorrhage. Three months after treatment it measured 2.3 cm × 2.8 cm in cross section was difficult to delineate at five months post therapy initiation with everolimus .\n\n【12】A large solid mass involving the lower pole of the right kidney became cystic after three months of treatment with everolimus. It appears as two adjacent but separate cysts. The first of the two lesions located in the hilum of the right kidney, projecting anteriorly, had decreased in size to 1.5 cm × 1.9 cm in cross section and 1.8 cm CC five months after treatment with everolimus compared to 2.1 cm × 2.2 cm in cross section and 2.4 cm CC three months after initiation of everolimus. Radiographic density of this lesion was 70 HU and 42 HU, five and three months after treatment with everolimus respectively. A cyst located adjacent to this AML lesion, which was previously 2.0 cm × 2.4 cm cross section and 2.2 cm CC, also decreased in size to 1.4 cm × 1.8 cm in cross section and 1.4 cm CC on the CT completed at five months post treatment initiation. Its density also increased from 46 HU to 63 HU . There were two adjacent AML lesions present in the mid segment of the left kidney. The larger, more posterior lesion measured 2.7 cm × 2.5 cm cross section and 3.7 cm oblique on the coronals on the baseline CT conducted prior to everolimus initiation. The lesion had reduced in size to 2.4 cm × 1.7 cm in cross section and 2.6 cm in long oblique (coronals) three months post therapy initiation. At five months, this lesion had further decreased in size to 2.1 cm × 1.7 cm in cross section and longest oblique (on coronal MPR) of 2.5 cm. Its density progressively increased, from 131 HU at baseline to 144 HU at three months to 240 HU at five months post therapy initiation. A smaller spherical lesion was located anterior to this AML lesion. This small spherical lesion was 1.4 cm in diameter initially but also was noted to reduce in size to 0.95 cm then 0.77 cm at three and five months post everolimus initiation respectively. The density of this lesion also increased from 100 HU initially to 148 HU at three months and 224 HU at five months.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】In the past decade, progress has been made in understanding the role of the mTOR signaling pathway and its inhibition in patients with TS. Regressive effects of renal AML lesions and improvement of other TS-associated extra renal manifestations have been demonstrated in patients treated with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. Treatment with sirolimus has been associated with regression and control of renal AML lesions during treatment in patients with TS. In these patients sirolimus withdrawal led to subsequent regrowth of the AML lesions . In a study conducted by Bissler et al, a reduction of AML volume of 47% was seen at one year of treatment with sirolimus; while a study by Davies et al showed a volume reduction of 60% . Lower drug levels were achieved in the latter study. An increase in the volume of AML lesions from 53% to 86% was seen over the course of 12 months following withdrawal of sirolimus .\n\n【15】Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a fundamental role in regulating angiogenesis. A multicenter prospective phase 2 clinical trials of 36 adults with TSC or TSC/LAM treated with daily sirolimus showed a correlation between serum VEGF levels and the size of AML lesions. It was noted that serum VEGF-D levels were elevated at baseline in patients with renal AML lesions, and when a decrease in AML size was noted a corresponding decrease in VEGF levels was also noted .\n\n【16】EXIST-2 was an international, multicenter, double blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of everolimus in adult patient patients 18 years old or older with AML associated with TSC or sporadic LAM of the lungs. A 42% objective response rate of AML lesions to everolimus was seen. Few adverse events including stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, and acne like lesions were observed. As early as 24 weeks into treatment, 55% of patients receiving everolimus had at least a 50% reduction in sums of volumes of lesions compared to baseline. Treatment with everolimus was associated with improvement in progression of AML lesions compared to placebo. This study showed that everolimus was associated with a decreased in the volume of renal AML lesions and decreased the rate of progression of AML lesions. Treatment with everolimus was associated with an acceptable safety profile . There are a few ongoing clinical studies evaluating the role of everolimus in the treatment of TSC patient with renal AML. Currently, a clinical trial is being conducted in patients with TSC ages 18 - 65 to examine the efficacy and safety of everolimus in the treatment of AML lesions . In addition, a case report published on a patient with LAMs and lung transplantation showed a reduction of renal AML lesions when the patient was treated with everolimus . The role of mTOR inhibition as induction (neoadjuvant) therapy prior to nephron sparing resection of renal AML lesions is under evaluation .\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The goals of treatment with everolimus in the two patients described in the current report were to delay the progression or growth of renal AML lesions, prevent bleeding from renal AML lesions and prevent or delay the development of renal cell carcinoma. The first patient has been followed for a total of 13 months and has shown considerable improvement in fat content/density of the renal AML lesions and possibly a decrease in mass vascularity; although, the size of her lesions have been stable or have slightly increased in size. There are notable improvements in the extra renal manifestations of TS including a decrease in the size and number of facial angiofibromas as well as improvement in mood and cognition reported by the patient’s care giver. In addition, her contrast enhanced MRI brain has shown stable findings with no growth or change in the suspected SEGAs.\n\n【19】The second patient showed considerable improvement in the size of her bilateral renal AML lesions with daily everolimus. This benefit was documented after five months of mTOR inhibitor therapy. The increased radiographic density seen in the renal AML lesions with daily everolimus in this patient is not well understood. This could represent intra tumoral hemorrhage. However, the lack of acute changes is the size of renal AML lesions and the lack of symptoms like acute flank pain or drop in the hemoglobin and hematocrit do not suggest acute hemorrhage as the cause of increased radiographic density of the renal AML lesions seen during treatment with daily everolimus. To the time of the preparation of the present report neither patient has developed renal cell carcinoma or new renal hemorrhage.\n\n【20】Both patients showed varied responses to everolimus treatment. The first patient’s response showed stability in size and marked decrease in density indicating regression of her AML lesions. The decrease in density could indicate that the lesions were becoming less vascular and more fatty which could presumably decrease the risk of subsequent bleeding episodes. The second patient’s radiographic changes with daily everolimus were different. Her renal AML lesions showed increases in density which could indicate increased vascularity and decreased fatty components. This could presumably increase the risk of bleeding of renal AML lesions. The lack of acute symptoms, stable hemoglobin and hematocrit, and decrease in size of her renal AML lesions do not suggest intratumoral bleeding. Although there was marked decrease in the size of renal AML lesions with daily everolimus, the increases in radiographic density seen during treatment could indicate increased intratumoral vascularity which in turn would suggest that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus was not associated with decreases in angiogenesis. Measurements of serum VEGF levels and intratumoral vascular density in prospective clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in patients with TS with renal AML may be helpful to understand the role of mTOR inhibitors and their effects in angiogenesis in this patient population.\n\n【21】The molecular mechanisms underlying the varying radiographic changes of renal AML lesions with daily everolimus therapy found in our two patients are not established. Further studies are needed to understand the radiographic changes and response rates of renal AML lesions to daily everolimus therapy. Our case report suggests that treatment with daily everolimus may lead to reduction in size and/or decreases in density or renal AML lesions. It is unclear whether these findings will prevent or delay the development of renal cell carcinoma or prevent bleeding from renal AML lesions. The main limitation of our study is a short follow up time period on both patients. At the time of preparation of this report, both patients continue treatment with daily everolimus without serious adverse events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Much has been learned about the physiology and function of eosinophils ever since and it is currently known that they produce a large panel of secreted cytokines and soluble mediators and of bidirectional interactions with dendritic and T cells, thus being involved in initiation and propagation of diverse inflammatory responses, as well as modulating innate and adaptive immunity .\n\n【2】Eosinophilia is defined as a blood eosinophil count above the upper limit of reference (in adults ≥ 0.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and can be classified into mild (0.5 - 1.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), moderate (1.5 - 5.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) or severe (> 5.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Eosinophilia can also be divided into three different categories: reactive (or secondary), clonal (or primary) and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), the last being defined by moderate or severe eosinophilia of unknown origin, persisting more than 6 months with organ damage.\n\n【3】The most common cause of eosinophilia is allergy in the western world and invasive parasite infections in the developing countries and damage to end-organs can result even in eosinophilia secondary to a known cause as a Toxocara infection . End-organ damage is caused by activation of eosinophils, release of their granules contents and deposition of their proteins and thrombotic events . Treatment, therefore, must rely in destroy or suppress eosinophils and, for that reason, clinicians must be aware of eosinophil-associated disease which can manifest in a wide variety of manners.\n\n【4】Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare cause of eosinophilia and its prevalence (10 - 15/million) and annual incidence (0.9 - 1.2/million) are about 10 times lower than those of other anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) . The role of ANCAs in EGPA, detectable in only 30-40% of patients, remains unclear and eosinophils, which play no role in GPA or MPA, seem to be important in EGPA .\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old man, with a history of asthma diagnosed in the adult life, was admitted to our tertiary care hospital complaining of a swollen tongue and submental edema in the last 2 weeks. He had been well until 9 months before this presentation, when diarrhea developed, with five to six stools per day, with no blood or mucus. During that time, he lost 17% of his body weight. Five months before admission, he performed an abdominal ultrasound that showed, in the lower right abdomen, parietal thickening of the last ileal loop and small adenopathies adjacent to this region. A colonoscopy was then proposed and some scattered erosions were visible. Biopsies revealed a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate with nodular aggregation and some polymorphonuclear eosinophils. He had at that time a complete blood count where lymphocytosis and eosinophilia were already present. The diagnosis of a pancolitis of undetermined etiology was made and the patient was started on mesalazine with a reduction in the number of stools (two per day).\n\n【7】However, 2 weeks before admission, he began feeling a swollen tongue and posteriorly a submental swelling, with no palpable lymph nodes, and for that reason, was admitted into the emergency department.\n\n【8】On examination, he was afebrile with a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 109/79 mm Hg. His respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute while breathing room air, with normal peripheral oxygen saturation. He had no nasal polyps and no cutaneous lesions. The patient had fine crackles on the inferior parts of both lungs. Abdominal examination and ultrasound were innocent. His laboratory tests showed elevated white blood count of 13.89 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (4.00 - 11.00 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and eosinophilia of 50% (6.96 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes and urinalysis were normal. He had normal tryptase and vitamin B12 values and a negative HIV test. Parasite infection was excluded since he had no history of recent travel and stool and blood analyses were negative. A diffuse thickening of the tongue muscles was observed by CT imaging . He was then proposed for a chest CT scan that showed patchy airspace opacities in the upper lobes . Bronchoscopy revealed a diffuse phenomenon of bronchitis with mucosal congestion with no other changes or microbiological isolations in bronchoalveolar lavage.\n\n【9】The medulograma and bone marrow aspirate were normocellular and the immunophenotypic study showed no changes suggestive of lymphoproliferative disease. The FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation was also negative.\n\n【10】The antibody profile, rheumatoid factor, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA), myeloperoxidase antibodies (MPO) and complements were normal. Cytoplasmic ANCA (C-ANCA) (1/80) and the anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) were elevated.\n\n【11】Endoscopy was performed and colonoscopy was repeated (similar to the previous) and new biopsies were made that showed abundant infiltration by polymorphonuclear eosinophils, congruent with eosinophil-associated disease.\n\n【12】A tongue biopsy was also made and the extracted lymphoid population had no immunophenotypic alterations suggestive of lymphoma. The histopathologic study showed no dysplasia and identified a marked inflammatory infiltrate consisting of eosinophils and scant lymphocytes.\n\n【13】Even thought the patient had no symptoms suggestive of heart or central nervous involvement, a complete neurological examination was performed, and electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and troponin measurements were made with normal results.\n\n【14】In view of these findings, the diagnosis of EGPA was made and the patient was started treatment on prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (0.6 g/m <sup>2 </sup> ). The patient is currently asymptomatic, with no diarrhea or swollen tissues, and a normal blood count.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】EGPA is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affects small-to-medium-sized vessels. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology based the diagnosis of CSS on the presence of four of six criteria: asthma, sinusitis, pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia > 10% in peripheral blood, histological proof of vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils and evidence of neuropathy . Our patient fulfilled four of these criteria and therefore the diagnosis was made even though no vasculitic lesions were present. In fact, EGPA may present in three distinct phases: the prodromal phase, characterized by asthma and rhinosinusitis, the eosinophilic phase, marked by peripheral eosinophilia and organ involvement and the vasculitic phase. These three phases are not necessarily seen in the same order and vasculitis may not be present at diagnosis.\n\n【17】The ANCA test results may help define subgroups of patients and there is evidence to suggest that ANCA-positive patients are more likely to have a “vasculitic” phenotype with glomerulonephritis, mononeuritis multiplex and relapses . However, the overall prognosis of ANCA-negative patients remains worse due to a higher frequency of cardiomyopathy . Cardiac involvement is indeed the leading cause of dead  in EGPA patients and therefore it must be actively searched, as was the case.\n\n【18】The five-factor score (FFS) is a prognostic tool that consists of five items. Age over 65 years, heart and gastrointestinal tract disease and creatininemia > 150 μmol/L each provide a point. Ear, nose and throat manifestations, however, are associated with a better outcome and its absence is also scored +1 . Patients with an FFS ≥ 1 are defined as high-risk patients, and treatment is recommended to include not only corticosteroids but also a cytotoxic drug, usually cyclophosphamide. Our patient scored 2 in the FFS and therefore started double treatment as recommended. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with co-trimoxazole (800 mg thrice weekly) was also started.\n\n【19】Eosinophil-associated diseases are not always expected and therefore are frequently unrecognized but, in the presence of eosinophilia, the possibility of end-organ damage caused by eosinophils must be considered. The different causes for eosinophilia must then be thoroughly investigated, since they differ in treatment and prognosis. In the case of EGPA, prompt recognition and treatment is imperative to ablate vasculitis tissue damage and improve outcome. Therefore, physicians must be aware of this rare entity and its differential diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "526b5f13-4987-46e4-9a87-a1aaf57967c1", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Acute aortic dissection is the most common surgical emergency among all aortic conditions and can be classified into Stanford type A which involves the ascending aorta, and type B which occurs distal to the left subclavian artery. In particular, acute Stanford type A aortic dissection has a mortality rate that reaches 50% by the first 48 h if left untreated . Prompt diagnosis and surgical treatment can improve patient outcomes. We report a case of a relatively well patient with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection with a rare complication of right heart failure who presented with persistent profound hypoxemia despite intubation, and discuss the possible etiologies.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 70-year-old lady with well-controlled hypertension and multinodular goiter status post total thyroidectomy presented to our emergency department with a sudden onset of chest pain radiating to bilateral arms, shortness of breath and diaphoresis. On examination, her blood pressure was 84/30 mm Hg, heart rate was 47/min and oxygen saturation was 82% on room air. The patient was alert and responsive at the time of presentation, and cardiovascular examination did not reveal any murmurs or signs suggestive of heart failure such as pedal edema or lung crepitations. Her neurological examination was also grossly normal. Intravenous dopamine infusion up to 20 µg/kg/min was immediately started to support her hemodynamics and she was given supplemental oxygen. She was diagnosed to have an acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) based on electrocardiogram showing ST elevation in inferior leads and a complete heart block (CHB), and was sent for urgent primary percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】Coronary angiograpy revealed normal left coronary artery, a dissection flap in the aortic root arising from the right coronary cusp and the right coronary artery (RCA) ostium was unable to be located, likely occluded by the dissection flap. Bedside echocardiogram done showed ascending aortic dissection with dilated aortic root and mild aortic regurgitation. She was intubated in the catheterization laboratory in view of persistent hypoxemia. Despite intubation and hand ventilation with 100% oxygen, she remained hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 80% and a corresponding arterial blood gas showed a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 41 mm Hg. Endotracheal tube (ETT) placement was confirmed with 5-point auscultation, repeat laryngoscopies as well as chest X-ray (CXR). No pneumothoraxes were seen on the CXR. She was started on IV noradrenaline infusion up to 0.4 µg/kg/min and transvenous pacing for the CHB.\n\n【7】In view of her persistent hypoxemia, computed tomography (CT) aortogram and thorax were performed. The CT aortogram showed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending to the right common and left external iliac arteries with RCA arising from the false lumen with poor contrast opacification. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or lung consolidation .\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】The patient was transferred to the operating theater for a coronary artery bypass graft of the RCA using saphenous vein graft and a repair of the dissection. Intra-operatively, the right ventricle was observed to be infarcted with akinesia, and no flow was seen in the RCA. Despite these surgical interventions, poor right ventricular function with minimal ejection into the pulmonary artery was noted, and decision was made to commence veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to recovery.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】Post-operatively, her recovery was complicated by acute kidney injury and hemorrhagic shock. Despite extensive resuscitation, there was persistently low flow on the ECMO and her pupils were noted to be dilated with sluggish response to light on post-operative day 1. CT of brain was performed which showed hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Poor prognosis for meaningful survival was conveyed to the family, and a decision was made for no further escalation of care. ECMO was also subsequently withdrawn and the patient eventually passed away on post-operative day 3.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Aortic dissection is relatively uncommon, with an incidence of two to six cases per 100,000 persons , but it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Aortic dissection is characterized by the separation of the intima-media layers within the aortic wall and the extent and direction of dissection determines the patients’ presentation. Classically, patients may experience an abrupt onset of tearing/ripping chest or back pain, but it can also mimic other medical conditions such as myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism . Evangelista et al reported that over a span of 20 years, medical mortality rate in patients with type A aortic dissection remains high at 57%, while surgical mortality rate has declined, highlighting the importance of early surgical intervention in the treatment of these patients .\n\n【14】Complications from aortic dissection can occur rapidly, and include shock (15%), cardiac tamponade (18%), mesenteric malperfusion (3.7%) and brain injury (10%) . These complications arise due to the dissection affecting mesenteric and arch vessels respectively. Congestive heart failure has an incidence of 6% , while right ventricular failure (RVF) has only been reported in case series . Such complications significantly increase mortality rate, and should be elucidated early when assessing patients.\n\n【15】Unfortunately, despite being a catastrophic condition, aortic dissection is often misdiagnosed resulting in delayed treatment and a negative patient outcome. The myriad of presentations, either as a direct effect of the acute aortic dissection or a complication of it, can mislead the medical practitioner. Our patient was initially misdiagnosed with an inferior STEMI and a CHB and was brought for urgent coronary revascularization. It was only during the procedure that she was noted to have an aortic dissection. Acute STEMI can occur due to the occlusion of the flow within the coronary arteries by the dissection flap if the dissection extends proximally. However, what remains unusual is that she remained profoundly hypoxemia, even after intubation and 100% oxygen delivered, with a PaO <sub>2 </sub> /fraction of inspiration O <sub>2 </sub> (FiO <sub>2 </sub> ) ratio of 41 and normal lung parenchyma. This is likely due to RVF from the aortic dissection extension to the RCA, leading to right ventricular infarction and akinesia. There is a resultant forward failure with the inability to pump blood into the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation to occur. The additional presence of intra-cardiac shunts can further worsen hypoxemia as it allows the mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Even though such shunts were not detected in our patient, small shunts could be easily overlooked if these were not intentionally sought after during the echocardiogram. Similar mechanisms in patients with RVF and infarction have previously only been described in case reports . To the best of our knowledge, such profound hypoxemia in aortic dissection and its proposed mechanism have not been reported in the literature to date.\n\n【16】RVF is often overlooked in the discussion of heart failure. The causes of RVF include cardiac conditions such as left ventricular failure (LVF), direct right ventricular myocardial disease such as right ventricular ischemia or infarction, or constrictive pericarditis and lung pathologies like pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension . Symptoms include dyspnea, light-headedness, syncope, right upper quadrant discomfort and peripheral edema, while physical examination findings include systemic hypotension, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, right ventricular third sound and tricuspid regurgitation . RVF is easily missed due to the non-specific nature of these clinical presentations, and clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion to clinch this diagnosis. While RVF can cause forward failure through interventricular dependence, compromising LV preload and reducing LV performance, resulting in hypotension and hypoperfusion , there is a paucity of literature demonstrating hypoxia as a direct consequence of RVF. RVF reversibility is more likely and rapid than LVF due to the thinner nature of the RV , hence prompt diagnosis and early institution of treatment is crucial. Treatment modalities include volume optimization, improvement of myocardial contractility, restoration of perfusion pressure as well as mechanical circulatory support .\n\n【17】It is unexpected for hypoxemia to persist after intubation and the likely causes should be ruled out in a logical fashion. These causes are classified into equipment-related problems, progression of the underlying disease, the onset of a new problem and the side effects of interventions, procedures and medications  . The airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure (ABCDE) approach recommended in clinical emergencies  should be adopted to confirm the diagnosis. Airway patency is confirmed by inspecting the ETT and breathing circuit to rule out blockages and leaks, and ventilator settings should be optimized. Auscultation findings can confirm endobronchial or esophageal intubation, and suggest presence of bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, consolidative changes or pneumothorax. The hemodynamic parameters should be checked and hypotension corrected. Patient exposure can reveal further clues to assist with the diagnosis, such as the presence of rashes in anaphylaxis. Lastly, a review of drugs and doses administered should be done. Additional investigations may be required to achieve a definitive diagnosis. A CXR can be obtained to confirm ETT placement, and rule out pneumothoraxes, atelectasis or lung collapse, and pneumonia. The placement of ETT can be further confirmed by repeat laryngoscopy to verify that the ETT is seen passing through the vocal cords. A CT pulmonary angiogram can be done to rule out pulmonary emboli, especially if the clinical suspicion is high.\n\n【18】In conclusion, this is a rare complication of Stanford type A aortic dissection, where the patient developed severe persistent hypoxemia despite intubation and ventilatory support due to a dissection that extended to the RCA and resulted in RVF. Medical practitioners should consider this as a potential etiology when next faced with a similar patient. Nevertheless, the rarity of such a presentation demands that common causes of hypoxemia are excluded first.\n\n【19】Learning points\n\n【20】Aortic dissection can have diverse presenting symptoms and complications as a result of the location and extent of dissection flap involved. RVF is a rare possible complication as a result of dissection flap extending to RCA causing right heart infarction and akinesia. Additionally, RVF is not easily diagnosed clinically due to its non-specific features, and persistent profound hypoxemia is a possible presentation although this is rarely described. The outcomes of such patients are dependent on swift recognition of both the primary condition of aortic dissection and the presence of RVF, to allow institution of timely interventions which have been shown to have a survival benefit. Lastly, the rarity of such a presentation demands that common causes of hypoxemia are excluded first.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

ITP could be triggered by a number of causes such as inherited diseases, infections, autoimmune conditions and malignancies . It was reported that lymphoma could associate with ITP and successful treatment of lymphoma might resolve ITP . We herein, first in the world, report a unique clinical case and our experience in curing refractory ITP on a patient who received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning regimens for refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】The patient was a 64-year-old man with a previous medical history of stage 4 DLBCL diagnosed in 2013. His lymphoma was successfully treated with six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine (RCHOP) and he was in remission for 2 years. In 2015, this patient developed significant thrombocytopenia with lowest platelet count of 2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. He was subsequently diagnosed as having an ITP. His thrombocytopenia did not respond well to both rituximab and steroid managements, but weekly romiplostim (2 µg/kg) successfully maintained his platelet above 30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】In 2018, this patient rapidly developed peripheral lymphadenopathy. A core biopsy of right iliac lymph node confirmed a relapsed DLBCL. Immunohistochemistry showed enhanced expression of C-MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6, but a subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ruled out double or triple hit lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy did not demonstrate any bone marrow involvement. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan showed multifocal progression of soft tissue nodules, with metabolically active lymphadenopathy, especially in the right iliac lymph nodes chain.\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】He then received two cycles of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (RICE) combination chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy PET/CT scan showed a morphological complete remission and patient was subsequently referred for autologous HSCT consultation.\n\n【9】Throughout the course of DLBCL treatment, he continuously presented with thrombocytopenia and was managed with romiplostim. He subsequently underwent an autologous HSCT with BEAM conditioning regimen on March 5, 2019. During high-dose BEAM combination chemotherapy conditioning period and first 3 weeks post-transplant, patient received daily twice platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts > 15 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, romiplostim 10 µg/kg subcutaneous (SQ) weekly, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) weekly and steroids support.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】His post-transplant course was complicated by systemic infection and several episodes of paroxysmal A fib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was controlled with Cardizem 120 mg XR oral daily, flecainide 100 mg oral twice daily. Interestingly, his platelet counts recovered nicely, having not required platelet transfusion since April 16, 2019 and not required romiplostim treatment since May 19, 2019 . PET/CT scans 1 year post transplant showed a complete remission of DLBCL .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The prevalence of ITP in patient’s non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is around 0.76% . Anecdotal evidence suggests that platelet level may predict outcomes in DLBCL . The international prognostic index (IPI) and hemoglobin platelet (HP) index have been analyzed, but the level of evidence remains to be weak and controversial . It is believed that lymphoma tissues produce autoantibodies against platelets that may incite ITP . Elevated IgG and IgM antiplatelets have been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models supporting this hypothesis . Around 10 cases of ITP associated with DLBCL have been reported in literature, highlighting the uniqueness of this presentation .\n\n【14】DLBCL is an aggressive form of NHL in which, complete remission can be attained with optimal therapy. In the present era rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimens such as RCHOP have remained the standard of care . RCHOP fails in 30-50% of the cases of DLBCL. Refractory disease occurs in 20% of the cases, whereas around 30% will have a relapse even after complete remission (CR) . For these patients, salvage cytotoxic chemotherapy with regimens like RICE followed by autologous HSCT results in long-term survival benefits in around 50% of the patients. For patients who do not respond or have a second relapse allogenic HSCT and emerging novel therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) have a role .\n\n【15】It was observed that people with NHL could increase the risk of ITP incidence, and successful treatment of the lymphoma also could improve platelet counts. In a series of 10 cases described by Ono et al, six went into remission after treatment for DLBCL with chemotherapy, three of these patients however required splenectomy .\n\n【16】HSCT decreases the circulating pool of auto-reactive T and B cells, effectively resetting the immune system. Thymic removal of self-reactive cells, promotion of self-tolerance and cytotoxic effect of the ablative priming regimen are a few of the proposed mechanisms by which stem cell transplant may provide benefit in refractory ITP . A National Institutes of Health (NIH) phase II study on nine ITP patients and five Evans syndrome patients showed that autologous stem cell transplant had a response rate of 57% . Another study analyzed 36 patients who either received autologous  or allogenic (nine) stem cell transplant for various cytopenias. Four out of 12 ITP patients, who received autologous stem cell transplant, experienced a sustained platelet count response. A subsequent analysis, involving 52 patients with ITP and Evans syndrome, showed an overall survival of 61%. Recurrence-free survival was similar between autologous and allogenic transplant. The inadequate power and small sample size are the main limitations of these trials . The case we present here is the first case showing that autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM conditioning for DLBCL could resolve coexisting ITP as well.\n\n【17】Learning points\n\n【18】The literatures indicated that 0.76% lymphoma patients could be complicated with chronic ITP . ITP-caused severe thrombocytopenia is a huge obstacle for patients who expect to receive HSCT, especially using high-dose multiple chemotherapy regimens combination (e.g. BEAM) as conditioning agent. This case report described our experience in using novel multiple agent combination treatment protocol to manage severe thrombocytopenia during high-dose conditioning regimens chemotherapy period and early post-HSCT period. This case report also first in the world demonstrated that high-dose BEAM chemotherapy regimens conditioned autologous HSCT could cure chronic/refractory ITP that was associated with DLBCL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

A rare cause of aortic inflammation is C. septicum , which typically occurs in patients with multiple comorbidities . C. septicum infection progresses very rapidly, with a mortality rate of approximately 79% in adults, typically occurring within 48 hours of infection .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus was hospitalized for one week of progressive right lower quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever and chills. His evaluation was suggestive of enterocolitis with computed tomography of the abdomen revealing a circumferential thickening of the distal ileum and multiple enlarged ileocolic lymph nodes . At that time he refused a colonoscopy or further evaluation and was treated empirically with oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and dismissed in stable condition.\n\n【4】Five days after completing his antibiotic regimen he presented to the emergency department with recurrent abdominal pain, fever, chills and hypotension. A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed new mural gas extending through the descending aorta to the infrarenal aorta with associated periaortic fat stranding. Blood cultures grew Clostridium septicum . The patient declined surgical intervention. He was initially treated with empiric intravenous antimicrobials including vancomycin, voriconazole, levofloxacin, and pipercillin-tazobactam, but ultimately chose palliation and was discharged to hospice care with oral metronidazole. The patient passed away shortly thereafter.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Infectious aortitis due to C. septicum is a very rare and often lethal . C. septicum is a Gram-positive, motile bacillus whose ability to metastasize and invade tissues is facilitated by its flagella and the secretion of alpha-toxin, a hemolysin . The classic CT finding of intramural air in the aorta made the diagnosis and the infectious organism was confirmed by blood culture in our patient. A recent review of the literature identified 26 such cases, of which 58% had isolated abdominal aortic segment involvement. Early treatment with intravenous antibiotics followed by definitive surgical therapy is required for optimal outcomes. The overall mortality rate is 64%, with a 6-month mortality of 100% in those who do not undergo surgical intervention . Early radiographic indicators of aortitis include soft tissue prominence with increased contrast enhancement surrounding the involved segment. Intramural and peri-aortic emphysema is indicative of more advanced disease. Serial imaging of the aorta might be needed to monitor for aneurysmal transformation. The natural history of infectious aortitis is that of rapid aneurismal transformation, occurring in as little as 1 to 3 weeks, with subsequent rupture and death. Concomitant resections of a C. septicum aortic aneurysm and colon cancer have also been successfully performed .\n\n【7】This case highlights the essential features of infectious aortitis caused by Clostridium septicum and the associated need for a high index of suspicion for rapid diagnosis and management.

Its fisiopathology remains unclear but seems to be related to a failure of the cerebral blood pressure mechanism or to an endothelial dysfunction. This neurological syndrome is characterized by seizures (partial or generalized), sudden headache with no response to analgesia, altered mental status and visual impairment. The RPL is mainly reversible but sometimes it can have a fatal course . Otherwise, as it has many different etiologies, clinical manifestations may vary.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 18-year-old female, right handed, with not known allergies and medical history of Eritematous Sistemic Lupus and Lupic Nephritis (level IIIA). The year before she had been treated with ciclofosfamide and mycophenolate. The patient developed increased edema in lower limbs so she was transferred to the hospital, where she started taking again ciclofosfamide and intravenous methilprednysolone pulses. During the first days of hospitalization, she remained asymptomatic but with high blood pressure that decreased with antihypertensive drugs.\n\n【4】After a week, she developed a progressive mild to moderate headache, located in occipital regions, without sickness but with transitory phosphenes in her left visual field. Blood pressure at the moment was 210/110, cardiac frequency was 80 bpm, capillary glucose was 110 mg/dL and temperature was 36.4 °C.\n\n【5】The neurological examination showed normal level of consciousness, there were no meningeal signs or pupillary defects and no weakness was observed. There were normal deep osteotendinous reflexes and no language alteration. The only abnormal sign was a left homonimous hemianopsy.\n\n【6】An urgent computerized tomography (CT) scan showed two hipodense lesions  located in both occipital lobes.\n\n【7】Urgent blood exams showed: low hemoglobin (8.8 mg/dL) with hematocrit of 26%, 6.2 mill/mm <sup>3 </sup> leukocytes, 79 mill/mm <sup>3 </sup> platelets, urea 0.7 g/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, normal electrolytes, glucose 86 mg and proteinuria of 7.9 g/L. Search of lupic anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. An urgent encephalogram and transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. The urgent transcranial ultrasound study showed minimum asymmetry between deep venous systems to superficial one, there were no signs of vasospasm or significant stenosis.\n\n【8】High blood pressure was normalized after intravenous drugs during the next hours and the patient was given paracetamol so she had complete recovery in the following 24 hours. According to the abnormalities found in the urgent transcranial ultrasound an anticoagulant treatment was started using low weight heparin.\n\n【9】A Magnetic Resonance (MRI) with diffusion/weighted sequences and angiography was done after 48 hours of the onset and was completely normal . The second transcranial ultrasound (four days after the onset) did not show abnormalities.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】There has been described many etiologies  for this neurological syndrome, such as severe hypertension, renal diseases, immunossupressive drugs, eclampsia or preeclampsia, vasculitis, use of contrasts or even blood transfusion. Pathogenesis is yet unclear , it seems to be related to a failure of the cerebral blood regulation mechanism after an unexpected increase of blood pressure. It may consequently develop a vasogenic brain edema which has predilection for the vertebrobasilar system  due to its deficitary sympatic inervation. Clinical signs may vary and the radiological findings are not pathognomonic. It is common to find symmetrical lesions in white matter, mostly in posterior regions such as occipital lobes, cerebellum and even brainstem although grey matter and anterior regions could be rarely affected.\n\n【12】The variability of clinical and radiological findings leads into a wide differential diagnosis  including venous thrombosis, central nervous system vasculitis, stroke, central nervous system infections or even the onset of a demielinating disease.\n\n【13】An urgent CT scan is mandatory  to discard other pathologies but the MRI is the best exam to diagnose early ischemic lesions, especially when using the diffusion/weighted sequences. The neuroradiographic exams are really useful in patients with an atypical onset like our patient, who had significantly slight signs and symptoms according to the typical RPL . Physicians should be aware of this variability because it may hinder a correct diagnosis and treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "902dc794-c345-41ae-b476-e1003cfdf9ce", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】PHACE syndrome was originally described in 1996 by Dr. Ilonia Frieden . Prior to this, Reese et al reported nine cases of hemangiomas associated with posterior fossa abnormalities including Dandy-Walker malformations . In several of the patients, associated arterial abnormalities were also noted. The term PHACE is an acronym for the main components of the syndrome including: Posterior fossa malformations of the central nervous system (CNS), particularly Dandy-Walker malformation and agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellum or cerebellar vermis; Hemangiomas, specifically segmental facial hemangiomas or airway hemangiomas; Arterial lesions usually involving the cerebral vasculature, which may present as agenesis, aneurysm, or occlusion of the carotid arteries and its branches; Cardiac abnormalities, most commonly aortic coarctation; and Eye abnormalities, specifically microphthalmos . When accompanied by ventral developmental defects, it is termed PHACES syndrome, where the “S” represents sternal cleft or supraumbilical raphe. There is a female to male ratio of 8:1 suggesting that PHACES is an X-linked dominant disorder that causes in utero demise in the male fetus. The disorder is generally considered to be one of the neurocutaneous syndromes. Given the associated dermatologic and CNS involvement, it may be confused with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) . Distinguishing features of PHACE include hemangiomas as opposed to the capillary malformation (port wine stain) observed with SWS as well as cerebral arterial manifestations rather than the classical leptomeningeal involvement (angiomatosis or malformations) in SWS. Given the multi-system involvement of the disorder, patients may present for surgical procedures of the airway, CNS or the heart. The perioperative concerns of such patients are discussed and previous reports of anesthetic care are reviewed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Board Review is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 2-year-old, 14.7 kg child with PHACE syndrome who presented with subglottic hemangiomas, chronic otitis media, sleep-disordered breathing, and tonsillar hypertrophy. He was originally diagnosed with PHACE syndrome in infancy, manifestations of which included cutaneous hemangioma on the cheek, lower lip, mucosal surfaces, and left mandibular angle; a subglottic hemangioma, intracranial arterial tortuosity, and a sternal cleft. He also had a history of episodes of stridor which had not required therapy. The patient was the product of a full-term gestation with spontaneous vaginal delivery and a birth weight of 3.5 kg. There were no prenatal problems. Congenital heart disease (CHD) included a patent foramen ovale and a patent ductus arteriosus, both of which had resolved spontaneously by 3 months of age. Past surgical procedures included direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with triamcinolone injection into the subglottic hemangioma, bilateral ear tube insertion, and adenoidectomy at the age of 15 months. Magnetic resonance imaging performed at 1.5 years revealed arterial tortuosity affecting the posterior distribution of the cerebral vasculature, particularly the basilar artery and the superior cerebellar arteries with smaller circumferential vessels involved as well. The tortuosity appeared most prominent at the interpeduncular cistern with some extension to the right ambient cistern. Magnetic resonance angiography 6 months later demonstrated the abnormal vessels filling the cisterns, as described above, without significant change from the previous examination. Additionally, there was abrupt narrowing of the terminal segments of the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Apart from stuttering, he was developmentally appropriate for age with a normal neurological exam.\n\n【4】The child was admitted on the morning of the surgery for bilateral examination under anesthesia of the external auditory canals and tympanic membranes, direct laryngoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy, and tonsillectomy. He was held nil per os (NPO) for 6 h. His preoperative vital signs revealed an oxygen saturation of 97%, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, and a heart rate of 112 beats/min. He was transported to the operating room and routine monitors were applied according to American Society of Anesthesiologists' guidelines. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen. Following anesthetic induction, a 20 gauge peripheral intravenous cannula was placed and propofol (15 mg) was administered. Following the topical application of lidocaine (50 mg) to the trachea, direct laryngoscopy was performed while maintaining spontaneous ventilation with the insufflation of sevoflurane via the laryngoscope and subsequently the rigid bronchoscope. No significant abnormalities were observed. The trachea was intubated with a 3.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) following completion of the bronchscopy. With the cuff deflated, an airleak around the ETT was noted at 25 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O. Breath sounds were equal and bilateral with positive end-tidal carbon dioxide recorded by capnography. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (expired concentration 2-4%) in a combination of air and oxygen to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 25% of preoperative values. Fentanyl (25 µg) and acetaminophen (250 mg) were administered for postoperative analgesia. Additional medications included dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg) and ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg). Estimated blood loss was 25 mL. Total intraoperative fluids totaled 300 mL. Following the surgical procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated and he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. He was weaned to room air and transferred to the inpatient ward for postoperative monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry. Postoperative analgesia was provided by a combination of oral acetaminophen and hydrocodone elixir. His postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged home the following day.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】There are several perioperative concerns to consider when planning anesthetic care for patients with PHACE syndrome. As with any anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers is the associated presence of airway hemangiomas which may complicate airway management. Extracutaneous hemangiomas occur in approximately 25% of children with PHACE syndrome with subglottic hemangiomas being the most common. Durr et al retrospectively reviewed their experience with airway hemangiomas in 23 patients with PHACE syndrome . Twelve of the 23 patients (52%) had documented airway hemangiomas. Six of the patients underwent airway examination in the operating room at their institution. Five (83%) of the patients had subglottic hemangiomas while three (50%) had additional hemangiomas within the airway located on the epiglottis, vocal folds, posterior pharyngeal wall, and tracheal wall. Treatment included propranolol, corticosteroids, and vincristine. Although one patient required tracheostomy for airway obstruction, all were symptom free at follow-up which ranged from 13 to 76 months. The authors noted the frequent occurrence of potentially life-threatening airway hemangiomas in patients with PHACE syndrome and concluded patients with a history of respiratory symptoms, such as unexplained tachypnea, stridor, or hoarseness should be referred for airway evaluation. Depending on the patient’s status, this may include awake nasal endoscopy to evaluate the upper airway or more commonly, direct laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy in the operating room under general anesthesia .\n\n【7】The appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction, as recommended by Engelehart . General anesthesia can be induced by the inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation. Following anesthetic induction, general anesthesia is maintained with spontaneous ventilation via insufflation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen through the distal port of the operating laryngoscope and through the rigid bronchoscope. Neuromuscular blocking agents are generally avoided. The administration of an anticholinergic agent may be helpful to prevent reflex bradycardia associated with airway stimulation as well as reducing airway secretions to improve visualization . However, this should be weighed against the need to prevent changes in MAP or heart rate in patients with significant cerebrovascular disease. Topical lidocaine (3 - 5 mg/kg of a 2-4% solution) can be applied to the airway to supplement anesthesia prior to airway instrumentation. The preoperative medical therapy employed in the treatment of airway hemangiomas may impact perioperative care. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may require the administration of a stress dose of hydrocortisone, depending on the duration of treatment and the extent of the surgical procedure. Propranolol is a mainstay of treatment for infantile hemagiomas with a reported response rate of 98% . Propranolol may be held the day of surgery given concerns regarding its hemodynamic effects with potentiation of intraoperative bradycardia or hypoglycemia. However, prolonged withdrawal of therapy may lead to rebound tachycardia and hypertension, which may be deleterious in the patient with significant cerebrovascular disease. Other less common therapy for hemangiomas such as vincristine may result in autonomic or motor neuropathy. Although this rarely impacts anesthetic care, vincristine has been reported to cause isolated vocal cord paresis .\n\n【8】Another major concern of children with PHACE syndrome, as noted in our patient, is the presence of arterial abnormalities with cerebral and cervical arterial malformations being the most common . The arteriopathy most commonly involves the internal carotid artery and its embryonic branches, followed by the middle cerebral artery. In addition to anomalous origin and abnormal course of these vessels, hypoplasia, tortuosity, stenosis, and occlusion have been reported. These anomalies are generally located on the ipsilateral side of the cutaneous hemangiomas. Persistent embryonic arteries especially of the trigeminal artery and Moyamoya phenomena have also been reported . In a review of 39 case series with a total of 115 children with PHACE syndrome by Heyer et al, 89 of the 115 patients (77.4%) had cerebrovascular anomalies. Although the exact cause for the arterial anomalies is not clear, it has been proposed that the cerebral vascular development in the early embryonic period (≤ 5 weeks) is affected . Burrows et al, in a retrospective study of eight children with cervicofacial hemangiomas and intracranial arterial anomalies, proposed that the arterial malformations may be congenital or develop later in life . This involvement may also be progressive . Although neurological sequelae are rare, the clinical impact may be significant when acute ischemic stroke occurs. This may present as new-onset seizures or acute hemiparesis. The incidence of such problems generally coincides with the time of the most rapid growth of the hemangioms (6 - 18 months of age). Since abnormal cerebral vasculature is a major risk factor for arterial ischemic stroke, it has been suggested that children with PHACE syndrome should undergo neuroimaging to view the arterial architecture of the brain . There is no evidence-based support for the medical treatment of PHACES patients at risk for acute ischemic stroke . However, prophylactic treatment regimens may include the use of anti-platelet medications such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Consultation with surgery, cardiology, and neurology may be required to determine a perioperative plan regarding the continuation of such therapy.\n\n【9】The predisposition of these patients to acute ischemic stroke and seizures mandates that appropriate attention be focused perioperatively on factors that affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery. The anesthetic regimen should maintain the appropriate depth of anesthesia while minimizing hemodynamic effects that alter cerebral perfusion pressure and CBF. Hemodynamic depression may occur throughout the anesthetic care, but is most likely to occur during anesthetic induction. Perioperative hypotension should be treated promptly with a direct acting α-adrenergic agonist such as phenylephrine (1 - 2 µg/kg). Potential adverse effects related to intraoperative hypocarbia, such as decreases in CBF, suggest that intraoperative hyperventilation should be avoided . These changes may have greater clinical significance in patients with decreased CBF related to ischemic disease processes. Javault et al suggested neuromonitoring with the use of near infrared spectroscopy, as well as the bispectral index, when there are concerns regarding CBF and the potential for cerebral ischemia . In specific clinical scenarios, transcranial ultrasound and Doppler may also be used to complement near-infrared spectroscopy in assessing cerebral perfusion.\n\n【10】Although our patient did not have a history of seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy, seizures may accompany the arteriopathy of PHACE syndrome. Preoperative management to limit the incidence of perioperative seizures includes optimizing anticonvulsant therapy and documentation of therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to surgery. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s NPO status. Maintenance doses of anticonvulsant agents should be administered intraoperatively and postoperatively. As enteral administration may not be feasible, alternative routes of delivery (intravenous or transrectal) should be considered. Consultation with the neurology or pharmacology service is suggested when questions arise concerning dosing conversion from enteral to intravenous administration or intraoperative redosing.\n\n【11】The child with PHACE syndrome also has the potential for associated cardiovascular anomalies. Our patient had a history of a patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, which had closed spontaneously by 3 months of age. However, clinically significant cardiovascular lesions are not uncommon in these patients. Analysis of data from 50 children with PHACE syndrome revealed that 37% of these had cardiovascular anomalies, with aortic coarctation and aberrant subclavian artery being the most common . The coarctation of the aorta that occurs in children with PHACE syndrome is atypical. Unlike the classical type, there is involvement of the aorta proximal to or at the level of the origin of great vessels. Hence, the classic blood pressure gradient observed between the upper and lower extremities may not be present. The aortic segment involved in these children may be much longer compared to relatively discrete involvement of the classical type. The other cardiac abnormalities reported include aortic arch abnormalities, tetralogy of Fallot, septal defects, and stenosis of the semilunar valves .\n\n【12】The exact perioperative care of patients varies, depending on the type of CHD that is present. Screening for the presence of a coarctation during the preoperative evaluation includes auscultation of the heart as well as blood pressure (BP) and pulse checks in all four extremities. Echocardiography and consultation with a cardiologist should be considered, based on the nature of the CHD. Anesthetic goals focus on reducing the cardiovascular stress proximal to the obstruction by maintaining a normal heart rate and left ventricular filling pressure, ensuring adequate perfusion of the tissues, and control of the systemic vascular resistance . BP monitoring at two points (proximally and distally to the obstruction) should be considered to ensure adequate BP control pre-coarctation and maintenance of an adequate BP distal to the obstruction to ensure adequate perfusion pressure.\n\n【13】Ocular manifestations have been reported in 16% of PHACE patients . These include microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, cataracts, and increased retinal vascularity . Since endocrine anomalies, commonly those of the thyroid and pituitary, have been reported in children with PHACE syndrome, it has been suggested that the “E” in “PHACE” should reflect endocrinopathy along with eye manifestations. The hypothyroidism found in PHACE syndrome may be due dysfunction at several levels of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis . Additional reports document the association of PHACES with a lingual thyroid gland . Additional causes for thyroid dysfunction include the interferon therapy used in the treatment of hemangioma as well as the enzyme, 3-iodothyronine deiodinase, secreted by the hemangioma . A high index of suspicion in these children with endocrinology consultation may be helpful in the timely diagnosis of the thyroid dysfunction in patients with PHACE syndrome. In patients with hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction resulting in hypothyroidism, adrenocortical function should also be evaluated given its impact on perioperative outcome .\n\n【14】In summary, PHACE syndrome is a recently described neurocutaneous syndrome. Given the end-organ involvement, various surgical procedures may be required in these patients. Specific perioperative concerns include potential difficulties with airway management related to airway hemangiomas as well as an arteriopathy which predominantly affects the carotid vasculature and may impact on CBF resulting in ischemia, and associated CHD. The assessment of end-organ impairment by the primary disease process during the preoperative evaluation will allow for the effective perioperative care of these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It involves patients of different age groups, from newborns to 78 years of age. No significant difference in incidence according to gender or race, or association with any etiologic agent, was reported. Genetically, in NUT carcinomas, only a translocation is sufficient for the appearance of the lesion. Two-thirds of the cases are associated to t(15; 19) translocation, which conditions a fusion between the gene encoding the NUT protein and BRD4 (“bromodomain-containing protein 4”).\n\n【2】It is a rare entity, with few cases described in the literature, and about 63 cases were described .\n\n【3】The form of presentation is extremely variable with the location of the lesions, being caused mainly by the mass effect of the lesion. In the majority (66%) of the cases, they have already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis is performed by karyotype analysis with demonstration of the translocation, or by identifying the fusion genes, through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ hydrolysis. However, these methods are not easily accessible in most hospital settings. The prognosis has been invariably fatal, with the mean survival time estimated at 6 - 7 months in most series, although some refer to 9 - 10 months.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department for a lower back pain, of sudden onset, worsened with movements, without irradiation and with pleuritic chest pain in the left hemithorax, which improved after administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n【6】He was a smoker of 4 - 5 cigarettes per day, did not take any medications and denied alcohol or drugs abused.\n\n【7】In the family history, we highlight the fact that he had a brother who died at the age of 24, with a large mediastinal mass diagnosed a Ewing’s sarcoma.\n\n【8】On physical examination, the patient presented pain on mobilization and palpation of the left costal margin, lumbar spine and pelvis and, decreased of pulmonary sounds in the left hemithorax, without other auscultatory changes in the pulmonary parenchyma.\n\n【9】Serum analyses only revealed an increase of lactate dehydrogenase (475 U/L), being the rest of the study without renal dysfunction (urea 23 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL), without ionic alterations (potassium 3.8 mmol/L, sodium 144 mmol/L, corrected calcium 9.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL), negative C-reactive protein and complete blood count within normal values. The human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone and alpha-fetoprotein were researched, which were both normal (> 1.0 mIU/mL and 2.07 ng/mL, respectively).\n\n【10】A large mediastinal hypotransparency on the left side  was revealed in the chest radiograph. For a better clarification of this image, a computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a pulmonary mass in the left upper pulmonary lobe, in contact with the aorta and the left pulmonary artery, mediastinal lymph nodes and bone metastases in the sternum and left costal arch . In the abdomen and pelvis, secondary lesions in the spine and iliac bone were observed in the CT scan .\n\n【11】The bone scintigraphy showed pathological foci in bilateral iliac bone, sternum, second and fifth left costal arches and the right lesser trochanter .\n\n【12】In the bronchofibroscopy, the upper division of the left lobar bronchus was total blocked by an endobronchial mass. Bronchial histological exam revealed a presence of ciliated cells of bronchial lining, alveolar macrophages, keratinized pavement cells and small cell stratified clusters, with poorly defined cytoplasm, poorly defined and rounded nuclei with fine chromatin and apparent small nucleoli. Due to the age of the patient and histological characteristics, an immunocytochemical study was performed, using anti-NUT monoclonal antibody which showed intense and diffuse nuclear positivity, thus demonstrating that this carcinoma was associated with translocation (15;19).\n\n【13】The histological examination of fragments of bone lesions of right iliac bone and sternal demonstrated dense fibrous tissue involved by the neoplasm with features that were overlapping with those identified in the histological examination of endobronchial tumor biopsy. The immunocytochemical study using the anti-NUT monoclonal antibody also demonstrated intense and diffuse nuclear positivity.\n\n【14】On the 10th day of hospitalization, the patient developed paralysis of the lower limbs associated with urinary retention in need of urinary catheter placement and uncontrolled pain. In a group decision, it was decided to perform palliative radiotherapy directed to D10 (site of spinal compression/destruction). After having completed 10 sessions of radiotherapy, improvement of the neurological and pain complaints was observed, with bladder sphincters recovery and an improvement in lower limb mobility.\n\n【15】After interdisciplinary discussions, the patient was submitted to a cycle of palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine.\n\n【16】The outcome of this case was unfortunately fatal once the patient died 5 months after diagnosis.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The term NUT midline carcinomas (NMCs) was used because this cancer is defined by rearrangement and translocation in the genes of NUT protein, and most of these tumors (about 90%) arise from midline anatomic sites . NMC is named for its tendency to involve midline structures .\n\n【19】The NUT carcinoma was recognized in the thymus in 2004 WHO classification as a carcinoma with t(15;19) translocation, and it is also referred to as NMC .\n\n【20】Although it was originally thought to be a disease of children and young adult, which is a reflection of the systematic research of neoplasms in young children, cases on new-borns to 78 years were described. Even so, most of those cases are found around the age of 15 years old, with 50% of the cases appearing over the age of 20 years old, and it seems to affect males and females equally .\n\n【21】A single translocation results in tumor transformation, classically characterized by the translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 19, t(15:19), in two-thirds of the cases, with the juxtaposition of BRD4 (19p13.1) and NUT (15q14) genes, that result in a BRD4-NTU fusion product . The fusion protein seems to block the epithelial and squamous differentiation.\n\n【22】Fewer than 63 of NUT carcinomas have been reported in the literature . Several factors contribute to its apparent rarity: insufficient reporting, underdiagnosis, being a relatively new entity, age bias, and non-specific morphology.\n\n【23】The clinical symptoms are non-specific and include dyspnea, chronic coughing, nausea, pains from metastasis in bones and chest or shoulder pain . They are also based in the location of the tumor and it is related mainly to the mass effect. At the time of diagnosis, metastases may present, with the bones being the most common site of extrathoracic involvement .\n\n【24】There are no specific radiological signs, except for the suggestion of necrosis, confirmed in rare dissected specimens, which also show hemorrhagic areas. Histologically, it is composed of layers of small to medium cells, monotonous, with irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, and frequent images of mitosis and apoptosis. Squamous differentiation, cystic transformation and reaction with anti-keratin antibodies, mainly the CK7, often occur.\n\n【25】The differential diagnosis for NUT carcinoma includes undifferentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. It includes pediatric small cell tumors (primitive neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor), melanoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, high-grade hematologic malignancies, endocrine carcinomas and other undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinomas. NUT carcinomas are monomorphic, poorly differentiated carcinomas with varying degrees of squamous differentiation, and they can mimic other undifferentiated neoplasms such as germ cell tumors, Ewing’s sarcoma or lymphoma.\n\n【26】The diagnosis is made by demonstrations of expression of the NUT-fusion protein using a monoclonal antibody to NUT for immunohistochemistry (sensitivity 87% and specificity and positive predictive value 100%), and confirmation of the fusion (BRD-NUT or NUT-variant) by fluorescent in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .\n\n【27】Patients have been receiving chemotherapy, in different combinations, without success, assuming natural chemoresistance. The radiotherapy has a palliative role and, more rarely, a neoadjuvant one, due to its low resectability.\n\n【28】In this patient, an urgent radiotherapy was used due to the compression of the spinal cord, continuing with palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【29】Currently, there is no defined therapy for this entity, in addition, durante to the aggressiveness and rapid tumor growth, surgical removal is not feasible. Apparently, the best option seems to be the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel and cisplatin. The administration of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and extra-terminal proteins inhibitors is promising but further data are required .\n\n【30】The outcome has been invariably fatal despite the promising target therapies currently tested in clinical trial.

{"seq_id": "2893b7d3-a1a2-47a7-af4a-366f33cd5827", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery has been reported occasionally after external injury to the thigh and orthopedic surgery of the femur . Rarely, a spontaneous pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery has developed without a clear history of trauma or orthopedic surgery of the femur under special conditions . Warfarin is used to treat and prevent venous thrombosis, and the dose of warfarin should be adjusted to maintain the target international normal ratio (INR) . INR values that exceed the therapeutic range lead to bleeding and other complications. We report a case of spontaneous rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm that mimicked lymphedema after radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection in a patient who was receiving warfarin, even though the dose of warfarin was adjusted to maintain the INR within the therapeutic range.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 69-year-old woman noticed swelling and pain in her left thigh after doing some light stretching for about half an hour. She thought that the symptoms were caused by lymphedema developing as a complication after the radical hysterectomy as it had occurred in the past. However, she visited our hospital because she felt the pain in her thigh, which she had not experienced previously. The patient had undergone a radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 uterine cervical cancer 11 years ago. Although just after surgery, she had several episodes of lymphedema of the thigh, there was no lymphedema since then. Two years prior, she underwent a choledocholithotomy at another hospital. Immediately after surgery, she had pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis, and an inferior vena cava filter was left in place permanently. She had been receiving warfarin in a dose of 6 mg per day since then. The patient had no history of trauma, and puncture of the femoral artery had not been performed for several years. Although the left thigh was swollen as compared with the right thigh, its skin color was normal. There was no palpable thrill in the left thigh. The hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and INR levels were 10.3 g/dL, 0.66 mg/dL, and 2.19, respectively. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed. A pseudoaneurysm of the left deep femoral artery surrounded by a large hematoma in the adductor muscle was confirmed . Active bleeding from the left deep femoral pseudoaneurysm appeared to continue. Moreover, the large hematoma in the adductor muscle might progress to the compartment syndrome. Selective angiography of the left deep femoral artery was performed after the patient received 10 mg of vitamin K by slow intravenous injection. The findings confirmed a 7.3-mm pseudoaneurysm in a muscular branch of the deep femoral artery  and extravasation of contrast medium from the pseudoaneurysm . Coil embolization was successfully performed . Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Our experience indicated three important clinical points. First, pseudoaneurysm can develop in the deep femoral artery even when the INR level of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic range. Second, swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of the deep femoral artery resembles the lower-extremity edema that occurs after radical hysterectomy. Third, contrast-enhanced CT is useful for diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery with hematoma and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage caused by hematoma.\n\n【6】First, pseudoaneurysm can develop in the deep femoral artery even when the INR level of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic range. Warfarin is used to treat venous thrombosis. Its safety and efficacy depend on the administered dose, and an INR value of 2.0 - 3.0 is recommended . A dose of warfarin exceeding the recommended therapeutic range can cause bleeding as a complication. Etiologic factors for spontaneous pseudoaneurysm formation include sports activities with muscle overcontraction or overstretching, use of anticoagulants, arterial wall weakness caused by arteriosclerosis, advanced age, inherited connective-tissue disease, infection, and congenital arterial disorders . Our patient was an elderly (69 years old), receiving warfarin, and lightly stretched her muscles for about half an hour, before coming to our hospital. Only one of the following factors is unlikely to cause pseudoaneurysm: advanced age, warfarin treatment with an INR value of 2.19, and light stretch exercise. In our patient, the presence of all three of these factors, particularly warfarinization, probably led to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【7】Second, swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm resembles the lower-extremity edema occurring after radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection. We often encounter patients who have lower-extremity edema after pelvic lymph-node dissection. If the patient had thought that her swollen thigh was caused by edema and massaged her thigh, bleeding might have increased considerably and caused the compartment syndrome. In patients who receive warfarin after pelvic lymph-node dissection, thigh swelling is likely to be caused not only by edema, but also potentially by femoral pseudoaneurysm. Moreover, rupture of a femoral pseudoaneurysm can directly cause thigh edema . These factors might create difficulty in the diagnosis of rupture of a femoral pseudoaneurysm after pelvic lymph-node dissection.\n\n【8】Third, contrast-enhanced CT is useful for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage. Although color Doppler imaging is a sensitive and specific modality for the evaluation of pseudoaneurysm , it is difficult to accurately diagnose rupture of a pseudoaneurysm with hematoma . Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain information on muscle damage after rupture of a pseudoaneurysm on color Doppler imaging. Several case reports have documented that pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery can lead to compartment syndrome . In the absence of appropriate treatment, compartment syndrome can in turn cause permanent muscle and nerve damage. Although our patient had a swollen left adductor muscle caused by hematoma, early diagnosis of the large hematoma in the adductor muscle was possible on contrast-enhanced CT, and angiography confirmed the presence of a pseudoaneurysm, allowing early treatment to be performed, thereby preventing the development of compartment syndrome.\n\n【9】In conclusion, our experience indicates that rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery can occur in patients who are receiving warfarin, even when the INR value is maintained within the therapeutic range. Swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm resembles the lower-extremity edema occurring after pelvic lymph-node dissection. We found that contrast-enhanced CT was useful for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage. Some cancer patients have venous thrombosis and require anticoagulation therapy. In cancer patients with risk factors for pseudoaneurysm who are receiving warfarin, physicians should consider the risk of pseudoaneurysm formation, even when the dose of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic INR range.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The medical community is in a desperate need to understand the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (caused by SARS-CoV-2) and explore possible therapeutic strategies in the wake of widespread mortality. At the time of writing this article, globally, 305,395 people have succumbed to this disease with 4,508,435 total infections. As almost a dozen pharmaceutical agents go into randomized controlled clinical trials, multiple studies have surfaced trying to associate a hypercoagulable state to COVID-19 patients . We reference these studies and present two novel COVID-19 cases who presented with pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The summary of cases with pertinent patient characteristics, histories, findings and supporting data are presented in Table 1 . Until now, there have been only sporadic cases of occlusive PE in COVID-19 patients, coming from China, Italy and the USA. Both our patients presented with dyspnea preceded by a mild flu-like illness and were found to have pulmonary emboli with significant clot burden at initial presentation. There were no significant predisposing risk factors, other than a hypercoagulable state due to COVID-19. The history of prostate carcinoma in patient 2 is unlikely to be contributory as he was in remission, suggested by a normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Both patients were treated with heparin products. Patient 1 remains hospitalized with moderate illness (day 4). Patient 2 required 3 days of inpatient stay and was discharged on newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with a recommended duration of 3 months. Hypercoagulable workup including factor V Leiden mutation, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III levels, and anti-phospholipid antibody tests was ordered upon outpatient follow-up, which remains pending.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Initial studies from Greece and France endorse that COVID-19 patients might be at a higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which has been attributed to a hypercoagulable state . The exact putative mechanism of this observation still remains elusive, but the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) has been implicated . Interesting autopsy findings from China suggest hyaline thrombi in some microvessels of the alveolar septum on immunohistochemical staining . Our European and Chinese colleagues recommend an early initiation of anticoagulation therapy in selected patients . This has shown to improve prognosis of this group of COVID-19 patients . In summary, all these studies point towards a similar direction, decoding the labyrinth, i.e. pathophysiology of COVID-19 and how anticoagulation therapy might fit in the algorithm. Future randomized controlled studies might help clear this association. In the meantime, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is being widely used in patients who fit this picture . This brings us to our questions to the medical community: 1) Are NOACs appropriate for these patients? 2) Should we consider these PEs as provoked or unprovoked? 3) What should be the duration of therapy?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "cfb38981-0d28-4c6e-b927-57ce88ced939", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency is an enzymopathy that leads to red blood cells (RBCs) hemolysis . It is the most common enzymopathic disorder of RBCs . It is a genetic disorder localized on the X chromosome which is inherited by an X-linked recessive pattern. Thus, it is transmitted and occurs primarily in males. Worldwide, it has been reported that more than 400 million people have been diagnosed with this disease . The rate of new cases is associated with areas endemic for malaria. However, it is conventional in other countries . A huge body of evidence considered that the G-6-PD is the most important factor in the production of antioxidants, which protecting the cells from oxidative damage . Accordingly, patients with G-6-PD deficiency are highly susceptible to oxidative stressors . In the previous reported cases, successful anesthetic management of a patient with G-6-PD deficiency involved the decreasing of possible oxidative stressors, and this is dependent on the type of surgery . In our report, we present this case of successful anesthetic management in a 23-year-old female patient with G-6-PD deficiency undergoing coblation adenoidectomy with septoplasty and turbinectomy. We also discuss the different types of medication to be used in such a patient based on reviewing the literature and our experience.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 23-year-old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 48 kg) was diagnosed as G-6-PD deficiency at the age of 7 years after a hemolytic episode, and she received a blood transfusion at that time; no other episodes were reported. She presented to the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Clinic with symptoms of nasal obstruction, nasal tone of voice, and mouth breathing. A routine laboratory investigation was revealed: hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, white blood cell counts of 4.63 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, RBC counts of 4.09 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L, and platelet of 158 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; all are within normal limits. Computerized tomography (CT) of paranasal sinuses showed deviated nasal septum, minimal mucosal thickening seen in the maxillary sinuses, left upper molar radicular cyst, and asymmetrical thickening of the nasopharyngeal mucosa.\n\n【4】The planned surgery was for coblation adenoidectomy with septoplasty and turbinectomy. Intraoperatively, a 20-gauge intravenous cannula was established, and the patient was monitored by electrocardiogram (ECG), bispectral index sensor (BIS) and the measurement of oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), temperature, and followed by preoxygenation. Pre-induction vital signs revealed blood pressure of 118/81 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm), SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100%, and a temperature of 36.4 °C. Thereafter, general anesthesia induced with fentanyl (100 µg), propofol (150 mg), rocuronium (30 mg), and dexamethasone (16 mg). The patient was intubated by a direct laryngoscope with oral endotracheal Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) tube (internal diameter (ID): 6.5 mm) with an inflatable cuff and connected to the circuit of the anesthesia machine. Anesthesia has been maintained by the inhalational anesthetic agent sevoflurane (2.0%) with O <sub>2 </sub> /N <sub>2 </sub> O mixture (1.0/1.0 L/min). The patient was positioned supine for the surgery. Before the incision was made, cefazolin (2 g) was given as a prophylactic antibiotic. At 40 min into the surgery, we administered paracetamol (1 g) followed by oxycodone (4 mg). Also, she received isotonic, crystalloid fluid (Ringer’s lactate) with a total infusion of 650 mL. The estimated blood loss was 50 mL. Intraoperatively, the patient was vitally stable. The duration of the surgery was approximately 90 min. At the end of the surgery, we reversed the residual neuromuscular medication with glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) plus neostigmine (2.5 mg), and when the patient was fully awake, the trachea was extubated successfully. Postoperatively, oxycodone has been used as a postoperative analgesia. Moreover, we monitored the patient for any signs or symptoms of an acute hemolytic crisis. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day (POD) after assuring the result of complete blood count (CBC) is normal.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】In the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which known also as phosphogluconate pathway and hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt, the major enzyme is G-6-PD . It is the first step in PPP resulting in converting glucose to ribose-5-phosphate. In our body, the only source for generating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) is PPP . In contrast, the generation of NADPH will lead to reducing cell energy by controlling the reduced glutathione within the cell . Oxidative damage will be bypassed by glutathione reduction as this mechanism results in cell protection . RBCs do not have another metabolic backup system as other human cells, which work to generate the intracellular NADPH . Therefore, any exposure to oxidative stress will contribute to hemolytic anemia . Subsequently, G-6-PD deficiency is lethal in RBCs . However, RBCs are vulnerable to oxidative stress, leading to hemolytic anemia .\n\n【7】Hemolysis can be happening after exposure to many factors such as fava beans, infections, metabolic conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and hypothermia, and have been all over reported previously . Furthermore, certain types of medication such as antimicrobials (sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, and chloramphenicol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants, diuretics containing sulfonamide, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and ranitidine, are known to lead to hemolytic anemia . The mechanism of hemolytic anemia is due to membrane damage by oxidized hemoglobin . At the same time, anesthetic drugs such as diclofenac, metoclopramide, lidocaine, methylene blue, and prilocaine are contraindicated in patients with G-6-PD deficiency . While glycopyrrolate, fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol, ketamine, propofol, thiopental, halothane, nitrous oxide, rocuronium, succinylcholine, neostigmine, bupivacaine, and heparin are reported previously as it can be administrated safely in patients with G-6-PD deficiency . However, there are anesthetic agents still controversy such as sevoflurane and midazolam . In our case, we administrated the inhalational agent sevoflurane, and to our experience it is safe in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. Overall, there is insufficient evidence of medications to be used in G-6-PD deficiency patients, and some of them are still controversy . Hence, for patients with G-6-PD deficiency, perioperative medications must be known as much as possible to avoid acute hemolytic crisis. All the administrated medications in our case were safe for a patient with G-6-PD deficiency.\n\n【8】Also, hemolysis can be caused by surgical stress, which has been reported in the literature . Therefore, perioperative adequate analgesia will work effectively to decrease the level of stress related to the surgery . We provided adequate analgesia throughout the intraoperative and postoperative interval because this surgery is painful. In such a case, our aim is to avoid acute hemolytic crisis . However, acute hemolytic crisis is self-limiting and in severe rare cases granting blood transfusion . After 24 to 72 h, the hemolysis can become demonstrable in patients with risk factors . Intraoperatively, reducing oxidative stress is extremely important besides monitoring and treating hemolysis . During surgery, hematuria is an indicator of an acute hemolytic crisis . Reaching to the diagnosis is substantial, and once that made, we have to cease the triggering agent and maintaining the urine output by infusing crystalloids as well as administration of non-sulfonamide diuretics . Unfortunately, a Foley catheter was not inserted in our case because the surgical duration was short; but we recommend inserting a Foley catheter in such a patient to monitor the urine output regardless of the surgical duration. Postoperatively, the symptoms of hemolysis will be appearing clearly by 7 days after the hemolysis, which include headache, fatigue, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, lethargy, lumbar pain, abdominal pain, splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria and scleral icterus . To monitor the need for blood transfusion, CBC must be done daily after an episode of acute hemolytic crisis . Microscopic examination of the peripheral blood smear will show RBC fragments such as reticulocytes, schistocytes, and Heinz bodies. Other lab investigations that can be done are lactate dehydrogenase and unconjugated bilirubin which will be increased, whereas haptoglobin levels will decrease . Additionally, urobilinogen and hemosiderin can be detected in the urine . Also, we can use the direct Coombs test to rule out an immunological reaction .\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】From an anesthetic point of view, acute hemolytic crisis is correlated with different triggers as we previously mentioned. Out of these triggers, there are particular types of medication we have to avoid as much as possible in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. Moreover, monitoring the patient perioperatively for such a crisis is extremely important, which includes surgical stress, because acute hemolytic crisis is a life-threatening situation in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

GBS is an autoimmune disorder that emerges as a result of a postinfectious defect at a population that is generally healthy and that does not have any systemic or autoimmune disease. This case is the third reported in the literature in terms of the association of GBS and pericarditis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 52-year-old male patient applied to our clinic with the complaint of numbness and loss of strength at the extremities for three days. In his story it is learned that the patient had upper respiratory tract infection 10 days ago. Numbness of the feet began a few days before the numbness of hands and afterwards loss of strength began to develop at the legs and arms. Any significant pathological finding was not detected at the physical examination. At the neurologic examination of the patient during the application, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The deep tendon reflexes (DTR) were not detected at the lower extremities while they were hypoactive in the upper extremities. There were stocking style hypoestesia at both legs. Bilateral proximal and distal upper limb muscle strength was found to be 4/5 and bilateral proximal and distal lower extremity muscle strength was found to be 3/5, respectively. The base skin reflexes were evaluated as flexor, bilaterally.\n\n【4】In electromyography (EMG) examination, with the axonal and demyelinating involvement, widespread sensory motor type polyneuropathy and loss of F responses was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was seemed to have a clear view and the pressure was found to be normal. In the microscopic examination of CSF no cells were observed, and total protein was found to be high (144 mg/dL; normal range: 15 - 45 mg/dL).\n\n【5】The patient was diagnosed to have GBS and was administered 400 mg/kg per day intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) treatment for 5 days. At the 2th day of admission the patient had the complaint of palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain that increases with lying on his back and that is radiating to both of the shoulders. Cardiological evaluation was normal but at the ECG examination pericardial effusion was detected, diagnosis of acute pericarditis was done and ibuprofen treatment was started.\n\n【6】Viral markers that were screened in order to evaluate the etiology were found to be negative. Fever and diarrhea developed during his stay at the clinic. Thus, a complete blood count, sedimentation rate, peripheral blood smear, biochemistry, ASO, throat, urine, and stool culture was performed and empiric antibiotic moxifloxacin was started at a dose of 400 mg daily IV. Culture results were negative. At the 10th day of antibiotic therapy, the therapy was stopped. Granted for a period of five days prior to at the 10th day following the discontinuation of the IVIG treatment after administration for 5 days, hypoesthesia was reduced and hypoactive DTR’s at the lower extremities can be able to be taken at the neurological examination. Bilateral proximal and distal upper limb muscle strength was found to be 5/5, while bilateral proximal lower extremity muscle strength was 4/5 and the distal was 5/5, respectively. 14 days after the application for chest pain, pericardial effusion was disappeared at the echocardiography.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】GBS and the coexistence of pericarditis have rarely been reported in the literature. In our case, this developed condition can be interpreted as the coexistence of two rare condition or complication of GBS with pericarditis. Of the GBS patients in the literature about at 2/3, prior infection symptoms were detected within 3 weeks before the muscle weakness symptoms were emerged . A nearly similar prodromal period can also seen at the most common form of acute pericarditis, which is known as acute idiopathic pericarditis. In our patient, similar to the findings of this study, 10 days before the occurrence of symptoms of the GBS symptoms of influenza, such as fever and runny nose emerged. This situation suggests that there seems to be a possibility that the same factor causes GBS and as well as pericarditis.\n\n【9】Although, in the literature many types of infections were reported to be in association with GBS, the most common causative infections are upper respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Campylobacter jejuni, CMV, EBV, M. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are considered as common triggering agents of GBS . On the other hand, although it is controversial,in the literature, events other than the infections such as, vaccines, operations and stress are reported to be associated with GBS .\n\n【10】In the literature, there are 2 patients that have the coexistance of GBS with pericarditis. In the case report of Kao et al, a 68-year- old female patient at which GBS was emerged after the influenzae vaccination, was diagnosed to have pericarditis based on echocardiography. The patient recovered fully within two months with plasmapheresis . Komiagin et al. reported GBS and exudative pericarditis emerged after acute hepatitis B infection in a patient receiving hemodialysis .\n\n【11】Like the general population, due to the high probability of missing the pericarditis at the patients with GBS, pericarditis may not be so uncommon contrary to the beliefs. For this reason, GBS patients deserve a careful review for symptoms of pericarditis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The triggering etiology in most cases is unknown, but it has been reported to be associated with certain infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Helicobacter pylori . Histoplasmosis is the most common of all North American fungal infections. The lymphogenous reaction to Histoplasma can cause mediastinal lymph node enlargement, bronchiectasis, constrictive pericarditis, and rarely, idiopathic thrombocytopenia. We report a case of ITP secondary to histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of non-bloody diarrhea, lightheadedness, and nausea. The patient’s past medical history was significant for ITP diagnosed in 1990 with a relapse in 2011 during which time she was treated with aggressive medical management. During this most recent admission, she was found to have a platelet count of 6,000/μL and therefore diagnosed as having another ITP relapse.\n\n【4】The patient was admitted and started on intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. Her platelet count gradually improved and the patient was evaluated for a splenectomy as definitive treatment of her ITP. Two weeks after discharge, the patient underwent a splenectomy.\n\n【5】The patient tolerated the procedure well, without any intra-operative complications. Pathologic evaluation of the resected spleen revealed methenamine silver stain-positive structures consistent with Histoplasma species . The patient was therefore diagnosed as having ITP secondary to histoplasmosis, a rare but known risk factor for the development of ITP.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】In 1951, William Harrington published and first described patients with ITP . Fifty years later, many aspects of the pathogenesis of ITP remain unanswered, and the management remains controversial .\n\n【8】ITP is a relatively common acquired bleeding disorder characterized by autoimmune destruction of platelets. In adults, the annual incidence is around 1.6/100,000, common in middle aged females . In patients with ITP, physical examination is usually normal aside from bleeding manifestations, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and purpura . The three key diagnostic criteria for ITP are isolated thrombocytopenia with otherwise normal peripheral complete blood count and smear, an absence of hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy on physical examination, and platelet response to classic ITP therapy .\n\n【9】ITP has been noted to be associated with HIV, H. pylori , and HCV as possible etiological agents in some cases . Histoplasma is frequently seen in certain geographic location associated with decaying bat guano or bird droppings . In the United States, it is commonly seen in the states bordering the Ohio River valley and the lower Mississippi River . Histoplasmosis commonly involves the lungs and mimics sarcoidosis. Disseminated histoplasmosis is usually seen in association with immunosuppressed individuals .\n\n【10】Review of the literature has shown case reports of disseminated histoplasmosis presenting with thrombocytopenia . Our patient comes from a geographic location where histoplasmosis is endemic. Most cases of histoplasmosis have mild symptoms and usually escape diagnosis .\n\n【11】The microconidia formed in the mold phase of Histoplasma capsulatum are easily aerosolized, inhaled into the lungs, and then phagocytized by alveolar macrophages. Inside the macrophage, the organism converts to the yeast phase, survives within the macrophage for the first few weeks, and disseminates widely throughout the reticuloendothelial system . If cell-mediated immunity is deficient because of immunosuppression due to corticosteroids, transplanted organs, the organisms remain viable within macrophages and cause progressive infection . Most patients have either no symptoms or mild pulmonary complaints that are not severe enough to seek medical care .\n\n【12】Although disseminated histoplasmosis has been reported to be associated with thrombocytopenia and anemia, most of these patients are immunocompromised.

It was found in 1.4% of cases in an autopsy study, whereas clinical diagnosis was made in 0.014% of those patients  suggesting that the condition is frequently missed and that a high degree of suspicion is needed to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n【2】L Traube  published the first case of renal embolic disease in Germany in 1856 and since then multiple other case reports and case series have appeared in the medical literature.\n\n【3】The following case reports illustrate different risk factors that predispose to ARI. We also review the previously published case report series.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 47-year-old man presented with right lower abdominal and back pain for three days associated with vomiting. The pain was throbbing in nature, had no radiation, and had an intensity of 10/10. He had smoked at least 5 cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, used heroin in the past, and currently received methadone 120 mg daily. Physical examination was unremarkable except for severe right flank pain. His vital signs showed a blood pressure was 150/80 mmHg, pulse 60 beats per minute and regular, respirations 16 per minute, and temperature 36.5 °C.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin of 14 g/dl, leukocyte count 7600 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophils 80.5%, platelets 241000 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 76 units/liter (normal 10 - 42), alanine aminotransferase was 65 units/liter (normal 10 - 40), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) 657 units/liter (normal 91 - 180). Urinalysis was strongly positive for blood, and urine protein was 300 mg/dl. Three sets of cardiac enzymes gave normal results. Total cholesterol was 196 mg/dl (normal 140 - 200), low density lipoprotein (LDL) 143 mg/dl (normal < 130), triglyceride 68 mg/dl (normal 35 - 160) and homocysteine 6.9 micromoles per liter (normal < 11.4).\n\n【8】The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 52 beats per minute and inverted T waves in the inferior wall and chest leads. Echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction and no evidence of thrombus or vegetations. Impaired relaxation pattern of the left ventricular diastolic filling was observed.\n\n【9】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed right renal infarct with occlusion of the posterior branch of the right renal artery . Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the abdominal aorta and renal arteries confirmed right renal infarction involving the upper and posterior cortex.\n\n【10】He was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin. His symptom improved significantly, and was discharged.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】An 89-year-old woman presented with right lower quadrant pain that started suddenly in the early morning hours, sharp in quality, 5/10 in severity, non radiating, and associated with nausea but no vomiting.\n\n【13】Her past medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and osteoarthritis. Medications on presentation were amlodipine, metolazone, enalapril, and aspirin. She had been taking warfarin in the past but had discontinued after an episode of toxicity. She never smoked or abused alcohol or illicit drugs. Her blood pressure was 160/60 mmHg, pulse 67 beats per minute, irregular, respirations 16 per minute, and temperature 36.2 °C. She had right lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds were present.\n\n【14】Laboratory tests yielded a serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dl, hemoglobin13.1 g/dl, leukocyte count 6400 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 213000 per liter, lactate dehydrogenase 1957 units per liter. Urinalysis was strongly positive for blood, and urine protein was 100 mg/dl.\n\n【15】Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Abdominal sonogram did not reveal abnormalities.\n\n【16】CECT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed poor enhancement in the lower two thirds of the right kidney and a focal filling defect in the distal right renal artery, suggestive of thromboembolism causing the infarct of the right lower two thirds of the kidney. Echocardiogram showed no evidence of thrombus or vegetations and the ejection fraction was 55%. She was treated with heparin drip and later discharged on warfarin.\n\n【17】Case 3\n\n【18】A 41-year-old male was admitted to the hospital after suffering a gunshot wound, and had penetrating and blunt injuries. Past medical history and social history were unobtainable. On presentation blood pressure was 59/45 mmHg, pulse 98 beats per minute, respirations 40 per minute, and temperature 34.2 °C. He underwent splenectomy with repair of mesenteric injuries as well serosal tears of his colon.\n\n【19】Initial laboratory data showed a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dl, hemoglobin12.4 g/dl, leukocyte count 7500 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 153000/L. No urinalysis was available. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed hypoperfusion of the left kidney with multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypodensities representing possible infarcts. The left renal artery only demonstrated contrast enhancement on some of its branches suggesting renal artery injury.\n\n【20】Anticoagulation was initiated with heparin drip. Later he developed acute kidney injury and underwent multiple sessions of hemodialysis until renal function recovered. A follow-up CECT was done and revealed normal kidneys, at which time the heparin infusion was discontinued.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】The clinical presentation of ARI is nonspecific and may be confused with that of a renal colic. Patients commonly present to the ED with flank or abdominal pain associated with fever, nausea or vomiting, or may only present with acute onset of hypertension . The prevalence of spontaneous kidney infarction in patients with new onset hypertension is 3% and the incidence is 0.18% per year . The classic triad consists of persisting abdominal or flank pain; elevated serum LD and/or microscopic hematuria; and high risk of thromboembolism.\n\n【23】Laboratory studies reveal hematuria and proteinuria in most instances, and the blood levels of LD and the aminotransferases are frequently raised. Absence of hematuria indicates more serious loss of renal function . Measurement of urinary LD may also be helpful.\n\n【24】The diagnosis is confirmed with CECT, angiography, or isotope scan. The sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) is 80%, renal isotope 97% and angiography is 100% . CT characteristically shows a perfusion defect with a mass effect representing the zone of infarct, sometimes surrounded by a cortical rim sign indicative of the zone of ischemia (functioning nephrons supplied blood via capsular collaterals). The isotope scan demonstrates absent or reduced blood flows to the affected area. Angiography can clearly delineate the lesion. Hilton S et al  correlated the CT findings with angiography and sonographic findings and concluded that the diagnosis can usually be made on the basis of specific CT findings. Angiography is valuable in helping to establish the cause and direct treatment. Sonography is less important in diagnosis but can be helpful in corroborating the CT findings. In case of high probability of renal infarction, Haung CC et al  suggested to obtain a CECT of the abdomen if no calculi are detected after unenhanced CT. They were able to make the correct diagnosis in 50% of cases during their first visit to the ED.\n\n【25】The pathogenesis of renal infarction is frequently due to thromboembolic events in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Frost L et al  followed 30,000 patients with atrial fibrillation over a 13-year period and noted 2% incidence of renal artery embolism. Hazanov N et al  reported 44 cases of ARI in patients with atrial fibrillation over 18-year period. Patients were mostly older than 60 years and had previous embolic events. Renal isotope scan was the most sensitive diagnostic test in this group of patients. Case 2 is an example of this complication although we could not detect any intracardiac thrombi on echocardiographic examination. Vegetations in infective endocarditis and cardiac tumors are other potential sources of emboli that could lead to a renal infarct, while case 1 illustrates an occlusion of the renal arteries due to thrombosis, which usually occurs with pre-existing renovascular disease.\n\n【26】Trauma or aortic interventions may also lead to ARI  as shown in case 3. Other risk factors include: clotting disorders, vessel anomalies such as fibromuscular dysplasia, kidney transplantation, antiphospholipid syndrome, Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis, malignancies, and sickle cell disease. Cases of renal artery occlusion resulting from the use of cocaine  and infection with mucormycosis  have been described. It can be idiopathic. Bolderman R et al  identified sixteen patients (59%) over 2.5 years who developed ARI without any structural or arrhythmic cardiac disease. Cigarette smoking increases the risk for arterial thrombosis. Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, decreases protein C activity and increases platelet aggregation and fibrinogen concentration. All of these effects may have contributed to the thrombosis of the abnormal renal artery in case 1.\n\n【27】We reviewed ten published case series and tabulated the data in Table 1 . There were a total of 213 patients. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain, followed by flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and fever. In all case series, laboratory findings were similar: hematuria, elevated LD, proteinuria and leucocytosis. The most common risk factor was atrial fibrillation, followed by history of thromboembolism, coagulation dysfunction and heart disease.\n\n【28】The treatment modalities include anticoagulation with heparin followed by warfarin, except when contraindications (such as aortic dissection) are present.\n\n【29】Thrombolysis and thrombectomy had been accomplished in patients with unilateral and bilateral occlusion but the results show only occasional improvement in renal function. In one case series, of seven patients who received thrombolysis, one developed end-stage renal disease, one had mild renal failure and two died . In another case series, out of five patients, one patient’s renal function did not recover or worsen during more than 1 year of follow-up . In a case series reported by Korzets Z et al , one patient had a combination of intravenous heparin and renal intra-arterial urokinase infusion, but no improvement was observed. The patient had a serum creatinine of 3.5 with a contralateral contracted kidney, required maintenance dialysis. Angioplasty and stent placement had been tried in some cases. The success of the intervention is limited by the duration of the ischemia.\n\n【30】The prognosis of ARI is determined by the etiology and the size of the infarct. In most series of unilateral disease there was not a significant loss of kidney function most likely due to compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney tissue, but in most instances of bilateral infarct complete loss of renal function follows. Some patients develop persistent hypertension following ARI .\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】A high degree of suspicion remains the key for early diagnosis of ARI. Patients presenting with flank pain, hematuria and proteinuria as well as elevated level of LD should undergo CECT scan to obtain confirmation. Early anticoagulation may reduce symptoms and help preserve kidney function by preventing recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Its hallmark is the destruction of septal and interlobular ducts and portal inflammation with scarring, causing extensive fibrosis and liver failure .\n\n【2】Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by inflammatory, fibrotic and degenerative changes. It may be classified as diffuse cutaneous SSc or limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) on the basis of the extent and distribution of skin involvement. The systemic manifestations of the disease include circulation abnormalities, such as Raynaud’s phenomenon, and multiple organ involvement with fibrotic and vascular complications .\n\n【3】The association between PBC and other autoimmune conditions, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or systemic sclerosis occurs in 84% of cases . The overlap of lcSSc and PBC is known as Reynolds syndrome, after the lead author of an article published in 1971 . The authors report a patient with lcSSc and PBC.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In 1999 a 76-year-old man presented with Raynaud’s phenomenon complaints and mild arthralgias in the previous month. His past medical history revealed only benign prostatic hyperplasia and arterial hypertension. Physical examination showed mild skin thickening of forearms and moderate skin thickening of hands (according to modified Rodnan skin score), sclerodactyly, cutaneous calcifications in the forearms, pitting digital ulcers in the 2nd and 3rd fingers of the right hand and facial telangiectasias. Thoracic and abdominal examination was normal.\n\n【6】The routine laboratory workup (hemogram, ionogram, liver function tests, c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was normal. Immunoelectrophoresis was suggestive of monoclonal gammopathy IgM kappa. The proteinogram revealed gamma monoclonal peak. Bone marrow examination detected changes compatible with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Antinuclear and anticentromere antibodies were positive (with maximum score in a qualitative scale, ++++). Anti-SSA(Ro) antibody was also positive. All other autoimmune tests were negative. Chest radiography had discrete signs of lung fibrosis. Nailfold capillaroscopy showed senile pattern in the left hand, while in the right hand it showed dilated capillaries, few giant capillaries, severe stasis and pericapillar edema, without avascular areas . Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis diagnosis was established. Treatment with sustained-release nifedipin 30 mg id, aspirin 100 mg id and pentoxifylline 400 mg bid was begun, with clinical improvement.\n\n【7】The patient was regularly observed, with no changes in the autoimmunity pattern until 2005, when in addition to the antinuclear and anticentromere, antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) were also strongly positive (++++). Liver function tests, particularly alkaline phosphatase, were normal, while erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 45 mm/hour. In 2006 he presented with fatigue, pruritus and dyspnea on exertion. Liver function tests showed elevation of alkaline phosphatase (143 U/L, normal range 30 - 120 U/L) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (81 U/L, normal range < 55 U/L). Although the patient refused liver biopsy, two PBC criteria were met and the diagnosis was established. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid 250 mg tid and cholestyramine 4 gr bid was instituted. Mild increase in liver function tests was observed over time .\n\n【8】In 2008 the patient was admitted to the hospital with 4 months history of anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain and significant weight loss (27% of body weight lost in that period). On physical examination the patient presented abdominal distention and ascites. Laboratory workup revealed low serum albumin (3.3 g/dL, normal range 3.5 - 5.2 g/dL), elevated alkaline phosphatase (215 U/L), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (83 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (45 U/L, normal range < 35 U/L). Endoscopy showed grade II esophageal varices in the distal third of the esophagus and congestive and hypertrophic gastric mucosa. Abdominal computed tomography was performed, presenting small nodular liver, with difuse steatosis, and splenomegaly. Furosemide 40 mg bid, spironolactone 50 mg id and propranolol 20 mg bid were added to the previous therapeutic regimen with clinical improvement. Simvastatin 20 mg id was also prescribed for the treatment of recently diagnosed hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【9】The patient was admitted to the emergency room in 2009 with chest pain. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed and standard medical therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and low molecular weight heparin was given, but the patient died before angioplasty could be performed.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The overlap of different autoimmune conditions is widely known. The association of lcSSc and PBC was first described in 1970 by Murray-Lion et al  and in 1971 by Reynolds et al . The prevalence of SSc in patients with PBC is 3-8%. Conversely, the estimated prevalence of PBC among patients with SSc is 2.5-3% . Although the subjacent immune mechanisms are not yet completely known, Mayo et al reported that antigen-stimulated T-cells play an important role and described bigger prevalence of clonal populations of CD8+ TCRBV3 in Reynolds syndrome than in both conditions alone .\n\n【12】PBC is more frequent in women (8:1 female-to-male ratio) and patients present usually between the 5th and 7th decades, with an estimated incidence of 0.7 - 49 cases per million-population per year . Systemic sclerosis also affects mostly women (5:1 female-to-male ratio), generally between the 3rd and 5th decades and with annual incidence of 14.1 cases per million . The authors present a case of a male patient who first was diagnosed with lcSSc at the age of 76 years and with PBC seven years later. The onset of any of these diseases separately is uncommon either in the male gender or in older patients.\n\n【13】PBC is probably the result of the interaction between genetic background and extrinsic factors. Most patients are asymptomatic (48-60%)  and the diagnosis is suspected in routine blood tests, due to abnormal alkaline phosphatase values. Fatigue and pruritus are the most common symptoms . According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines on PBC, the diagnosis can be established when two out of three criteria: 1) biochemical evidence of cholestasis based mainly on alkaline phosphatase elevation; 2) presence of AMA; 3) histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts . Although liver biopsy allows diagnostic confirmation and disease staging, it is not mandatory for diagnosis once the other two criteria are met. In our case the patient had alkaline phosphatase elevation and positive AMA, therefore the diagnosis was established. Liver biopsy was considered, but the patient refused the procedure. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was iniciated but liver function tests gradually worsened and finally in 2008 he was admitted due to liver failure. Liver transplant is the only treatment that truly improves PBC’s natural history .\n\n【14】The diagnosis of lcSSc was based on clinical findings of severe Raynaud’s phenomenon, mild calcinosis, sclerodactily and telangiectasia. Only esophageal dysmotility was lacking for the diagnosis of CREST syndrome, although the patient had dyspeptic complaints. Autoimmune pattern was also compatible with lcSSc, antinuclear and anticentromere antibodies were strongly positive and anti-DNA topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibody was negative. Nailfold capillaroscopy revealed also typical findings of scleroderma . Symptomatic treatment for Raynaud’s phenomenon was given to our patient, with positive evolution. SSc can cause heart disease, namely pericardial effusion, myocardial fibrosis and arrhythmias . Despite this patient had no previous history of cardiac disease, he died of an acute myocardial infarction. We cannot exclude that this patient had cardiac manifestations of SSc.\n\n【15】Reynolds syndrome prognosis depends of PBC’s severity, since lcSSc is a relatively benign slow progressive form of SSc . The regular evaluation of liver function tests is useful for monitoring disease progression. Advanced age, hyperbilirubinemia, low serum albumin and stage 4 (cirrhosis) liver biopsy indicate worse prognosis . Nevertheless, survival of patients with PBC and CREST syndrome seems to be better than that of patients with PBC alone .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "24b71260-baeb-4510-9310-c60927135a9f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Pheochromocytoma is a rare chromaffin cell tumor that secretes catecholamines which can precipitate life-threatening hypertension . It is usually benign in nature, but a few malignant tumors have also been reported. The diagnosis is made by measuring plasma metanephrines or a 24-h urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines . Approximately 10% are discovered incidentally . Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often used for localization, with the latter being the modality of choice. Surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice and often cures the associated hypertension. Careful preoperative treatment with alpha blockade and, if required, beta blockers are important in the prevention of intraoperative hypertensive crises .\n\n【2】An aortic aneurysm (AA) is defined as a localized or diffuse dilation of the aorta with a diameter increase of more than 50% of its normal limits. It can be localized above the diaphragm (thoracic AA) or below it (abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)). It can also present on either sides of the diaphragm (thoracoabdominal aneurysm). The etiology encompasses infections, arteritis, trauma, and inherited connective tissue disorders. Smoking is the strongest risk factor associated with AAs. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, increasing age, male sex, and increased body mass index have also been thought to be associated. There has been an inverse association noted with females, African Americans, and diabetics . Although the majority are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally on imaging, they can be potentially life-threatening. Surgical repair is still the definitive treatment.\n\n【3】There are few reports in the literature that propose an association between pheochromocytoma and AAA . Herein, we support those few and, uniquely, report the first norepinephrine type (NE-type) pheochromocytoma coexisting in association with diffuse AAs.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 60-year-old African American male with a history of refractory hypertension, type 2 diabetes, tobacco use, heart failure, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and chronic kidney disease presented to the hospital with a 1-week history of diarrhea, altered mental status, weakness, and nausea. At presentation, he was bradycardic and disoriented to time. Otherwise, his physical exam was unremarkable. He was hyperkalemic as a result of acute on chronic kidney injury with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.\n\n【6】An abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate his hyperbilirubinemia, which revealed an incidental AAA and a mass atop the left kidney. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an AAA with involvement of the mesenteric vessels. The AAA showed maximum diameter of 5.3 cm at the level of celiac artery . Additionally, a retroperitoneal mass was detected between the superior pole of the left kidney and abdominal aorta. This measured 5.3 × 4.7 cm with irregular peripheral enhancement concerning for an adrenal tumor . For verification, an abdominal and pelvic MRI was done and confirmed the CT findings.\n\n【7】In light of the patient’s refractory hypertension, the presence of pheochromocytoma was suspected. Further serum and urine biochemical studies yielded a greater than seven-fold increase in total plasma metanephrines (10-fold increase in free plasma normetanephrine with low free plasma metanephrines) and a six-fold increase in 24-h urine total metanephrines (seven-fold increase in 24-h urine normetanephrine with normal 24-h fractionated metanephrines). Plasma cortisol, aldosterone, and supine renin activity levels were found to be low . Thus, a diagnosis of adrenal pheochromocytoma was made. I-MIBG scintigraphy was not done due to the high risk of interaction with some of the patient’s medications that could not be discontinued.\n\n【8】In order to assess the integrity of the thoracic aorta, a chest CT without contrast was done and detected an ascending AA with diameter of 4.3 cm at the level of the right pulmonary artery as well as a descending thoracic AA with diameter of 4.7 cm at the level of the diaphragm. A surgical approach was deferred at this time after expert consultation with vascular surgery as the patient was asymptomatic. The patient’s CKD status placed him at higher risk for dialysis-dependence and this outweighed the benefits of a surgical approach. Thus, the case was managed medically and the initial plan of pheochromocytoma resection was discussed with endocrine surgery and deferred to a point of time when his renal function is optimal.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Although aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta, the abdomen is the most common site. The majority of AAAs occur below the level of the renal arteries with a size greater than 4.0 cm. Thoracic AAs are subdivided depending on the location: ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta. Prognosis is based on size, growth rate, and severity of coexisting vascular diseases. The greater the size and the faster the growth rate of the aneurysm, the greater the risk for rupture and the worse the prognosis.\n\n【11】Pheochromocytoma has been classified into two types based on plasma catecholamine levels: 1) NE-type and 2) mixed epinephrine-norepinephrine type (E-type). The NE-type has been reported to have an association with a deficiency in the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) . Deficiency in PNMT would result in a buildup of normetanephrine and a relative deficiency in metanephrine . No genetic testing was done on our patient to prove that he had a PNMT deficiency. However, his lab values showing very high normetanephrine and low metanephrine levels coincide with the NE-type pheochromocytoma.\n\n【12】The coexistence of pheochromocytoma and AAA has been reported previously in the literature . Our article reaffirms such association and substantiates the authors’ claim. Persistently high catecholamines in the blood damage and weaken the vascular endothelium of the aorta. With more than seven-fold rise in total catecholamine levels in our patient, it is plausible that this played a role in developing his AAs. Additionally, we propose a distinctive association between the NE-type pheochromocytoma and AAs. We believe that the NE-type may have a greater propensity and aggressive nature that can cause more destructive damage throughout the aorta compared to the E-type. This was manifested in our patient with multiple aortic aneurysmal lesions at the ascending, descending thoracic, and abdominal aorta.\n\n【13】Management of patients with coexisting pheochromocytoma and AA remains an evolving field. The rarity of this coexistence leaves ideal management unclear with no specific guidelines. It is suggested that concomitant surgical removal of the pheochromocytoma and AA repair be attempted if the patient’s condition allows. Regarding AAA, surgical repair is recommended if the aneurysm is ≥ 5.5 cm and/or symptomatic. For patients that are surgical candidates, pre-operative medical optimization is crucial. Alpha and possibly beta-adrenergic blockade decrease the perioperative and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality related to the catecholamine surge . Unfortunately, our asymptomatic patient was not a surgical candidate at the time due to his acutely worsened kidney function. Therefore, he was medically managed with blood pressure control and close follow-up until his clinical status improved, upon which a surgical option would be reconsidered.\n\n【14】In conclusion, pheochromocytoma is associated with high levels of circulating catecholamines that damage and weaken aortic walls. Consequently, this can result in the development of AAs. The NE-type pheochromocytoma demonstrated in our case appears to have a more diffuse and aggressive effect on the aortic walls compared to the E-type that is usually confined to one area. We encourage all clinicians to report similar cases with coexisting pheochromocytoma and AAs as well as, to note the type of pheochromocytoma (NE- versus E-type) in order to further evaluate for a possible association.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "cac0bf1c-7426-4d30-ab38-2897f4c4b094", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Verrucae vulgaris (VV), also known as common wart, are the one of proliferative virus dermatopathy infected and produced by human papilloma virus (HPV). It represents the most frequent clinical lesions as the hyperkeratotic papulonodules that can be seen anywhere on the glabrous skin . However, there are few cases of giant verrucae vulgaris (GVV) reported in the published work and its pathogenesis is largely unknown. By literature, GVV often occurred among transplanted patients and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients . On the other hand, butcher's warts are often larger than common warts. These warts usually occur in people whose occupation is related to handling of meat, poultry, or fish products . We herein report a healthy middle-aged man with GVV who had been misdiagnosed as eczema and treated with topical glucocorticoids uninterruptedly for 4 years. We suggest that the prolonged exposure of topical glucocorticoids might associate with the formation of GVV.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old man had complained of a growing large flavotestaceous massy plaque covered with some nodules and many crusts on the shin of his left leg for nearly 4 years at our clinic. Since 2006, the patient had arisen with some pruritic red papules on the shin of his left leg without any treatment. Later, the lesion was developed into local phanero-pruritic erythema and maculopapules progressively. He had been diagnosed as eczema at the local hospital. Then, A simple anti-allergic therapy and topical fluocinolone acetonide and halometasone application were applied twice daily on these lesions. After continual scratching and applying these glucocorticoids alternately for 4 years, a large massy plaque covered with nodules and crusts were gradually developed. Furthermore, the lesion was thickening and expanding further. The patient was otherwise healthy and denied any occupational history of meat-handle before. No medical history of trauma and similar family history were reported.\n\n【4】Systemic and laboratory examinations revealed normal data. Tissue biopsy cultures were negative for fungi, atypical mycobacteria, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. On dermatological examination, a well-defined, flavotestaceous-color, 5 × 5 cm sized, massy plaque covered with some nodules and crusts without hemorrhage was observed on the shin of his left leg. An obsolete granulation tissue was found around the basement of one nodule but no evident erosion and ulcer. A biopsy specimen was taken from the margin of the plaque. Histopathologic examination showed crusts, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and papillomatosis in epidermis . At higher magnification, many physaliphorous cells, located on the upper-mid-dermis were detected and neither malignancy nor cytological atypia were observed . The histopathology was typical for VV.\n\n【5】The patient was refused to be treated with liquid nitrogen firstly because of pain terror. So we applied topical ftibamzone and penciclovir (well-distributed mixing proportion 1:1, twice daily) instead of glucocorticoids for the lesion. Interestingly, we found that the plaque gradually stopped progressing and then regressed a little within 4 months. A cryotherapy and topical imiquimod therapy was strongly recommended. Finally, the patient received the therapeutic regimen. The skin lesion was totally healed after 2 months treatment.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Verrucae vulgares occur as solitary or multiple, endophytic, or exophytic lesions predominantly seen in children and adolescents. Although the lesions are usually 2 to 10 mm in diameter, they can grow up to a GVV whose size is larger than 1 cm . However, there is few cases of GVV reported in the published work and its pathogenesis is largely unknown. By literature, GVV often occurred among transplanted patients and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients . So some researches revealed that there is close relationship between GVV and immunosuppression . On the other hand, butcher's warts are often larger than common warts. These warts usually occur in people whose occupation is related to handling of meat, poultry, or fish products . In butcher’s warts, HPV 2 was the most frequently isolated type in Jablonska’s study . Lei et al  revealed that the promoter activities of the HPV2 isolates from patients with GVV were remarkably increased compared with the HPV2a prototype. They speculate that increased promoter activities are linked, at least partially, with the clinical phenotypes of the uncommonly GVV.\n\n【8】In our case, the lesion was misdiagnosed with eczema and continuously applied topical fluocinolone acetonide and halometasone for nearly 4 years. Interestingly, discontinuation exposure to topical glucocorticoid was sufficient to stop the progressing of the eruption and regressed slowly within 4 month. In view of such above proofs, we speculate that scratching and prolonged exposure of topical glucocorticoids in the case might contribute the formation of GVV.\n\n【9】There is little information about HPV infection after long-term exposure to glucocorticoid has been reported in the published work. von Krogh et al  discovered that the prevalence of HPV DNA in the biopsies of of genital lichen sclerosus and erosive lichen planus was increased significantly after long term clobetasol therapy. Meanwhile, Bromberg-White et al  showed that the upstream regulatory regions of HPV31 were inducible by dexamethasone in differentiating keratinocytes. Bromberg-White believed that glucocorticoids may play an important role in the differentiation-dependent life cycle of HPV. Another studies also showed that multiple recalcitrant warts during Cushing’s disease had a complete resolution after a 6-month therapeutic trial with anti-cortisolic drug ketoconazole . The author indicated that anti-cortisolic treatment may correct endogenous hypercortisolism and improve immunological status . We believed that the prolonged exposure of topical glucocorticoids might destroyed the local immunology of skin and partly reactivate the HPV and provoke GVV formation at last. A large blind controlled study is necessary to test the hypothesis of association between glucocorticoids and GVV.\n\n【10】In the differential diagnosis of a GVV on the leg, warty tuberculosis (tuberculosis verrucosa cutis), deep mycosis and especially blastomycosis, blastomycosis-like pyoderma, and verrucous carcinoma should be considered. In addition, clinically GVV may mimic many other diseases depending on the localization such as vascular fibroma, even neurotrophic foot ulcer . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case about GVV on the leg mimicking eczema. On the other hand, VV is associated with the development of verrucous carcinoma, or classic warts may show malignant transformation .\n\n【11】In our case, the lesion was isolated, chronic, and circumscribed with inflammatory reaction and unresponsive to glucocorticoids treatments. Therefore, we considered the diagnoses of eczema, warty tuberculosis, deep mycosis and verrucous carcinoma besides GVV. We herein emphasize that skin biopsy from adequately deep and multiple sites to exclude underlying malignancy should be performed on all giant, chronic, isolated, recalcitrant eruption before therapy is initiated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5a888bcc-a2b7-40fb-b4b4-e1242f032257", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Gastric perforation caused by acute gastric dilatation is an extremely uncommon complication. In most cases, acute gastric dilatation is encountered as a postoperative complication after abdominal surgery and in several disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, psychogenic polyphagia, or trauma .\n\n【2】Acute massive gastric dilatation has been described as an extreme distention of the stomach, in which it occupies the abdomen from the diaphragm to the pelvis and from left to right . Acute massive gastric dilatation can cause ischemia, necrosis, and perforation of the stomach. In most cases of acute massive gastric dilatation, surgery has been necessary to prevent or to treat the complications. Early diagnosis with prompt gastric decompression may avoid unnecessary laparotomy.\n\n【3】We present the case of a patient with gastric perforation caused by acute massive gastric dilatation occurring after a bingeeating episode.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year old female patient presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and abdominal fullness after a heavy meal. She reported having a tendency to overeat when she felt emotional stress; however she had no history of consultation for eating disorders. Three days prior to binge-eating, she experienced a stressful event at work. On the day of admission, she had two bowls of steamed rice and 4 - 5 pieces of sweet potato for lunch. After lunch, she abruptly experienced abdominal pain and abdominal fullness. The symptoms were not improved after taking digestive medicines. She had no history of previous abdominal surgery. She had a habit of smoking a quarter of a pack per day for 3 years.\n\n【6】At admission, the patient’s height and weight were 160 cm and 37 kg. Her body mass index was 14.5. Her vital signs were normal with blood pressure at 100/60 mmHg, a pulse rate of 64 beats/min, a respiration rate of 24/min, and a body temperature of 35.5 °C. On physical examination, she had severe abdominal distension with dull percussion and mild abdominal tenderness in the epigastric region. Intestinal sounds were audible, but weak, and with decreased frequency. She had reported intermittent nausea, but without vomiting. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: hemoglobin, 13.1g/dL; hematocrit, 37.8%; white blood cell count, 11,700/uL; platelet count, 233 x 10 <sup>3 </sup> /uL; serum protein, 6.7 g/dL; serum albumin 4.3 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dl; alanine aminotranferase 29 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 15 IU/L; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dl; serum Na, 141 meq/L, serum K, 3.7 meq/L.\n\n【7】Computed tomography revealed massive stomach dilatation. The stomach occupied the whole abdominal cavity from the epigastric region to the pelvis. The second portion of the duodenum was also dilated. There was no intra-abdominal tumor . Intravenous fluid replacement was initiated and a nasogastric tube was inserted without difficulty. Only 100 mL of brownish semisolid material was aspirated. On the day after admission, the patient underwent emergent surgery because of aggravating abdominal pain and abdominal fullness. Her vital signs were stable without fever. On laparotomy, the stomach and the second portion of the duodenum were massively dilated. A small perforation surrounded by necrotic change was identified on the fundus of the stomach. The small bowel loops were not dilated. There was no adhesive band, malrotation or tumor. About 2500 mL of food content in the stomach was extracted manually through gastrotomy on the great curvature of the stomach. The perforation site was treated by wedge resection and primary closure. A duodeno-jejunostomy with the side-to-side anastomosis technique was performed for bypass drainage. The patient’s postoperative recovery was uneventful.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Acute gastric dilatation may occur due to variable etiologies, such as postoperative complication after abdominal surgery, anorexia nervosa and bulimia, psychogenic polyphagia, trauma, electrolyte disturbance, or diabetes mellitus . The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of acute gastric dilatation and its complications are not well known. Due to its frequency as a postoperative complication, anesthesia and debilitation have been identified as predisposing factors. Some previous studies demonstrated that superior mesenteric artery syndrome was an underlying cause of increased intragastric pressure, which is a contributing factor of acute gastric dilatation . Other authors suggest that acute gastric dilatation may be a functional entity secondary to regional disease, such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gallbladder stone, or appendicitis . Otherwise, some cases of acute gastric dilatation were reported in patients with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimic binge . A period of starvation in patients with anorexia nervosa may result in atony and muscular atrophy of the stomach. This may also be a predisposing factor for acute gastric dilatation after bulimic attacks .\n\n【10】Although the rich collateral blood supply of the stomach may protect it from ischemia, increased intragastric pressure that exceeds the gastric venous pressure, may result in ischemia and infarction. The stomach luminal pressure was exceeding 30 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O results in decreased intramural blood flow of the stomach . Additionally, Revilloid demonstrated in 1885 that the stomachs of cadavers had to be distended by at least 4 liters of fluid to result in perforation .\n\n【11】The symptoms of acute gastric dilatation are usually progressive abdominal pain and diffuse abdominal distension . However, pain is sometimes mild in intensity in contrast with the massive distended abdomen. The intensity of abdominal pain may be aggravating after perforation of the stomach. Emesis is also a common symptom of acute gastric dilatation . However, there are reports of patients with acute gastric dilatation who were unable to vomit . It has been suggested that this is caused by the occlusion of the gastroesophageal junction by the distended fundus. In these cases, the patients had intermittent nausea symptoms, but no episodes of vomiting.\n\n【12】For diagnosis of acute gastric dilatation, plain abdominal films may reveal an air-fluid level in a markedly distended stomach without small bowel gas shadows. The most useful diagnostic investigation is an abdominal CT scan that can clearly demonstrate gastric distension . The CT scan may reveal a massively distended stomach reaching the pubic region, displacing organs, and compressing vessels . If perforation is concurrent, pneumoperitoneum may be identified on radiologic investigations.\n\n【13】In some cases of gastric dilatation, recovery may occur with nasogastric decompression without surgery . Partial decompression with nasogastric tube drainage may be helpful for decreasing the intragastric pressure and reducing the risk of necrosis and perforation. After binge-eating, treatment with gastric decompression using a normal sized nasogastric tube is generally unsuccessful . When semisolid material is present in the stomach, even a large tube may be insufficient. If conservative management fails, immediate surgical intervention is mandatory. Surgical options include surgical decompression, bypass duodeno-jejunostomy, partial gastrectomy, total gastrectomy with esophago-jejunostomy, total gastrectomy with cervical esophagostomy and feeding jejunostomy . In the case presented here, superior mesenteric syndrome was suspected as a predisposing factor of acute gastric dilatation. The CT scan showed massive dilatation of both the stomach and the second portion of the duodenum. The cutoff of duodenal dilatation was identified at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. Therefore, surgical decompression with gastrotomy and bypass duodeno-jejunostomy was performed.\n\n【14】Early recognition of gastric infarction is essential for surgical intervention. Gastric necrosis or perforation has been reported as lethal complications of acute gastric dilatation . Progressive abdominal distension, peritonitis, subcutaneous emphysema, and shock may be helpful signs for recognition of gastric necrosis or perforation. In this case, surgical intervention was considered without radiologic investigation for gastric perforation. The patient had suffered progressive abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Emergent laparotomy was performed for surgical gastric decompression and drainage. On laparotomy, perforation on the fundus of the stomach was identified.\n\n【15】Although it is very rare, acute massive gastric dilatation after a binge-eating episode may result in gastric necrosis or perforation, even in patients without a prior history of eating disorder . Careful monitoring for gastric infarction is critical in the management of acute gastric dilatation. When conservative management fails, immediate surgical intervention is mandatory.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "70aa5abc-d42f-4203-8f12-09246a65403d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】There is an increasing incidence of neck of femur (NOF) fractures with increasing age . It was estimated that approximately 100,000 patients will need surgical treatment for a fractured NOF by 2033 in England . NOF fractures confer a high morbidity and mortality, with a decreased functional status post-surgically . Atraumatic NOF fractures can be frequently encountered in clinical practice and can be defined as low-energy mechanism of injury producing a fracture. Causes of atraumatic NOF fractures may include stress, insufficiency, fatigue, atypical and pathological fractures. These causes may cause weakening of the bone or impair bone healing, hence leading to reduced integrity and bone strength . It is difficult to evaluate the exact prevalence of pathological fractures due to studies not including histological screening for all NOF fractures; however, one study found nine out of 311 patients to have a pathological fracture as a result of malignancy. Pathological fractures most commonly result from lymphoma, myeloma or metastatic disease of breast and lung being the commonest, followed by renal and prostate . In this case report, the presence of lymphoma was only confined to the left neck of the femur and right lobe of thyroid. Interestingly, the thyroid function for this patient remained within the normal range.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 65-year-old woman presented to her general practitioner complaining of a 4-week history of left knee pain after which she sustained a fall at the practice and presented to the local accident and emergency (A&E). At the time, she denied any systemic symptoms. The plain radiographs taken in A&E showed no abnormalities, and the patient was discharged home .\n\n【5】Four days later, she re-presented to A&E, having sustained another fall, with left hip pain. On this occasion, the radiograph showed a basic cervical/intertrochanteric fracture of the left hip. The report stated a lucency in the region of the greater trochanter, which was not visible on the initial radiograph; however, this was attributed to be a potential artefact .\n\n【6】Her past medical history included hypertension, depression, foot neuropathy of unknown origin, gastric band surgery and severe diverticulosis. She had no significant family history. On investigation, her vitamin D was found to be low 28 nmol/L and adjusted calcium of 2.51 mmol/L, normal thyroid function. The thyroglobulin was high (47.55 µg/L), while dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was normal.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Her fracture was fixated with an intermedullary nail. Due to a history of multiple presentations with hip pain without any radiological evidence of pathology such as osteoarthritis, the surgeon sent the bone remains for histopathological examination . The bone sample was found to show para-trabecular infiltrate containing sheets of atypical lymphoid cells with frequent fibrosis and apoptosis. The atypical cells were found to be positive for CD45, CD20, and CD79a, with the Ki67 index being raised. Consequently, a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was made.\n\n【9】A subsequent computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT CAP) identified a “4-cm solid nodule in the lower pole of the right lobe of the thyroid with retrosternal extension causing tracheal displacement” . However, her thyroid function was found to be unaffected. An ultrasound scan showed a hypoechoic mass with increased vascularity and a fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid mass was suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The patient underwent a CT of her left upper leg to evaluate the size of the femoral lesion better. The CT did not find any discrete lesion or mass in the femur. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was then conducted to identify any insidious areas of malignancy. This showed an intensely avid solitary right thyroid nodule, measuring at 4 × 3.6 cm, displacing the trachea and a surgically fixed pathological left femoral fracture due to intensely avid proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . The remaining FDG biodistribution and CT appearances were unremarkable.\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】A diagnosis of stage IV DLBCL was made, and the patient was therefore commenced on systemic chemotherapy regime in a clinical trial of R-CHOP with acalabrutinib, and subsequently was found to be in complete remission.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】Patient was seen in hematology and orthopedic clinic 3 - 6 months after discharge, and remained well and no further concern was raised. Unfortunately, after 12 months recurrence of lymphoma in the left hip was noted and patient was referred to specialist center for further treatment.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The B-cell lymphomas result from the malignant proliferation of B cells  and are classified into Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and NHL. NHL constitutes about 80% of all lymphomas. NHL is highly heterogeneous, with one of the commonest subtypes being DLBCL , accounting for approximately a quarter of all NHLs worldwide .\n\n【16】Tumor tissue can affect any organ and system, usually in lymph nodes, and 30-40% of primary DLBCL is mainly in non-lymph nodes organs. Therefore, extra-nodal involvement is prevalent in DLBCL compared to other NHL subtypes . Examples of such extra-nodal involvement can be seen in the gastrointestinal tract, skin and soft tissue, bone, and genitourinary system . Femoral involvement often presents with non-specific symptoms and inconclusive radiographic features which make diagnosis of DLBCL difficult to establish. Patients usually present at a late stage of the disease, with features including bone pain, fractures, swellings, and fevers .\n\n【17】It is important to note that in the majority of cases, bony involvement was associated with widespread disseminated disease. Fifty percent of patients with presumed solitary lesions were found to have disease elsewhere upon further investigation . Reported radiographic features usually included lytic lesions . Thyroid lymphoma is classified into primary lymphomas (PTLs) and secondary thyroid lymphomas (STLs). STL affects lymph nodes and other organs first followed by spread to the thyroid later. The incidence of thyroid involvement in patients with lymphoma is approximately 20%; however, these are very rarely clinically overt . PTLs are uncommon malignancies, accounting for around 5% of all thyroid cancers . DLBCL is the most common type, with more than half of these cases.\n\n【18】Differentiating PTL from STL can be challenging. A review of the literature reveals that PTL tends to occur in older age group, around 60 years old, and almost exclusively originates in setting of pre-existing thyroiditis. On the contrary, STL more commonly affects middle-aged patients, and presents with disseminated disease and with no evidence of thyroiditis . To our knowledge, there has only been one reported case of DLBCL involving both the femur and thyroid which presented with distal femoral fracture, with imaging revealing lytic lesions in the femur and fibula . Siddiqui et al reported that lymphomas presenting primarily at the proximal femur and proximal humerus are unusual . The pathological association between thyroid, femur bone, cancer and lymphoma is very interesting. For instance, DLBCL of the mandibular bone was incidentally found to be associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma in a case report . Suwardjo et al reported the presence of papillary thyroid cancer with NOF fracture . Evans et al reported a case of primary thyroid lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration at presentation .\n\n【19】Such observations may raise many future research questions. 1) How the thyroid gland communicate with neck of the femur during normal physiological conditions; 2) How such communication will change between the two organs in presence of cancer or lymphoma; 3) If these two hypotheses were true, the role of thyroid in bone metabolism may be beyond our current understanding; 4) Interestingly, in our case report, the NOF fracture was in the left while the lymphoma was in the right lobe of the thyroid (it is tempting to describe, is this similar to the control exerted by the right side of the brain in the left side of the body, obviously further research is needed). The lymphoma may have different clinical presentations. For instance, De Vitis et al reported unique case report of a primary B-cell lymphoma causing a pure sensory peripheral neuropathy of the upper limb, that responded to radiotherapy treatment .\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Our case is unique, as the patient presented with hip pain twice to the hospital, lymphoma in both the femur and thyroid and no clinical features of lymphoma. The case also illustrates the importance of the collaboration between ortho geriatrician, orthopedic surgeons and hematologists in making the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】NOF fracture following low-energy trauma warrants the need to exclude pathological fracture. Lymphoma of the bone can be confined to the bone or affect other organs as well. The presence of lymphoma of the NOF and one lobe of the thyroid is extremely rare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9ad60bc5-1f98-4864-b332-6537dace6be2", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Many conditions can radiologically mimic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These include infectious etiologies such as viral pneumonias, atypical pneumonias such as legionella and mycoplasma pneumonia. Of the most common non-infectious mimics is interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and scleroderma . These patients not only share the same chest computed tomography (CT) changes with COVID-19 but also share the clinical presentation such as dyspnea, flue-like symptoms, fatigue and aches and pains .\n\n【2】Antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. The syndrome is considered a sub-group of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) . The hallmark of the disorder is the presence of autoantibodies against the aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase, also known as antisynthetase antibodies, or anti-ARS . Patients with this syndrome have a characteristic clinical picture consisting of fever, exanthema on the hands (also referred to as mechanic’s hands), myositis, and/or ILD, and/or articular involvement. Raynaud’s phenomenon is frequently observed. The severity and type of pulmonary involvement determines the prognosis of the disease .\n\n【3】Anti-Jo-1 was the first anti-ARS discovered. However, many other antibodies have recently been discovered. Most of the literature on ASS is based on the presence of anti-Jo-1 antibodies, which is the strongest predictor of this syndrome , nearly found in 70% of patients. Other less common variants of anti-ARS antibodies include: anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12, anti-OJ, anti-EJ, anti-KS, anti-ZO, and anti-tyrosyl antibodies .\n\n【4】We discuss a patient who presented with COVID-like symptoms, treated as COVID-19, later proven to have ASS.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 32-year-old male presented with a 4-week history of exertional shortness of breath and dry cough. There was no chest pain, hemoptysis, edema, or weight loss. His symptoms were accompanied by intermittent fever, malaise, arthralgia, and generalized aches and pains. He is non-smoker, on no medications, has no pets at home and no occupational dust exposure. On examination, he was apyrexial, hemodynamically stable, with a respiratory rate of 18/min and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 L of O <sub>2 </sub> . There was no clubbing or evidence of Raynaud’s phenomenon, or jaundice. Cardiac examination was normal. Chest examination revealed bibasal fine inspiratory crackles. No muscle tenderness was noted.\n\n【8】Full blood count (FBC) was normal. Urea and electrolytes were normal. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 128 mg/L (0 - 5 mg/L). Liver function test (LFT) was deranged with high alanine transaminase (ALT) at 315 U/L (0 - 41 U/L). Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was 165 U/L (10 - 71 U/L) with normal values of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Troponin was high at 64 ng/L (0 - 15 ng/L). D-dimer was positive. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) on three consecutive occasions. Throat swab was negative for influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using PCR. Urinary legionella and pneumococcal antigens were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal as well as cardiac echo. Chest X-ray  showed patchy air space shadowing in both lungs, prominently in mid and lower zones. Appearances are likely due to infection/COVID-19. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  showed no pulmonary embolism but multiple ground glass lesions covering more than 50% of the alveolar surface, concerning for pulmonary infection including moderate form of COVID pneumonitis.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Despite the negative coronavirus PCR tests, he was presumed to have COVID-19, based on his symptoms and chest CT findings. Eventually, after more investigations including autoimmune screen, he was diagnosed with ASS.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】He received dexamethasone, intravenous antibiotics and O <sub>2 </sub> therapy. He improved, weaned off O <sub>2 </sub> and discharged home with a plan for a repeat chest CT and a follow-up with the respiratory team.\n\n【13】Follow-up\n\n【14】Two months following his discharge, he was seen in the chest clinic. He was completely asymptomatic with unlimited exercise tolerance and normal O <sub>2 </sub> saturation. A high-resolution chest CT showed significant improvement in the ground glass appearance compared to the previous study .\n\n【15】Two months following his visit to the respiratory clinic, he presented to same day emergency care (SDEC) with 2 weeks history of on and off palpitation, chest pain and fatigue. There was no shortness of breath or hemoptysis. Clinical examination was unremarkable in particular no pleural or pericardial rub. D-dimer was positive. Troponin was high at 850 ng/L (0 - 15 ng/L) and ECG was normal. CTPA showed no PE with diffuse patchy lung infiltrates, predominantly in both lung bases, with some variation from previous imaging . Echo was completely normal. In view of the high troponin and normal echo and CTPA, serum creatine kinase (CK) was checked and found to be significantly high at 6,744 U/L (40 - 320 U/L). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also high at 1,482 U/L (135 - 225 U/L). Rheumatology opinion was sought, and muscle weakness was clinically confirmed, therefore further investigations were made. Electromyography (EMG) was found to be abnormal with occasional denervation and myopathic features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the femur  was highly suspicious of acute polymyositis. JO-1, La (SS-B), RO (SS-A) and ENA autoantibodies were positive and a diagnosis of polymyositis JO-1 positive was made. His lung function test showed a restrictive pattern with mildly reduced carbon monoxide uptake (TLCO).\n\n【16】The patient was given a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone and discharged on a reducing dose of oral prednisolone and a gradual increase dose of methotrexate, with regular follow-up in both respiratory and rheumatology teams.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Our case highlights the importance of awareness of other conditions that imitate COVID-19 both clinically and radiologically. A degree of scepticism for the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be maintained in RT-PCR negative testing.\n\n【19】The cardinal features of ASS are a triad of ILD, arthritis and myositis. Beside the typical triad, other features may be present, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, unexplained fever and hyperkeratotic fissured plaques on hands and feet, called mechanic’s hands and hiker’s feet respectively. These other symptoms occur in only 40% of patients . The main difficulty in diagnosing this syndrome is not only its rarity but also the fact that only 20% of the patients present with the full triad. In this case, our patient presented mainly with the ILD form, which shares the same radiological changes with COVID-19, a reason why COVID-19 was strongly suspected even though the patient had three negative RT-PCR results. He complained of fatigue, which is a muscle symptom, that can be caused by myositis and hence lead to checking the muscle enzymes, such as CK. It seems that fatigue, in this case, was also attributed to COVID-19. This is not unusual as fatigue, myalgia and muscle weakness are common in viral pathologies, not only with coronavirus . Muscles enzymes are also reported to be high in 33-46% of COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases . The degree of muscle inflammation is dependent on the duration of illness and that the skeletal muscles are more frequently affected than the cardiac muscles. The viral load was also found to be low in the affected muscles, which makes the muscle inflammation is most likely due to circulating RNA, rather than direct infection of the muscle cells. This suggests that myopathy in COVID-19 is most likely post infectious, immune-mediated myopathy .\n\n【20】In our patient, the possibility of inflammatory myositis was not entertained, due to lack of any specific features and failure of checking serum muscles enzymes. It is only during the patient’s second visit to hospital, presenting with chest pain and sob of breath, a possibility of a different diagnosis has started to emerge. The high troponin in the second visit, in the absence of cardiac sounding chest pain, negative CTPA for pulmonary embolism and normal echo, ruling out myocarditis, have led to the exploration of the skeletal muscles as a source for the troponin. This was confirmed by typical history of proximal myopathy and high serum CK. Following this, the patient had all the necessary workup to make the diagnosis of ASS.\n\n【21】Many factors have interacted together resulting in the delay of the diagnosis of ASS. The first factor was the similarity of presentation with COVID-19 (fever, aches and pains, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath). The other factor is the similarity of the chest CT findings in both conditions. The absence of the myopathic and other ASS symptoms at the initial presentation did not alert the treating team to consider other diagnoses. ASS itself is rare and uncommon, and it is not surprising that such a diagnosis be missed even at normal times. During times of COVID-19 pandemic, the mindset and cognitive biases are more towards COVID. The dangers and implications of the false-negative RT-PCR have also led to multiple testing, which could also have resulted in the delayed diagnosis and management of other conditions that mimic COVID-19 .\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】ASS is a rare medical syndrome and one of the COVID-19 mimics that can be easily missed if not specifically looked for.\n\n【24】Learning points\n\n【25】Several potentially fatal diseases remain masked among the wave of COVID-19 mimics. It is imperative that a thorough differential diagnostic panel be considered prior to consideration of a COVID-19 diagnosis. The implications of delayed or missed diagnosis might result in serious complications and poor quality of life, that could have been avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy noted two channels in the gastric antrum, in which one of them is true pylorus and the other one is fistulae tract. The scope was able to enter the duodenum through the pylorus but not from the fistulae tract. There was no evidence of active peptic ulcer disease, however an ulcer scar was observed between pylorus and adjacent channel .

{"seq_id": "0cb8d6f3-f514-4d0a-bd4a-05bf5388d2e9", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 patients annually, which is the highest prevalence of the porphyrias. Porphyria is a collection of disorders resulting from a breakdown in heme synthesis. The most common form is acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), and the other disorders are less common and therefore more difficult to diagnose. AIP occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 patients annually. Clinically, porphyria is classified as acute, with associated neurovisceral symptoms as in δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ADP) and AIP, or cutaneous, by its effects with sun-exposed skin. AIP can have cutaneous pathology late in the disease. The cutaneous category is further broken down to either chronic blistering, as in congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), or acute/non-blistering, which includes erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP). Further still, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP) have both neurovisceral (i.e. abdominal pain, psychological and neurological disturbance) and cutaneous presentations .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The 39-year-old white male patient in this report presented to a US Navy primary care physician with abdominal pain, neuropathy and psychological manifestations. His medical and social history was unremarkable, except for the fact that symptoms began approximately 9 years prior. Intermittently, he suffered from diarrhea up to five times per day, and it had become increasingly bothersome, with bloating and severe abdominal cramps that often resolved with each episode. Early in his medical history, he was given a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and was treated symptomatically. Specialties that consulted this case included hematology, genetics, neurology and dermatology.\n\n【4】His symptoms complicated when he presented with dizziness, nystagmus and tinnitus. He had a normal MRI of the brain and a normal audiogram, but was noted to have intermittent oscillopsia, new-onset headaches, and was diagnosed with bilateral vestibular dysfunction.\n\n【5】There was a marked photosensitivity and with UV exposure, blistering occurred on the patient’s scalp, arms and chest. This patient typically presented with tingling on his scalp after yard work or sun exposure, which progressed to pustules and blisters shortly thereafter. This was thought to have been polymorphous light eruptions (PMLE), but it is highly unusual for eruptions to develop after each instance of UV exposure.\n\n【6】Neurologically, there is no history of seizure disorder or hallucinations. He had received a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) several years prior and experienced steadily increasing difficulty with mental focus in recent years. He also suffers from frequent insomnia. Psychologically, there is no history of depression or other mood disorder. The patient has become more forgetful than usual. A neurological evaluation yielded a glottic, valsalva-induced dizziness and vertigo. Nystagmus was a key clinical discovery. Porphyria was suspected after many years of consultation and treatment-related ailments and with no positive outcome.\n\n【7】Clinical diagnosis\n\n【8】Because of abdominal pain, diarrhea, tachycardia, mild hypertension and psychological problems, an initial diagnosis of AIP was considered just over a year ago; however, AIP does not address cutaneous effects. In the preceding 2 years, red blood cell (RBC) assay for porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) level and δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was initially negative, most likely because he was tested when asymptomatic . Other signs, such as the extensive blistering of the skin following UV exposure, nystagmus and vestibular dysfunction exhibited by this patient, were not consistent with AIP. Clinical presentation of neurocutaneous signs and symptoms led the authors to a suspicion that either dual porphyria or HCP was the complete diagnosis.\n\n【9】Cutaneous porphyrias often involve edema, redness and blistering of the skin , especially with UV exposure. The neurocutaneous porphyrias , VP and HCP, were candidates for additional diagnosis because they captured the remaining elements of the patient’s ailment, namely, vestibular dysfunction. Such autonomic neuropathies are common with neurological forms of porphyria .\n\n【10】Blood testing\n\n【11】Tests of the patient’s whole blood, which sought uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were inconclusive. When referred to specialty care, this patient’s blood was tested when asymptomatic. The timeliness of blood and plasma testing for porphyria (i.e. when symptoms are present) is important to emphasize . Blood tests for ALA and PBG and its precursors will be repeated when the patient is symptomatic.\n\n【12】Stool/urine tests\n\n【13】A test for fecal protoporphyrins and coproporphyrins was completed with no significant result, but this was most likely a result of testing an asymptomatic patient. Following diagnostic criteria , in one urine test, heptacarboxylate, pentacarboxyl, coproporphyrin I/III and uroporphyrin were all elevated from normal values. ALA and PBG have been tested with no appreciable increase during either acute or latent phases.\n\n【14】It is essential to analyze urine for porphyrin, its precursors, ALA and PBG . Values can be elevated between and during acute attacks, and up to 10% of people can have normal levels regardless . Of note, the patient’s urine porphyrins were elevated in the summer months, during his photosensitive outbreaks, but were negative later in the cooler months of the year.\n\n【15】Biopsy\n\n【16】A vertex and posterior scalp punch biopsy that was taken from a photosensitive lesion following ultraviolet exposure showed marked superficial and deep inflammation with subdermal blistering. These findings are consistent with neurocutaneous porphyria, especially considering the photoactive nature of porphyrin in the skin .\n\n【17】Genetic screening\n\n【18】Porphyria research in the 1980s and 1990s largely pointed to enzymatic analysis for diagnostic confirmation of porphyria . Recent literature suggests that porphyria diagnoses in a clinical setting should be confirmed via genetic study . A gene panel was completed via array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with specific detection for ALAS2, CPOX, FECH, HMBS, PPOX and UROD, the results of which were negative for deletion and duplication.\n\n【19】Family/social history\n\n【20】The patient has a significant travel history as part of a long military career. There is no significant family history of dermatological conditions or metabolic diseases. He is married, has never smoked, does not abuse alcohol and has no history of illicit drug use. The patient is of approximately 60% British ancestry, with no other family members affected by any form of porphyria.\n\n【21】Treatment and prognosis\n\n【22】Currently, the patient has not been diagnosed with any one unifying ailment. Instead he is being treated separately for ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and vertigo, with little improvement in symptoms. His current medications are adderall, maxzide, imitrex and trazodone. He continues to have numbness in his mouth, visual disturbances/vertigo, headaches/migraines, vesicular lesions of the scalp in the summer months, gastrointestinal distress and increasing memory loss. He was a highly productive military service member who can no longer work or drive a vehicle. This degradation occurred in a matter of 2 years’ time.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】The purpose of this case report is to make clinicians aware of the possibility of a rare presentation of porphyria. Early identification means early treatment, with an abrupt end to disorder progression. The goal of this report is to highlight a recent clinical finding of a unique disorder with an initially challenging cutaneous and vestibular finding.\n\n【25】It is necessary that tests for porphyria are sought while a patient is symptomatic or under acute attack. This patient’s case could have been managed more effectively if other possible diagnoses had been more carefully evaluated. It is important to keep a wide differential when cases present in an unusual manner.\n\n【26】The authors wish to emphasize the increasing importance of a team approach and multiple disciplinary focus in modern medicine. The initial diagnosis and treatment of porphyria can be primary care/general practice-centric, and inter-departmental communication with all specialties involved is essential to the best patient outcome, as others have asserted .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The prevalence of obesity in Europe is estimated to be 23% in women and 20% in men. Currently, there is no evidence that the prevalence of obesity is slowing down. For instance, by 2025 in UK, it is expected that 47% of men and 36% of women will be obese . Several studies suggested that obesity is associated with decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and increase in risk of bone fragility. In a study conducted by Fracture Liaison Service in Cambridge (UK) that involved 1,005 postmenopausal women < 75 years of age presenting with a low trauma fracture, obesity was shown to be associated with significant risk of hip fractures, while the risk of fractures of the wrist was significantly less common . Furthermore, a study from the Nottingham Fracture Liaison Service reported that obese subjects were more likely to fracture their ankle and upper arm, but were less likely to fracture their wrist . The Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW) showed that obesity is not protective against fracture in postmenopausal women and is associated with increased risk of ankle and upper leg fractures . Obesity may also influence bone integrity through its impact on vitamin D and testosterone level. Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with low vitamin D and low plasma testosterone levels . One serious consequence of obesity is development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, there is emerging evidence that diabetes has an impact on bone metabolism.\n\n【2】The Rotterdam Study showed that individuals with diabetes had an increased fracture risk, probably due to long-term complications associated with diabetes mellitus . Importantly, in a meta-analysis by Vestergaard, it was shown that hip fracture risk increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas BMD increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus and decreased in type 1 diabetes mellitus . Poor diabetes control is also associated with high risk of bone fracture. For instance, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study showed that type 2 diabetes was significantly and independently associated with increased risk of fracture especially those treated with insulin or those with HbA1c ≥ 8% (64 mmol/L) as compared to those individuals with HbA1c below 8% . Furthermore, the Rotterdam Study data showed that poor glycemic control based on an HbA1c cut-off of 7.5% (58 mmol/L) in type 2 diabetes was associated with higher all types of fracture risk .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report a case of a 42-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 10 years ago) and body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> who was admitted with fracture of right head of the femur after small fall from stepladder. Imaging of the pelvis in the form of an X-ray showed multi-fragmented fracture through trochanteric region of the right femur . His investigations during the time of admission to our hospital showed normal renal, liver and thyroid function. His chest X-ray showed clear lung field and normal heart size. His ECG showed he was in sinus rhythm. Furthermore, his diabetes control was poor with an average HbA1c of 11% and he was also known to have background diabetic retinopathy. He suffered from erectile dysfunction for around 4 years but he did not seek medical help and this was revealed during his consultation with endocrinologist during the treatment for his fracture. His family history showed the presence of diabetes and hypertension without evidence of family history of osteoporosis. He was treated with metformin 2,000 mg per day, gliclazide 320 mg per day and sitagliptin 100 mg per day. He was switched to insulin therapy and advised to continue with metformin therapy as well. His fracture was fixed with an intramedullary device . However, subsequent tests revealed low testosterone (4.2 nmol/L and reference range 10 - 35 nmol/L) and low vitamin D (13.2 nmol/L and reference range > 50). During his hospital stay, he was commenced in vitamin D replacement. His bone densitometry scan showed no evidence of osteoporosis. After successful treatment of his fracture, he was given physiotherapy and then discharged. He was referred to the diabetes and endocrinology outpatients for optimization of his diabetes control and treatment of hypogonadism.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Our case report showed that the presence of obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, low vitamin D and hypogonadism is associated with increased risk of bone fracture. Importantly, this can increase risk of fracture in young individuals. Interestingly, the bone density scan was normal. Cross-sectional epidemiological studies have found that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a higher incidence of fragility fractures despite normal or elevated BMD . This is likely to be explained by the fact that type 2 diabetes induces deterioration of bone microarchitecture leading to a porous skeleton susceptible to fracture. Furthermore, it was shown that cortical porosity is specific to those with type 2 diabetes patients that have a fracture . In addition, conventional diagnostics such as DXA measurements and the current fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) risk prediction algorithm for estimating risk of osteoporotic fractures are not sufficient in individuals with diabetes .\n\n【7】In view of the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity, it is possible to predict that obesity-induced fracture will increase the burden in orthopedic department. It is very difficult to predict how this epidemic will affect the orthopedic service, in particular in the absence of robust screening method and also the absence of diagnostic tools for osteoporosis in individuals with diabetes. Another problem in the horizon, detection of such individuals at young age is vital, as he is likely to need hip replacement twice assuming that he lives up to 85 years old. Therefore, our case report illustrates the needs for close collaboration between orthopedic surgeons, general practioners and endocrinologists not only in treatment of obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, fracture and hypogonadism but also the need to establish robust methods for screening and risk stratifications.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】In individuals with diabetes, obesity, low vitamin D and low testosterone, the risk of fracture is difficult to be estimated especially in young individuals. Such unfortunate individuals can present with complications such as fracture of the neck of the femur. Therefore, aggressive treatments of risk factors are necessary in all patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The prevalence of congenital disease in different countries varies, but is usually between 0.15 to 2.0% . The fetus and the newborn can be infected by the virus by placental transmission through blood and cervical secretions or breast milk, and the risk of fetal infection primary, higher than in maternal reinfection. CMV infections acquired during birth or through breast milk, which has no effect on future neurological development in infants at term . However, premature infants less than 32 weeks gestational age, and may have symptoms similar to sepsis.\n\n【2】Fetal infection can be diagnosed by serology, amniotic fluid research, using viral culture and the identification of CMV-DNA analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using blood or urine.\n\n【3】The test-CMV IgG avidity is also a useful tool as a confirmatory method, dating the time of primary infection by CMV. Namely, IgM maternal not be transferred through the placenta, whereas IgG antibodies in the infant are mostly transferred maternal antibodies. The demonstration of serum IgM in the newborn before 2 and 3 weeks of age, is indicative of congenital infection. However, only 70% of neonates with congenital CMV have IgM antibodies at birth .\n\n【4】The avidity test is a measure of antibody binding CMV-IgG. Early in infection the binding capacity is low, but over time, it increases. The investigation of maternal IgG avidity informs when the infection may have occurred. A high viral load in the amniotic fluid correlates with the fetal damage .\n\n【5】CMV is transmitted by direct contact between people through contact with urine, saliva, semen, cervical secretions and breast milk .\n\n【6】The congenital CMV infection in children can result in a number of deficiencies, alone or in combination, such as mental retardation, autism, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, deafness or hearing impairment, visual impairment or blindness. Hearing loss can be late onset, during the first six years of life in children with both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in the neonatal period .\n\n【7】Studies evaluating the treatment pre-and postnatal congenital CMV infection have shown encouraging clinical results for administration of ganciclovir . In several case reports, both intravenously and by mouth, valganciclovir has been shown safe and effective for use in mothers with fetuses infected in the early stages of pregnancy without teratogenicity . However, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir in prenatal therapy should be further evaluated by means of clinical trials. A randomized controlled trial with ganciclovir showed that six weeks of intravenous treatment of ganciclovir 12 mg/kg/day beginning soon after birth in infants infected with CMV, with CNS involvement can preserved hearing .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】Child born at 28 weeks and 6 days , with birth weight of 1,080 grams, Apgar scores of 5 and 8 at one and five minutes respectively, regular prenatal consultations with 5, all negative serology, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) > 40 hours, and a mother with a history of urinary tract infection in the last trimester of pregnancy and no regular treatment. Child was endotracheal intubation shortly after birth and maintained on mechanical ventilation throughout evolution to date November 23, 2012, when it was referred to a case. Three blood cultures were negative and that was evidenced Stahylococcus epidermidis, with 16 days of life. For evaluation, 12 blood samples to perform complete blood counts, and 10 of them showed leukocytosis ranging from 12,100 to 43,560/mm <sup>3 </sup> and most with bastonetose.\n\n【10】Of the 12 CBCs, 4 had thrombocytopenia smaller than 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and 4 with platelets less than 142,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and above 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . The child presented with six treatment regimens and different antibiotics without clinical improvement. In the evolution of the child she developed cholestasis, jaundice becoming well and the levels of total and direct bilirubin were respectively: Day 08/11/2012: 15.58 mg% and 12.36 mg%. Day 9/11/2012 despite negative serology for cytomegalovirus, was conducted PCR (polymerase chain reaction) of urine specimen which was identified genomic sequences of CMV (cytomegalovirus). From the result of the PCR was started treatment with ganciclovir at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg/day on 12/11/2012, due to clinical severity. After this period the patient began to exhibit improved clinical response with reduction of ventilatory parameters and decreased jaundice: BT: 9.88 mg% and BD: 8.04 mg%. An echocardiogram confirmed and patent ductus arteriosus 2.8 mm, but there was no response to clinical measures.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The spectrum of diseases causing neonatal cholestasis becomes intriguing problems in investigations. There are many causes, and the end result is the specific problem peculiar characteristics. For example, extrahepatic biliary atresia may be the result of viral infection leading to progressive obstruction, of the extrahepatic bile ducts with some degree of injury of the intrahepatic bile duct. This same sequence of injury with persistent viral infection may be responsible for sporadic (non-familial) as cases of neonatal hepatitis .\n\n【13】It is difficult to determine the frequency of cholestatic jaundice, ranging between 1:2500 and 1:5000 newborns. Intrahepatic cholestasis neonatal represents 2/3 of cases of neonate cholestasis . The most common causes of the disease are infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the situation of a newborn patient with cholestasis, one should think of CMV.\n\n【14】The specific treatment for cytomegalovirus is ganciclovir, which is a synthetic nucleoside analogue 2'-Deoxyguanine that inhibits replication of herpes viruses both in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that patients with cholestatic hepatitis have improved levels of direct bilirubin, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) using drug. In addition to this, another drug used to treat immune compromised has shown good results, foscarnet, which reduces viral replication by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase enzyme .\n\n【15】Children treated with ganciclovir may develop neutropenia, but in three laboratory assessments during the use of ganciclovir child in this study, none of the blood counts was observed neutropenia, so during this treatment is also important to monitor leukocyte counts and absolute neutrophil. These changes are drug-dependent and often no need for discontinuation of medication . Ganciclovir may also cause nephrotoxicity and liver enzyme abnormalities, tremors, changes at the infusion site (phlebitis), nausea, vomiting, rash and fever .\n\n【16】However, cost-effective, use of ganciclovir can prevent hearing loss, and developmental changes and improvements in pictures of cholestatic hepatitis. The usual dose of 10mg/kg/day of ganciclovir is divided into two doses administered intravenously over 2 to 4 weeks for 60 minutes  according to the severity of the disease. Currently researchers suggest shorter treatment time in remission EV with ganciclovir for 21 days, followed by valganciclovir oral dose of 15 to 18mg/Kg single daily dose (USA) twice daily for 21 days, indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of CMV retinitis in immune compromised patients .\n\n【17】Place of the Study\n\n【18】Neonatal intensive care unit of University Hospital of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande-MS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In early life it has a glandular structure which reaches its greatest development at about the seventh year. After puberty, the glandular tissue gradually disappears and is replaced by connective tissue .\n\n【2】Large pineal tumors are rare  and because of their midline location usually compress the cerebrospinal fluid circulatory channels leading to hydrocephalus or displace adjacent neurological pathways causing bilateral symptomatology.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】An 18-year-old female developed headaches, vision problems, walking difficulty, and drowsiness. MRI of the brain showed a large pineal mass tumor . The patient, because of hydrocephalus, underwent ventriculostomy. At the time of ventriculostomy, biopsy of the mass could not be performed. The patient was taken back to the operation room and a stereotactic brain biopsy was obtained. Pathology showed a fibrous meningioma, WHO grade one. Embolization of the tumor was performed prior to proceeding with craniotomy for tumor resection. After treatment, her vision did not significantly improve except for some peripheral vision.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Pineal tumors can be divided mainly in germinomas and other tumors.

{"seq_id": "ac0cb7be-e95a-44df-9672-7cf54c01414f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Gemellae are catalase-negative and anaerobic to aerotolerant Gram positive cocci and may be found as part of the normal oropharyngeal microflora in humans. There are four species of Gemellae : Gemella haemolysans , Gemella morbillorum , Gemella sanguinis and Gemella bergeriae . These bacteria have little growth in blood agar and need 48 hours to be visible. Colonies are small and grayish and they may exhibit alpha-hemolysis on blood agar thus leading to initial presumptive identification as a Streptococcus viridans . A positive L-pyrrolidonyl-, B-naphthylamide hydrolysis test can rapidly distinguish the isolate from a Streptococcus viridans . Other microbiological characteristics include susceptibility to vancomycin and negative reactions to oxidase and catalase.\n\n【2】In the last years, Gemellae emerged as a cause of sporadic severe infections such as endocarditis, liver abscess, meningitis, cerebral abscess, mediastinitis, and pericarditis . In few cases these infections were associated with onco-hematologic diseases such as osteosarcoma, oral Burkitt's lymphoma or intestinal adenocarcinoma and Gemellae ’s bacteremia have been suggested as a marker of suspicion of intestinal malignancy . To our knowledge, 5 reports of septic shock caused by Gemella spp. have been published so far: 2 cases in Italian adults with AIDS , 2 cases in immunocompromised pediatric patients  and one case in an immunocompetent American adult patient with a retro-pharyngeal abscess .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 41-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department in a state of coma (Glasgow Coma Scale 5) with no neck stiffness, severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure 70 mmHg), high grade fever (39.5 °C), anuria, leukocytosis with neutrophilia (total white blood cells: 13100/µL), high C-reactive protein (22.1 mg/dl) and procalcitonin (147.64 ng/ml). The patient had undergone a recent etoposide-based salvage chemotherapy for a progressive undifferentiated neuroendocrine rhino-pharyngeal cancer, with local invasion (left para-pharyngeal space, peri and sub-mastoideal space, maxillary sinuses, clivus) and laterocervical and mediastinal lymph node involvement as well as pulmonary and hepatic metastasis. His cancer was first diagnosed in 2002 and relapsed in March 2010.\n\n【5】Chest radiography was negative and, due to the suspicion of a central nervous system infection, a lumbar puncture was performed. The analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed normal values for white blood cells, glycorrachia and proteinorrachia and the direct Gram stain and culture were negative. The patient was hospitalized in the infectious diseases unit where a nutritional and supportive therapy was started via central venous catheter (inserted 30 days before), together with oxygen therapy via a reservoir mask and an empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g tris in die) and vancomycin (1 g loading dose followed by 2 g as a 24 h continuous infusion). A purulent-like liquid flowed from his mouth and was collected and sent, together with urine and blood cultures, to the microbiology laboratory. Blood cultures were performed using the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux®, Marcy l’Etoile, France).\n\n【6】Despite initial improvement of blood pressure and diuresis, after 24 hours an acute respiratory failure occurred and respiratory assistance in C-PAP ventilation was initiated, with no substantial results. Meanwhile the microbiology laboratory informed us that 3 blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in the anaerobic bottles. The urine culture was negative while the oral pus culture was positive for alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Oxacillixin sensitive S. aureus and Candida albicans : no change was made to the antibiotic therapy. The patient died 48 hours after admission due to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. No autopsy examination was performed.\n\n【7】The strain grown from the positive anaerobic bottle was identified as Gemella spp. using the ATB ID32A identification system (bioMerieux®, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Unfortunately the Vitek GP card was not tested due to the patient's exitus.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This is a case of septic shock due to Gemella spp . due to a probable retropharyngeal cancer-abscess. An organism reported as an alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was isolated from a pharyngeal swab and was, at first, considered to represent normal upper respiratory tract bacteria, which, in our centre, are not routinely identified further not excluding that the strain was not the same Gemella isolated in blood cultures. Nevertheless, the systemic infection did occur in conjunction with an oral infection as shown by the purulent fluid observed in the mouth and the previously reported severe oral mucositis. Unfortunately a CT-scan of the head and neck could not be performed due to the patient’s poor condition and the hypotesis of a cancer-abscess of the rhino-pharyngeal region could not be proved. As 2 of the 3 positive blood cultures were obtained from the central venous catheter puncture a concomitant infection of the central venous line could also be hypothesized. There was no biochemical and cultural evidence of bacterial invasion of the subarachnoid space, therefore the neurological manifestations could be consistent with toxic encephalopathy, indeed.\n\n【10】Vancomycin should have guaranteed in vitro activity as no resistance to glycopeptides has been reported so far  and the exitus depended on the severe multi-organ failure already ongoing at admission.\n\n【11】As implementing standard oral care with an antibiotic paste was found to be effective in reducing alpha hemolytic streptococcal sepsis in immunocompromised children  we suggest that this standard of care could be useful in immunocompromised adults and that this bacteria may be considered as an opportunistic pathogen and more attention should be paid to prevent his spread in high risk patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b6fcf706-2529-4eb4-9f7d-558950cbe480", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Glycine, widely used as an irrigation fluid for transurethral procedures and endometrial procedures, has been shown to be a safe irrigant. However, adverse reactions from irrigant absorption occur with some frequency . The most frequent adverse event, irrigation absorption syndrome, is characterized by hyponatremia, confusion, lethargy, coma, headache and visual disturbances . Hyperammonemia is a known sequelae of glycine toxicity. Glycine toxicity usually occurs from absorption of the irrigation fluid during procedures. Massive absorption of irrigation fluid through a bladder rupture is infrequent. We report a case of profound hyperammonemia occurring from complications of a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor in a female. During the procedure the bladder was ruptured with massive absorption of glycine irrigation solution and resulting severe hyperammonemia. No published documents report such high serum ammonia levels.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 76-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) with a one week history of gross hematuria and pelvic pain. Three weeks prior to admission she was treated for a UTI with moxifloxacin. An abdominal CT showed a bladder mass and a right hydronephrosis consistent with invasive bladder cancer.\n\n【4】Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her only medication was irbesartan. She had no prior surgeries. Physical examination revealed a supple neck without jugular venous distension. Her lungs were clear. Her cardiovascular exam was normal with no murmur. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended. Her liver and spleen were normal. There was no costovertebral tenderness. There was no urethral prolapse. There was no adenexal tenderness and no cervical motion tenderness on pelvic examination. Her pre-operative laboratory values were sodium, 138 mmol/L, potassium, 4.0 mmol/L, bicarbonate, of 23 mmol/L, glucose, 120 mg/dL, BUN, 16 mmol/L, creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria, leukoesterase and nitrites.\n\n【5】During her operative procedure the patient was found to have an invasive bladder tumor, which was resected using a resectoscope under direct observation. There was no obvious bladder perforation. Indigo carmine was given to evaluate the ureteral orifices. The right ureter was never seen. The left ureter was clearly seen. All the bladder chips were removed using the Ellik evacuator and hemostasis was meticulously controlled. During the procedure she received 24 liters of 1.5% glycine irrigation fluid. After the procedure the patient was found to have a distended lower abdomen. A retrograde cystogram confirmed that a rupture of the bladder occurred with extravasation of large amounts of fluid, thought to be glycine irrigation fluid, into the peritoneal cavity.\n\n【6】While in the recovery room the intubated patient was following simple commands. Her initial post-operative serum sodium level was 120 mmol/L. The patient was placed on intravenous normal saline at 50 mL/hr and continuous bladder irrigation with 0.9% normal saline. One hour later her serum sodium was 114 mmol/L. 200 ml of 3% hypertonic saline was administered over 8 hours. Intravenous gentamycin was also administered.\n\n【7】An abdominal CT scan revealed significant amounts of fluid in the abdomen, pelvis, and a moderate sized collection in the prevesicular space extending over the dome of the bladder. CT guided percutaneous drainage of the fluid collection with an 18 French J-Thal catheter was performed, 2.5 L of clear fluid was collected from this catheter. Repeat CT scan showed significant decrease in the fluid collections. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and care. Twenty hours after the procedure the patient had an episode of tonic-clonic muscular activity. She was treated successfully with phenytoin and midazolam.\n\n【8】The patient’s serum sodium and ammonia levels are listed in Table 1 . The sodium decreased to a low of 109 mmol/L and the ammonia level peaked at 1,592 µmol/L. The patient underwent hemodialysis on post-operative day one. Three days after the procedure the patient was extubated and at her baseline mental status. Her ammonia levels returned to normal by day two. She was discharged from the hospital without neurological sequelae.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Transurethral surgeries have been performed since the 1930s to resect prostate tissue and bladder tissue. The procedure involves a rectoscope that contains a wire loop electrode and is inserted through the urethra. The electrocautery loop can resect tissue and coagulate bleeding via coagulation current. To visualize the tissue being resected an irrigation fluid is used that is electrically inert and provides a clear field. Initially, distilled water was utilized. However, this was associated with intravascular hemolysis and water intoxication . To avoid hemolysis, solutions of mannitol, sorbitol, or glycine were used.\n\n【11】Use of mannitol is associated with hyponatremia. Sorbitol usage has been associated with cerebral edema . Glycine has a lower risk for hyponatremia and cerebral edema and fulfills criteria for an ideal irrigating solution: it is non-electrolytic, non-toxic, easily sterilized and inexpensive . Because of these characteristics, it has become the most commonly used irrigation fluid for transurethral procedures .\n\n【12】A typical transurethral procedure utilizes an average of 20 L of irrigation solution. Most patients are expected to absorb 1 L to 2 L of irrigant in a procedure that usually lasts approximately 40 minutes , when bladder rupture occurs large amounts of solution enters the peritoneal cavity. This can lead to a massive absorption, as in this case. Only one other report of bladder rupture and massive irrigation is reported .\n\n【13】When large amounts of glycine irrigation fluid are absorbed systemically a symptom complex known as Irrigation Absorption Syndrome occurs.\n\n【14】The onset of Irrigation Absorption Syndrome occurs minutes to hours post procedure. It occurs in about 2% of all transurethral prostate resections . Factors associated with occurrence of the syndrome include duration of surgery, height of the irrigation solution, and amount of venous sinuses opened during the procedure. Altered mental status immediately after the procedure, as in our case, is a common finding in patients with irrigation absorption syndrome. Confusion, agitation, headache vomiting, muscle twitching, and seizures are commonly seen . Hyponatremia and hyperammonemia are frequently reported .\n\n【15】Hyperammonemia results from glycine metablolism . Glycine, a non-essential amino acid, is metabolized to pyruvate by glycine synthase with the liberation of ammonium ions . Once formed, ammonia is converted to urea. Alternatively, a percentage of ammonia is converted to glutamine via glutamine synthase. Studies have shown both mechanisms to be highly active in glycine toxicity .\n\n【16】High levels of ammonia due to glycine absorption have been reported as high as 848 µmol/L . Our patient’s level of 1,592 µmol/L is the highest reported in the literature. An elevated ammonia level may cause nausea, vomiting, convulsions and altered mental status. In animal studies increased ammonia levels led to elevated brain glutamate concentrations and increased NMDA receptor activation . However, animal studies do not show convincing evidence of lethality associated with increasing levels of ammonia . Despite the extremely high levels of ammonia in our patient, the levels quickly decreased over several days without any resultant neurological sequelae.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Severe hyperammonemia is possible after massive pelvic and intraperitoneal glycine absorption. Such toxicity is survivable and can be associated with altered mental status and seizures. The etiology of irrigation absorption syndrome is controversial. Hyponatremia and hyperammonemia both have profound neurological effects. Further studies into the pathophysiology are needed so that any adverse effects of glycine toxicity can be managed in a directed fashion towards the metabolic abnormalities that cause glycine irrigation absorption syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Then, carboxy group of the carboxybiotin is transferred to propionyl-CoA generating methylmalonyl-CoA by b subunit . These subunits are encoded by PCCA and PCCB genes located on chromosomes 13 and 3 .\n\n【3】The phenotypes of PCCA mutations are most varied ranging from mild to lethal within a few days after birth because there is great heterogeneity in the mutations of PCCA, while PCCB bears only a limited number of mutations . So, in general, defects in these genes result in insufficiency of the enzyme and accumulation of propionyl-CoA , ammonia and severe ketoacidosis .\n\n【4】Clinical manifestations typically appear when infants wean from breast milk (early-onset) because formula is high in protein, whereas breast milk is relatively low in protein . Most of the affected babies, if not treated, die in the neonatal period or during the first 10 years of life . In the rare cases, and for unknown reasons, symptoms of this disease occur in adulthood (late-onset) . About 80% of cases appear during the neonatal period and late-onset cases especially those proving fatal are more uncommon .\n\n【5】The most common and most severe form of PA presents in the neonatal period, and patients typically present within their first 3 months of age with acute metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia and progressive encephalopathy , seizures, and coma . Late-onset cases tend to run more heterogeneous courses, presenting with episodic acidosis, acute encephalopathy, mental retardation, and movement disorders, with extrapyramidal signs such as choreoathetosis and dystonia, even without metabolic decompensation . Early- and late-onset PA can cause severe and permanent neurological damage . The degree of neurological insult is related to the degree of hyperammonemia .\n\n【6】Deep resequencing of all human genes could potentially identify allelic variants involved in a given rare monogenic disease . One of approaches is the targeted resequencing of all protein-coding subsequences (whole exome sequencing (WES)), which requires about 5% as much sequencing as a whole human genome . Sequencing of the exome, rather than the entire human genome, is well justified as an efficient strategy to search for mutation discovery of rare Mendelian disorders .\n\n【7】Here we analyzed an Iranian couple with the history of having a child who died probably due to PA by WES. The child with poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, hypotonia and lethargy born to a first cousin parents died in age of 1 year. Biochemical and enzymatic assays that have been performed for her were in favor of PA diagnosis.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】Ten milliliter peripheral bloods were collected from parents in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using salting out standard method. WES was done for one of the parents. Human exonic regions were enriched by using the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000.\n\n【10】Analysis of the WES data was performed by using the alignment and analysis software NextGENe <sup>TM </sup> v2.18 by Softgenetics. The raw data were filtered for low quality reads before alignment. Reads that passed the quality filter were aligned to the whole human genome hg18. The average exome coverage was determined using a complete list of human exons generated by the UCSC Table Browser. The same procedure was performed for PCCA gene coverage. The following analytical steps were performed only with reads that matched exonic regions including exon intron-boundaries.\n\n【11】Potential mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing generally using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl instrument. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request.\n\n【12】By various filtering steps, we focused on the novel variants or those with very MAF less than 1% found in the genes known so far for methylmalonic academia and PA. We considered the genes for methylmalonic academia as well in order to not miss anything as these two diseases are very similar and it is difficult most of the times to discriminate them based on clinical and biochemical findings. WES revealed only one promising novel heterozygous mutation in PCCA. It included the single-base substitution c.1140C>G, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid position p.380  in exon 12. We could confirm by Sanger sequencing this non-sense mutation in both parents, but we could not confirm the parental segregation of p.Y380X in their infant, in whom no material was available.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】More than 7,000 rare diseases have been described, and in the aggregate, these affect more than 25 million people. The majority of these diseases are considered genetic disorders, and many of them are thought to be monogenic. Exome sequencing of a small number of affected family members or affected unrelated individuals is a powerful, efficient and cost-effective strategy for markedly reducing the pool of candidate genes for rare monogenic disorders and may even identify the responsible gene(s) specifically . It uses DNA-enrichment methods and massively parallel nucleotide sequencing to comprehensively identify and type protein-coding variants to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and small insertion/deletions (49 new) throughout the genome . This approach is likely to become a standard tool for the discovery of genes underlying rare monogenic diseases  because it has been used so far successfully in many rare diseases .\n\n【15】In this study, we encounter parents with consanguineous marriage that lost their infant because of suffering a genetic disease suspicious to PA. We did not have any material for examination and diagnosis of her disease.\n\n【16】Iran is one of the countries located in the consanguineous marriage belt, where prevalence rate of consanguineous marriages is estimated to be 23-78% . Therefore, the rate of recessive mutations is expected to be higher in Iranian population compared to other populations . In the country with lower rate of consanguineous marriage, individuals suffering from PA are most commonly compound heterozygotes . As PA is an autosomal recessive disorder  and parents were first cousin, we assumed that it is more likely parents are carriers of the same disease-causing variants. So we applied WES on one of the parents and confirmed the variants found in the other parent by Sanger sequencing in order to reduce the cost.\n\n【17】A novel heterozygous non-sense mutation  in exon 12 of the PCCA gene resulting in the protein truncation was found through this study.\n\n【18】Determining genetic diagnosis prenatally allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions and to be counseled about possible fetal outcomes, management options and recurrence risks. Therefore, it is important for the physician to be conscious of the full spectrum of genetic conditions, and to use appropriate testing and referrals to genetic healthcare providers in order to obtain a specific diagnosis .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】We showed that WES in parents, along with appropriate filtering against public SNP databases, is sufficient to identify carriers for a known monogenic disorder, PA, in a consanguineous family. Therefore, principled methods combining genomic, biochemical, and clinical data will be required to usher NGS into the clinical arena .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8bd0a29a-70ec-4416-b95e-53feb91e498e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary epithelial neoplasm of the liver originating from hepatocytes. The majority of patients are males in late middle age with predisposing hepatic cirrhosis (of varying etiology) or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Although a global challenge for healthcare being the fifth most common cancer worldwide, the majority of the burden of HCC falls on developing nations where endemic hepatitis B virus infection and aflatoxin exposure rather than hepatitis C virus and alcoholism drive most cases .\n\n【2】HCC in childhood is very rare and accounts for less than 0.5% of all pediatric malignancies. However, it is the second most common malignant liver neoplasm after hepatoblastoma in children. Its relative frequency is 0.5 to 1.0 cases per million children. It is commoner in adolescents than in infants. There may be some evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the R0 resection rate in pediatric cases .\n\n【3】Unlike hepatoblastoma, pediatric conventional HCC usually develops in the presence of underlying liver disease and this may include chronic hepatitis B infection, metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia, Wilson’s disease  and glycogen storage diseases, structural problems such as biliary atresia  and infantile cholestatis. However, in children as compared to adults, there are more de novo cases arising in non-cirrhotic livers. The prognosis in HCC is poor and this may relate to the intrinsic resistance of HCC to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy certainly compared with hepatoblastoma .\n\n【4】A subtype of HCC is fibrolamellar carcinoma. Its distinguishing features histologically include abundant fibrous collagenous bands, eosinophilic tumor cell cytoplasm and enlarged nucleoli . Fibrolamellar HCC predominantly occurs in young patients without underlying hepatitis or cirrhosis. Serum α-fetoproteins are not elevated in most cases and the male/female ratio is approximately equal. Although many early studies suggested a better prognosis with the fibrolamellar variant , it is increasingly being appreciated that this may well not be the case . The 5-year survival rate was 76% for resected fibrolamellar HCC versus 37% for resected HCC in one study .\n\n【5】The typical presenting symptoms of HCC may include upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, and constitutional symptoms such as poor appetite, lack of energy and unintentional weight loss. In patients with a history of chronic liver disease, HCC may first be suspected when de-compensation of cirrhosis occurs manifesting with variceal bleeding, worsening ascites associated with peripheral oedema, jaundice and encephalopathy. HCC is also increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals who are undergoing serological (AFP) and ultrasound surveillance in view of their liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\n\n【6】Treatment for HCC is largely determined by the stage of the tumor at presentation and the Barcelona Liver Clinic staging system is widely used for this purpose. It incorporates patient-related factors such as co-morbidities, symptoms and performance status, tumor-related factors including size and number of tumor nodules on imaging and the presence of nodal metastases and extra-hepatic spread and also the severity of any underlying cirrhosis as assessed by the Child-Pugh score and degree of portal hypertension . Patients with early stage disease may be treated with curative intent with ablative techniques, partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation . Intermediate stage disease is treated with loco-regional therapies including transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE) typically with doxorubicin  and latterly radioembolization  leading to a median survival of 20 - 24 months. Advanced stage HCC is treated with sorafenib, a multi-targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, cKIT, RAF and Flt3 ligand, as standard-of-care. The survival benefit is demonstrable but modest with an increase of 2.8 months in median overall survival in a European population with predominantly hepatitis C virus infection  and 2.3 months in an Oriental population with mainly hepatitis B virus infection and more advanced cirrhosis .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Here, we present a case of fibrolamellar HCC, diagnosed in childhood in the absence of underlying liver disease with a protracted course, multiple resections of metastatic deposits and dramatic response to radiation therapy.\n\n【9】A 14-year-old girl, without any significant past medical history except for meningococcal septicaemia at the age of 5 years, presented for further evaluation with a 3-month history of profound fatigue and lethargy. She also described amenorrhoea for 1 year and a recurrent rash on the bridge of her nose. She did not complain of bowel symptoms, loss of appetite, abdominal pain or jaundice.\n\n【10】On clinical examination, she was slightly hirsute over her trunk and was slightly tachycardic with pulse of 100 and a blood pressure of 125/80 mm Hg. On abdominal examination, she had an enlarged liver, 4 - 5 cm below the right costal margin. She was also hyperpigmented around her neck but no other abnormalities were noted. There was no family history of liver disease or malignancy.\n\n【11】Her laboratory investigations showed a slightly raised alanine aminotransferase at 51 IU/L, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 88 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 44 mg/L with no other abnormal results. Abdominal ultrasound showed a solid echogenic lesion measuring 17 × 18 × 10 cm displacing hepatic and portal veins within her liver. A localized lesion was confirmed on CT imaging: there was no evidence of metastasis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was within the normal range.\n\n【12】She underwent laparotomy and extended right hemi-hepatectomy with caudate lobe resection and there was complete macroscopic clearance of visible disease. Histopathology confirmed a primary fibrolamellar HCC, measuring 28 cm diameter, with no histological evidence of fibrosis or steatohepatitis in the background liver and no evidence of infective or metabolic liver disease as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 2 shows the typical fibrocollagenous bands of fibrolamellar HCC. Following surgery, she received adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of chemotherapy with intravenous doxorubicin and sorafenib for a period of 6 months. However, 9 months following the completion of adjuvant therapy, routine surveillance imaging detected a seemingly isolated recurrent lesion in the remnant liver. This was resected with a non-anatomical resection with clear margins and histomorphological appearances identical to the primary lesion, with evidence of focal lymphovascular invasion as shown in Figure 3 . A follow-up CT scan 6 months later demonstrated multiple lung lesions. At this point, after an informed discussion with the patient and her family regarding the relative paucity of evidence for sorafenib in fibrolamellar HCC, sorafenib was re-instituted at a dose of 800 mg daily and this was later reduced to 600 mg daily in view of grade 1 - 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and generalized dry skin. Over the next 3 years, she underwent multiple video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical wedge resections for asymptomatic small pulmonary nodules (one in the right lung and three in the left lung) detected on routine surveillance thoracic and abdominal imaging. Histology confirmed metastatic fibrolamellar HCC in all nodules (with evidence of bile production by tumor cells), one resected nodule had positive resection margins and a hilar lymph node was involved with tumor. Histomorphological appearances resembled those of the primary lesion in the liver . She continued with sorafenib 600 mg during this period with reasonably good tolerance.\n\n【13】Six months after her last VATS lung resection, imaging revealed concerning enlargement of a left hilar lymph node. This was kept under surveillance and sorafenib was continued. However, 8 months later (5 years after initial diagnosis of fibrolamellar HCC in the liver) there was unequivocal enlargement of the left hilar node with a new enlarged right hilar node as shown in Figure 5a, b At this point, her sorafenib dose was increased back to 800 mg daily. Once again, a thoracic surgical opinion was sought and due to proximity of the left-sided lymph node to the inferior pulmonary vein and the right-sided node to the pulmonary artery, surgical resection was deemed inappropriate. Therefore, in a patient with an excellent performance status and no respiratory co-morbidity, an opinion regarding radical radiotherapy was sought. She underwent tomotherapy to bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes with a dose of 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Sorafenib was continued during radiotherapy and following completion of radiotherapy, she developed oral mucositis which had never been experienced with sorafenib previously. A follow-up CT scan 7 months after radiotherapy confirmed complete resolution of the bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and no evidence of recurrence elsewhere . Six months after this, despite remaining well and free of cancer-related symptoms, she developed grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysasthesia despite supportive measures. Due to the adverse effects on her quality of life, after an informed discussion she discontinued sorafenib and was kept under regular surveillance. At most recent follow-up, she remains well with no clinical or radiological evidence of active cancer.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】We believe this case is highly unusual and potentially educational in several ways including the protracted disease course with multiple metastectomies, good tolerance of sorafenib treatment over several years and the dramatic response to radiotherapy.\n\n【16】Although there is no evidence for chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for resected fibrolamellar HCC, this patient received adjuvant treatment with both sorafenib and doxorubicin in view of her complete resection, young age and potential to benefit from such treatment. The evidence for efficacy of either treatment in this setting is lacking in HCC  although the use of sorafenib after liver resection or ablative treatment is being investigated in the STORM study of sorafenib versus placebo until recurrence or intolerance of treatment. In fibrolamellar HCC, various case series have advocated aggressive resection of recurrent lesions to improve survival of young patients . Even in these cases documented median survival after second resection is in the range of 24 - 27 months.\n\n【17】It can be speculated that since sorafenib is predominantly cytostatic, its concurrent use with chemotherapy may have blunted the potential cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy which targets dividing cells. This potential cytostatic effect of sorafenib also formed the rationale for restarting the drug when metastatic disease was detected despite its use in the adjuvant setting. The sorafenib-doxorubicin combination is currently being studied in the randomized, phase III setting for advanced HCC in the NCT01015833 study. In patients with inoperable HCC, it was reported that sorafenib and doxorubicin were tolerable, although rates of G/3 diarrhea and leukopenia were 17% and 45% respectively, with a disease control rate of 70% .\n\n【18】This patient underwent pulmonary metastectomies via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and wedge resections for metachronous oligometastatic disease in the lungs. Notably, although there was no evidence of metastatic disease outside of the thorax, the lung lesions were multiple not solitary. Again, there is a paucity of published scientific literature on this topic. Three studies, each with less than 50 patients, reported on outcomes from case series of patients who had pulmonary metastectomies for metachronous disease . The rate of overall survival ranged from 24% at 3 years to 26-37% at 5 years. Solitary metastasis and longer time from resection of primary cancer to detection of metastases were associated with better survival outcomes. Clearly, such case series do not include a comparison group and therefore the favorable outcomes described may relate to intrinsically indolent disease as in this case rather than reflect any therapeutic benefit of the surgical resection.\n\n【19】Although HCC has long been known to be an intrinsically radiosensitive tumor, as evidenced by for example the 70-80% pain relief rate after irradiation of symptomatic skeletal metastases , its role in fibrolamellar HCC is unknown. Our case does demonstrate good therapeutic effect of radical dose RT in keeping with recent findings of the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy whether delivered externally in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy , sparing normal liver tissue, or internally for example with yttrium beads .\n\n【20】This patient received concurrent radiotherapy and sorafenib and whilst not an extensively studied combination in the literature, there is emerging evidence that it is a safe and feasible combination treatment  and, in fact, there may well be synergistic effects between anti-angiogenic therapy and radiotherapy with the former potentiating the effect of the latter , although this may be very dependent on dose and scheduling of radiation therapy .\n\n【21】This patient has survived for over 5 years, with evidence of local recurrent disease for 4 years and metastatic disease for 3 years and her tumor-related symptomatology has been minimal. However, having received a prolonged course of sorafenib which at best may have reduced her disease velocity and also having received 50 Gy of thoracic radiotherapy, her options for future systemic treatment are limited. These options may include further anti-angiogenic therapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib, which has shown evidence of limited overall survival benefit in heavily pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer, and which is being studied for advanced sorafenib refractory HCC in the phase III, randomized, placebo controlled setting in the NCT01774344 study. Brivanib, another multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has additional effects on fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling, has shown promise in advanced HCC although in the first-line setting, it was inferior to sorafenib and was less well tolerated . In the post-sorafenib setting, brivanib did not improve overall survival compared to placebo but there was a radiological response rate of 10% and median time-to-progression was 1.5 months longer for brivanib than placebo .\n\n【22】Moving away from targeted therapies, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging as a potentially highly effective therapy for cancers which were once considered non-immunogenic such as non-small cell lung cancer . In particular, there is evidence that the anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-antigen-4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab can generate potent anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses in patients with HCV-associated HCC and in the clinical setting, tremelimumab achieved a partial response rate of 18% with a median progression free survival of 6.5 months in patients with advanced stage HCC and Child-Pugh B cirrhosis . Of particular relevance to this case, it is well known that radiation therapy to a particular metastatic lesion may lead to “abscopal” regression of distant (non-irradiated) lesions due to radiotherapy inducing immunogenic cell death and immune priming  which may be potentiated by subsequent immune checkpoint blockage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "80d7a7f2-9ecd-4055-aaad-b14f0a440fa4", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Two types of endometrial carcinoma, type I and type II, have been distinguished on the basis of clinicopathological and genetic studies. Malignant transformation of adenomyosis has been recognized similar pathway of them. Type I, characterized by ER-positiveness, accounts for the majority of endometrial cancers . Type II, consisting of rare cases and negative for ER and PR, is characterized by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. We report here an autopsy case of type II endometrial carcinoma arising from adenomyosis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old premenopausal woman with a 4-year history of adenomyosis, gravida 0, para 0, presenting with continued low abdominal pain, visited a local clinic. Ultrasound scans revealed multiple tumors in the pelvic cavity. On referral to our hospital, biopsy of endometrium was done, which revealed almost normal glandular cells (negative). MRI revealed multiple tumors in uterine myometrium and omentum. The tumors were enhanced on T1-weighted imaging, and uterine sarcoma was suspected. The endometrium, without enhancement, was 6 mm in thickness. Liver and bone metastasis was confirmed by CT . Serum levels of CEA and CA125 were elevated to 695.3 U/mL and 300.0 U/mL, respectively. The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The uterus was child-head sized and multiple disseminations in omentum, peritoneal cavity, and adnexa were seen . The cut surface of the uterus was white to yellow-white in color. Necrosis and hemorrhage were observed. Histopathological examination revealed grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation. But the lesion was located only in the muscle layer of the uterus and the endometrium was no tumorous change. Cancer nests adjacent to the adenomyotic foci were observed. Tumor cells stained positively for p53, but did not express either ER or PR . We diagnosed the case as a stage 4B endometrioid adenocarcinoma originating from adenomyosis, following the staging of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  2008. Its postoperative classification was pT3aN1M1.\n\n【4】Opting against adjuvant therapy, the patient died 16 days later from rapid enlargement and rupture of the metastasized liver and respiratory failure. An autopsy confirmed the mass lesions in the pelvic cavity and also compressed small intestines, which caused ileus. Bone metastasis, multiple lymph node metastases including para-aortic, and lung metastases were also diagnosed. Multiple liver metastases caused biliary obstruction and hepatic failure. Multiple thromboses and hemorrhaging in both lungs with the hypercoagulable condition led to respiratory failure. Histology of the pelvic mass lesion revealed mainly poorly differentiated carcinoma. The tumor cells contained bizarre nuclei and exhibited high mitotic activity. Benign endometriosis lesions were not present in pelvic cavity.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Adenomyosis is a common gynecological disease, which is characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma located within the myometrium . Several pathological theories have been proposed: epithelial-mesenchymal transition , metaplasia , Mullerian rests , reaction (injury and regeneration of tissue) , and multipotential perivascular theory . The etiology and pathogenesis of adenomyosis remain undecided. There have been 44 reported cases of adenocarcinoma developing within adenomyosis . Most of the patients were postmenopausal. Malignant transformation of adenomyosis in premenopausal women with normal endometrium is extremely rare .\n\n【7】Sampson’s or Colman’s criteria for the diagnosis of carcinoma arising from adenomyosis are as follows: 1) the carcinoma must not be situated in the endometrium or elsewhere in the pelvis; 2) the carcinoma must be seen to arise from the epithelium of adenomyosis and not to have invaded from other source; and 3) endometrial (adenomyotic) stromal cells should be surrounding the aberrant glands to support the diagnosis of adenomyosis . Histological subtypes of the tumors are endometrioid and, to a lesser degree, serous, clear cell and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma . Two types of endometrial carcinoma, type I and type II, have been described on the basis of clinicopathological and genetic studies. In most cases with malignant transformation of adenomyosis, different stages of atypical or hyperplastic changes are simultaneously identified . This observation points to a similar pathway of carcinogenesis in adenomyosis as is known in estrogen-responsive endometrial cancer type I .\n\n【8】In general, malignant transformation of adenomyosis is positive for ER, PR, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), CA125 and focally weak-positive for aromatase. Hormonal receptor expression is associated with low-grade and early-stage tumors . Kucera et al, having researched the clinical data of 219 patients with the diagnosis of early endometrial cancer, reported that adenomyosis was found in 88 of them and malignant changes in adenomyosis were present in six (6.8%) of those 88 patients. All those six cases were with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, of which five were well or moderately differentiated. They suggested that there is a similar pathway of carcinogenesis in adenomyosis in that it is positive for ER (type I endometrial cancer) . By contrast, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells stained positively for p53 , but did not express either ER or PR . This has led to the proposal that some cases with malignant transformation of adenomyosis develop de novo . Koshiyama et al reported only four cases of type II carcinomas in 564 patients (0.74%) operated on between 1981 and 2001 . Three of the four cases reported (grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, clear-cell adenocarcinoma, and serous adenocarcinoma) were of histologically unfavorable subtype .\n\n【9】It is usually difficult to make a diagnosis of type II endometrioid adenocarcinoma; a delay is often caused because of the absence of lesion in nomotopic endometrium. According to the review of Boes et al, in almost all the cases where endometrial cytology was performed, the result was negative . It is usually until after the tumor has grown so much as to involve the endometrium, causing abnormal uterine bleeding or spreading outside of the uterus, a correct diagnosis is made . The management of this clinical entity consists of surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n【10】In our own case, there was a past history of adenomyosis for 4 years. The tumor must have originated from adenomyosis because the carcinoma located only in the muscle layer of the uterus and apart from the endometrium. The endometrium was intact and cancer nests adjacent to the adenomyotic foci were observed. There is no hyperplastic or atypical changes between cancer nests and adenomyotic foci. The tumor had rapidly grown and affected many organs, killing the patient at 3 months after the appearance of a symptom.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Malignant transformation of adenomyosis in premenopausal women is extremely rare, and the details remain unclear including the convalescence. The case we encountered was a high-potential malignant tumor: the tumor rapidly grew and infiltrated multiple organs in a short period, suggesting it was a type II carcinoma with biologically aggressive behavior.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "ce5a03d2-249d-40e7-a9a2-51971ce69fcb", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is common in Asia and South Africa. Approximately 80-90% of HCCs arise from chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis that develops after HBV or HCV infections; however, a growing number of HCCs have recently developed from non-B-non-C hepatitis. Another cause of hepatitis and liver cirrhosis is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is related to lifestyle diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and obesity. NASH has the potential of developing HCC. Till date, HCC was believed to arise from the background of cirrhosis liver and uncommonly in a liver not damaged by cirrhosis. Here we report the case of a patient with HCC that developed from non-cirrhotic NASH.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 76-year-old male presented to our hospital with a complaint of abdominal distention. His past medical history included impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that were treated using anti-hypertensive drugs. He denied any use of tobacco and alcohol. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass of 5 cm in S5 of the liver. He was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of this liver mass.\n\n【4】Upon arrival, his blood pressure was 168/76 mm Hg, heart rate was 87 beats/min with regular rhythm, blood oxygen saturation was 96% under atmospheric conditions, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. On initial clinical examination, his weight was 70.7 kg, height was 170.0 cm, and body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . There was no evidence of anemia upon inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva. Chest auscultation revealed no signs of abnormal heart murmurs and no rales or other respiratory sounds. The abdomen was slightly distended, with no tenderness in the upper abdomen, and normal peristalsis was evident. Further, there was no palpable mass or any signs of peritoneal irritation.\n\n【5】Laboratory analysis results, including complete blood counts, biochemistry, and blood coagulation values were all within normal limits. In addition, tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, revealed values within normal limits. Virus markers were negative for HBs-Ag, HBV-DNA, HCV-Ab, and HCV-RNA.\n\n【6】Ultrasonography revealed a lobular mass in S5 of the liver with a marginal low echo that measured 50 × 40 mm . Contrast-enhanced CT also revealed a mass in S5 of the liver that measured 48 × 45 × 45 mm, with marked enhancement in the early phase . In the late phase, contrast agents in the interiors of the mass were washed out with the residues of the contrast agent at the margin of the tumor . Based on the imaging modalities, the patient was diagnosed with HCC. As a result, he was chosen as a candidate for surgical resection. Subsegmentectomy of S5 and S6 was performed under general anesthesia. Gross examination of the specimen revealed a white-yellowish soft tumor with multiple nodules . Microscopic histological findings of the tumor indicated moderately differentiated HCC . In addition, macrovesicular lipid depositions and mild steatosis without fibrosis were observed in the background liver, which were compatible with A2F1 .\n\n【7】The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient discharged, and regular follow-up at an outpatient clinic was planned.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Approximately 80-90% of HCCs in Japan arise from HBV- or HCV-related chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis; however, there has been an increasing number of non-B-non-C HCCs. NASH is considered to be another potential cause of hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and also deemed to be an underlying non-B-non-C HCC disease. Past research has demonstrated strong associations between NASH and lifestyle diseases. Increase in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been found to have a positive correlation with liver fibrosis, suggesting that the level of HbA1c affects the progression of NASH .\n\n【10】Liver damage that is not associated with a history of alcoholic use, which shares similar histological findings to alcohol-associated liver disease, was discovered in 1980; thus, the concept of NASH was first established . Subsequently, the relationship of NASH with metabolic syndromes, including obesity, DM, and hypertension, was observed . Although it was considered uncommon for non-cirrhosis NASH to develop into HCC, there has been an increasing number of cases of HCC developed from NASH. Recently, it was reported that oxidative DNA damage may, in part, be a carcinogen . Furthermore, patients with metabolic syndrome suffering from obesity, DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia tend to demonstrate increased oxidative stress .\n\n【11】A recent pathological study regarding NASH complicated by HCC demonstrated that 64% of HCCs arose from non-cirrhotic liver . This finding may suggest that fatty liver has a high potential for developing HCC. Recently, the concept of “immunometabolism” has gained momentum as a potential pathway to the development of HCC, stemming from complicated changes in the immunosystem or metabolic malfunction. Hence, immunometabolism is considered an important factor in the development of HCC from non-cirrhotic liver.\n\n【12】In the current study, closer examination of virus markers in the patient showed a positive indicator for HBs-Ab and negative indicator for HBc-Ab, HBe-Ag, and HBe-Ab. Although it is unclear if the present patient had a history of HBV vaccination, it is possible that he contracted HBV without being aware of it, indicating that acute HBV-related hepatitis might remit before knowing. Immunostaining of background liver tissues by HBs-Ag and HBc-Ag revealed negative and false-positive results, respectively . Based on this result, it seems likely that HBV viruses undetectable by serologic tests are involved in liver tissues. Upon further examination of liver fibrosis in this patient, the serum hyaluronic acid and serum collagen type IV levels were within normal limits; this result suggests no evidence of liver fibrosis in this patient. According to studies of asymptomatic HBV carriers, chronic HBV hepatitis, and HBV cirrhosis, it is known that negative seroconversion rates of HBV infections are 1-2%/year . Despite the amelioration of liver tissues in patients with HBV remission after the seroclearance of HBs-Ag, serum HBV-DNA and the normalization of serum ALT levels, it is possible for HCC to occur . It is recognized that HBV-DNA in liver tissues may work as a carcinogen, even if serum HBV-DNA is not detected. Recently, the concept of occult HBV has received attention after the revelation of fulminant HBV hepatitis developed during immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy . Occult HBV is defined as absence of HBs-Ag and presence of HBc-Ab and/or HBs-Ab; it carries a risk of reactivation of HBV hepatitis . In our patient, it was challenging to differentiate whether HCC stemmed from NASH or from occult HBV; nonetheless, it is suggested that patients with positive HBc-Ab and/or positive HBs-Ab, or positive HBs-Ab and/or positive HBc-Ab should receive regular follow-ups with serological viral marker testing and imaging modalities. Moreover, it should be noted that patients with metabolic syndrome should be meticulously observed by ultrasonography despite results of hepatitis virus markers.\n\n【13】A randomized control trial demonstrated that weight loss by diet and exercise is effective for the amelioration of liver steatosis . Likewise, in our patient, weight management and control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels is important for ameliorating NASH and preventing HCC recurrence.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】There is a growing concern about NASH as a contributing factor in the development of non-viral hepatitis or cirrhosis. NASH should be carefully observed because it carries a potential risk of developing HCC regardless of history of non-cirrhotic liver. Moreover, whenever encountering HCC with negative indicators for serum HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab, it is important to examine serum HBc-Ab and HBs-Ab to determine the presence of occult HBV. Our findings suggest that clinicians should increase awareness of these growing concepts of NASH and occult HBV.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "929d3b1a-e3b6-42e6-9dcb-778a1e3df3f3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Many diseases affect the liver during pregnancy, the most frequent being preeclampsia, eclampsia, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, hepatic rupture, hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Moreover, liver test abnormalities may exist as a result of many diseases that occur coincidentally during pregnancy. The laboratory findings of each of these disorders are usually similar, ranging from elevated liver-related enzymes and cholestasis . Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP) is a rare disorder with a prevalence of one in 1000 - 10,000 pregnancies. It is usually defined as cholestasis without other causes of biliary obstruction and liver dysfunction during the third trimester and, as a rule, it normally resolves following delivery . The ethiology of this disease has not been well established. One possible explanation is a gene variant of hepatocanalicular transport proteins and their regulators which affect the estrogen and progesterone mechanism .\n\n【2】The diagnosis of IHCP is based on evidence of elevated serum bile acid concentrations (>11 mmol/L) and decreased glycine/taurine bile acid ratio (below 1.0) in connection with cholestasis and pruritis during the third trimester of pregnancy . To confirm the diagnosis, the coexistant diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, autoimmune cholangitis, biliary tract disorders and systemic diseases) or medication use (e.g. herbal medicine) characterized by cholestasis should be promptly ruled out . HBe antigen negative pregnant patients with positive HBs antigen should be followed closely by means of ALT and HBV DNA testing and treated with antiviral agents once confirmation of hepatitis B flare during hypertransaminasemia is established .\n\n【3】Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is a destructive autoimmune thyroiditis that begins within the first few months after delivery, 85% of patients with PPT have positive antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase typically begins primarily and may be followed by a hypothyroid phase. Abnormalities in thyroid function tests resolve in most patients . Very rarely, a flare of hepatitis B may be associated with IHCP. In such cases, a prompt diagnosis can be made hardly. Here we report the coexistence of IHCP with hepatitis B infection and the subsequent development of PPT and loss of hepatitis B antigen in a woman.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 29-year-old pregnant woman was referred to our hospital because of elevated liver-related enzymes. A diagnosis of hepatitis B had been made seven years earlier and she did not receive any therapy for Hepatitis B. She did not smoke, drink alcohol or use herbal medicine. The patient was born and lived in eastern Turkey. This was her first pregnancy and there was no history of abortion. Her mother had pregnancy-related cholestasis and died in her 60s. On physical examination, the vital signs were normal except for mild tenderness on her right upper quadrant with scleral subicterus.\n\n【6】Her blood pressure was 115/85 mmHg and she had a pulse of 90 beats per minute at a temperature of 36.6 °C. The patient’s hematologic values were within the normal limits. The laboratory results obtained were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase level, 125 U per liter (normal range, 0 to 42); alanine aminotransferase level, 225 U per liter (normal range, 0 to 47); alkaline phosphatase level, 700 U per liter (normal range, 42 to 140); gamma glutamyl transferase level, 350 U per liter (normal range, 5 to 60); and direct bilirubin level, 0.4 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0.0 to 0.4 mg per deciliter). The international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.0.\n\n【7】Her HBS antigen was positive but HBe and hepatitis delta antigens were negative. HBV-DNA level was 350,000 copies/ml. She tested negative for other causative agents of viral hepatitis. Autoimmune and metabolic liver disease markers were also negative. An ultrasonographic study of the abdomen revealed a viable fetus at 24 weeks of gestation and showed an enlarged liver which measured as 19 mm; the appearance of the liver was homogeneous, without gallbladder stones or biliary dilation. The pancreas was normal and there was no splenomegaly. Moreover, MRCP revealed no abnormality in the entire biliary tract as well as pancreatic duct. Medication at discharge included tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg/day with antipruritic skin gels. One month after discharge, she returned to the hepatology clinic due to worsening of pruritus especially during the night. When admitted for the second time, her HBV DNA level was negative but direct bilirubin levels as well as cholestatic enzymes were higher.\n\n【8】Her prothrombin time was normal. Serum bile acid concentration was measured as 47 mmol/L. A diagnosis of IHCP was made and while tenofovir disoproxil was continued, a treatment with UDCA (15 mg/kg per day) and topical emollients was started. Two weeks later, at a follow-up visit, the patient was comfortable, and her pruritus was resolved. Furthermore, levels of the conjugated bilirubin and liver-related enzymes were also normalized. Following the fourth week of delivery, she returned to the hospital due to inability to sleep and tremors.\n\n【9】Hormonal analysis revealed hyperthyroidism with higher CRP level and elevated titers of antithyroid antibodies. A thyroid ultrasonography showed paranchymal heterogeneity . On the basis of these findings, postpartum thyroiditis was diagnosed and a short course of beta-blocker was started. Four months later, a subsequent hypothyroidal phase developed and 0.05 mg of L-thyroxine daily was prescribed. Furthermore, 96 weeks later, loss of HBS antigen developed during tenofovir treatment. The patient is currently thriving in her normal medical state.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The case reported had a rare combination of different diseases. We considered firstly liver disorders occurring coincidentally with pregnancy such as a delta coinfection or a severe exacerbation of hepatitis B, since the patient had previously received a diagnosis of being a hepatitis B carrier, and the patient had HBs antigen and higher HBV DNA levels. Delta hepatitis was ruled out by a negative HDV RNA test. Diagnosing IHCP at the time of the patient’s initial presentation was done hardly because the moderate cholestasis can be seen in biliary disorders but it could also reflect a cholestatic variety of viral hepatitis .\n\n【12】In this patient, co-morbidity, including autoimmune or metabolic liver diseases was also excluded by further biochemical and serologic methods. The therapy for hepatitis B in pregnant patients consists of nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. Tenofovir and telbivudine are listed by the FDA as pregnancy category B drugs , of which the most commonly available is tenofovir disoproxil at a dose of 245 mg/day, which we used for the treatment of the discussed case.\n\n【13】Despite the evidence of treatment-related low levels of HBV DNA, moderately elevated transaminases and cholestatic enzymes and direct hyperbilirubinemia persisted and her pruritus worsened at the fifth week of the antiviral treatment. IHCP frequently causes cholestasis in the third trimester of pregnancy, with a mean presentation at 30 weeks gestation. Biochemical tests of patients typically show elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (two to four times the normal level) and conjugated bilirubin (< 5 mg/dL). Liver transaminases may also be elevated, but rarely higher than fourfold .\n\n【14】Elevated levels of total serum bile acid concentrations are present in almost all patients with IHCP  as was seen in our case. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 10 - 20 mg/kg per day) is the first-line treatment for IHCP . A cascade of persistent symptoms and biochemical features at the second admission were characteristic of IHCP, so we favored treatment with UDCA at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day. Symptomatic treatment for pruritus was also started. In this patient, reducing HBV DNA levels by maintaining tenofovir was a good therapeutic approach, so we continued the antiviral therapy.\n\n【15】PPT is an autoimmune disorder and develops within 2 to 6 months following delivery. Transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism may develop. High titers of antithyroid antibodies are almost always present. One of the hallmarks of PPT is a markedly depressed TSH level with a high free thyroxine level during the postpartum period. Hypothyroidism may develop in a minority of patients . TSH is a useful tool to detect postpartum thyroiditis and should be measured where possible in all patients post pregnancy. Therapy with levothyroxine sodium is indicated for patients with thyroid failure .\n\n【16】Loss of serum HBS antigen is reported as final endpoint for the treatment of hepatitis B . In HBe antigen negative patients, tenofovir-induced loss of HBS antigen at week 48 was reported as 0% . At week 96, she also had a loss of HBS antigen with antibody seroconversion against hepatitis B surface antigen. In light of the presented case report, tenofovir disoproxil should be considered for the treatment of HBe antigen negative pregnant patients.\n\n【17】IHCP can also occur in pregnant hepatitis B patients. A high index of suspicion is necessary in order to diagnose IHCP, particularly in pregnant women who have a flare of hepatitis B. Furthermore, there may be a causal relationship between the IHCP and postpartum thyroiditis. These two disorders may share the same autoimmune ethiology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1d6af4a0-a080-40c5-b5d7-1e3be8eb2b75", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Intestinal obstruction due to colonic malrotation is a challenging diagnosis and a very rare presentation. Its diagnosis is mainly based on radiologic imaging methods . The presence of radiological signs such as the whirl sign of mesenteric vasculature and left sided cecum on abdominal computerized tomography examination and the clinical signs of intestinal obstruction are of diagnostic importance for this disease entity . Surgery is the treatment of choice for these patients . The success of treatment and prevention of complications depends on an accurate diagnosis and exact localization of colonic and intestinal anatomy . Herein, we report a 39-year-old man having intermittent attacks of nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain leading to a diagnosis of intestinal and colonic malrotation. We presented our case with detailed clinical, radiological and surgical findings and summarized the relevant literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 39-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of vomiting and acute epigastric pain. He noticed that he vomited digested food and bilious contents postprandially for the last few weeks. He also said he had been suffering from intermittent abdominal pain since his childhood. He had no medication use for any known illness. He also never consumed ethanol. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and abdominal distension. Laboratory studies showed a normal hemogram with a slightly elevated C-reactive protein. His blood biochemistry revealed elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, 97 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 42 U/L), amylase 465 U/L and lipase 734 U/L. The other tests of blood biochemistry including glucose, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, g-glutamyltransferase, triglycerides and electrolytes were completely normal. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) examination revealed that cecum and appendix were seen in the left lower abdominal quadrant and the ascending colon was lying parallel to descending colon till to the level of left kidney . At that level, the ascending colon had a turn to the right side of the abdomen and thereafter it joined to transverse colon after making hepatic flexura nearly at the second part of the duodenum. There was a sudden and obvious decrease in the luminal diameter of second and third part of the duodenum where the ascending colon passes from the right to the left of mid-abdomen. Proximally duodenum is noted to be dilated. Additionally, we noticed the existence of whirl sign due to rotation of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) leftward on superior mesenteric artery (SMA) .The gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts were seen normally on magnetic resonance cholangiography.\n\n【4】The patient was referred to operating room. On exploration, there was distension in the stomach and throughout the duodenum and, there were Ladd’s bands crossing and squeezing especially the distal part of the duodenum. The third and fourth parts of the duodenum were found to reside intraperitoneally, rather than their expected natural place in the retroperitoneum. Also, the cecum, appendix and ascending colon were found to reside completely in the left abdominal space . The bands around duodenum were excised surgically. The other abdominal organs were in their normal anatomical position. A diagnosis of incomplete midgut malrotation was made in this patient.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Intestinal malrotation has been considered primarily a disease of infancy or childhood. However, it can be diagnosed in adults with variable clinical signs and symptoms. Seven different types and degrees of intestinal malrotation were known according to complete or partial failures of rotation and abnormalities affecting the duodenojejunal loop, the cecocolic loop, or both. As in our patient, the most common type is type Ia and the duodenum and large bowel stop rotation after 90° in that type, so that the proximal small bowel, including the duodenojejunal junction, lies on the right and cecum lies on the left . After 12th gestational week, fixation of intestine throughout peritoneal bands (Ladd’s bands) to the posterior body wall occurs. In the setting of colonic malrotation, the tightening of these bands may lead to duodenal obstruction as occurred in our case . Due to obstruction, high intra duodenal pressure and reflux of duodeno-biliary contents can complicate as recurrent pancreatitis attacks which is a very rare reason of pancreatitis .\n\n【7】Intestinal obstruction due to cecal malrotation can be difficult to diagnose clinically. In clinics, the most frequent symptom is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension diarrhea, malabsorption, peritonitis and septic shock . Our patient presented with chronic recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. In adult patients, these clinical symptoms can be mistaken for peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic and biliary disorders. Because of these nonspecific clinic symptoms, the diagnosis of malrotation primarily lies on radiologic examinations. In infancy, the main diagnostic approach is plain abdominal film and ultrasonography (USG). Although the plain abdominal radiographs do not have specific findings indicating malrotation, the dilatation of bowel segments can be easily seen on these graphs. If this finding exists, there needs to be prompt further investigation. Ultrasonography is a primarily diagnostic modality in infants. On USG examination, the dilated duodenal segments, whirl sign between rotated duodenum, SMV and SMA, and fixed midline duodenum can be noticeable findings . The CT is the primary diagnostic method of choice in adult patients. On CT examination, whirlpool sign is a good indicator of intestinal malrotation even in the absence of volvulus . Furthermore, abnormally positioned cecum and ascending colon in the left lower quadrant also will be clearly seen on CT examination. Due to Ladd’s bands, duodenal obstruction can occur and transition point between dilated and non-dilated bowel segments will be apparently seen on CT imaging as well. Surgical intervention is definitely treatment option for colonic malrotation. Ladd’s procedure is a choice of reasonable treatment and during this operation, an appendectomy may be performed or not.\n\n【8】As a conclusion, this case reminds us the importance of a tedious radiological evaluation in the setting of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting in daily clinical practice. Clinicians should be aware of colonic malrotation presenting with symptoms of intestinal obstruction and pancreatitis even in adulthood. This is very much important for proper treatment decision and to avoid surgical complications in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e3210c9c-1074-43fb-9357-cf293b036043", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a term used to describe a heterogenous group of disorders with the common theme of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, non-immune thrombocytopenia, and end-organ damage. Drug-induced TMA is a rare cause of this disease process. The diagnosis requires ruling out other causes of TMA such as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli \\-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), underlying conditions, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity > 10% .\n\n【2】STEC-HUS and TTP are often considered primary causes of TMA, while aHUS and TMA associated with an underlying disease can be considered secondary causes. In this classification scheme, the term aHUS is reserved for TMA due to uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway  and is usually associated with a genetic defect in complement regulatory proteins . Pathogenic variants of complement regulatory genes for complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and C3 have been described in aHUS . Other secondary causes of TMA can result from a variety of conditions such as infection, cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, pregnancy, and medication exposure. However, it has been suggested that complement dysregulation may play a critical role in the acute stages of many secondary TMAs, not solely in aHUS .\n\n【3】Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy . Since that time, increasing reports of TMA secondary to carfilzomib have been published . The most important step in the management of carfilzomib-induced TMA is stopping the drug. More recently, therapeutic success has been reported with the terminal complement inhibitor, eculizumab . Additionally, plasmapheresis can be used as a temporizing measure until TTP is ruled out or when eculizumab is not available.\n\n【4】We present a case of TMA secondary to carfilzomib, describe the pathogenesis of TMA in this setting, and discuss possible links between the mechanism of proteasome inhibitors and complement dysregulation.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 62-year-old African American woman with a long-standing history of essential hypertension was diagnosed with IgA kappa multiple myeloma. The diagnosis was made after she presented with a history of left hip pain that did not improve with conservative management. After a computed tomography (CT) scan of the hip showed lytic lesions, a bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. At that time, she had no evidence of kidney disease, and her blood pressure was controlled with amlodipine, losartan, and metoprolol succinate.\n\n【8】Therapy for multiple myeloma was initiated with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. The patient received two doses of each medication during the first cycle of this regimen. On day 6, she presented to a local hospital emergency department with dyspnea on exertion, tachycardia (102/min), and an elevated blood pressure (152/101 mm Hg). She was afebrile and all other vital signs were within normal limits. She was oriented to person, place, and time and had no evidence of bleeding or peripheral edema. She also did not endorse abdominal pain or any recent episodes of vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea, nor did she endorse exposure to sick contacts.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】A chest CT ruled out a pulmonary embolism. Of note, her admission laboratory tests demonstrated evidence of a probable microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with platelets of 2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, haptoglobin of < 8 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 4.2 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1,757 U/L, and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Furthermore, her urine was amber colored, and the urinalysis was positive for blood (3+) and protein (3+). Her creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL at that time. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was negative, and the fibrinogen was within normal limits. However, her D-dimer was elevated at 5.63 mg/L .\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】At this point, carfilzomib-induced TMA was suspected, and therapy with this agent was discontinued. However, as TTP was also a consideration, ADAMTS13 activity was assessed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated (1.0 plasma volume per day with frozen plasma replacement using the Spectra Optia apheresis instrument: Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). After a 3-day hospitalization, which included two TPE procedures, the patient experienced no improvement in either her baseline clinical symptoms or her laboratory values. Therefore, she was transferred to our institution for further management.\n\n【13】The patient received two additional TPE procedures with mild improvement in her hemolytic laboratory indices, but she experienced a sustained rise in her creatinine (4.6 mg/dL) and additional evidence of acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 68 mg/dL). On day 5, ADAMTS13 activity resulted at 91% (≥ 67%). Complement levels were reduced: C3 of 83 mg/dL , C4 of 9 mg/dL , and total complement, CH50, of 14 U/mL (> 41). TPE was discontinued. With compelling evidence to support a diagnosis of aHUS, intravenous eculizumab was started on day 7 at a dose of 900 mg. The patient completed two cycles of eculizumab (weekly dosing) but did not receive additional therapy since her liver enzymes became elevated. However, her hemoglobin stabilized within 2 weeks. Of note, additional complement factor testing was within the normal reference range, including factor H of 283 µg/mL , factor B of 33 mg/dL , and factor I of 44.6 µg/mL (29.3 - 58.5). CD46 and factor H antibodies were not assessed. On hospital day 8, the patient’s creatinine plateaued. By day 14, she demonstrated marked improvement in laboratory markers of hemolysis and her clinical symptoms . Throughout her admission, all infectious disease tests were negative.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】After a 2-week hospitalization, the patient was discharged and was followed as an outpatient with the hematology/oncology clinic. After discharge, her hemolysis laboratory values and renal function continued to improve. Four months after this event, the patient underwent an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant and has been in recovery since that time.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Carfilzomib-induced TMA is an uncommon but serious side effect in patients receiving carfilzomib for multiple myeloma. In a phase II study of single-agent carfilzomib in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, drug-associated TMA was not reported but drug-related anemia was reported in 46% of patients, thrombocytopenia was reported in 39% of patients, and acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported in 1.5% of patients . A phase III study comparing carfilzomib and dexamethasone versus bortezomib and dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma patients, the ENDEAVOR trial, reported TMA in two out of 463 patients . The CARDAMON study, a phase II trial of carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in untreated myeloma patients, reported TMA in eight out of 281 patients. ADAMTS13 activity was checked in seven of these eight patients, and all had normal activity . Lastly, Fotiou et al reported TMA in six out of 114 patients (5%) with relapsed and refractory myeloma multiple myeloma who received carfilzomib. Of these six patients, ADAMTS13 activity was evaluated in two patients and was normal . Therefore, carfilzomib-induced TMA must be on the differential diagnosis in a patient with multiple myeloma receiving carfilzomib who presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI. In addition to the complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), a peripheral blood smear should be ordered to evaluate for schistocytes which would indicate active microangiopathy. Other hemolysis laboratory tests like haptoglobin and LDH should also be ordered. Finally, urinalysis should be performed to check for proteinuria.\n\n【18】Recognition of TMA is critical since stopping carfilzomib is the first step in management and can prevent further kidney damage. However, this can be challenging because other causes of TMA must be ruled out. Rarely, patients with multiple myeloma can develop aHUS due to myeloma progression , which should also be taken into consideration. Several factors that support carfilzomib-induced aHUS in our patient include a history of carfilzomib treatment, eventual improvement with discontinuation of carfilzomib, lack of recurrence of TMA in the absence of carfilzomib, and ruling out other causes of TMA.\n\n【19】There is no consensus definition for TMA. Although several authors have proposed diagnostic criteria for TMA, the histologic findings of TMA on biopsy remains the gold standard . The kidney is the most often involved organ. However, renal biopsy is often not feasible due to the increased risk of bleeding from thrombocytopenia . In this report, our diagnosis of TMA was based on the laboratory findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, elevated LDH, negative direct and indirect Coombs tests, hypertension, and proteinuria. These findings would satisfy most criteria for TMA, including those recently proposed by Jodele et al .\n\n【20】Carfilzomib-induced TMA has been reported as early as 24 h and as late as 24 months after therapy . In this report, our patient presented on cycle 1, day 6. Carfilzomib was immediately stopped and supportive care with plasmapheresis was initiated while evaluation for the cause of the TMA was undertaken. ADAMTS13 activity > 10% ruled out TTP. There was a low clinical suspicion for primary HUS. Given the patient’s history, the diagnosis of carfilzomib-induced TMA was made. Complement level test was performed but can be difficult to interpret because complement levels can be normal in TMA . Genetic test for pathogenic complement gene variants and test for terminal complement activation (elevated sC5b-9 complex) was not performed in this case.\n\n【21】Recently, eculizumab has been identified as a lifesaving therapy for carfilzomib-induced TMA, especially in cases that do not improve after carfilzomib withdrawal . Rassner et al reported a case of two patients with carfilzomib-induced TMA that only improved with eculizumab . Likewise, Portuguese et al noted that in two patients the early initiation of eculizumab reduced the progression of carfilzomib-induced TMA . Our patient’s TMA appeared to be refractory to carfilzomib withdrawal and multiple apheresis procedures. There was no improvement in creatinine though there was some increase in the platelet count. However, the patient responded completely to eculizumab. There was a marked improvement in her renal function and platelet count, and her overall clinical picture improved within 2 weeks of eculizumab administration. The success of eculizumab in treating carfilzomib-induced TMA suggests a relationship between the mechanism of proteosome inhibition and complement pathway dysregulation.\n\n【22】Proteasome inhibitors are drugs that target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which results in a blockage of cell cycle progression and an antiproliferative activity against many tumor types . The transcription factor NF-κB is a regulatory protein whose mode of activation is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the resting cell state, NF-κB is bound to unphosphorylated IκB, thereby blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. When triggered by proinflammatory cytokines, inflammation, or stress, a signal cascade occurs which activates a multisubunit IκB kinase (IKK). Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB leading to its degradation through ubiquitination. This releases free NF-κB which can then translocate into the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of many proteins including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . Proteasome inhibitors prevent the ubiquitination of IκB, which prevents free release and activation of NF-κB and impairs the transcription of VEGF. Thus, a downstream effect of carfilzomib is inhibition of the VEGF pathway.\n\n【23】VEGF is most known for its critical role in angiogenesis, but a link between VEGF and complement regulation has been described. Keir et al demonstrated that VEGF inhibition decreases local CFH and other complement regulators in the eye and kidney through reduced VEGFR2/PKC-α/CREB signaling . In that study, human retinal epithelial cells and renal podocytes with pathogenic complement regulatory gene variants showed more complement deposits compared to controls. Additionally, the deposits were increased by VEGF antagonism. These results suggest that VEGF plays a role in protecting the renal microvasculature from complement damage.\n\n【24】Moscvin et al present additional evidence that alternative complement pathway mutations may be a risk factor for carfilzomib-induced TMA in multiple myeloma patients . In their abstract, deletions of the CFHR3 \\- CFHR5 region were present in seven out of 10 cases of carfilzomib-induced TMA. Two heterozygous and four homozygous complement pathway gene deletions were reported. Although the sample size is small, their results suggest that mutations in the alternative complement pathway increase the risk of TMA in multiple myeloma patients receiving carfilzomib. Similar findings were reported by Portuguese et al who found heterozygous CFHR3 \\- CFHR1 deletions in two patients with carfilzomib-induced TMA .\n\n【25】Taken together, these data suggest a multi-factorial mechanism for the pathogenesis of carfilzomib-induced TMA. The first risk factor is the multiple myeloma diagnosis, as multiple myeloma is an independent risk factor for TMA . Therefore, we must consider the underlying malignancy in these patients as a contributing factor. The second risk factor is the presence of mutations in the alternative complement pathway. Early studies suggest that alternative complement pathway gene mutations may play a role in carfilzomib-induced TMA . The final contributing factor is exposure to carfilzomib. When carfilzomib is given, there is reduced local VEGF production by renal epithelial cells. This results in reduced local complement regulatory proteins, which makes endothelial cells vulnerable to complement activation. Any combination of the above risk factors would effectively create a pro-TMA environment.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】Carfilzomib-induced TMA is an important adverse effect to recognize in patients receiving carfilzomib for multiple myeloma. Withdrawal of carfilzomib and treatment with eculizumab have proven successful in some patients. The mechanism of this adverse effect may be related to the compound effects of multiple myeloma, the presence of mutations in the alternative complement pathway, and the inhibitory effect of carfilzomib on VEGF, which results in local overactivation of complement in the glomerular endothelium. Further investigation into the mechanism of carfilzomib-induced TMA is required to better understand this rare but significant adverse effect.\n\n【28】Learning points\n\n【29】Carfilzomib-induced TMA should be in the differential diagnosis of a patient with multiple myeloma who is receiving carfilzomib and presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI. The success of eculizumab in treating carfilzomib-induced TMA suggests a pathogenesis involving the complement pathway. Risk factors for TMA in multiple myeloma patients receiving carfilzomib include the underlying multiple myeloma, mutations in the alternative complement pathway, and local complement dysregulation due to the mechanism of carfilzomib.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The most common type of soft tissue sarcoma is a liposarcoma that consists of four different subtypes . Myxoid liposarcomas are the second most common type of liposarcoma that frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decade of life with a propensity to present in men . The most prevalent area for this subtype of liposarcomas to develop is in the lower extremities . Liposarcomas rarely present in the back . We present a case of a 29-year-old woman found to have a myxoid liposarcoma located in her right lower back.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 29-year-old woman presented to the hospital for an elective excision on a soft, mobile mass located on her right lower back. The patient stated that the mass had been causing her discomfort and had been present for quite some time. The mass was excised and during the procedure was noted to be intramuscular. Upon biopsy results, the gross specimen was partially capsulated measuring 11.0 × 10.0 ×5.5 cm, tan-pink to brown in color with a smooth outer surface. The tumor extended into the margins of the excision. The mass consisted of mainly hypocellular, vaguely lobulated, proliferation of small ovoid to spindle cell admixed with scattered lipoblasts, in a background of abundant myxoid material and arborizing vascularity. At the periphery of the lobules, increased cellularity was noted with moderately increased cytological atypia. Mitotic activity was very rare and areas of round cell composed less than 5% of the total tumor. In many of the tumor cells, stain with p53 showed evidence of p53 overexpression. Stain with Ki-67 showed a proliferation index of 2-8%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was positive for detection of rearrangements of the DDIT3 ( CHOP ) gene at the 12q13 locus, consistent with the diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma. Following the diagnosis, the patient had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a resection scar along the right paraspinal musculature with no evidence of lymphadenopathy, lesions or pathology. Due to evidence of the tumor extension into the margins, the patient underwent re-excision at the previous resection site of the mass. The patient tolerated the procedure well and will be followed up for subsequent post-operative visits. The biopsy results of the re-excision revealed no evidence of residual myxoid liposarcoma.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Liposarcomas are one of the most common types of soft tissue sarcomas. According to the World Health Organization, there are four types. These subtypes are myxoid/round cell, pleomorphic, well differentiated and dedifferentiated . Of the four subtypes, myxoid liposarcomas account for about 20%. Myxoid liposarcomas typically present as a painless slow growing mass . They are frequently located in the intramuscular fascia, under or on muscle .\n\n【6】The most common area for myxoid/round cell liposarcomas to develop is in the lower extremities, which make up about 75-80% of cases. More specifically, about two-thirds of cases manifest in the thigh . In about 8% of cases they present in the retroperitoneum and 5% appear in the upper extremities . It is atypical for a liposarcoma to present in the back . To the best of our knowledge, no cases of primary myxoid liposarcomas subtype located in the lower back have been reported. We report a rare case of a myxoid liposarcoma presenting in the right lower back.\n\n【7】Histologically, this subtype exists on a spectrum with variable amounts of round cells. The existence of greater than 5% of round cells within the mass is associated with a poor prognosis and is considered high-grade . Approximately 95% of cases of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma subtype have a TLS-CHOP fusion gene on cytogenetic analysis . This fusion gene is specific for this subtype and is the result of t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation. It has been suggested to be a dysfunctional transcriptional regulator that interrupts differentiation of adipocytes resulting in proliferation . In our case, the mass was found to have this specific fusion gene. Seen in less than 5% of cases, EWS-CHOP fusion gene is a rare variant that has also been observed .\n\n【8】The standard of care for patient with local disease is wide local surgical resection with the confirmation of negative margins . Low-grade myxoid liposarcomas have a low local recurrence rate. At a 5-year follow-up, approximately 8% of diagnosed patients will have local disease recurrence . In comparison to other types of soft tissue sarcomas, myxoid liposarcoma is more radiosensitive . Adjuvant radiation is typically considered for patients who have considerable number of round cells composing the mass .\n\n【9】Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma has a tendency to metastasize to extrapulmonary sites, specifically, soft tissue and skeletal sites such as the mediastinum and the retroperitoneum . With the potential to metastasize to distant sites, prompt diagnosis as well as providing the best possible treatment options is critical .\n\n【10】Conclusions\n\n【11】This case illustrates the challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of these rare tumors. Myxoid liposarcomas should be included as a possible differential diagnosis in cases of soft tissue masses that present in the lower back. An early accurate diagnosis will not only result in appropriate treatment from the get-go, but also save both the patient and clinician valuable time and resources. Although a rare entity, considering myxoid liposarcoma in the diagnosis of soft tissue masses may prevent misdiagnosis and possibly alter the clinical approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Hypospadias is the second most common congenital malformation in males, and its incidence is 1/1,000 to 1/100 and changes according to the literature due to differences of ethnic origin and countries . There are four main factors contributing to this malformation: environment of child and mother, the endocrine and genetic background of the child, principally gonadal steroid synthesis and the genes of phallic development, the placenta which manages the hormones during the first part of gestation and the mother having possible disorders of hormonal production .\n\n【2】In this case report, we wanted to share three hypospadias cases that have prolonged to three generations including father and three sons with the literature.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Three brothers at the ages of 6, 17 and 19 years respectively, were applied by their father for circumsicion to our clinic. The socio-economic status of the father was the main reason for the delay of elder brothers’ circumcision. The mother was a housewife and she had never worked before. The father was a butcher. The 6-year-old brother had a history of left orchiopexy. We revealed midshaft hypospadias without chordee in three brothers at physical examination. The testes of three brothers were normal in terms of volume and location. The father also told us that he had the same disorder and our physical examination of the father supported hypospadias . Also according to the history taken from father, the grandfather had also hypospadias probably at the same localization. We performed tubularized incised urethral plate to these cases under general anesthesia.\n\n【5】All of the patients were pre-operatively evaluated with laboratory tests like complete blood count, serum biochemical analysis and testosteron and free testosteron. The results of these tests were normal.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】The prevalence of hypospadias varies considerably accross countries, ranging from 4 to 43 cases per 10,000 births . Blacks, Asians and Hispanics are less affected from hypospadias than whites . There is a dilemma about if the prevalence of hypospadias is increasing or not. Some authors reported increasing prevalence in China whereas others did not find an increase in the USA .\n\n【8】Hypospadias is mostly diagnosed during physical examination of the newborn, but localization is establised best during surgery after reconstruction of the chordee. Boys with hypospadias more often have additional congenital anomalies like undescended testes, chordee or more seriously ambigus genitalia, when compared with healthy children . The severity of hypospadias depends on the localization of the meatus. The more proximally localized meatus, the higher degree of congenital anomalies and severity. In our case report, the younger brother underwent left orchiopexy for left undecended testis, and the others had not any additional congenital anomalies.\n\n【9】Most hypospadias cases show spontaneous occurrence and have no clear cause because the genetic pathways of external genitalia formation are poorly understood . Familial tendency is associated with hypospadias, 7% of cases having first, second or third degree affected relatives . Like our cases, familial occurrence is more common for middle and anterior forms of hypospadias than posterior . The brother of an affected boy may also have hypospadias, and this rate is approximately 9-17% . This report also showed us that the heritability of hypospadias was estimated to be 57-77% . This means that 57-77% of the phenotipic variability may be attributed to genetics. The recurrence risks of sons and brothers of hypospadias cases are similar, and genetics factors rather than environmental factors may play the major role in familial cases . The genetic effect was too clear in our cases due to three generations hypospadias at the same localization. Also, we did not think any effects of chemical exposure to the family members, because of the job of the father and mother.\n\n【10】Several genetic variants carry an increased risk of hypospadias. These genes can be summarized as AR, SRD5A2, HSD17B3, ESR1, ESR2, ATF3, MAMAMLD1/CX or f6 . Immunohistochemical analysis on human preputium tissue revealed that most hypospadiac samples were positive for expression for ATF3 . Also in vitro and some animal studies confirmed this finding . Liu et al reported that fetal exposure to estrogen increased the level of ATF3 messenger RNA , whereas this group also indicated that fetal exposure to DEHP (di-2-ethylexyl phthalate) activated transcirption and transduciton of the ATF3 gene . According to our clinical findings, we believed that there should be a dominant gene responsible for hypospadias formation in this family, but due to technical reasons, we could not have a chance to evaluate preputial samples and blood of patients for expression of ATF3 gene and genetic mutations.\n\n【11】Occupational factors have been a major focus in hypospadias research. Especially exposure to pesticides has contradicting results. Giordano et al reported a possible increased risk for pesiticides in one study , besides this three studies focusing on paternal exposure to pesticides before pregnancy did not affect hypospadias . A recent meta-analysis about pesticle exposure indicated only a modestly increased risk of hypospadias . The genetic effect was too clear in our cases due to three generations hypospadias at the same localization. Also, we did not think any effects of chemical exposure to the family members, because of the job of the father and mother.\n\n【12】As a result, hypospadias is a complex congenital anomaly that could be affected by genetic and environmental factors. Herein, we presented three generations cases in a father, possibly grandfather and three sons with hypospadias at the same localization. It was a very different and interesting experience for our clinic to meet such a medical situation. In the light of these cases, we have thought that there should be a dominant gene responsible for formation of hypospadias. To the best of our knowledge, most of the data about hypospadias are depending on case reports, so in our opinion, urology field should focus on genetical studies concerning with familial tendency in hypospadias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "d1e9be6b-240a-457c-8b3d-ae0bc08c2f2c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Spinal anesthesia (SA) became a popular technique during the 1980s when it was used as an alternative to general anesthesia (GA) as a means of avoiding postoperative apnea in high-risk, former preterm neonates . However, with the introduction of sevoflurane into clinical practice, the risk of apnea was shown to be limited and interest in SA waned . More recently, there have been numerous reports in the literature regarding the potential long-term neurocognitive effects of GA during infancy and the neonatal period . While there is insufficient prospective evidence to clearly prove a causal relationship, there has been a renewed interest in the use of SA as a means of avoiding GA during the potentially vulnerable time period. Given its limited duration of action, single-shot SA is applicable only for surgical procedures that can be accomplished in less than 70 - 75 min. We present two infants in whom a combined SA with a caudal epidural catheter technique was used to provide surgical anesthesia for cases lasting more than 90 min. The technique is presented, its applications discussed, and previous reports from the literature regarding the combined use of spinal and epidural anesthesia in the pediatric population reviewed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for presentation of case series with two or fewer patients at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH).\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】At the time of the surgery, the patient was a 2-year-old, 11.2 kg boy scheduled for first stage hypospadias repair. He had no allergies. His medication history was significant only for albuterol and cetirizine, which he took for wheezing (reactive airway disease) and seasonal allergies, respectively. There was also a history of previous problems with general anesthesia and an unexplained cardiac arrest during an orchidopexy. Although a thorough post-procedure cardiac evaluation was negative, the patient’s parents were motivated to avoid GA for subsequent procedures. For this first stage hypospadias repair, SA alone would not be sufficient due to the length of the procedure. Informed consent was obtained for combined spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia with sedation. The patient’s vital signs on the morning of the procedure were unremarkable. In the preoperative area, LMX cream (4% topical lidocaine) was applied to the lumbar spine to minimize discomfort with placement of the spinal needle. After arrival to the operating room, the patient was placed in the sitting position. After sterile preparation, the intrathecal space was accessed on the first attempt using a 1.5 inch, 22-gauge spinal needle. Upon return of cerebrospinal fluid, 1.2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine-epinephrine 1:200,000 with clonidine (11 µg) was administered. Following successful SA, the patient was then placed in the supine position, standard monitors were placed, and a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the right foot. Immediate sensory and motor block were noted. A single dose of dexmedetomidine (total of 12 µg in divided doses) was administered intravenously for sedation during caudal epidural catheter placement. The patient was placed in right lateral decubitus position for caudal epidural catheter placement. After sterile preparation, the caudal epidural space was accessed using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle. A 20-gauge caudal catheter was advanced 3 cm into the epidural space to allow sacral coverage. The needle was removed and the catheter secured. A test dose of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 (1 mL) was negative. The patient was placed supine and the surgical procedure started under SA. Dexmedetomidine (0.5 - 1 µg/kg/h) was administered intravenously for intraoperative sedation. Approximately 1 h after the start of the surgical procedure, the caudal catheter was dosed with 3% chloroprocaine (1 mL/kg) followed by a continuous infusion of 3% chloroprocaine (1.5 mL/kg/h). The surgery was completed with excellent operating conditions. The patient was hemodynamically stable and required no supplemental oxygen throughout the procedure, which lasted approximately 2 h. The caudal catheter was removed in the operating room following completion of the surgery. The patient’s post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay was uncomplicated and he was discharged home that afternoon without incident. The parents were very satisfied with the care of their son, and they requested the same approach for his second-stage hypospadias repair, which was also performed successfully.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】At the time of the surgery, the patient was a 16-month-old, 8.75 kg girl scheduled for bilateral ureteral reimplantation. The patient had a known history of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) status post repair, grade 4 primary vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent pyelonephritis, and difficult postoperative pain management. She had no allergies. Her medication history was significant only for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for urinary tract infection prophylaxis. Preoperative laboratory studies were not performed and her vital signs on the morning of the procedure were unremarkable. An echocardiogram performed 2 months before the surgery revealed findings typical for a patient that had undergone TOF repair with normal biventricular function. The patient had previously received GA uneventfully, but her parents desired avoidance of GA due to her history of congenital heart disease. Informed consent was obtained for combined spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia. In the preoperative area, LMX cream (4% topical lidocaine) was applied to the lumbar to minimize discomfort with the placement of the spinal needle. After arrival to the operating room, the patient was placed in the sitting position. After sterile preparation, the intrathecal space was accessed on the first attempt using a 1.5 inch, 22-gauge spinal needle. Upon return of cerebrospinal fluid, 1.2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was administered. Following successful SA, the patient was placed in the supine position, standard monitors were placed, and a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the left foot. Immediate sensory and motor block were noted. The patient was then placed in the right lateral decubitus position for caudal epidural catheter placement. After sterile preparation, the caudal epidural space was accessed using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was advanced 5 cm into the epidural space to allow for a T10-12 blockade. The needle was removed and the catheter secured. A test dose of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 (1 mL) was negative. For the first 40 min of the procedure, the patient slept comfortably without need for additional medications. After 40 min, dexmedetomidine (8 µg) was administered intravenously for irritability with good effect. At 1 h post-incision, 0.2% ropivacaine (6 mL) was administered via the caudal epidural catheter and another dose of dexmedetomidine (4 µg) was administered intravenously. The procedure, which lasted approximately 2 h, was completed successfully. The patient was hemodynamically stable and required no supplemental oxygen throughout the operation. The caudal epidural catheter was removed in the operating room following completion of the surgery. Her PACU stay was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to home the next morning without incident.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Our institution has developed a SA program to offer an alternative to GA for appropriate cases in light of concerns related to potential anesthetic neurotoxicity. Although the use of continuous SA, continuous caudal anesthesia, and SA combined with epidural anesthesia have been previously described , the majority of these reports have used the technique for avoidance of GA in a high-risk child . Our goal with the reported technique (SA plus placement of a caudal epidural catheter) was to develop a technique that could be offered as a viable alternative to GA for longer surgical procedures, especially given recent concerns of the potential long term neurocognitive effects of general anesthetic agents. The spinal plus caudal epidural catheter technique can be used to circumvent the temporal limitations of SA, and in theory can be used for any length surgical procedure. Herein we report our successful experience with the technique in two infants to illustrate the technical aspects of the procedure as well as options for medication dosing.\n\n【10】Although SA in children is a relatively simple, elegant technique, it is not without limitations. As it is a single-shot technique, it can only be used for procedures that last approximately 1 hour . Adjunctive agents such as epinephrine or clonidine can be added to the local anesthetic agent that may extend that duration 20-30%, but the upper limit of duration remains 70 - 75 minutes . Additionally, SA is generally reserved for pelvic and lower abdominal procedures. With this combined technique, it may be possible to perform more cephalad surgeries because a higher level of surgical anesthesia is possible with more cephalad placement of the tip of the epidural catheter.\n\n【11】In addition to avoiding potential neurotoxicity, SA provides several advantages over GA. SA provides superior intraoperative hemodynamic stability (decreased hypotension and bradycardia) when compared to GA . Additionally, SA has been shown to lead to more effective blunting of the surgical stress response, lack of a need for airway management or supplemental oxygen, and limited need for parenteral opioids . While SA has typically been limited to procedures lasting less than 70 - 75 minutes, this report presents an effective technique combining spinal and caudal epidural anesthesia for two prolonged urologic procedures lasting more than 90 min. Combining methods of regional anesthesia can provide a surgical team with an extended window of time to perform surgical procedures. Furthermore, the surgical anesthesia provided by the initial SA provides effective anesthesia for placement of the caudal epidural catheter without the need for additional agents. Given the prolonged duration of the procedure, as noted in both of our patients, supplemental sedation may be required during the procedure given the cognitive level and limited ability of infants and children to remain quiet for a 2-h surgical procedure. Our experience with the technique and its efficacy have allowed us to expand its application outside of the neonatal and infant age range as our patients were 2 years and 16 months of age, respectively. Key to the success of this regional instead of general anesthesia program has been the cooperation of a well-trained, multidisciplinary team of surgeons, pediatric anesthesiologists, and nurses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of GC varies from 2% to 29.6% of all cases of acute cholecystitis and is associated with significantly greater morbidity and mortality .\n\n【2】Risk factors for GC include diabetes mellitus, advanced age, male sex, leucocytosis, history of coronary artery disease, critical illness and a high C-reactive protein (CRP) .\n\n【3】Forty-eight percent of patients with histologically proven GC have little or no evidence to suggest this disease process pre-operatively. Once suspected, patients with GC should undergo urgent or emergency cholecystectomy in order to avoid potentially life-threatening complications .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 50-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted with severe right upper quadrant pain of 3 days duration, which worsened on the day of admission and was associated with nausea, anorexia and fever.\n\n【6】On initial examination, the patient had a sinus tachycardia of 113 bpm, observations were otherwise normal and he was apyrexic. The patient was markedly tender over the right upper quadrant and Murphy’s sign was positive. Laboratory investigations revealed a leucocytosis of 17.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, a CRP of 80 mg/L, a bilirubin of 12.4, a Gamma-glutamyltransferase of 12, an alkaline phosphatase of 69 IU/L, and an amylase of 35. The patient was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and commenced on IV co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TID.\n\n【7】An ultrasound abdomen performed on the morning after admission demonstrated calculi within the gallbladder, a thickened gallbladder wall with pericholecystic fluid but no common bile duct dilatation.\n\n【8】The patient completed a 5-day course of IV co-amoxiclav with complete resolution of his symptoms and he was discharged home with normal inflammatory markers to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a later date.\n\n【9】An elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed 6 weeks after discharge, by which time the patient was asymptomatic and was systemically well. Admission observations were normal as were pre-operative bloods.\n\n【10】During the laparoscopy, the fundus of the gallbladder was found to be gangrenous and covered by adherent omentum. The omenal adhesions were gently freed revealing an entirely necrotic gallbladder fundus . The cystic duct and artery were identified and clipped and the gallbladder dissected off the liver bed. The procedure was completed laparoscopically without complication. The patient was discharged home on day 1 post-operatively on a 5-day course of oral co-amoxiclav following advice from the microbiology department.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Acute cholecystitis is the most common complication of cholelithiasis occurring in approximately 1-2% of asymptomatic patients annually .\n\n【13】The primary etiology of acute cholecystitis is obstruction of the cystic duct secondary to an impacted stone. In approximately 80% of patients, the impacted stone dislodges allowing for initial conservative non-operative management. However, in approximately 2-29.6% of patients, the disease processes to GC.\n\n【14】The etiology of GC is primarily vascular compromise secondary to sustained obstruction of the cystic duct. The persistent obstruction of the cystic duct results in marked distension of the gallbladder with increased tension in the gallbladder wall and resultant epithelial injury. As a result of the epithelial injury, phospholipases are released that degrade adjacent cell membranes leading to an intense inflammatory reaction. It is the combination of increased gallbladder wall tension and the intense inflammatory reaction that results in either local or global gallbladder wall ischemia and subsequently to ischemic necrosis of the gallbladder wall .\n\n【15】GC is associated with a significantly greater morbidity and mortality when compared to uncomplicated acute cholecystitis . In spite of its grave prognosis, the diagnosis of GC can be elusive, both clinically and biochemically, with 48% of patients demonstrating histologically proven GC displaying no evidence to suggest this disease process pre-operatively. It is often only considered after deterioration of a patient suspected of having uncomplicated cholecystitis.\n\n【16】Many factors have been implicated in the formation of GC, including diabetes mellitus, age ≥ 51 years, male sex, leucocytosis (WCC > 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> ), history of coronary artery disease; other associated risk factors include critical illness and a high CRP.\n\n【17】Due to the associated increased morbidity and mortality, several authors have advocated emergency cholecystectomy for GC. There is controversy regarding the best surgical approach for GC. Some surgeons would opt for open cholecystectomy for most men over the age of 60 years who have significant comorbidity, large gallstones and a raised bilirubin level; however, in the hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be used safely and successfully in patients with GC .\n\n【18】Complications associated with GC include perforation, which has been reported to occur in up to 10% of cases of acute cholecystitis. It is therefore vital to diagnose and surgically treat GC prior to perforation to avoid the associated morbidity and mortality.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】When managing a patient with acute cholecystitis, a high index of suspicion is essential for the possibility of GC, especially in a diabetic and elderly patient even if the patient appears to be improving clinically and in the presence of normalising laboratory investigations. Radiological investigations may not conclusively demonstrate GC.\n\n【21】There is a need to consider early or emergency cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) in these patients due to the high risk of gangrenous transformation with possibility of gallbladder perforation and a resultant increased morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They represent 5-10% of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) and can occur either spontaneously or in association with type 1 neurofibromatosis . Those involving intrathoracic nerves and located at the anterior and middle mediastinum are even more exceptional . To the best of our knowledge, few cases of MPNSTs arising from the phrenic nerve have been described in the literature .\n\n【2】MPNSTs are very aggressive tumors with high recurrence rate after excision and increased risk of distant metastasis. Their prognosis is poor with a 5-year overall survival of 50% . Complete surgical resection with safe margins remains the treatment of choice. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiation has been proven to be a significant treatment tool in several series. Chemotherapy can be used as adjuvant treatment, but its efficacy has not been proven. It can be useful for metastatic disease or in neoadjuvant setting for large and unresectable tumors . In this report, an unusual case of MPNST arising from phrenic nerve is described. A particular therapeutic approach is presented here, with relevant literature review. Multimodal treatment including preoperative chemotherapy, wide local resection with safe margins and adjuvant radiation, constitutes a successful management of this unresectable MPNST. Complete surgical resection is the best indicator of good prognosis .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 77-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, dry cough and right-sided chest pain for the previous 6 months. On physical examination, breath sounds were decreased on the right side. The skin examination showed no “cafe au lait” spots or subcutaneous tumors.\n\n【5】Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a well circumscribed heterogenous mass of the anterior mediastinum lateralized to the right measuring 11 cm in major axis without compression of the superior vena. This mass presents close contact with the ascending aorta and the right atrium with obvious pericardial thickening . An interventional radiologist performed a transthoracic needle core biopsy, which revealed a mesenchymal lesion. An anterior mediastinotomy (Chamberlain procedure) was then performed to obtain adequate tissue for a precise diagnosis. On microscopic examination, the tumor consisted of neoplastic spindle cell proliferation arranged in interlacing bundles with large and irregular nuclei and frequent mitoses (around 10 mitoses per 10 fields) . Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed. The panel of monoclonal antibodies consisted of cytokeratin 5, 6, 7, and 20, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, CD-117, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD-34, and S-100 protein. Tumor cells were positive for vimentin strongly  and uniformly and negative for PS100 and other markers. This morphological and immunohistochemical aspect was compatible with high-grade MPNST. After pathological diagnosis was established, whole body CT scan was performed but did not reveal any tumor. The tumor was considered unresectable and the patient received three cycles of chemotherapy based on adriamycin 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Chest CT scan performed thereafter showed partial response consisting of 30% decrease of the tumor volume allowing complete surgical excision of the tumor .\n\n【6】Right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed over the fifth rib using double-lumen endotracheal tube to permit unilateral deflation of the right lung. Surgical exploration revealed firm, irregular, and completely encapsulated mass involving the right phrenic nerve, with conservation of the cleavage plane with the trachea, the superior vena cava, the ascending thoracic aorta, and lung. The tumor was completely resected and partial resection of the right phrenic nerve was performed ensuring R0 surgery .\n\n【7】Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of MPNST originating from the right intrathoracic phrenic nerve in an old female patient with no clinical evidence of Von Recklinghausen disease. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis were seen.\n\n【8】The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Six weeks later, the patient underwent adjuvant three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation to the surgical bed at the dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with mild acute side effects and overall a very good tolerance.\n\n【9】The patient remained free of recurrence 3 years after her treatment.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】There are two main reasons to present this interesting case report. First is the unusual demographics and location of MPNST in our patient . Second one is the successful management with multimodal therapy, which suggests probable benefit of preoperative chemotherapy in some patients .\n\n【12】MPNST of the intrathoracic phrenic nerve is a malign neurogenic tumor that arises from the nerve sheath and can involve the middle or anterior mediastinum. Although there have been few reports of the thoracic location of this neoplasm, most of them are located at the posterior mediastinum in the paravertebral gutters . MPNSTs of the phrenic nerve have been described previously, but they appear to be even rarer than neurofibromas, with less than 20 cases reported in the English literature .\n\n【13】MPNSTs are typically seen in patients between 20 and 50 years old, although occasional cases may be seen in the elderly population. Known main risk factors include previous radiation exposure (either therapeutic or environmental), pre-existing neurofibromas, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (Von Recklinghausen disease), which is the most important risk factor, accounting for almost 50% of patients with MPNST . In our case, the patient is female, 77 years old. The site of the injury is the phrenic nerve and the patient has no sign of neurofibromatosis-1.\n\n【14】Diagnosis is particularly difficult because of the variable pathological presentation and unpredictable differentiation. The clinical features depend on the site, size, and malignant potential of the tumor . Most of these tumors occurring inside the chest or abdomen take longer for the symptoms to express and in many cases discovery is delayed, meaning that the tumor grows and in many cases can no longer be completely excised upon discovery, or may be inoperable. These tumors are often found incidentally at standard chest X-ray . Phrenic nerve tumors should be suggested in front of any rounded mass opposite the path of the nerve and should not be confused with primary cardiac tumors. In our case, there were some symptoms such as chest pain, cough, and dyspnea related to the mass effect.\n\n【15】The microscopic diagnosis of MPNSTs is difficult because of their cellular origin and histopathological similarities with other spindle cell sarcomas like monophasic synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma . Thus, a combination of gross, histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies are used for diagnosing these tumors. Malignancy is retained on cell pleomorphism, high number of mitosis and capsular infiltration . Also, the lack of well-delimited borders and encapsulation, invasion signs, significant atypia and necrosis suggest malignancy. Large areas of necrosis and high mitotic activity are typical .\n\n【16】IHC guides the diagnosis but is not specific. In contrast to benign and locally aggressive schwannomas, which demonstrate uniform immunoreactivity for S-100 protein, malignant entity may show patchy or absent immunoreactivity for this antigen . In our case, IHC showed intense positivity to vimentin and negativity to PS100. Diagnosis was based on both morphological and immunohistochemical aspects which were compatible with high-grade MPNST.\n\n【17】Full assessment is required before starting treatment. The minimum requirements for staging include chest imaging by CT scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are necessary to localize the tumor accurately, and to provide information about tumor size and involvement of adjacent organs, and help in surgical planning. Although there is significant overlap between imaging features of large benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. MPNST should be suspected if there is heterogeneous density, focal areas of central necrosis, ill-defined borders, rapid growth on interval imaging, invasion of surrounding soft tissues, and destruction of surrounding bone structures . MPNSTs have metastatic potential, which requires distant workup staging . Metastatic spread is hematogenous and metastatic locations are diverse. In our case, the antero-inferior mediastinal tumor appears to be of inhomogeneous density with enhancement of the periphery and the central portion without any detected metastasis.\n\n【18】Prognostic factors are tumor size, grade of malignancy, speed of clinical evolution, degree of cellular pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Prognosis is usually poor, especially in large invasive tumors, those related to NF1, and those with high-grade histologic features .\n\n【19】The mainstay of therapy of MPNST is complete surgical resection with negative margins . MPNSTs are biologically aggressive in nature with rapid progression, and then surgery must be planned as soon as the pathological diagnosis has been made. Moreover, surgery should preferably be performed by specialized surgeons in the management of sarcomas; this could ensure higher rates of complete surgical resection which is the best indicator of good prognosis. Currently the introduction into clinical practice of additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy can improve immediate and long-term treatment results of such patients .\n\n【20】The use of pre- or postoperative adjuvant therapy is not yet well codified. Adjuvant radiotherapy to the tumor bed and possibly other sites of bulky may be beneficial in preventing local tumor relapse. It may be a very useful therapy to improve local control . In our patient, MPNST was identified in the anterior mediastinum extending behind the right anterior chest wall with suspicious invasion of its surrounding capsule. Complete wide excision of the mass was done with parietal resection and finally negative margins were obtained. Adjuvant radiotherapy to the tumor bed was indicated to ensure local control and to decrease any chance of further relapse. Our patient is still asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence so far.\n\n【21】Recurrences of MPNST are associated with poor prognosis. Zou et al reported that MPNST recurrences are strongly associated with positive surgical margins, poorly sensitive to chemotherapy and relatively more radioresistant .\n\n【22】There are few data regarding the efficacy of chemotherapy on MPNSTs. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered in case of unresectable disease, or when tumor excision requires mutilating surgery. It is based on anthracycline-based chemotherapy, whether or not combined with external radiotherapy, possibly in concomitant treatment.\n\n【23】The role of chemotherapy in advanced MPNST is unclear. Most MPNSTs are biologically high-grade sarcomas that tend to recur (40-65%) and metastasize (40-80%) most commonly to the lungs . A retrospective study compared the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and/or ifosfamide  in patients with MPNST (175 patients) with those with other types of STSs (2,500 patients). This study did not show any difference between the two groups in terms of objective response (21% and 22% respectively), progression-free survival (17 and 16 weeks), or overall survival (48 and 51 weeks). However, treatment with combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide achieved higher response rate (not specified in the article) than that obtained with doxorubicin alone, but without overall survival improvement.\n\n【24】Only one prospective phase II study specifically looked at the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic MPNST . Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of a combination with adriamycin/ifosfamide, followed by two cycles of combination with etoposide/ifosfamide. Forty-eight patients (33 MPNSTs on NF1 and 15 sporadic) were included. This treatment produced a response rate of 17.2% for patients with NF1 and 33.3% for sporadics. In addition, this study highlights the potential role of etoposide in the treatment of MPNST.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】The addition of our case to the literature offers new clinicopathological data useful for better defining the diagnosis and biological behavior of MPNST. The purpose of presenting this case is not only to report an uncommon tumor but also to raise awareness among clinicians adding this clinical entity as a differential diagnosis when a mediastinal anterior mass is identified. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be considered in locally advanced disease to obtain complete resection. Better knowledge of these tumors, particularly of their molecular origins, should allow their classification and therefore their treatment to evolve.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Our experience might give empirical information about the utility of two important diagnostic tools: the echocardiography, useful to accidentally identify the mediastinal mass and to follow up its consequences on cardiac haemodynamic, and the cardiac magnetic resonance, useful to provide information about the mass dimension and the contiguity relationship.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We describe the case of a 29-year-old woman at the 27th week of gestation that was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea, chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and fatigue. Physical examination was unremarkable except for an area of hypophonesis on the left basal lung compatible with pleural effusion and a tracheal murmur at the level of C7. An echocardiogram showed the presence of pericardial effusion (max 17 mm) and revealed an echogenic mass, before the right ventricle, in the mediastinum with a disomogeneous echogenicity . In the suspicion of a mediastinal tumor, a chest X ray and subsequently a cardiac MRI were performed, this last better defined the mass dimension and its contiguity relationship and confirmed the suspicion of a lymphoproliferative disease . A biopsy was performed for the mass characterization and revealed an infiltrating non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma at B big cells; chemotherapy was started. Following the mother willing and inaccordance with a team of experts, it was planned to wait as much as possible for a safe caesarean delivery. Meanwhile the mother clinical and hemodynamic conditions and the fetus growth were monitored. Pericardial fluid and mass influences on cardiac hemodynamic were followed up by echocardiography until the 30th week of gestation when the instabilization of mother’s clinical condition requested the interruption of pregnancy. The caesarean delivery succeeded excellently; the newborn was vital and normal for the gestation time. Through a transternal thoracothomy, after debriging of mediastinal, pulmonar, vascular and cardiac structures, the mass was excised.\n\n【4】The patient was discharged after ten days, up to today, after 6 months since surgery, results are quite satisfying; it has been observed a reduction of mass dimension and a subjective wellness of the mother, the baby is doing very well.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma during pregnancy is quite rare and often has a poor prognosis . The tumor growth may be favoured by hormonal and immunitary changes typical of pregnancy. In most of cases they are low grade of differentiation lymphoma and they present mediastinal localization . Among these, the primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, known as PMLBCL, is the rarest and its prognosis is controversial . Diagnosis is often difficult because symptoms may be late and secondary to compression and infiltration of the nearer structures. The most frequent symptoms are dyspnea, cough, chest pain, compression of the superior vena cava, Corner syndrome, Pancoast syndrome, disphonia, palpitations, pleural effusion, and sometimes also cardiac tamponade .\n\n【7】There are no clear guidelines in the literature about the treatment of lymphoma inpregnancy. Some reports have documented the usefulness of biopsy for mass characterizationduring the gestation and others have documented the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy during pregnancy . Echocardiography was a non-invasive, repeatable diagnostic tool able to identify the presence of the mediastinal mass and to follow up its consequences on cardiac hemodynamic. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed safety after the third trimester without producing apparent problems in the newborn. It helped for the diagnosis in giving information especially on the mass dimension and its contiguity relationship but did not characterize the mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Following successful coronary intervention and reperfusion of the occluded vessel, the coronary collaterals can no longer be angiographically visualized . We report a case of a patient with acute STEMI who was found to have spontaneous disappearance of angiographically detected coronary collaterals during a cardiac catheterization procedure without coronary intervention.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 71-year-old woman presented to the emergency department following the sudden onset of chest pain. The pain began 30 min prior to arriving in the emergency department and was located in the mid chest area with radiation to the left chest, shoulder and back. The patient had no previous history of known cardiac disease and no previous symptoms of chest pain. During the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient had noted occasional symptoms of exertional dyspnea, but no symptoms of shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She had noted occasional symptoms of palpitations during the past several weeks, but no episodes of lightheadedness, syncope or near-syncope. The patient’s cardiac risk factors included a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, exposure to tobacco products and a family history of coronary disease. Medications prior to admission included a beta blocker agent, a statin medication, aspirin and metformin. She had no history of surgical procedures in the past.\n\n【4】On presentation to the emergency department, the blood pressure was 109/65 mm Hg, the pulse rate was 88 per minute and the respiratory rate was 18 per minute. The neck was supple, with no jugular venous distention. The lungs were clear to auscultation. On cardiac examination, there was a regular rhythm with soft systolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. On extremity examination, there was no pedal edema and pedal pulses were palpable bilaterally.\n\n【5】The initial 12-lead electrocardiogram  showed ST segment elevation of the inferior leads, most pronounced in leads III and AVF, which had 2 mm of elevation and reciprocal ST segment depression of as much as 4 mm in the precordial leads V2 through V4. A single view chest radiograph showed borderline cardiac enlargement and clear lung fields. Initial laboratory examination included normal electrolyte, creatinine and complete blood count values, with a mildly elevated troponin-I level of 0.074 ng/mL (reference range: 0.000 - 0.056 ng/mL). The patient was brought urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. After obtaining femoral arterial access, a left coronary diagnostic catheter was introduced and left coronary angiography was performed in multiple projections . The left main and non-dominant left circumflex coronary arteries were angiographically normal, while a moderate lesion was present within the proximal anterior descending artery estimated at 50% diameter narrowing. Well-defined coronary collateral circulation to the right coronary artery was visualized. The collateral vessels arose from the anterior descending artery and resulted in retrograde filling of the dominant right coronary artery to the mid segment of the right coronary artery. A right coronary guiding catheter was then introduced. The right coronary angiogram, performed in multiple projections , surprisingly revealed an entirely normal dominant right coronary artery, without angiographic evidence of stenosis, plaque or intracoronary thrombus. The left coronary diagnostic catheter was then reintroduced, and the left coronary angiogram was repeated . The collateral circulation to the right coronary artery was no longer detected. Left ventriculography was then performed in the right anterior oblique projection, utilizing a pigtail catheter. Mild hypokinesis of the inferior left ventricular segment was observed with an estimated ejection fraction of 50%.\n\n【6】The patient was treated with the addition of clopidogrel and amlodipine to the medication regimen, increased doses of statin and beta blocker agents, and continuation of aspirin. She progressed satisfactorily following hospital admission, with no further symptoms of chest pain and no observed arrhythmias on cardiac monitoring. A clinical and laboratory evaluation for collagen vascular abnormalities or hyper-coagulable predisposition was unrevealing.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Our patient’s clinical presentation, including findings on electrocardiogram and troponin-I level, was consistent with acute STEMI. The initial left coronary angiogram demonstrated the presence of collateral circulation from the left coronary arterial system to the dominant right coronary artery. It has been demonstrated that the angiographic appearance of coronary collateral vessels is indicative of a 99% or 100% coronary artery occlusion . It therefore appears evident that, at the time of our patient’s left coronary angiogram, the right coronary artery was totally or sub-totally occluded. This suggested right coronary artery occlusion is consonant with our patient’s clinical presentation of acute inferior STEMI.\n\n【9】Several minutes after performance of left coronary angiography, selective right coronary angiography demonstrated entirely normal right coronary findings. The absence of right coronary occlusion at this time was confirmed by the subsequent repeat left coronary angiogram, which no longer showed the presence of coronary collateral vessels. It would appear that these “vanishing” coronary collaterals corresponded to the resolution of total or near-total right coronary artery occlusion.\n\n【10】Our patient’s acute myocardial infarction in the presence of a right coronary artery that was normal at the time of selective coronary injection is consistent with the phenomenon of myocardial infarction with angiographically normal coronary arteries. A retrospective analysis of patients with proven myocardial infarction demonstrated that 1.1% of patients had no luminal irregularities at the time of coronary angiography . The proposed mechanisms for myocardial infarction in the presence of normal coronary arteries include coronary thrombus formation with subsequent spontaneous lysis and coronary vasospasm leading to transient coronary artery occlusion . Both of these processes are compatible with the angiographic findings in our patient. Other reported causes of myocardial infarction without detectable coronary disease, including apical ballooning syndrome, cocaine abuse, viral myocarditis, aortic dissection, and autoimmune vasculitis  are inconsistent with our patient’s clinical history and findings.\n\n【11】Although the precise etiology of our patient’s unusual findings of “vanishing coronary collaterals” remains uncertain, we have elected to continue empiric treatment for both the possibility of transient intracoronary thrombus and coronary vasospasm with a post-hospital discharge regimen that includes a calcium channel blocking agent and dual anti-platelet medication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Studies have shown that 50-66% of healthy dogs carry the organism in their nasal secretions . Animal bites or scratches have been shown to cause P. multocida associated cellulitis, pneumonia, bacteremia and even acute septic arthritis in humans .\n\n【2】Prosthetic joint infection following an animal bite caused by P. multocida is rare with very few infections in replacement knee and hip joints being reported in the literature in the 10 years up to 2010 . The majority of cases reported resulted in replacement or removal of the prosthetic joint and all required prolonged antibiotic treatment. One case has been reported where P. multocida was isolated from the hip aspirate of a 48-year-old woman with long-term bilateral hip replacements after being bitten by a cat . The patient ultimately underwent a one-stage revision left hip and made a full recovery after a further 6 weeks antibiotic treatment. Prosthetic hip infection caused by P. multocida was also reported in a 57-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate . She presented with pyrexia and leg cellulitis and tender swollen lymph nodes after being scratched by a cat 24 h earlier. Initial intravenous antibiotic treatment failed to clear the infection and she had to undergo a two-stage revision of her hip. A further two cases of P. multocida prosthetic hip joint with infections following cat scratches, have been reported both of which required joint replacement .\n\n【3】We report a case of a prosthetic joint infection following a cat bite treated with incision, drainage and washout, followed by antibiotics.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 74-year-old woman presented to the medical admissions unit of the Royal Gwent Hospital with pain on mobilization so severe that she required intravenous morphine. Her past medical history included osteoporosis and osteoarthritis which required bilateral total hip primary replacements in 1988 and a revision of her left hip in 1999. She was not on any steroid treatment or immunosuppressive therapy. On examination she was apyrexial, with a normal respiratory and cardiovascular examination. She did, however, have a marked erythema on her left foot extending up to just below her knee and a puncture wound on the lateral side of the leg. The range of movement in her left leg was severely restricted by pain. She reported to have been bitten by her cat 4 days previously, apparently jealous, as she had returned home after being taken out for a Mother’s Day lunch by her family. Chest and limb X-rays were all normal but her CRP was 136 mg/L, and she had a raised neutrophil count of 8.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /mL. A diagnosis of septic arthritis was made, and she was started on intravenous benzyl penicillin 1.2 g and flucloxacillin 2 g both four times daily. She underwent a left hip washout under general anesthesia and 10 mL of frank pus was removed. Her antibiotics were changed to IV co-amoxiclav 1.2 g and metronidazole 500 mg both three times daily the day after her washout. P. multocida sensitive to amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin was isolated from the hip pus, and the patient was switched to ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily plus intravenous amoxicillin 2 g four times daily on micro-biology advice. She received 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by a further 6 weeks of oral amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. Eleven days after her hip washout the patient was mobilizing well, and her CRP had fallen to 62 mg/L. A follow-up X-ray 6 months after the initial presentation is shown in Figure 1 which indicates no evidence of joint loosening or residual infection. The patient reported at that time that the cat had found a new home.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Prosthetic joint infection following a cat scratch or bite with P. multocida , although rare, usually leads to the loss of the prosthetic joint. Most of the cases reported in the literature have involved prosthetic knee replacements, but a few cases involving hip joint infections have been reported as well. Joint infection was the result of distal spread of the organism and seeding into the prosthetic joint. It is essential therefore to highlight the importance of prompt medical review for anyone with a prosthetic joint who is subject to an animal bite or scratch. It would be interesting to compare the incidence of animal bite associated cellulitis and secondary joint infections in patients with and without prosthetic joint as it is likely that the relative risk of developing a joint infection is higher in people with prosthetic joints. The P. multocida isolated in our case was sensitive to amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. Given the high risk of loss of the prosthetic joint, we chose to treat the infection with 2 weeks intravenous amoxicillin plus oral ciprofloxacin followed by a further 6 weeks of oral amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin (although there are established guidelines for treating prosthetic joint infections, these do not specifically deal with zoonotic infections). The joint was washed out but no revision or major debridement was needed as there was no evidence of joint loosening. This may be related to the early presentation, diagnosis and treatment received by her. She remains well with a CRP of less than 5 mg/L, pain free and mobile, 2 months following the infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The vast majority of UEDVT arise secondary to central venous catheters or access devices. Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS), formation of venous thrombosis due to mechanical compression of the subclavian vein by anatomic abnormalities or upper chest muscular hypertrophy, is an uncommon cause of primary UEDVT. Typically occurring in young, healthy males, the diagnosis often goes unrecognized and can result in serious complications if overlooked. Here we report a case of Paget-Schroetter syndrome resulting in pulmonary embolus.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department with three days of swelling and erythema of the right upper extremity. There was no history of trauma, fever, pain, or neurologic compromise. Chest x-ray was within normal limits. Venous doppler ultrasonography demonstrated right subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis. CT angiography illustrated bilateral pulmonary emboli . Systemic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin infusion and oral warfarin therapy was initiated.\n\n【4】Echocardiogram did not demonstrate right ventricular dysfunction. Initial venography demonstrated occlusive thrombus in the axillary and subclavian veins . The patient underwent mechanical thrombectomy followed by six hours of tissue-plasminogen activator infusion. Post-procedure CT angiography showed reduction of thrombi though persistent stenosis of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular junction. The patient subsequently underwent first rib resection and scalenectomy for presumed Paget-Schroetter syndrome. Post-procedure CT venogram demonstrated occlusive thrombosis extending from the right axillary vein to the right subclavian vein . Repeat thrombectomy and thrombolysis led to resolution of thrombus, however there was persistent significant stenosis in the right mid-subclavian vein . Venoplasty and stenting was performed with successful resolution of stenosis . The patient was subsequently discharged home on systemic anticoagulation.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Paget-Schroetter syndrome is an uncommon cause of UEDVT. The syndrome usually presents in healthy young males as upper extremity edema, pain and erythema. It most commonly occurs in the setting of vigorous activity; rarely, a specific precipitating event cannot be ascertained . In this patient population, aggressive diagnostic evaluation should be performed, as surgical correction of anatomic abnormalities can be curative. Initial diagnostic modality includes venous doppler ultrasonography to detect thrombosis and obstruction. This should be followed by chest CT to detect bony abnormalities. It is imperative to maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion, as often these testing modalities are equivocal. Conventional venoangiography is often necessary as the gold standard for diagnosis . It is also important to assess the contralateral extremity as obstruction frequently occurs bilaterally .\n\n【7】Numerous predisposing congenital anatomical anomalies are associated with the syndrome, including cervical ribs, extra ribs, scalene muscle hypertrophy, or abnormal muscle tendon insertion sites . Patients may also develop venous compression through repetitive movements, or from bony rib trauma. These movements cause continual venous injury and results in expansive fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia . This fibrosis occurs both within the vein itself as well as around the vessel, causing contraction and venous blood flow stasis . Recurrent injury leads to initiation of the coagulation cascade thrombosis . Anatomic abnormalities may also reduce mobility of the subclavian vein, further predisposing to obstruction and thrombosis . In the patient discussed above, his first rib anatomy as well as scalene muscle hypertrophy presumably resulted in venous compression and development of PSS.\n\n【8】Complications of PSS include pulmonary emboli and post-thrombotic syndrome . Post thrombotic syndrome develops from thrombosis induced venous valvular injury resulting in valvular incompetence . It can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, pain, edema, and hyperpigmentation . Approximately 10 of patients with PSS develop pulmonary embolus .\n\n【9】Management of this complex disorder requires a multidisciplinary and should include Internists, Thoracic Surgery, and Interventional Radiology. Consultation with a Hematologist is often helpful for ruling out alternative thrombophilias. Conventional systemic anticoagulation is a cornerstone of initial therapy. In order to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome, definitive thrombotic therapy is often necessary utilizing both mechanical thrombectomy and pharmacologic thrombolysis . Definitive surgical correction of the underlying anatomic abnormality is critical to prevent recurrence . The timing of these procedures however remains controversial . Long term anticoagulation is usually required for at least three months .\n\n【10】While Paget-Shroetter syndrome remains an uncommon cause of UEDVT, clinicians should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for this elusive syndrome in young, healthy patients with upper extremity edema. This is particularly important in patients presenting with history of repetitive movements who are thought to have musculoskeletal injury alone. Accurate diagnosis can result in prevention of pulmonary embolus or post-thrombotic syndrome and its’ associated morbidity. Surgical therapy of anatomic abnormalities can lead to definitive cure, making this challenging disorder rewarding for patients and clinicians alike.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Repeated vaso-occlusive pain episodes are the hallmark of SCD . It involves multiple organs with musculoskeletal system being the most common site. It is estimated that SCD affects 70,000 - 100,000 Americans . SCD is a major health concern with high rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in these patients . Pain is the most common reason for which patients seek medical help . There could be other systemic musculoskeletal disorders which can present with similar symptoms and those diagnoses can be missed. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis of auto-immune etiology. The disease onset of RA is usually insidious with predominant symptoms being pain, stiffness and swelling of multiple joints . In 2005, an estimated 1.5 million (0.6%) of US adults had RA . In our review of literature, we found only a few case reports describing these overlapping conditions. Based on review of cases with these overlapping conditions, there is often a delay in diagnosis of RA. This is mainly due to overlapping musculoskeletal symptoms which are frequently incorrectly attributed to patient’s SCD. Early recognition and treatment of RA in these patients with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is important to achieve disease control and to prevent joint destruction and disability. Our case series demonstrates that a systematic evaluation of clinical symptoms, biomarkers and radiologic findings can help differentiate the two conditions.\n\n【2】Case Reports\n\n【3】We present eight patients who have overlapping SCD and RA. All patients had a diagnosis of SCD since childhood. RA symptoms started later in adult life. All patients diagnosed with RA met 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria which included number and site of joints, serological abnormalities (rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)) and elevated acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) . Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of these patients at time of diagnosis. We divided our patients into two groups based on the severity of joint involvement. Cases 1-4 had more severe joint destruction as compared to cases 5-8.\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】This patient has florid RA. He had rare presentations for sickle cell related events up until diagnosis of RA after which he started to have multiple ED visits and hospitalizations for painful events. His pain during these exacerbations was localized to the knees, elbows and left shoulder. There was a diagnostic dilemma during each of these episodes as to whether his pain was from sickle cell crises or RA exacerbations. Over the last 6 years, he developed significant joint deformities involving the knees and elbows, subsequently becoming wheel chair bound. X-ray of knees shows sclerotic changes from bone infarcts in the diaphysis and metaphysis due to SCD and erosive articular changes from RA . The elbow X-ray showed only erosive articular change . On the other hand, his left shoulder X-ray showed avascular necrosis (AVN) of the humeral head with preserved joint space . He was tried on several anti-rheumatic medications including methotrexate, adalimumab and certolizumab but had an inadequate response to these. He is currently on low dose prednisone, tofacitinib and leflunomide.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】This patient has an added history of recurrent stroke, Moyamoya syndrome and residual right-sided weakness. She did not have significant musculoskeletal pain due to SCD prior to diagnosis of RA. She later developed increasing joint pain associated with digital deformities. Subsequent workup showed that she had concurrent RA. Hand X-ray shows erosive arthritis and subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal joints . Her RA is being treated with prednisone, methotrexate and plaquenil.\n\n【8】Case 3\n\n【9】This patient developed RA at a young age. She had active disease with recurrent joint pain. She developed Boutonniere deformities in both hands and fixed flexion deformities of both elbows and wrists within the first few years of diagnosis. X-rays of both hands and toes showed erosive arthritis. Her RA was treated with prednisone, methotrexate and azathioprine.\n\n【10】Case 4\n\n【11】This patient had an added history of pulmonary embolism and chronic venous stasis ulcers. She had recurrent pain in the hips and knees which were attributed to SCD. Due to marked signs of inflammation in the knee, she underwent further diagnostic workup which revealed concurrent RA. Her RA is well controlled on sulfasalazine and plaquenil.\n\n【12】Cases 5-8\n\n【13】These patients have stable rheumatoid disease with less frequent joint pain. There were minimal articular changes on X-ray. Cases 7 and 8 have been on leflunomide and 5 and 6 are not on any anti-rheumatic medications.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】We analyzed the number of ER visits and hospitalizations of these patients before and after diagnosis of RA. Patients with severe RA had a higher admission rate  compared to patients with mild RA and both groups were treated as SCD painful crises. These painful events were retrospectively found not attributable to SCD based on clinical assessments, biomarkers and radiological findings. Both groups had similar hospitalization rates before diagnosis of RA. Case 3 had severe RA but relatively fewer admissions at our hospital after the diagnosis of RA but she did report frequent overseas travel with hospitalizations in her home country. Case 6 had notably only a single hospitalization but she has a very recent diagnosis of RA.\n\n【16】In our case series of patients with SCD and concurrent RA, we elaborate the following differentiating features based on our observations.\n\n【17】Clinical features\n\n【18】In SCD, patients develop acute bone infarcts with localized pain, swelling, erythema and tenderness but articular involvement is not an initial finding. AVN is a bone infarct involving the epiphysis of a long bone, commonly the head of femur and humerus . Acute episodes of AVN cause limitation of joint movement due to pain but in the chronic phase, articular surface collapse can occur leading to secondary degenerative osteoarthrosis. In RA there is polyarticular, symmetrical joint inflammation with chronic pain, joint stiffness, joint line tenderness and synovial hypertrophy. Bone infarct in SCD involving phalanges is called dactylitis and is an acute process as compared to chronic small joint stiffness in RA. Dactylitis can occur in children but is not common in adults . In RA, the small joints of the hands and feet are involved early in the course of disease and other synovial joints such as the elbows, shoulders, ankles and knees are usually affected later . Periarticular involvement with tendon rupture is common in RA but is not seen in SCD. Vertebral central endplate depression causing H-shaped vertebral bodies is a classical sign of SCD but is never seen in RA. In making a distinction between these two conditions, particular attention must be placed on the temporal association of the joint symptoms, the pattern of joint involvement as mentioned above and the disease progression.\n\n【19】Radiological signs\n\n【20】Musculoskeletal symptoms in co-existent SCD and RA can pose a diagnostic challenge. In these instances, there are specific radiological features that can be used to distinguish underlying skeletal pathologies in each condition. These changes are well demonstrated in the X-rays of our patients . In SCD, bone infarct due to vaso-occlusion is the primary pathology. X-rays initially show subchondral lucencies at the infarcted sites along with periosteal reaction. As the condition becomes more chronic, subchondral sclerosis develops. Repeated bone infarcts involving epiphyses lead to osteonecrosis (AVN) commonly of femoral and humeral heads  which can eventually progress to depression, collapse, and fragmentation of the articular surface . Overtime secondary degenerative changes of osteoarthrosis with eccentric joint space narrowing may occur. In RA, damage occurs at the articular surface. There is synovial inflammation with destruction of cartilage and formation of scar tissue at a later stage. This leads to concentric joint space narrowing consistent with inflammatory arthropathy. It can take several weeks to identify changes on conventional radiographs, as initial findings are very subtle . In RA, activation of osteoclasts and alterations in the microcirculation cause para-articular osteoporosis as seen on X-rays. In advanced stages, there is joint subluxation with spine being the most commonly affected site . MRI is more sensitive to detect changes early in both conditions. In SCD with acute bone infarcts, initial X-rays appear normal but MRI images (in particular, T2-weighted images) show regions of high signal intensity indicative of bone marrow edema . AVN can also be picked up in early stages by MRI. In early RA, MRI shows erosions along with hypertrophic synovial tissue.\n\n【21】Biomarkers\n\n【22】Serum markers are routinely used to assess disease activity in both conditions. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most commonly used biomarkers. Elevated CRP is a non-specific indicator of both inflammation and necrosis in tissues. While CRP has its value in monitoring disease activity in each condition , it cannot reliably differentiate inflammation in SCD from that in RA. This can pose a challenge when patients with co-existent RA and SCD present with acute musculoskeletal symptoms. In our cohort of patients, we noted that an elevated CRP associated with a concurrent rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and reticulocyte count above patient’s baseline corresponds with active SCD. In active RA on the other hand, CRP elevation was associated with LDH, reticulocyte count and bilirubin levels remaining at baseline. This point is well demonstrated graphically for case 1 . Also median CRP levels were higher in patients with severe RA as compared to patients with bone infarcts in SCD. A prospective cohort study in children showed that LDH levels increase significantly during vaso-occlusive crises compared with steady-state values and that there is a significant positive correlation between LDH levels and the severity of pain in SCD . ESR is a rough measure of abnormal concentrations of acute phase proteins and immunoglobulins. This property makes ESR a sensitive, but non-specific, indicator of tissue damage and inflammation. ESR is used to assess RA severity. It is important to point out that the interpretation of ESR is of little relevance in SCD as sickled erythrocytes are unable to achieve Rouleau formation (underlying basis of test) which results in lower ESR values . On the other hand, if the hematocrit is low, red cells can also aggregate and sediment faster giving rise to abnormally elevated ESR. Therefore, ESR cannot be used to assess RA disease activity in SCD.\n\n【23】Treatment\n\n【24】We make note of a few pertinent issues related to treatment in these patients. Hydroxyurea and methotrexate are both bone marrow suppressants. We are unable to find studies showing the safety of combined use of these two agents in patients suffering from these concurrent conditions. Therefore, our patients with SCD who benefited from hydroxyurea had to be switched to a less myelo-suppressive anti-rheumatic agent early in the course of RA treatment. Initially, a few of our patients noted that their sickle cell pain worsened after being started on methotrexate, the etiology of which is not clear. Careful evaluation of the painful events in patients with overlapping disease will enable an accurate diagnosis of RA exacerbations which when treated with appropriate anti-rheumatic agents will prevent disease progression and morbidity. Another notable point is that the use of steroids to treat RA in these patients may increase their risk of AVN as they have an inherent risk for it. There is also a noticeable high opiate usage in these patients for pain in the acute setting due to inaccurate attribution of the pain to SCD. This has the potential for consequent opioid dependence.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】All painful events in SCD may not be related to it. RA and SCD can co-exist. There should be thoughtful analysis of painful events in these patients to prevent treatment delay and morbidity from RA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is most commonly found in the uterus, stomach, small intestine, vasculature and retroperitoneum . It usually remains dormant for many years and then can recur.\n\n【2】Leiomyosarcomas are generally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and there is a general opinion that aggressive surgery with wide resection margins is the treatment of choice .\n\n【3】Whilst primary leiomyosarcoma in the orbit has been reported by several authors, there are only three previously documented case reports of orbital metastases of leiomyosarcoma from a uterine primary . However, there are no documented cases of bilateral orbital metastases from the uterus. Here we present a case of a middle-aged lady with bilateral orbital and neck metastases from a primary uterine leiomyofibroma.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 63-year-old Caucasian lady presented to the ENT department with an 18-month history of a left-sided neck lump and left breast lump. She also complained of a 2-week history of left eye pain and diplopia.\n\n【6】Physical examination demonstrated a well-circumscribed round, fixed 3 cm posterior triangle lymph node on the left side of the neck. There was also a left breast lump about 3 cm in diameter. Eye examination demonstrated a slight proptosis of the left eye, but no diplopia. There was a restriction in elevation of the right eye. The visual acuity was 0.06 in the right eye and 0.30 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 13 mm Hg in the left eye, with exophthalmic radius of 23 mm in each eye.\n\n【7】Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the left neck node demonstrated histological features of leiomyosarcoma with intersecting and intertwining bundles of elongated spindle cells with abundant deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm with a hemangiopericytomatous pattern focally. The nuclei were markedly pleomorphic with focal ischemia and caseation necrosis. The tumor cells expressed SMA and desmin but not CD34 or S100. There was a Ki-67 index of up to 19%.\n\n【8】Computed tomography of the orbits demonstrated bilateral masses arising from the medial orbit and replacing the medial rectus muscle, larger on the left side (10 mm) than on the right side . Biopsy was performed of the left orbital mass which confirmed metastatic deposits on histology from leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【9】The patient was urgently referred to the tertiary sarcoma center where she had a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan that demonstrated the primary in the uterus. Histological analysis of the uterine mass confirmed primary uterine leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【10】Given the extensive disease, the decision was made to treat it with bilateral orbital radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions). Unfortunately there was further disease progression and she has since had six cycles of doxorubicin as part of the GeDDiS trial . The patient has now finished her course of treatment, and now is for palliative treatment.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Leiomyosarcoma is a smooth muscle neoplasm, typically in the uterus, gastrointestinal tract, retroperitoneum and vascular tissue . However, it can be found in other parts of the body in mesenchymal cells with smooth muscle differentiation potential . They typically occur in middle-aged to older women with an average age of diagnosis of 64 years (range 36 - 84 years) .\n\n【13】Leiomyosarcoma makes up around 1% of all uterine malignancies with an incidence of 0.64 per 100,000 women . The risk of metastases ranges from 45% to 73%, most commonly to the lungs, liver and peritoneal cavity .\n\n【14】Metastases of leiomyosarcoma to the head and neck region are very rare, and only a few cases have been reported, including the mandible, temporalis muscle, larynx, trachea, external auditory canal and middle ear .\n\n【15】Orbital leiomyosarcomas are extremely rare . A search of MEDLINE  using the keywords “uterine leiomyosarcoma” and “orbit” produced 15 citations. There are four reported cases of metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the orbits from a uterine primary. Drake and Dobben described the case of a 52-year-old woman with right retro-orbital leiomyosarcoma who was diagnosed with primary uterine leiomyosarcoma 20 years prior to presentation with the orbital symptoms . She unfortunately died of widespread metastases. Gardner described a 55-year-old case with metastasis to the right retrobulbar region, who died 4 years post diagnosis . Su et al described the case of a 55-year-old lady with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus with sphenoid bone and orbital metastases, who was treated with aggressive surgery and survived at 10 months follow-up . Kaltreider et al have described the case of a 43-year-old lady with leiomyosarcoma of the medial orbit, with a previous history of buttock and uterine leiomyosarcoma, who survived at 8 months follow-up.\n\n【16】There are also reported cases of secondary leiomyosarcoma invading the orbit from the paranasal sinuses and orbital leiomyosarcoma as a complication of orbital radiation for retinoblastoma . However, a thorough literature review reveals that there are no reported cases of primary uterine leiomyosarcoma presenting with bilateral orbital, left neck and left breast metastases.\n\n【17】Women with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma have very poor 5-year survival rates ranging from 0% to 42% . Surgery is generally recommended, even in metastatic leiomyosarcoma, as it tends to have a poor response to chemoradiotherapy, and indeed there have been survival benefits reported when there is metastatic disease in the brain or lungs .\n\n【18】Soft tissue sarcoma has been reported to be best treated with complete surgical excision with 1 cm margins when surgery alone is used, and 0.5 cm margins if a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is used . There are, however, no randomized control trials for treatment of soft tissue sarcomas . There are some prospective trials that have shown clear benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas . More recent studies have demonstrated benefits of chemo- or radiotherapy alone in treating leiomyosarcoma, which has implications for future treatment .\n\n【19】The decision to proceed with surgery in the context of metastatic leiomyosarcoma is dependent on many factors, not least the informed patient’s wishes. In the case reported, given the extensive disease, the patient elected for radiotherapy given the risk to sight of bilateral surgery.\n\n【20】When orbital leiomyosarcoma is considered, the differential should include primary, secondary, metastatic and radiation induced tumor. The importance of a thorough gynecological history cannot be emphasized enough in these patients, as the uterus is a relatively common site for leiomyosarcoma. Increasingly, there are more options in the treatment of leiomyosarcoma, including surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. Given the rarity of the condition, long-term survival is difficult to predict, but close follow-up is always necessary.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of smooth muscle origin that has a predilection for hematologic dissemination.\n\n【23】Most metastatic lesions occur in the lung and abdomen whilst involvement of the orbit is rare.\n\n【24】We describe a case report of a 63-year-old lady presenting with bilateral orbital metastases from a primary uterine leiomyosarcoma, which has not been reported before.\n\n【25】The decision to proceed with surgical treatment in the setting of metastatic disease must be individualized, but in this case as the disease was so advanced, chemoradiotherapy was the treatment of choice.\n\n【26】This case highlights the need for a careful, thorough history and examination when faced with the rare presentation of orbital leiomyosarcoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This occlusive thromboaortopathy has an estimated incidence of two cases/1,000,000 population/year and is more prevalent in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America . The etiology of TA remains poorly understood and likewise its exact pathogenic sequence is yet to be established . The disease demonstrates a striking female predilection and commonly but not exclusively presents in the second or third decade of life . Owing to the paucity of distinctive symptoms and absence of a reliable serological marker of disease course, TA often poses a diagnostic dilemma leading to its under-recognition, misdiagnosis and delayed management .\n\n【2】The hallmark of TA is the granulomatous inflammation that commences from the adventitia and progresses to the intima with resultant segmental stenosis, occlusion, dilatation and aneurysm formation leading to end-organ ischemia . The characteristic proximal arterial involvement usually leaves the brain parenchyma until later stage of disease progression . Takayasu-induced cerebral ischemia may result in a myriad of neurological manifestations including headache, organic confusion, dementia, seizure, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, visual disturbances and syncope . Although between 42% and 80% of patients with TA present with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, convulsive syncope as the primary presentation is rare . We report a case of convulsive syncope as an initial presentation of TA in a 17-year-old male patient of African origin.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 17-year-old male patient secondary student of African origin was referred to us from an upcountry regional hospital with a diagnosis of medically intractable epilepsy for cardiovascular review. He presented with a 28-week history of recurrent convulsive syncope attacks which were unresponsive to anti-epileptic drugs. The seizures were generalized tonic-clonic in nature followed by loss of consciousness of variable duration (10 - 30 min). These episodes were often associated with abrupt change of posture particularly sitting upright and on standing. On average he experienced 1 - 3 episodes daily. He denied bladder/bowel incontinence or presence of aura symptoms following or preceding the convulsive episodes respectively. Neurologist’s notes revealed post-ictal drowsiness with a transient memory impairment following the attack. There was a negative history of recurrent headaches, fever, visual disturbances, arthralgias, claudication or unintentional weight loss. His past medical history was unremarkable and he denied substance abuse.\n\n【5】On examination, he was alert, oriented and well-kempt. He was pale (conjuctival and palmar) but not jaundiced. Oral examination revealed a lateral tongue bite mark with adequate dentition. His left-sided brachial and radial arterial pulses were feeble, whereas pulses on his right side and in both lower limbs were normal. Left-sided carotid and vertebral bruits were noted. His blood pressure (BP) was 169/91 mm Hg on his left and 124/82 mm Hg on the right side. He had a pulse rate of 119 beats/min which was regular and of good volume. He was afebrile (37.2 °C) and had a healthy weight (body mass index (BMI) 21.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). Abdominal examination was uneventful with no evidence of renal bruits or aneurysms. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【6】His hematological, biochemical, serological and autoimmune tests revealed normal findings except for raised inflammatory markers, i.e. erythrocyte segmentation rate (ESR) 58 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 27.6 mg/L. A tuberculin test was negative. Echocardiographic examination revealed normal findings except for a trace aortic regurgitation. Due to a clinical suspicion of TA, we ordered a carotid Doppler ultrasound scan (USS) which showed a complete occlusion of the left common, internal and external carotid arteries. On the other hand, renal Doppler USS revealed bilaterally patent vessels with a spontaneous phasic flow. Moreover, both common and deep femoral arteries exhibited a normal course and calibre with no evidence of intraluminal plaque or stenosis on femoral Doppler USS.\n\n【7】Computed tomography (CT) of brain was negative for stroke or space occupying lesions and electroencephalogram (EEG) ruled out likelihood of a focal cerebral pathology. Furthermore, CT angiogram of his thoracic and abdominal aorta revealed changes suggestive of a diffuse arteritis, i.e. irregular narrowing with variable degrees of stenosis, tapering and corrugated appearance . Additionally, left common carotid, left internal carotid, left external carotid and left vertebral arteries could not be visualized on the magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the brain .\n\n【8】Based on the clinical presentation and radiological features, our case fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria  for TA. He was counseled and dexamethasone (60 mg per day), methotrexate (10 mg per day), acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg once daily) and amlodipine (10 mg once daily) were initiated on the sixth day of hospitalization. The patient had a total of 14 convulsive syncope episodes in the initial 6 days of hospitalization (i.e. before initiation of steroids) and five episodes in the last 7 days. He was discharged home after 13 days of hospitalization in a considerably stable state. We reviewed him as an out-patient at 3 and 6 months. He had a controlled BP (132/78 mm Hg left-sided and 117/71 mm Hg right-sided) and was seizure-free for the last 5 months (i.e. had two episodes within the first month after discharge).\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】TA is a rare yet the most common large-vessel vasculitis with an unidentifiable cause and undetermined pathogenesis . Owing to the involved vascular territory and the degree of disease progression, TA patients vary greatly in their clinical presentation which is collectively characterized by active and quiescent phases . Such unpredictability in its presentation and course often makes the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition difficult and late .\n\n【11】In spite of their relatively late onset, neurological manifestations are not uncommon in TA . Decreased blood flow resulting from steno-occlusive lesions and/or shifting of the blood flow (steal) is responsible for various TA-associated CNS manifestations . Whereas convulsive syncope as an initial clinical presentation is extremely uncommon , several other neurological manifestations including headache, vertigo, organic confusion, dementia, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, visual disturbances and intracranial aneurysms have been commonly associated with TA .\n\n【12】As presented in this case, the young boy presented with convulsive syncope which was labelled epilepsy and he was prescribed several anti-seizure drugs with no relief. Due to the absence of other clinical manifestations, it took literally 7 months to reach the definitive diagnosis of TA. Despite all the existing challenges attributable to TA diagnosis, we believe that this case is a clear reminder of how fundamental thorough history taking and physical examination are. We are convinced that despite the rare symptomatology, a couple of TA signs including elevated BP, BP discrepancy between arms, unequal pulses and bruits along the neck region were present but missed during the 7 months course of this case illness.\n\n【13】Worth noting is that, a number of medical conditions may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, therefore, not every seizure is epilepsy. Unfortunately, we are living in a world where clinicians have lost clinical examination capabilities and rely almost entirely on laboratory and radiological tests to reach a diagnosis . As a result, this form of substitution in clinical discipline has led to increased incorrect diagnoses and a more pricey management approach . Nonetheless, it is imperative for clinicians to be aware of the unusual presentations of TA because a timely and appropriate intervention has the potential to halt the inflammatory process and improve the health-related quality of life.\n\n【14】Despite its rarity, TA may manifest with convulsive syncope mimicking epilepsy. It is necessary for clinicians to understand the dynamic symptomatology of this condition for an early diagnosis and timely management to curb damage accrual and attributable morbidity. Moreover, physicians should strive to take detailed history and perform thorough physical examination so as to timely pick characteristic signs of TA especially in patients presenting with unanticipated symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The basic development mechanism is the decrease in the volume of the orbital content in the enlarging orbital bone tissue . There are two major causes. The most significant one is the post-traumatic enlargement of the bone volume as a result of lack of treatment of the orbital bone structure or reconstruction of it with improper and insufficient materials. The other cause is the decrease of the orbital volume in consequence of the late-onset orbital fat tissue atrophy caused by trauma . Retraction of the bulbus oculi causes the superior eyelid sulcus to deepen and cosmetic problems such as ptosis to occur. Post-traumatic enophthalmos up to 2 mm is acceptable functionally and esthetically, whereas cases with enophthalmos more than 2 mm may cause functional and esthetic issues depending on the severity of the damage . Surgical treatment is inevitable when distinct enophthalmos occurs. The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki by obtaining written consent from patient, with the approval of the local ethical review board. In addition, written consent of the patients for the publication of the photographs was obtained.\n\n【2】In this study, the process, results, efficacy and reliability of the treatment of two young cases with late-term enophthalmos after blunt trauma to the orbit will be presented and discussed. Surgery for a balanced orbital volume increase was performed using porous polyethylene (Medpor) implants.\n\n【3】Case Reports\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 38-year-old male patient who had a history of inferior orbital wall fracture repairment 7 years ago caused by blunt trauma to the orbit, applied to our clinic with complaints of the eye getting smaller. Ophthalmological examination showed that the visual sharpness was complete and the anterior and posterior segments were normal. The patient who had a 4 mm enophthalmos spotted with Hertel exophthalmometer showed ptosis of the superior palpebra and retraction of the inferior palpebra. One implant for each medial and lateral orbital wall of the subperiosteal region and two implants for the inferior lateral orbital wall with a thickness of 3 mm and width of 1.5 × 3 cm were placed via transconjunctival inferior orbitotomy approach. Although full recovery was observed with Hertel exophthalmometer evaluation in the post-operative month 3, ptosis and inferior palpebral retraction still remained. In response, firstly the ptosis was treated by performing superior palpebral levator procedure and then the inferior palpebral retraction was treated by using ear-cartilage graft in the posterior lamellar region . We have been continuing the follow-up for the patient for 22 months who has had no complaints other than minimal scleral show. In addition, no complications have been observed such as shift in Medpor implant, infection, damage in periocular muscles or limited globe movements.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】A 32-year-old female patient applied to our clinic complaining about the right eye getting smaller after a blunt trauma 10 years ago. Ophthalmological examination showed that the visual sharpness was complete and the anterior and posterior segments were normal. Examination with Hertel exophthalmometer showed a 3 mm enophthalmos and ptosis in the superior palpebra. One implant for each of medial, lateral and inferior orbital walls of the subperiosteal region with a thickness of 3 mm and width of 1.5 × 2.5 cm was placed via transconjunctival inferior orbitotomy approach. Although full recovery was observed with Hertel exophthalmometer evaluation in the post-operative month 3, ptosis still remained. In response, ptosis surgery was performed via levator procedure . We have been continuing the follow-up of this patient for 18 months who has had no complaints. In addition, no complications have been observed such as shift in implant, infection and limited globe movements.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Orbital blunt trauma may cause orbital bone fracture and damage on internal and peripheral orbital soft tissues . Various materials are used in the surgical treatment of bone fractures after orbital blunt trauma. Autologous bone grafts, cartilage-like materials or alloplasts made of titanium, Teflon, porous polyethylene or Marlex mesh may be used as implant materials . Among these materials, autologous implants have significant advantages such as successful adaptation with the tissue, revascularization, resistance to extorsion and absence of infection. Nevertheless, despite revascularization, these autologous materials can be resorbed and may cause unpredictable change in dimension, volume and eventually the position of bulbus oculi in the orbit . Bones with higher dense cortical structure proportion such as calvarial bones are more resistant to resorption whereas bones with higher cancellous proportion such as the ilium and costa are more vulnerable to resorption . Experimental studies show that bones with higher proportion of cortical structure such as calvarial bones are less vascularized and less vulnerable to osteoclast activity compared to cancellous bones . One of the major concerns about autologous implants is the difficulty of manipulating the shape of these materials perioperatively. For this reason, alloplastic materials such as Medpor have lately stood out as they are easily shaped and highly vascularized as a result of the porous complex. Extorsion and risk of infection are surely the major concerns about this material against surgical use. In a 4-year study including 70 cases with orbital fractures treated with Medpor, none of the cases showed any post-operative infection and extorsion complications .\n\n【10】Treatment of enophthalmos, which is one of the late-onset symptoms of orbital blunt trauma, is relatively difficult and problematic. The severity of the trauma and the region affected are important in the prognosis and treatment of enophthalmos. Treatment of cases with more than one orbital fracture may not be possible with these materials alone. Use of rigid metallic materials is beneficial for preparing an orbital bone frame; furthermore these materials serve as a platform for bone grafts and alloplastic implants . A study on late-onset post-traumatic enophthalmos reports a 65% increase in the orbital volume and a treatment rate of 50% in severe enophthalmos cases by using custom designed titanium mesh implants created with computerized tomography (CT) images of the patients. On the other hand, the need for an additional correction for increase in orbital ingredients is indicated in the study .\n\n【11】Although it is accepted that the enlargement of the orbital bone walls is the main culprit in the pathogenesis of late-term enophthalmos, lately many authors have been preferring the method of increasing the orbital or periorbital soft tissues for fixing the deformities or preventing enophthalmos . Nishi et al  used costal cartilage sliced from posterior to equator in the subperiosteal plan, while Lee  preferred using cartilage after corrective osteotomies in order to increase the volume. Cervelli et al  indicated in their one-case study that retrobulbar fat tissue injection is a reliable and alternate method for the treatment of enophthalmos. Honda et al  used tissue expander for the treatment of an enucleated enophthalmos case.\n\n【12】In order to provide that the bulbus oculi stands in the right anatomic position, regular orbital structure, periocular soft tissue and active periocular muscles are needed. For this reason, in the treatment of post-traumatic enophthalmos, these structures should be considered and as a matter of fact, the main objective should be adjusting damaged anatomic structures. In our surgical method, we successfully brought the bulbus oculi to the front steadily for the first time by placing Medpor implants to all three walls of the orbit. Although in our surgical method, we used more than one Medpor implant for each of the three orbital walls, neither of the patients had extorsion, strabismus or infection complications.\n\n【13】As a conclusion, we for the first time achieved a steady volume increase in the enophthalmic eye by using Medpor implants, without causing any vision loss.

Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is a major subtype of this group, consisting about 30-50% of all the liposarcomas, presenting between second and seven decade of life (between 18 - 67 years with a mean age of 42 years) . Their usual location sites are extremities specially in the thigh of the lower extremity. Perineum and pararectal spaces are rare, intrascrotal is very rare location sites of MLS  MLS has variable appearance spectrum on cross-sectional imaging modalities due to its fatty and matrix content .\n\n【2】In this article, Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings of a rare seen perineal located Myxoid liposarcoma with the review of the literature, are presented.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 36 years old male patient with the complaint of pain and swelling at the right perineal region for 3 month duration admitted to Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty Hospital. Althought the swelling was persisting before, it became more prominent during few months. On physical examination at the right perineal region, the located pain and swelling which extended toward the penil root, was detected. On Abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) demonstrated prominent hypodense area (in fluid density) in the perineal region which was at the location of the right corpus spongiosum, between the both corpus cavernosa and at the right portion of the penil root .\n\n【5】Pelvic Magnetic Resonans Imaging (MRI) study showed a 8 × 6 × 3 cm sized lesion cystic in nature, hyperintense on T1-Weighted images, remarkable hyperintense in signal intensity on STIR sequence, mural enhancing and heterogenous contrast enhacement pattern on post-contrast imaging was visualized. No relation between the lesion and anal channel was detected . The lesion was totally removed surgerically. The histopathology was reported as myxoid liposarcoma.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Liposarcoma is the second most common seen soft-tissue sarcoma in adults which is about 14-18% of all soft-tissue sarcomas . They originate from primitive mesenchymal cells rather than from mature fat cells . They can be seen everywhere in the body containg the fat tissue. Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is a major subtype of these liposarcomas which represents approximately 30-50% of all the liposarcomas and the mean age is 42 years (between 18 - 67 years ) . MLS commonly presents in the extremities, particularly in the thigh, however, it is relatively rare in the perineum or pararectal spaces .The major factors in determining the behavior and prognosis of liposarcoma are the histologic features, site, and size of the tumor . Also the very rare form of MLS involvement in intrascrotal location has been reported . MLS involves the intermuscular fascial planes or deep-seated areas, rarely found in the subcutaneous tissue . Clinically they tend to present as painless swellings that progressively increase in size. MLS usually grow to a considerable size before become clinically symptomatic. The tumor is relatively soft and non-tender at physical examination.\n\n【8】Diagnosis is usually depends on the clinical symptoms (swelling, maybe pain) and the mostly on the imaging. Generally the multi-imaging modalities help for the exact preoperative assessment, diagnosis, staging of MLS, providing the curative resection and minimizing the local recurrence risk in patients. CT and MRI are useful crosssectional imaging modalities, which have large spectrum of signal intensity in MRI and CT attenuation, may provide information about the size, biological behavior, tissue characterization, the tumor extention.\n\n【9】The imaging abnormalities in both modalities (CT and specially for MRI) depends on the amount of fat content (less than 10-25% of the tumour volume), the degree of cellularity and vascularity, and the presence of necrosis within the tumor, the quantity of mucinous and myxoid materials in the tumor, they may show hyperintense foci (represents fat within the tumor ) in a predominantly homogeneous hypointense mass on T1-weighted images, in intermediate signal intensity On T2-Weighted images .\n\n【10】The most majority part of MLS contain lacy or linear, amorphous foci of fat. Typically MLS tend to be hypointense on nonenhanced T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Contrarily to this, due to their relatively high fat content, lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas show high signal intensity on T1-weighted images . Although they may appear as a cystic lesion on non-enhanced MR imaging or they may have similar appearance to a fluid-filled cyst at T2-weighted imaging, some MLS tend to enhance the contrast material like other solid tumors at contrast-enhanced MR study . On Contrast-enhanced images there may be very little non-remarkable contrast enhacement, because of this reason they may mimic a cystic lesion .\n\n【11】Because of this reason, contrast (Godalinium) enhanced MRI is prefered and essential to differantiate the cystic or necrotic lesions from solid or cellular lesions  There are three contrast enhancing pattern in MRI including homogeneous (total enhancement), heterogeneous (partial enhancement, intensity more than 80% of the tumor volume) and no enhancement patterns .\n\n【12】The signal intensity of the lesion is variable due to its contents. If any lesion contains an extracellular matrix with a high level of mucopolysaccharide, hyaline cartilage, edema and areas of necrosis tends to be cystic in nature and it appears as a cystic mass on nonenhanced images . It makes the diagnosis difficult to differantiate cystic lesion from solid masses. In this level ultrasonography (US) may provide information about the internal nature of the lesions. If the MLS is purely cystic appearance at MRI, both US and contrast-enhanced MR imaging and US are helpful in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【13】MLS may mimic a fluid-filled cyst at T2-weighted imaging, therefore, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is important in differantiating cystic or necrotic lesions from solid, cellular lesions .\n\n【14】The local recurrence rates of MLS are relatively high at about 40-50% . Pure MLS has a rate of metastasis about 20% to the common sites including lungs, bones, and rarely the serosal surfaces (of the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium) . It is of great value to mention that the major predicting factor for local recurrence of MLS is the surgical margins and the major factor for metastasis is the histological grade and the percentage of round cells of the tumor .\n\n【15】In differantial diagnosis some tumors which contain myxoid tissue such as extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, intramuscular myxoma, ganglion and myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma should be considered. Unlike MLS, these tumors tend to be homogeneous and have well defined contour .\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Depends on the anatomical site, perineal location (the rare region) of the low attenuation in dansity or intensity cystic lesions ,as was in our case, mixoid liposarcoma should be consider in differantial diagnosis. It should be kept in mind that it is of a great value to obtain the contrast enhanced imaging in order to distinguish the cystic lesions from the solid masses.\n\n【18】Abbreviations\n\n【19】MLS: Myxoid liposarcoma; CT: Computed Tomography; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; US: Ultrasonography; STIR: Short Tau Inversion Recovery", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Lymphadenopathy usually is bilateral, painless and massive, and may also affect other lymphatic chains. It is observed in any age, but there is a predilection for young adult males (1.4:1) and commonly, the disease occurs in whites and blacks, and rarely in Asians .\n\n【2】The extranodal involvement is observed in rare cases, and it is observed as typical sites of involvement, the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the upper airway, salivary glands, the eyeball, bones, central nervous system and breast, the latter being an uncommon site of presentation . In most patients, the lesions regress spontaneously, however, these patients may develop recurrent, persistent disease, however stable or progressive disease leading to death in a few cases . Systemic changes and involvement of multiple organs apparently indicate a poor prognosis.\n\n【3】The differential diagnosis of lesions of Rosai-Dorfman disease of the breast is very complex and important in view that one should rule out a variety of malignant lesions. According to the literature, the radiologically Rosai-Dorfman disease manifests itself as lesions poorly defined borders without calcifications, difficult to distinguish from a carcinoma,  which is actually a challenge since the doctor suspected until the therapeutic decision.\n\n【4】The authors of this study present a case of Rosai-Dorfman breast with a literature review on the topic, addressing different aspects of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Woman, mulatto, 37 years old, married, domestic Brazilian sought medical treatment with a history of nodulation in the left breast, slightly painful and itchy, no redness, no report of preview drainage and with the same skin coloring. She was detected 2 years ago during self-breast examination, leading her to seek medical attention.\n\n【7】On physical examination, patients with good general condition, absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. There was a palpable nodule in the left breast, in the union of the lower quadrants, measuring about 3 cm in greatest diameter, hardened, alteration without skin color, not adhered to the deep plane and painless. There were exams pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and gynecological pathology, without semiological signs. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count and electrolytes without changes.\n\n【8】Mammography was performed, which revealed no satisfactoriness for evaluation (BI-RADS 0). The research was complemented with breast ultrasound, which showed solid nodule and heterogeneous, with images circumscribed and irregular, complete with halo and thick 3.5 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm (BI-RADS/US IVc).\n\n【9】Core biopsy performed with a probable diagnosis of chronic mastitis abscess, and then a biopsy. The result of pathologic analysis of the lesion showed no growth with neoplastic chronic inflammatory process and outline of noncaseating granuloma, and complementary diagnosis by immunohistochemical assessment of the same specimen showed intense chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of plasma cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes , observing further proliferation of histiocytic cells with characteristics of eosinophilic cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with nucleoli sometimes evident, the presence of inflammatory cells preserved inside the cytoplasm of these histiocytic cells, with clear halo around them, a phenomenon emperipolesis named . The immunohistochemical study revealed diffuse expression for protein S-100 in histiocytic cells, and CD20 +, CD3 +, CD163 +, CD138 + and negative for CD1a, which are morphological findings consistent with Rosai-Dorfman breast (extranodal).\n\n【10】Despite being a self-limiting disease, discuss with the patient the procedure to be performed, and because of the discomfort and anxiety, the patient opted for surgical excision of the lesion.\n\n【11】There was performed with wide resection specimen measuring 4.5 × 4.0 × 3.0 cm, compact, showing whitish-yellowish, with brownish areas in between, jagged edges and asymmetrical weighing 15.58 g . Microscopically, there was diffuse inflammatory infiltration and histiocytic lympho-plasmacytic arranged around the mammary ducts and acini. The histiocytes showed ample clear cytoplasm sometimes with leukocytes, lymphocytes phagocytosed by setting emperipolesis.\n\n【12】Postoperatively the patient remained without complications and was discharged with 48 hours of hospitalization, designating themselves conservative management. The patient recovered without developing disease in the last 1 year of outpatient treatment.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The Rosai-Dorfman is a clinical and pathological entity infrequent, have unknown etiology and is characterized by reactive changes of the immune system . Its classical presentation is painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in a young patient asymptomatic and usually evolves into a benign clinical course with low risk of systemic involvement.\n\n【15】In 1969, several years after its original description, it was felt that this was a disease process limited to lymph nodes. Currently has documented numerous cases in extranodal sites, which most often affect individuals with an age range a little higher, above 40 years. In another publication, we described seven cases with involvement of the mammary gland, showing the ages between 15 and 84 years, with an average of 42 years . During the last 16 years, in the literature, there have been 19 cases of Rosai-Dorfman disease related to mammary gland, and of these, 18 women with a median age of 45 years and 1 case in a man of 23 years old, with palpable mass in the right breast  .\n\n【16】Patients with involvement of the breast are rare and usually present with a palpable mass and ill-defined sensitivity exacerbated or an abnormal mammogram, typically of malignancy. The differential diagnosis based on sonographic and mammographic findings includes both benign and malignant solid masses. According to literature, ultrasound usually shows a hypoechoic mass vascularized, and usually mammography shows a mass with ill-defined borders, without calcifications .\n\n【17】The differential diagnosis based on histopathologic features include invasive breast carcinoma, Malakoplakia, diabetic mastopathy, fat necrosis, granulomatous mastitis, infectious granulomas, Erdheim-Chester, fibrous histiocytoma, malignant melanoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.\n\n【18】Definitive diagnosis is known thru the pathology, which can be established through fine needle aspiration (FNA), the core biopsy or surgical excision, histopathological characteristics that demonstrate similar regardless of the place of occurrence. The brand Rosai-Dorfman histiocytosis is a large, polygonal with round nuclei, vesicular chromatin, nuclear membrane thin, one to several eosinophilic nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm. Many of the histiocytes show emperipolesis, which signals useful feature, but not disease-specific and can be found in other pathologies. However, emperipolesis is often more difficult to be viewed in that extra nodal lesions in the lymph nodes.\n\n【19】Lymph nodes show capsular fibrosis and dilated nodal sinuses filled with foamy histiocytes, hence the disease is also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy . The immunohistochemical profile and is characterized by classic ultramicroscopic S-100 +, CD1a, without Birbeck granules. This type of spectrum immunohistochemical suggests that sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy is a proliferation of interdigitating dendritic cells in lymph nodes of antigen processing .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Currently there is a worldwide consensus of when to initiate treatment, or if conservative treatment is indicated, expectant or surgical. However, we know that Rosai-Dorfman disease usually evolves with spontaneous resolution in most cases. However, if you have documented, which may be persistent and aggressive evidence multisystemic, which can even be deadly in rare cases . What can be observed in the literature, is that patients with bilateral breast show an indolent clinical course similar to that seen in other extranodal site . Some unfavorable prognostic factors are: the extensive lymph node spread, extranodal involvement, immune disorders such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the presence of rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibodies and the association of anemia with neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia .\n\n【22】There are no standardized guidelines on follow-up of patients with disease confined to the breast, however, must be graded individually in order to delete the systematization of disease or local recurrence . However, we can conclude, as proposed by Landim et al , that tumors located exclusively in single anatomical site skin with surgical resection feasible, surgery should be considered: 1) tumors that persist or recur; 2) when the histopathologic findings are inconclusive; 3) the presence of symptoms; 4) if is the patient’s wish. Complete resection with clear margins should be the goal of surgery is a great option for regional control.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "93316434-564a-4b9d-b6a5-68dd3d78bb7d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The World Health Organization declared the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 , after its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 . The clinical manifestation of this highly transmissible ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presenting with a wide range of respiratory symptoms . Moreover, cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 have also been identified, such as acute coronary syndromes, myocardial injury, thromboembolic phenomenon, and arrhythmias. These are related to direct viral infection and indirect injury resulting from exuberant cytokinemia, endothelial inflammation, and microvascular thrombosis .\n\n【2】The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediates cellular entry . Therefore, antibodies that could bind to the spike protein, particularly at the ACE2 receptor biding domain, could neutralize the virus by preventing its attachment to the host cell . This concept was the foundation for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2020, the first two messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines received emergency use approval for distribution in the USA. These were BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer and mRNA-1273 developed by Moderna, which demonstrated 95% and 94.1% protection against SARS-CoV-2, respectively . Although these vaccines have been proved to have excellent efficacy and safety, there have been reports of various side effects associated with vaccination. Approximately 1,226 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, primarily occurring in young individuals after receiving their second vaccination dose . This report summarizes a case of transient myopericarditis occurring in a young and healthy male within 48 h of receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 44-year-old male presented with left-sided chest pain radiating to the left arm associated with shortness of breath. He had received his second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine 4 days before symptom onset. His chest pain began 2 days postvaccination; it was initially mild but progressively became severe. He denied any recent fevers, upper respiratory tract symptoms, or sick contacts. He did not have any past medical history or take any medications. He was a pack per day smoker but did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Vitals signs and physical exam were within normal limits.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. His initial troponin I was 1.40 ng/mL, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) was 30.8 ng/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 43 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 3.3 mg/mL, and D-dimer was normal at 100 ng/mL. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment changes. He was admitted and received three doses of sublingual nitroglycerin without relief from his chest pain. He was also started on aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg due to concerns of an acute coronary syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function, no valvular abnormalities, or pericardial effusion. Troponins were repeated 8 h after admission and resulted in a significant uptrend to 9.14 mg/mL. ECG was repeated and showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads ; therefore, he was started on a heparin infusion. In addition to aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg was initiated. He underwent left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, which revealed nonobstructive disease. As coronary angiography was nonconclusive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained , which was consistent with acute myopericarditis, fulfilling the updated Lake Louise criteria. A viral PCR panel was obtained, which was negative for adenovirus, coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, echovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes viruses, and parvovirus B19.\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】After myopericarditis was confirmed, clopidogrel was discontinued. After being admitted for two nights, his chest pain had resolved. His troponin I, ESR, and CRP levels trended down to normal. He was discharged from the hospital on aspirin 81 mg.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】At 1-month follow-up the patient had no recurrence of his chest pain. His exercise capacity had returned to his prior baseline. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Aspirin was discontinued at this time.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The rapid development of the mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) for SARS-CoV-2 have been a tremendous achievement in modern medicine. More than 275 million BNT162b2 vaccinations and 180 million mRNA-1273 vaccinations have been administered in the USA . In the initial trials, these vaccines were proved to be safe, with no severe concerns identified. However, there was a high incidence of minor local side effects such as pain, erythema, and swelling at inoculation sites compared with placebo. Transient systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, muscle, and joint pain were also more common with vaccination, typically occurring for the first 24 to 48 h after vaccination . After approval and distribution of the vaccines in the UK and the USA, several rare cases of anaphylaxis were reported, likely related to the vaccine components, specifically the polyethylene glycol derivatives . Recently, several cases have been published highlighting transient cardiac injury predominantly in adolescents and young adults after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination . In the initial clinical trials, there were no reported myocarditis or pericarditis events; however, the mean age of the participants was 51 in the mRNA-1273 trial , and the median age was 52 in the BNT162b2 trial . This signals that these trials might have lacked adequate power to detect this rare side effect in younger patients. The cardiac injury occurred in our patient within 48 h of inoculation with the second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, consistent with other published cases. No other causative factors were identified. Therefore, given the temporal association with the time of vaccination and symptom onset, we suggest that the transient cardiac injury in our patient was an adverse reaction to his recent vaccination. Moreover, COVID-19 is also a known cause of myocarditis , which was ruled out in our patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. A viral panel was also obtained to rule out other infectious causes of myopericarditis. Regarding diagnosis and management, monitoring cardiac myocyte injury trends with troponin I, ESR, and CRP were beneficial to track clinical improvement and resolution. Our case also demonstrates the utility of cardiac MRI in the diagnosis of myopericarditis in patients with a high clinical suspicion for postvaccination myopericarditis. Utilizing the 2018 Lake Louise criteria, cardiac MRI has a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 96.2% in detecting myocarditis . The disease course was mild in our patient, and symptoms were resolved with conservative management with aspirin.\n\n【14】Postimmunization myopericarditis has been correlated with other vaccinations , with the most substantial evidence for the smallpox vaccine as a cause . In cases of postvaccination myopericarditis with the smallpox vaccine, reports have shown a transient and subclinical course detected by elevated troponin I levels , similar to our patient after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The hypothesized etiology of cardiac injury after vaccination would be an autoimmune phenomenon involving molecular mimicry resulting in cross-reactivity between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and self antigens . Vaccine-associated autoimmunity associated with cross-reactivity between vaccinal and self antigen, or the immune-stimulatory effects of vaccine adjuvant has been previously described . Furthermore, greater systemic reactogenicity has been identified in younger patients after the second vaccine dose, possibly correlating with a higher burden of immunological side effects . Hence, this appears to be the most likely mechanism of cardiac injury in these patients.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】In unison with recently reported cases, we hypothesize our patient’s transient myopericarditis was associated with his recent mRNA-1273 vaccination due to the temporal relationship. However, we recognize that substantial evidence is needed to determine a genuine causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and cardiac injury. Moreover, vaccinations have proven to be lifesaving, with the benefits of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations far outweighing the rare risk of myopericarditis, given that COVID-19 in itself likely possesses a higher incidence of myocarditis compared to vaccination. Nevertheless, as the younger populations undergo vaccination, clinicians should be aware of this potential association and transient disease course. All cases should be promptly reported to the VAERS database.\n\n【17】Learning points\n\n【18】Learning points from this case report include: 1) Physicians should consider myopericarditis when evaluating adolescents and young adults who present with chest pain after recent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; 2) Troponin I and CRP are valuable in tracking the disease process. Furthermore, cardiac MRI is an invaluable tool in determining the presence of cardiac injury, utilizing the updated Lake Louise criteria; 3) A conservative treatment approach should be taken in these patients as most cases are transient and without significant sequelae.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Compared with adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma has a lower incidence and poorer prognosis. A histological analysis reported that pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) comprises only 0.09-0.4% of all cancers that occurs in the pancreas . PASC is diagnosed based on the criteria that more than 30% of squamous components are included in the pancreas tumor tissues . The biological nature of PASC is its aggressive proliferation and invasiveness into other tissues, including the lymph nodes, vessels, and nerve plexuses. Here we report the case of a patient with PASC that had penetrated into the stomach and transverse colon.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 55-year-old male with no relevant medical history presented with complaints of left flank pain, general fatigue, a sense of listlessness, and melena. His mother and aunt had died of colorectal cancer, and his father had died of lung cancer. He had been experiencing a dull pain in the left flank for 2 months prior to his presentation to the hospital. Upon presentation, severe anemia was evident based on his palpebral conjunctiva. There was tenderness over the upper abdomen and a palpable mass on his left upper abdomen.\n\n【4】Blood chemistry revealed remarkably elevated inflammatory reactions (white blood cell count of 25,250/μL, of which 93% were neutrophils, and a C-reactive protein level of 8.56 mg/dL), severe anemia (red blood cell counts of 13.3 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL, and a hemoglobin level of 3.6 g/dL), severe hypoproteinemia (5.2 g/dL), severe albuminemia (1.7 g/dL), mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (78 IU/L), mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245 IU/L), mild hyponatremia (131 mEq/L), and a mild coagulation disorder (73% prothrombin and D-dimer level of 1.9 μg/mL). His carcinoembryonic antigen level was moderately elevated at 37.9 ng/mL, and the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was remarkably elevated at 1,977 U/mL. The SCC antigen and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, which are two tumor markers, were moderately elevated at 29.8 ng/mL and 1,165 U/mL, respectively.\n\n【5】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver metastases and thickened gastric walls . A cystic tumor was apparent in the pancreatic tail, with invasion into the transverse colon . Ultrasonography revealed remarkably thickened muscle layers of the gastric body  and the cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 4.0 cm sized protruding mass with an ulcer formation in the greater curvature of the middle gastric body . Endoscopic biopsies revealed two components of SCC and adenocarcinoma . Colonoscopy revealed massive ulcers extending from the splenic flexure to the middle transverse colon . Endoscopic biopsies also revealed two components of SCC and adenocarcinoma . Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas that had invaded into the stomach and transverse colon. Although chemotherapy and palliative surgery were considered, the patient was unable to tolerate the treatment until his general condition and malnutrition improved. Administration of a red blood cell concentration (RCC) and intravenous nutrition was provided. On day 20, the patient’s blood pressure suddenly deteriorated and his anemia worsened. Although 10 units of RCC were administered, he died of circulatory insufficiency.\n\n【6】An autopsy was performed under the consent of his family. The stomach was perforated and contained 100 mL of blood . A cystic mass measuring 14 cm was discovered in the pancreatic tail that it penetrated into the gastric and transverse colon walls . Histological findings of the pancreatic tumors  and invaded gastric lesions  confirmed adenosquamous carcinoma with atypical cells accompanied by inflammatory cells and fibrosis proliferation, forming an alveolar and sheet-like structure along with keratinization, an intercellular bridge, and glandular formation. Based on these findings, it was concluded that his death was caused by bleeding from the stomach that was invaded by the PASC.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Adenosquamous carcinoma characterized by the presence of adenocarcinoma and SCC in the same tumor is known to have a poor prognosis and an aggressive proliferation. According to the current guidelines, PASC is defined by the presence of both adenomatous and squamous components, in which the latter comprises over 30% of the tumors . Adenosquamous carcinoma occurs in the esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, biliary tract, liver, salivary glands, and female reproductive system . Besides the aggressiveness and invasiveness of adenosquamous carcinoma, in general, there is little difference between PASC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in its clinical manifestation, including age, sex, location, size, and primary symptoms.\n\n【9】The mucous membranes in the pancreatic duct have no squamous epithelium, and SCC is hypothesized to originate from glandular tissues. There are four proposed mechanisms for the development of adenosquamous carcinoma: 1) ectopic squamous epithelium, 2) squamous metaplasia of the pancreatic ductal epithelium, 3) squamous metaplasia of the glandular system, and 4) histological transformation of adenocarcinoma. To date, evidence from many studies suggests that a histological transformation of adenocarcinoma to SCC 4) might be the underlying mechanism . However, considering that there are some cases of early-stage squamous carcinoma without an adenomatous component, 1)-3) mechanisms are also possible.\n\n【10】The squamous component of this type of tumor was reported to proliferate two times faster than its adenomatous component (doubling time of squamous component is 81.8 days, whereas that of adenomatous component is 166.3 days) . The rapid growth of squamous components in PASC is presumably related with bleeding or cystic and necrotic transformations of the tumor. The compression of adenomatous components by squamous cell proliferation leads to the loss of a distinct border between the two components. Furthermore, as the tumor progresses, squamous cell proliferation continues to replace adenocarcinoma. Tumors with a higher percentage of squamous components tend to progress more rapidly and have a poorer prognosis. It is notable that expansive growth is a characteristic of PASC.\n\n【11】In general, adenosquamous carcinoma has a poor prognosis compared with cancers with other histological origins in the pancreas because of its tendency to aggressively invade the lymph nodes, vessels, and nerve plexuses . Thus, the prognosis of PASC is generally considered to be poor; the average survival period of patients undergoing surgical resection is approximately 6 months and that of those who underwent palliative treatment is 1.5 months.\n\n【12】The characteristics of an imaging diagnosis are rich vessel proliferation and cystic transformation accompanied by internal necrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT of PASC revealed contrast-enhanced margins accompanied by non-contrast-enhanced lesions inside, suggesting hemorrhage or necrosis changes . This finding is effective for differentiating PASC from pancreatic ductal carcinoma. In our patient, contrast-enhanced CT revealed a cystic tumor with contrast-enhanced margins, which was indicative of PASC.\n\n【13】The laboratory characteristic of PASC is increased level of serum CA19-9. It may be helpful to assess serum CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic tumors that have different clinical or imaging characteristics from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【14】The treatment of PASC is a curative resection in patients without distant metastases; however, few PASC cases are discovered at an early stage because of its aggressive proliferation, making them unsuitable candidates for a surgical resection. A surgical resection of a localized PASC is controversial because of its worse prognosis after the resection than that without surgery; however, it is certain that some patients with PASC can benefit from a longer survival time after the surgical treatment .\n\n【15】There are a few cases reported in Japan where the patient survived for more than 5 years after the surgical resection of PASC. The mainstay of PASC is chemotherapy. However, there are currently no compromised protocols for treating PASC. PASC regimens are proposed in accordance with those of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including a monotherapy of S-1, or a combination therapy of S-1 plus gemcitabine, or an S-1 plus platinum- and/or a paclitaxel-based chemotherapy . Squamous carcinoma is considered to be susceptible to radiation therapy, and postoperative radiation therapy has been found to yield some favorable results .\n\n【16】This present patient was deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of his poor performance status and malnutrition. If he had survived until his general condition had improved enough to be able to tolerate chemotherapy, there was a little hope for longer survival.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】We herein reported the case of a patient with PASC that had penetrated into the stomach and transverse colon. Although PASC is characterized as having a poor prognosis because of its rapid and aggressive growth, efficient and compromised treatment strategies have yet to be established. In advanced PASC stages that are unsuitable for a surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of both therapies are attempted; further accumulation of experiences in treating PASC is required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0ef749e3-79af-4884-9176-95bad9526b85", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Adverse and allergic reactions to intravenous (IV) contrast  are not uncommon, reactions could vary from a very mild (3-13%)  feeling of warmth, nausea or itching to a very serious and life threatening anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, pulmonary edema , coronary spasm  and cardiac arrest may occur (0.04-0.3%) . Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are very rare form of allergic reactions but has been reported in the literature, a case of non-cardiac pulmonary edema was reported by Borish et al in 1998 , hence the radiology computed tomography (CT) technician should be fully aware of these reactions, prompt and early recognition followed by immediate medical intervention remains important for a successful outcome. I report a case of acute non-cardiac pulmonary edema  leading to cardiopulmonary arrest following injection of non-ionic IV CT contrast media. Following a very aggressive and prolonged resuscitation the patient fully recovered without any long term squeal, a rather miracle!\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 77-year-old Caucasian female presented to a free standing radiology facility in August, 2016 in a small medical center for a routine outpatient CT urography for follow-up of previously removed urinary bladder cancer in recent past by the urologist. She has been doing very well postop with no known cardiopulmonary problem or previous history of IV CT contrast dye or shell fish allergy. After 143 mL of Optiray 320, a non-ionic contrast media was injected IV, immediately following that the patient experienced severe nausea, vomiting, short of breath and not feeling well. The X-ray technician immediately approached a nurse in the emergency department which is located next door to the X-ray department. A full time Radiologist is not routinely staffed at this facility. The nurse then summoned the emergency room physician on duty (that happened to be the manuscript author) because the patient was experiencing a very serious IV contrast dye reaction. When the physician arrived in the X-ray department, he discovered that the patient was still on CT scanner table, had turned blue, not breathing, with no pulse, mouth and nose covered with pink frothy material. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately commenced in the radiology department and the patient was wheeled into emergency room for further care. CPR continued, secretions continuously suctioned from mouth and nose, ventilated with 100% oxygen using bag valve mask device followed by tracheal intubation, and treated for acute anaphylaxis with IV epinephrine, corticosteroids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and glucagon. The patient was also treated for acute pulmonary edema with IV Lasix, morphine, frequent suction and positive pressure ventilation. Copious amount of pink frothy material was exuding from mouth, nose and endotracheal tube like an active volcano; bilateral coarse rales on chest auscultation were heard. CPR continued for more than 4 h for cardiopulmonary arrest, pulseless electrical activity (PEA), hypotension and pulmonary edema. She continued to have problem of effective, satisfactory oxygenation despite positive pressure ventilation with a ventilator. It was recommended by the critical care physician who accepted the patient at intensive care unit (ICU) of the university hospital that she must be transported under the care of an anesthesiologist with nitrous oxide induction, it was accomplished and the patient was transported by air because the facility where the patient was initially resuscitated is a very small and remote free-standing emergency facility with limited resources. Chest X-ray and chest auscultation confirmed the findings of an acute pulmonary edema. The next morning the patient was successfully extubated, fully alert, awake and oriented with normal neurological examination. But she did not remember anything about her serious reaction resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest following IV contrast administration. But she did remember experiencing nausea, vomiting and not feeling well during her CT scan of abdomen. More than a year later of IV contrast reaction, a personal visit paid by the author with the patient in October, 2017 revealed that she is doing very well with no residual squeal and is free of her urinary bladder cancer. She still could not recall much about her serious contrast dye reaction.\n\n【4】Medications used during CPR: all medications were given IV; epinephrine 1 mg five doses, methylprednisolone 125 mg three doses, sodium bicarbonate 8.4% 50 mEq three ampules, Pepcid 20 mg, benadryl 25 mg, glucagon 1 mg, lasix 40 mg three doses, morphine 4 mg, fentanyl 50 µg, succinylcholine 50 mg, etomidate two doses of 18 mg and 10 mg, versed 2 mg, dopamine drip, norepinephrine drip, propofol drip, rocephin 1 g, vancomycin 1 g, and nitrous oxide gas.\n\n【5】Procedures performed included: endotracheal intubation, left femoral central line, Lucas-CPR, Foley to CD, and nasogastric tube.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Reactions related to IV contrast have been discussed in detail by Saljoughian, Pharm D PhD in 2012  (5-8%) and is classified into three categories: 1) mild- feeling of warm, nausea, mild vomiting and mild itching; these side effects are usually short lived and may or may not require any specific treatment, 2) moderate- persistent vomiting, hives, skin swelling and severe itching that normally requires symptomatic treatment with antihistamines, anti nausea medications and corticosteroids, 3) severe anaphylaxis , anaphylactoid reactions , pulmonary edema, seizures, and cardiac arrest are rare but need immediate medical intervention. In 1970, Ansell  reported severe and life threatening reactions with ionic contrast agents in 0.01-0.02% of all radiological examinations. But in 1992, Leiberman  reported an incidence of severe but not necessarily fatal, anaphylactoid reactions in 1-2% of all contrast studies, this 10-fold higher incidence may be due to previous under-reporting of adverse reactions. Allergic reaction to IV contrast may be a pseudo allergic response rather than a true antigen-antibody reaction. These agents directly act on mast cells and lead to release of potent vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators (histamine, prostaglandins, leukotriene, and cytokines). Tryptase is a neutral protease concentrated in the secretary granules of mast cells . Its concentration in blood is linearly related to histamine release, concentrations above 20 ng/mL may be indicative of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction. Studies have shown that iodine  is not the true cause of allergic response. Sea food or shell fish allergies are due to special proteins in this food called tropomyosins. Prawns usually cause most allergic response (0.6-10%). Sea food allergy and topical iodine allergy may or may not increase the risk of IV contrast allergic response.\n\n【8】Patients with prior reaction to IV contrast definitively are at a higher risk of further reactions in future (40-60%) and should be prepped with antihistamines and corticosteroids per standard radiology department protocols of its respective institution . Even then some reactions do occur but may be of milder form.\n\n【9】Patients with other multiple allergies, history of asthma, hyperthyroidism , congestive heart failure (CHF), dehydration and elderly with diabetes, myasthenia gravis, sickle cell anemia, and pheochromocytoma  are at much higher risk of allergic reactions. Renal evaluation especially in the elderly shall be performed before IV contrast injection to avoid further deterioration of renal insufficiency. True allergic response of antigen-antibody reaction is mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE); however, Mita et al  detected IgE antibody in 1998 following reaction to a radio contrast medium. Skin testing and small test dose of IV contrast media may not be a true predictor of an advanced or serious allergic response after full dose. Reactions are far less common with non-ionic contrast (3%) as compared to ionic-contrast (12%) and also ionic contrasts are more immunogenic and cause more serious allergic reactions. Hence non-ionic contrast is now commonly used. Iodinated contrast media is further classified according to osmolality; ionic media (1,500 mOsm/kg) has higher osmolality than non-ionic (300 - 700 mOsm/kg). These agents are derivatives of tri-iodobenjoic acid. In contrast normal serum osmolality is 290 mOsm/kg. Nitric oxide protects against contrast media reactions as reported in an experimental study of rats by Sendo et al  in 2000; this study suggests that pulmonary edema is produced by inhibiting endothelial nitric oxide production and nitro vasodilators that protect against adverse effects of contrast media in rats. Nitrous oxide was used in current case and may have been beneficial in this patient based on this experimental study. Role of nitric oxide was further discussed in another experimental study in rats by Yoshikama et al in 1997 . This study concluded that nitric oxide may play a protective role in acute lung injury induced by platelet activating factor in contrast media reactions. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased pressures in the heart resulting in the left ventricular failure to pump all the blood it receives from the lungs causing the veins and capillaries of the lungs to be filled with fluids rather than the air as seen in CHF. It occurs in severe coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, heart valve disease and hypertension. Non-cardiac pulmonary edema occurs without increase in the heart pressures. Fluid leaks from capillaries of the lungs, air sacs and fills these sacs with fluid rather than air, this also occurs in adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute severe trauma, high altitude, near drowning, smoke inhalation injury, renal artery stenosis. Detailed management of acute contrast reaction has been discussed in USAF Department of Radiology and Biochemical Imaging especially pulmonary edema with oxygen, lasix, morphine, steroids. Cardiopulmonary monitoring during CT scanning, especially in the elderly or high risk patients may be warranted to recognize and promptly treat the serious allergic response due to the IV contrast. CT technician should be well versed with all aliments of IV contrast reactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5606927a-c9e4-437a-aa3f-7639c71b3057", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder whose primary phenotypic features include a white forelock, vibrant blue eyes or heterochromia due to lack of pigmentation of the iris, distinctive facial abnormalities (laterally displaced inner canthi and a wide nasal bridge), sensorineural hearing loss, and upper extremity malformations . The embryological progenitor cells (neural crest cells) that result in the formation of pigment-forming melanocytes and the body’s connective tissue framework are affected. Anesthetic care may be required during various surgical procedures aimed at treating the end-organ involvement of the disease process. We report a 6-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome who required anesthetic care during dental surgery. The perioperative concerns of these patients are discussed, previous reports of anesthetic care reviewed, and options for anesthetic care presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】Review of this case and presentation in this format followed the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH).\n\n【5】The patient was a 6-year-old boy who presented for anesthetic care during dental rehabilitation. Past medical history of the child included an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery at 40 weeks gestation. The child passed his newborn hearing test and was meeting appropriate developmental milestone. Other past medical and surgical history was negative.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Given a family history of Waardenburg syndrome and characteristic phenotypic findings (heterochromia of the iris with inner canthi displacement and a wide, flat nasal bridge), a diagnosis of type I Waardenburg syndrome was made at 8 months of age.\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】The child presented for dental rehabilitation and treatment of multiple dental carries under general anesthesia. Physical examination revealed a child in no acute distress. He was normocephalic with wide-set eyes, flat nasal bridge hypertelorism and a wide flat nasal bridge. Airway examination revealed a Mallampati class I with a thyromental distance of 3 fingerbreadths. Mouth opening and neck range of motion were within normal limits. The cardiac and respiratory examinations were normal. The patient was held nil per os for 6 h and transported to the operating room. Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Following the inhalation induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen, a peripheral intravenous cannula was placed. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was easy. Propofol (2.5 mg/kg) was administered and following direct laryngoscopy, his trachea was intubated with a 5.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube. The surgical time was 60 min. Total fluids included 400 mL of lactated Ringer’s. Postoperative analgesia was provided by ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg) and morphine (2 mg). Prophylaxis for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting was provided by ondansetron (3 mg) and dexamethasone (4 mg). At the completion of the surgical procedure, his trachea was extubated and he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】The remainder of his postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged home the same day.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Waardenburg syndrome, a disorder of the neural crest cells, was first observed in deaf mute twin girls by the Dutch ophthalmologist, Jan van der Hoeve in 1916. However, it was not until 1951 that the ophthalmologist and geneticist, Dr. Petrus Johannes Waardenburg, fully defined the characteristics of the syndrome, which bears his name . Waardenburg syndrome affects the differentiation and migration of neural crest cells, specifically the melanocyte-forming lineage. Involvement of melanocytes leads to a lack of pigmentation including the characteristic white forelock in the hair, heterochromia of the iris or vibrant blue eyes, as well as hypopigmented patches of the skin and vitiligo. In the inner ear, the lack of melanocytes and malformation or absence of the organ of Corti leads to sensorineural hearing loss . Involvement of cephalic neural crest cells that form the craniofacial mesenchyme results in abnormal facial features and upper limb involvement, specific for Waardenburg syndrome type III.\n\n【14】Divided into four subclasses, the classifications of Waardenburg syndrome distinguish between the varied phenotypic presentations dependent upon the location and severity of gene mutation. Type 1 primarily involves the face and pigmentation alterations of the hair, skin, and eyes with a smaller proportion having sensorineural hearing loss. Type 2 has a higher prevalence of hearing loss, but lacks the presenting dystopia canithorum found in type 1 Waardenburg syndrome patients. A small subset, called type 3 Waardenburg syndrome or Klein-Waardenburg, has additional musculoskeletal malformations, particularly in the upper limbs with flexion contractures, fusion of carpal bones, and/or syndactyly . Type 4 is often called Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. These individuals exhibit the classic phenotypic findings of Waardenburg syndrome in association with Hirschsprung disease, related to deficient neural crest cell development of the myenteric plexus in the colon. Type IV lends further support for the primary defect involving neural crest cells given the association of Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung disease . In addition to the varied phenotypic expression, inheritance also varies from autosomal dominant or recessive.\n\n【15】Waardenburg syndrome is the result of mutations in one of several genes that control the division and migration of neural crest cells during embryonic development . Neural crest cells are multipotent progenitor cells arising from the embryological ectodermal layer. As the cells migrate throughout the body, they give rise to neurons, neuroglia, craniofacial, skeletal, connective tissues, and melanocytes. Autosomal dominant inheritance is involved in mutations of the PAX3 (2q35), MITF (3p14.1-p12.3), SOX10, EDNRB, or EDNR3 genes . The MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) gene functions in a critical stage of melanogenesis by stimulating the differentiation of melanocytes through the activation of a tyrosinase enzyme. PAX3, the most common mutation in Waardenburg syndrome, and SOX10 both operate as MITF regulators by binding to the MITF’s proximal site, thus also impacting melanogenesis in affected individuals . Mutations of the EDNRB and EDNR3 genes result in a deficiency in a growth promoting pathway, the endothelin-signaling pathway, of neural crest cells. As this pathway functions to enhance the proliferation of neural crest cells in the pluripotent stage of development, specific effects are seen in melanocytes and enteric nervous system development due to the abundance of cells needed and the long migration distance from the neural crest cells original embryologic site of development . The EDNRB and EDNR3 mutations explain the association of the phenotypic expression of Waardenburg syndrome and a lack of colonic ganglion migration seen in Hirschsprung disease.\n\n【16】As with other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, Waardenburg syndrome results in a specific pattern of end-organ involvement and anatomical malformations which may require surgical intervention. Although the disease has an incidence of 1 in 40,000, there remains limited information regarding anesthetic care for these patients . As with all intraoperative care, the anesthetic approach begins with a thorough preoperative evaluation and identification of the end-organ involvement. The limited literature regarding anesthetic care in these patients has anecdotally suggested the potential for difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation . Michalek et al described a 46-year-old patient with Waardenburg syndrome who presented for dental rehabilitation. Preoperative examination was limited due to a lack of patient cooperativity, but did demonstrate a short thyromental distance, and limited neck mobility. As direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation was not feasible due to limited mouth opening and neck movement, a supraglottic airway was placed and endotracheal intubation was performed through the airway using fiberoptic guidance. The authors concluded that although anesthesia-related information regarding anesthesia and airway management in Waardenburg syndrome is limited, specific facial features and muscle contractures may cause difficulties with both direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. In our patient preoperative airway examination revealed Mallampati class I with a thyromental distance of 3 fingerbreadths. Mouth opening and neck range of motion were within normal limits. Given the potential for airway involvement with Waardenburg syndrome, the ability to accomplish adequate bag-valve mask ventilation should be demonstrated prior to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. The appropriate equipment for dealing with a difficult airway should be readily available including equipment for indirect laryngoscopy .\n\n【17】In addition to the potential for difficulties with endotracheal intubation, congenital abnormalities of the glottis, larynx, and trachea have been reported including laryngomalacia and subglottic narrowing . The lineage of both melanocytes and laryngeal cartilage can be traced back to the neural crest cells explaining this association. Thapa et al reported an omega-shaped, floppy epiglottis with redundant aryepiglottic folds, and exaggerated arytenoids in a 45-day-old infant with Waardenburg syndrome . An additional report outlined normal direct laryngoscopy, but difficulties passing an appropriate sized endotracheal tube (4.5 mm) due to sub-glottic resistance in a 4-year-old child . The trachea was eventually intubated with a 3.0 mm uncuffed endotracheal tube and the case proceeded uneventfully. Given these concerns, preoperative consultation with otolaryngology may be indicated based on the patient’s preoperative history and physical examination.\n\n【18】Embryologic research of the PAX3 gene, which is mutated in type 1 Waardenburg syndrome, has demonstrated its involvement in the septation of the primitive heart in mice, leading to a possible connection between congenital heart defects and Waardenburg syndrome including atrial septal defects and persistence of embryologic structures (persistent left superior vena cava) . Another report outlines the association of dilated cardiomyopathy in a Waardenburg syndrome patient; however, the authors did not provide a specific causal relationship, but rather speculated that it may have been an unrelated association . Given these potential associations, preoperative echocardiogram is suggested if the history or physical examination suggests associated cardiac involvement.\n\n【19】Additional somatic involvement of Waardenburg syndrome includes muscular hypoplasia of the upper extremities, flexion contractures in the wrist and hands, fused carpal bones, and syndactyl. These concerns may affect intraoperative positioning, placement of monitoring devices, and vascular access . Sensorineural hearing loss may impact perioperative communication. The use of speech amplification devices, sign language interpreters, or primarily written information may facilitate communication and improve the perioperative environment for these patients .\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】Waardenburg syndrome is a primary defect involving the division and migration of neural crest cells with involvement of melanocytes, facial and laryngeal cartilage, and the enteric autonomic nervous system. Phenotypic characteristics of Waardenburg syndrome include lack of pigmentation of the hair (white forelock), vibrant blue eyes or heterochromia due to lack of pigmentation of the iris or heterochromia, distinctive facial abnormalities (laterally displaced inner canthi and a wide nasal bridge), sensorineural hearing loss, and upper extremity malformations . Waardenburg syndrome is a neural crest cell proliferation disorder caused by mutation in the PAX3, SOX10, MLF 23, ENDN or EDNRB, or ENF genes. Although anesthesia-related information regarding anesthesia and airway management in Waardenburg syndrome is limited, specific facial features and muscle contractures with limited neck mobility may cause difficulties with both direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Neural crest cell mutations, particularly in the PAX3 gene, may also result in congenital heart disease, which should be assessed for prior to anesthetic care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0caa7d6d-4fef-4f68-8701-7d677681a591", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) is a complex and rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent skin and lung infections, dermatitis and elevated serum IgE concentrations . Davis and colleagues described this disease first as “Job’s syndrome” in two girls suffering from recurrent “cold” staphylococcal abscesses, pneumonia and neonatal-onset eczematoid rash . In 1972, the syndrome was characterized further by Buckley et al.  who found extremely high serum IgE levels in the patients. Since that time, other manifestations of the disease were established, like skeletal, connective tissue, cardiac, and brain abnormalities .\n\n【2】Most cases are sporadic, but at the present time, two forms of HIES are recognized: a dominant form, caused by mutations in STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and a recessive form for which a genetic cause is unclear  although some cases are due to mutations in the gene TYK2 . The dominant form (the classic HIES) is the commonest one, characterized by non-immunologic features including skeletal, connective tissue, and pulmonary abnormalities in addition to recurrent infections and eczema . This type was the one presented by the first reports of the disorder . In contrast, the recessive form lacks the somatic features and has severe recurrent viral infections, extreme eosinophilia and devastating neurologic complications .\n\n【3】This article presents 3 patients suffering from HIES that were followed in our hospital at different times and with different outcomes; then, a description of the clinical, laboratory and therapeutic aspects of the disease will be made.\n\n【4】Case Reports\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】The first patient was a woman, born in 1975, without consanguineous parents, but 3 of her 4 siblings died in the first 2 years of life (cause of the deaths unknown). Since birth, she suffered from recurrent herpetic keratitis of the eye, motivating a corneal transplant at seven years old, that was rejected three years later. She also had a history of atopic eczema, recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, multiple verrucae , infected cutaneous ulcers and dental abscesses, one episode of intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia , and multiple hospitalizations from recurrent infected bronchiectasis. The infectious agents identified were Haemophilus influenzae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp . Her IgE values ranged from 2000 to 5000 UI/mL. She was hospitalized almost every month because of infected bronchiectasis and hemoptysis (pulmonary artery embolization was necessary). She had poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens and started intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) in a dose of 0.4 g/kg/month. There was no change of the clinical picture. At 26 years old a spinocellular carcinoma in the vulva (T1N0M0) was diagnosed and she was submitted to surgery. She developed persistent respiratory insufficiency and died, at 27 years old, from one episode of infected bronchiectasis.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】The second patient was a woman born in 1976, with consanguineous grandparents (one healthy brother). She had a history of multiple infections of the eye, with three rejected corneal transplants. Recurrent respiratory infections were the rule in her life (the infectious agent identified was always Staphylococcus aureus ) with structural and functional respiratory abnormalities. She also had recurrent infections of other organs (otitis, skin abscesses and purulent gingivitis). It was described, from the records, a rough skin and scoliosis. Her IgE values ranged from 900 to 1500 UI/mL. It was described an increased activation of lymphocyte B (increased expression of CD23). At 21 years old, she started IVIg in an irregular basis (0.4 g/kg), because of poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens, and prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole because of persistent skin abscesses and respiratory infections. The quality of life was improved after this treatment, with decreased number of hospitalizations. At 28 years old she had an advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and started chemotherapy. She died two months later from sepsis.\n\n【9】Case 3\n\n【10】The third case is a man, born in 1985, that at present is followed in our hospital. There is no known consanguinity in the family, but he has a cousin with the same disease. Since childhood, there has been a history of recurrent pneumonias (Staphylococcus aureus) and purulent otitis. At 20 years old he was hospitalized because of skin abscesses in the buttocks and dental abscesses, treated with antibiotics. Months later he had corneal ulcer of the eye ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and prolonged febrile syndrome, and it was the first time he had contact with our team. We documented some characteristic features like prominent forehead, facial asymmetry, a broad nasal bridge, prognathism and rough skin with prominent pores, scoliosis, lack of some teeth, eczematoid dermatitis, oral candidiasis and central depression on the tongue. He had no abnormalities in lung imaging and respiratory functional tests. No cause for the fever was encountered. He started topic treatment with antibiotics, and also systemic empiric antibiotics and antifungal (ciprofloxacin, flucloxacilin, itraconazole,trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and albendazole). The fever and the ulcer were treated, although he maintains a chronic diminished visual acuity. His IgE levels are between 8000 and 24700 UI/mL and eosinophilia is 2 - 4 times higher than the normal range. The levels of IgE and eosinophilia never were correlated with the clinical status of the patient. He had a low response to polysaccharide antigens. Since then, he has been with IVIg 0.4 g/kg/month, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (960 mg twice a day) and vitamin C. Now he is 25 years old and no longer has new infections.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Clinical manifestations of HIES\n\n【13】HIES usually presents very early in life. The clinical manifestations of the dominant form are resumed here.\n\n【14】Almost all patients suffer from recurrent staphylococcal infections, beginning in infancy and predominantly involving the skin and lungs . A newborn pustular and eczematoid rashes are usually the first manifestations of the disease, typically affecting the face and scalp, with an eopsinophilic infiltrate and caused by Staphylococcus aureus . Boils are a classic finding . Trouble areas may persist in intertriginous areas such as the axillae, the inguinal region, or under the breasts . Recurrent pyogenic pneumonias are very common, starting in the childhood. They may present with fewer symptoms, leading to a subsequent delay in clinical presentation, contributing to advanced disease and significant tissue damage before identification and initiation of therapy .\n\n【15】In these patients, the degree of inflammatory symptoms is variable. The “cold” abscesses, without external signs of inflammation, initially described by Davis and colleagues , are common. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterium most frequently isolated, but Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , enteric Gram-negative bacteria, Candida and Aspergillus are also common. Pneumonia is frequently followed by pneumatocele or bronchiectasis, that are commonly superinfected by Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The secondary infections are more indolent and difficult to clear. These long-term infections are more frequently associated with mortality than the acute pyogenic infections, causing rupture into large pulmonary vessels with life-threatening hemoptysis or fungal dissemination to the brain, for example . Mucocutaneous candidiasis is the most common opportunistic infection. Several cases of pneumocystosis , cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis have also been reported .\n\n【16】The facial appearance is very characteristic: facial asymmetry, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, mild prognathism, and rough appearance of the facial skin with prominent pores . Some individuals retain their primary teeth, because of the failure of those teeth to exfoliate. The secondary teeth can be present simultaneously when the secondary teeth emerge before primaries have fallen out. Other features are central depressions in the tongue and high arch of the palate .\n\n【17】One of the most recent documented features are arterial aneurysms, which can be coronary and extra-coronary. We must recognize in the adult patients the high risk of myocardial infarction as the result of an aneurysm . Brain abnormalities, like T2-weighted hypersensities seen on brain MRI are also present, but gross neurologic abnormalities are not detected in the majority of patients with these findings . Ophthalmologic pathologies such as extensive xanthelasma, giant calazia and undefined tumors of the eyelid have been reported .\n\n【18】Osteoporosis is common , and other skeletal abnormalities include scoliosis, minimal trauma fractures, hyperextensibility, and degenerative joint disease .\n\n【19】An increased risk of malignancy is associated with this disorder, contributing to the high mortality. Several malignancies have been reported, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemia, and cancers of the vulva, liver and lung .\n\n【20】Laboratory investigations\n\n【21】Serum IgE concentrations are extremely high in patients with HIES (> 2000 IU/ml) sometimes even at the time of birth. The molecular mechanism of hyper-IgE-emia remains unclear . The IgE levels are not static: they usually are undetectable in cord blood and rise to the adult range slowly over the years, and can diminish again. Substantial fluctuation has been documented over time without any obvious change in clinical presentation . HIES patients have normal or decreased serum IgM, IgG and IgA levels, but most have defects of various types in the antigen-specific antibody response to immunization. IgG subclass deficiencies have been reported in some patients .\n\n【22】Eosinophilia is the other consistent laboratory finding . There is no correlation between eosinophilia and IgE levels or eosinophilia and infectious complications of HIES . Total white blood cell counts are normal but they often fail to elevate appropriately during acute infection .\n\n【23】An impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils or monocytes has been described, a defect that explains the “cold abscesses” presented by the patients .\n\n【24】There is a lack of other pathognomic laboratory signs .\n\n【25】Autosomal recessive HIES\n\n【26】Patients with the recessive form have no skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. They have recurrent or severe infections by Staphylocuccus aureus , Haemophilus influenzae , Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Cryptococcus , chronic refractory Molluscum contagiosum infections, recurrent aphtoid herpes simplex infections. They are also susceptible to intracellular bacteria (mycobacteria, Salmonella ). The neurological symptoms are more severe, from partial facial paralysis to hemiplegia. The levels of serum IgE are more elevated than the dominant form. Eosinophilia is also more severe .\n\n【27】Therapy of hyper-IgE syndromes\n\n【28】There is no cure for HIES yet. The consensus favors long-term prophylactic therapy of Staphylococcus aureus skin and lung infection with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole . The efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis remains unproven . If possible, the etiologic agent should guide treatment of pneumonia; bronchoscopy may be helpful . Because patients feel well and are unware of how severely ill they are, we need to have a low threshold for investigating slight changes .\n\n【29】IFN-gama had inconsistent effects on IgE levels . Intravenous immunoglobulin may decrease the number of infections for some patients .\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In the past five years, there was a significant improvement of the diagnosis of the HIES syndromes. These primary immunodeficiency disorders are rare and usually first manifest during childhood. Patients usually die prematurely due to pulmonary infections; early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving and can lead to a significant reduction in morbidity. To best diagnose and treat, we should be familiarized with the clinical and laboratorial aspects of the disease. Besides the infections, we should not forget the risk of malignancy that is associated with HIES. The long-term prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is mandatory. We hope that developmental, biochemical, and molecular studies should help us to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and lead to new therapies for patients with HIES.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Excessive doses can cause a wide variety of symptoms including, but not limited to increased state of arousal, euphoria, increased energy, talkativeness, agitation, visual hallucinations, cardiovascular manifestations and hyperthermia . Moreover, hepatotoxicity has been reported in the literature with no clear treatment recommendations .\n\n【2】N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a known medication used in the treatment of acetaminophen-induced hepatitis as well as other conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the use in influenza as well as other viral diseases such as COVID-19-induced hepatitis, and its use in cocaine-related liver injury; however, all still remains controversial . NAC works as a hepatoprotective agent via multiple mechanisms, including restoring hepatic glutathione (GSH), and serving as a GSH substitute .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 20-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with palpitations after ingesting 2 g of methamphetamine. He soon after became obtunded and was intubated for airway protection. He was later found to be hypertensive with a pressure of 160/86 mm Hg, hyperthermic with a temperature of 42 °C and tachycardic with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute. A few hours later, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a pressure of 82/59 mm Hg with minimal response to fluids, central line was placed and patient was started on norepinephrine. Physical exam showed an obtunded individual, with normal breath sounds in bilateral lung fields and an increased heart rate, with normal rhythm without murmurs.\n\n【5】On admission, the patient’s urine toxicology was positive for amphetamines, and laboratory findings (labs) showed an aspartate transaminase (AST) of 121 IU/L with an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 32 U/L and a protime/prothrombin time (PT) of 19.4 s with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 36.5 s with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.61, and a normal bilirubin.\n\n【6】Poison control was contacted and recommended supportive care with the initiation of NAC. Intravenous (IV) NAC loading dose followed by a maintenance dose was started around 6 h after admission.\n\n【7】Within 24 h of admission, the patient started to develop multi-organ failure including ALF with an AST of 1,324 IU/L, an ALT of 217 U/L, a PT of 25.8 s, a PTT of 43 s, an INR of 2.32 and a bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. On day 3 of hospital admission, the patient’s labs showed a bilirubin of 1.6 mg/dL, an AST of 2,350 IU/L, an ALT of 2,145 U/L, an INR of 3.19, a PTT of 44.8 s and a PT of 33.1 s. Conversely, his serum total protein and serum albumin reached a nadir around the same time period.\n\n【8】After 3 - 4 days of NAC therapy, there was a significant recovery in liver enzymes. The starting of normalization of AST, ALT and PT/INR/PTT was observed by day 5.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Hepatotoxicity secondary to recreational drug use, such as cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and amphetamines, has been documented in the literature, but no clear recommendations on its management have yet been given . Although dialysis is a very effective method of removing the drugs, NAC has shown promising effects in the management of ALF secondary to drug use . Studies have shown that NAC has a hepatoprotective effect and is suggested to be via multiple mechanisms of action, which includes antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects . The antioxidant ability of NAC to reduce the effect of oxidative stress is thought to be due to NAC’s ability to decrease free radicals via replenishment of depleted intra-hepatocytes GSH, and the stimulation of a few enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) . It had been previously reported in a study conducted on the hepatocytes of rats, that NAC has been used to protect from cocaine-induced liver injury by up-regulating antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD . NAC also has an anti-inflammatory effect, by decreasing the level of inflammatory cytokines released, and blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha activation by modulating TNF alpha receptors . On a cellular level, L-cysteine (L-cys) is a tripeptide (γ-glutamyl cysteinyl glycine) and is the rate-limiting amino acid needed for GSH synthesis, but it is poorly penetrated into the cells. NAC however, easily penetrates the cells and is then deacetylated into L-cys, thereby promoting GSH synthesis for reducing the effect of the oxidative stress that is responsible for the liver injury .\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Although not yet widely tested on human subjects, NAC has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that may help with drug-induced liver injury. It was successfully used in treating our patient’s amphetamine-induced acute hepatic failure. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted to investigate the extended role of NAC in treating such cases of acute liver injury/failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

These include chondrolipoma and chondroid lipoma. Chondrolipomas are defined as benign tumors containing mature cartilage and adipose tissue while chondroid lipoma contains immature cartilage. We report a chondrolipoma occurring in the anterior floor of the mouth, a site not previously described.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 56-year-old Caucasian male presented with an asymptomatic mass in the floor of the mouth, which had doubled in size during the previous 6 months. Past medical history was positive for hypothyroidism treated with synthroid.

{"seq_id": "316c90b9-3f34-4eb7-9ffd-2b0d185b4b86", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Transradial access for coronary angiography and intervention has become increasingly popular and is even recommended as the default coronary intervention strategy by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) . Access site vascular complications, including hematomas, retroperitoneal hematomas, arteriovenous (AV) fistula, pseudoaneurysms, and arterial dissection/occlusion have all been shown to be significantly reduced via the transradial approach compared to the transfemoral approach .\n\n【2】AV fistula formation is caused by needle deviation through a vein resulting in a combined artery and vein puncture . If this communication fails to heal, then a fistula is formed. The majority of literature on transradial AV fistula is based on case reports, with timing of AV fistula diagnosis ranging from weeks up to 1 year post-angiography. We present a rare case of AV fistula formation as an early complication of transradial angiography.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 76-year-old man with a background history of mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) on warfarin anticoagulation presented with syncopal episodes and chest pains. He had a permanent pacemaker (PPM) inserted for sinus bradycardia with trifascicular block on ECG. He also underwent diagnostic transradial coronary angiography using a 5-French radial sheath with Judkins 3.5 catheters (Terumo Medical Corporation) which revealed significant calcification and stenosis in mid right coronary artery (RCA). A decision was made for elective rotablation and stenting of RCA 1 month post-PPM with pre-procedural warfarin cessation and bridging anticoagulation via clexane. No complication was noted following initial angiography.\n\n【5】The rotablation and stenting to the RCA was again performed via right radial approach using 6-French radial sheath (Terumo Medical Corporation). Pre-procedural Allen’s test was normal. Anticoagulation was administered with heparin 12,000 units. The RCA lesion was wired with a 0.014 inch Runthrough Extra Floppy wire (Terumo Medical Corporation) with balloon exchange to a Rota-Floppy wire (Boston Scientific). The heavily calcified RCA lesion was rotablated with a 1.5 mm burr (Boston Scientific), following which pre-dilation was performed with serial noncompliant balloons (Boston Scientific; Abbott Vascular). A 3.5 × 28 mm bare metal multi-link stent (Abbott Vascular) was deployed and post-dilation was done with a 3.5 mm balloon to 18 atmospheres pressure (Abbott Vascular). The radial artery sheath was removed immediately after the procedure and hemostasis was achieved by application of an adjustable plastic clamp of the radial artery (TR Terumo band). The clamp was gradually released over few hours while the access site was monitored for bleeding and hematoma. Patient was commenced on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), and his warfarin was recommenced with bridging clexane cover.\n\n【6】On day 5 post-procedure, patient complained of pulsatile swelling with minimal tenderness on palpation over the right radial artery. He did not complain of finger claudication or numbness, and the Allen’s test remained normal. An ultrasound Doppler was arranged which confirmed small AV fistula connecting the right radial artery with a superficial vein over the access site . The AV fistula was managed conservatively with TR Terumo band application for 24 h and limb elevation. No alteration to his anti-thrombotic therapy was made. The patient had a follow-up Doppler US after 1 month which showed resolution of the AV fistula .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The benefits of using radial artery as angiography access, which is a superficial and readily compressible artery compared to the femoral artery , have been shown in multiple observational and randomized controlled studies. The 2012 randomized controlled RIVAL study showed that access site complications were significantly less in the transradial group (1.4%) compared to the transfemoral group (3.8%) . Similar rates have been reported by a systematic review with vascular complication rates of 0.59% via transradial approach compared to 3.71% via transfemoral approach . In addition, transradial access is associated with earlier ambulation, greater patient comfort, and earlier discharges from the hospital .\n\n【9】The low incidence of AV fistula formation complicating transradial coronary angiography is illustrated in a recent large case series of 10,324 patients by Tatli et al, where only four cases of AV fistula were documented . Patients with iatrogenic radial AV fistula are usually asymptomatic and typically present with a pulsatile mass, thrill, or bruit over the wrist . The time to diagnosis can be variable from weeks up to a year from the angiography procedure. In our case, our patient first noticed his pulsatile mass 5 days after his procedure, which was relatively early in onset.\n\n【10】Duplex ultrasonography is the routine screening test for patients with suspected AV fistula . Factors have been identified which increases the risk of iatrogenic femoral AV fistula, although it is unclear whether they apply to transradial angiography as well. These factors were female sex, age more than 60, hypertension, prolonged warfarin therapy, and high heparin dose during interventions . In line with this, recommendations have been quoted in the literature to potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic AV fistula formation, including use of sheath sizes less than the arterial diameter, limitation on the number of arterial puncture attempts, gentle catheter manipulation and use of ultrasound guided needle placement to provide real time anatomic information on proximity of the radial artery to nearby veins .\n\n【11】This report also reviewed existing literature on management strategies for iatrogenic radial AV fistula. The natural history of radial AV fistula is thought to be benign with most cases resolving spontaneously , although serious consequences in the form of high output cardiac failure and distal limb ischemia can potentially occur. As in transfemoral AV fistula, three management strategies have been explored in transradial AV fistula, namely conservative management (including mechanical compression), implantation of covered stents and surgical repair .\n\n【12】Earlier case reports on radial AV fistula have all utilized the use of surgical ligation, with a range of presentation from 2 months post-angiography up to 1 year  . Out of the four AV fistula cases from Tatli et al, only one case required surgical ligation . No complications from the surgical ligation itself were identified from these cases. The authors of this report have identified one case involving the use a covered stent . However, unlike transfemoral cases, the practicality of this technique is limited by the small size of the radial artery, and the potential risk of restenosis .\n\n【13】Conservative management of radial AV fistula was reported on a patient who had this complication 1 month post-angiography . The fistula failed to resolve on 1-year follow-up but due to ongoing stable hemodynamic status, the management approach was continued. Seventy-five percent of the radial AV fistula cases reported by Tatli et al resolved with mechanical compression for 72 h and vertical arm rest . In view of this, these studies have recommended that a conservative approach be the first-line treatment option for patients with AV fistula formation. Our experience with this early case of AV fistula provides further support to this management approach, with successful resolution following conservative treatment mechanical compression for 24 h.\n\n【14】In conclusion, AV fistula is a rare complication from transradial angiography. The authors of this report agree that a conservative approach should be the default first-line treatment option for patient with this unusual complication. Invasive approaches, in turn, should be reserved for patients who have evidence of limb ischemia and/or cardiac insufficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9043a8d1-6503-4f87-81c0-6b4f4319ebe4", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Chest wall rigidity secondary to fentanyl usage is a recognized side effect of fentanyl. It presents with sudden onset of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and worsening of lung compliance. It is a medical emergency but is difficult to diagnose as there are many differential diagnoses to this presentation. There have been case reports of chest wall rigidity reported as complications of post-operative fentanyl usage as analgesia. Complications have also occurred when it has been used also as a sedative and analgesic agent for short procedures like bronchoscopy.\n\n【2】Here we describe a case of a patient with a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) with repeated sudden onset of type 2 respiratory failure while on high doses of sedation and analgesia with fentanyl and propofol. This was eventually attributed to fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient is an 80-year-old woman, who presented to the hospital with fever and productive cough with yellowish expectoration of 2 days duration. She also had lethargy over the same period and had sick contacts in the form of two daughters who both had recently recovered from a “flu-like” illness. She was known to have bronchial asthma treated with seretide 25/250 two puffs ON + PO monteleukast 10 mg ON, hypertension treated with PO losartan 50 mg BD, type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with PO linagliptin 5 mg OM and a previous right thalamic ischemic stroke 5 years ago for which she was on PO clopidogrel 75 mg OM and PO simvastatin.\n\n【5】The patient had a total of two admissions to the medical ICU. The patient was initially admitted to general ward for treatment of possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation and started empirically on intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but had worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia in the ward requiring intubation and transfer to medical ICU for invasive ventilatory support.\n\n【6】She was put on volume control mode ventilation with a tidal volume (TV) of 8 mL/kg ideal body weight and started on light sedation with intravenous propofol (30 - 50 mg/h) and fentanyl (30 - 50 µg/h) infusions post-intubation for comfort. She was given intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone 100 mg × q6h and inhaled bronchodilators for her asthma. Antibiotics were escalated empirically to IV meropenem. On day 2 of ICU stay, propofol and fentanyl infusions were discontinued and she was switched to pressure support mode of ventilation. She was given a total of 10 days of carbapenem cover. She required a slow wean from the ventilator over the next few days and was extubated to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) on day 7. Trials to wean her off NIV were unsuccessful.\n\n【7】The patient required re-intubation for decompensated type 2 respiratory failure after 2 weeks of weaning trials in the wards. She was put on pressure-regulated volume-controlled (PRVC) mode ventilation and started on low-dose fentanyl and propofol infusions for sedation and analgesia. Serial chest X-rays (CXRs) done were suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia and the patient was treated with empiric IV antibiotics (piperacillin + tazobactam) and inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol/ipratropium) with IV steroids for possible asthma exacerbation.\n\n【8】On day 3 of her second ICU stay, the patient required increasing doses of sedation due to agitation. Sedation and analgesia were increased gradually from 50 mg/h of propofol to 100 mg/h of propofol. Fentanyl was also increased from 30 to 100 mg/h. Paradoxically, on increasing her sedation and analgesia, the patient was noted to have episodic severe discordant breathing with prolonged expiratory phase with breath-holding with severe ventilator desynchrony. Peak airway pressures were high (> 50 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O) and generated TVs were low (about 50 - 100 mL) despite increasing pressure limits on the ventilator. No wheezing was heard on auscultation of her chest and plateau airway pressure remained low (15 - 20 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O). The endotracheal tube was patent and airway secretions were minimal. Repeat CXR done did not show any evidence of pneumothorax or new infiltrates. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes performed did not show any acute changes. Multiple ventilatory modes were tried (pressure control, volume control, PRVC) without any improvement in ventilation. Because of extremely low TVs, the ventilator was changed to exclude a leak which was less likely given the high airway pressures. She was empirically treated with IV steroids and also given multiple puffs of bronchodilator with no significant improvement. End-tidal carbon dioxide tracing showed rising trend and serial arterial blood gas showed worsening respiratory acidosis (pH 7.27, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 52.9). She was put on increasing doses of sedation (propofol 150 mg/h and fentanyl 160 µg/h). She responded well to boluses of muscle relaxants with subsequent improvement in ventilation and lowering of airway pressures dramatically. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was done and did not show any central cause for the hypercarbia.\n\n【9】From day 3 to 4, an attempt was made to wean down the propofol infusion. However, all efforts at weaning off the propofol infusion were met by repeat episodes of ventilator desynchrony, low minute volumes and breath-holding. Each episode of high peak pressure and low minute volumes was evaluated systemically. There was no response to bronchodilators, no worsening of the CXR and no pneumothorax. These episodes were aborted with small boluses of propofol of 10 - 20 mg. At this time, a diagnosis of possible fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity was considered and the patient was taken off fentanyl and continued on propofol infusion. IV dexmedetomidine infusion was started for the patient with the propofol infusion. A dramatic improvement in breathing pattern was noted. There were no more episodes of ventilator asynchrony, low TVs and high airway pressures. The propofol infusion was weaned down with the dexmedetomidine infusion. If there were episodes of agitation, they were briefly aborted with boluses of propofol. The patient was switched to pressure support mode ventilation the next day with no further episodes of desynchrony.\n\n【10】Because of prolonged ventilation and difficulty in weaning as a result of deconditioning for repeated ICU admission, the patient underwent an elective tracheostomy. She was given low-dose IV fentanyl peri-tracheostomy and tolerated it well without any further respiratory distress. Further ICU stay was uneventful and she was gradually weaned off the ventilator completely and transferred out of ICU.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Chest wall rigidity secondary to opioid usage is an uncommon side effect of using fentanyl that was first described in 1953 . Majority of case reports in opioid-induced chest wall rigidity were done describing patients who developed it during induction of anesthesia . There have been episodes of chest wall rigidity that have been reported developed after patients were administered small doses of fentanyl pre-procedure for bronchoscopy .\n\n【13】In ICUs, fentanyl is commonly used as analgesia and also for sedation. The incidence of chest wall rigidity secondary to fentanyl is unknown and likely to be under-reported as this is a diagnosis of exclusion that is clinically determined. Majority of cases have been reported as a result of using large doses of fentanyl after surgery in the surgical ICU . In our case, fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity occurred during the usage of fentanyl for sedation and analgesia in routine ICU management.\n\n【14】Doctors have attempted to manage fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity via two methods. One is the administration of opioid antagonist naloxone. The second method is the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents . In these cases, the effect of the treatment is dramatic. The reversal of the pathophysiology is quick and ventilation normalization occurs quickly.\n\n【15】Opioid-induced chest wall rigidity is characterized by increase in muscle tone in the thoracic and abdominal muscles after exposure to fentanyl. This leads to difficulty in ventilation. Diagnosis is challenging as there is no objective measure of measuring muscle rigidity. In our patient, she was obese and the additional fat tissue makes assessment even more subjective. Hence a high degree of clinical suspicion is required for diagnosis.\n\n【16】This phenomenon can happen both with high doses and low doses of fentanyl. Fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity has usually been reported with high doses of fentanyl (17 µg/kg) . In our case, the patient was administered fentanyl up to 180 µg/h as an infusion for a prolonged duration, extending the half-life to 12 to 14 h because of context-sensitive half-life. Bolus was also given to the patient. In the patient’s first admission, a low dose of fentanyl of 50 µg/h was administered to the patient without any issue. In her case, high-dose exposure to fentanyl triggered off the chest wall rigidity. But it is also known that chest wall rigidity can develop even with small boluses of 100 µg of fentanyl .\n\n【17】We have reported a case of fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity as a cause of acute type 2 respiratory failure in the ICU that was diagnosed late in the course of illness. This diagnosis is difficult as sudden onset of type 2 respiratory failure with minimal TVs but extremely high airway pressures has many confounding differential diagnoses. A systematic approach is required in the evaluation as the diagnosis of fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patient was evaluated for asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, inapt ventilator settings, pneumothorax, worsening of lung compliance secondary to pneumonia and even an underlying central neurological disorder. There was no wheezing noted on clinical examination. The patient was still treated with bronchodilators. Issues with ventilator were evaluated by disconnection which did not demonstrate dynamic hyperinflation and excluded leakage. The endotracheal tube was checked and all kinks or obstruction to the airway tube were excluded. The ventilator was also changed. Lung ultrasound did not support the diagnosis of pneumothorax. This was confirmed with a CXR, which did not suggest worsening pneumonia or new consolidation.\n\n【18】None of the investigations yielded significant findings leading to a diagnosis. The diagnosis of chest wall rigidity was considered late and until the diagnosis was considered, the strategy to abort this sudden presentation of patient-ventilator asynchrony was the usage of neuromuscular blocking agents and small boluses of propofol. The patient continued to experience acute worsening of respiratory function which was not ideal from the management point of view. Improvement only occurred when fentanyl was discontinued completely and this was over a 24-h period.\n\n【19】The near-continuous infusion of high doses of fentanyl that the patient received likely contributed to a prolonged effect of fentanyl in the body system because of a lengthened context-sensitive half-life. In her case, the fentanyl was replaced with the usage of infusion dexmedetomidine. In other cases of fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity, physicians used morphine infusions and hydromorphone infusions in place of fentanyl with success. Based on our experience, dexmedetomidine can also be considered as a reasonable alternative.\n\n【20】At this point, the pathophysiology of chest wall rigidity secondary to fentanyl remains unclear and is supported only by experimental studies. Mechanism of action for the chest wall rigidity includes activation of central mu receptors, stimulation of central dopaminergic and nor-adrenergic pathway .\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Fentanyl is a common analgesic used in the ICU. It has a reasonable side effect profile. Chest wall rigidity is an uncommon side effect that can be treated effectively with muscle relaxant and naloxone. Most importantly, fentanyl needs to be withdrawn upon diagnosis. The experience shared in this case report highlights the need to consider chest wall rigidity as an iatrogenic cause of respiratory failure in the ICU in unexplained acute causes of respiratory failure even if the exposure to fentanyl is low. This will allow early diagnosis, timely intervention and reduce the length of time spent in the ICU and on the ventilator.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Monosomy X is the most common cause of the syndrome. Other numeric or structural abnormalities of one of the X chromosomes might also appear (mosaicism, isochromosome Xq, deletions of the p or q arm of one of the X chromosomes, X ring etc) . Growth retardation, hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism due to streak ovaries, and specific phenotypic features are classical manifestations of the syndrome. Visceral malformations are common in Turner syndrome and do not correlate with the chromosomal change . Girls with Turner syndrome are also at risk for autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroidits . Cardiovascular abnormalities are common in Turner syndrome mostly affecting aortic isthmus and arch . Broad spectrum of anomalies has been described: elongation of the transverse arch, aortic coarctation, and aberrant right subclavian artery . Douchin S et al found any of the mentioned anomalies in 30% of patients with Turner syndrome. On a large number of patients they found bicuspid aortic valve in 19.2%, abnormalities of the aortic isthmus in 15.4%, kinking aorta or coarctation, and aortic regurgitation in 7.7%, mitral stenosis in 3.8%, partial anomalous venous drenage in 3.8%, patent ductus arteriosus in 3.8%, and left superior vena cava in 11.5% . Other authors report that 45 - 50% of patients with Turner syndrome have cardiovascular anomalies. Many other abnormalities of the arterial, venous and lymphatic vessels have been described in case reports .

She was born after a normal pregnancy, at term, with birth weight 2000 g, and length 47 cm. Her motor development was delayed; she started to walk alone at the age of 4 years, stopped wetting bed at 5 years, and was enrolled at school at the age of 9 years. Cardiac murmur was detected in infancy, however, it was considered functional; only follow up was recommended. At the age of 6 years, hypertension of 160/100 mmHg was detected. Electrolytes were within normal range, potassium 4.5 mmol/L (3.6 - 5), sodium 139 mmol/L , calcium 2.35 mmol/L (2.10 - 2.55). Urea was 6.0 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.1), and creatinine was 58 mol/L . Ultrasound revealed horseshoe kidney. Therapy with ACE II inhibitor (enalapril) was initiated. No further analyses were performed until the age of 10 years when she was referred to hospital for the control of the delayed growth, hypertension, and severe headaches.\n\n【4】At admission she was a slim and short girl (height and weight 3 SD below the mean for the age). She had some dysmorphic features: micrognathia, irregular teeth, low set ears, anti-mongoloid slanted orbits, hypoplastic nipples, and cubitus valgus. Turner syndrome was confirmed by karyotype analysis (45, X0). FSH and LH levels were increased, 95.1U/L and 12/7 U/L respectively. Estrogens were low (0.025 ng/ml). Hypoplastic uterus and streak ovaries were seen on ultrasound.\n\n【5】The major problem of this girl was a permanent and severe hypertension accompanied with severe headaches. Continuous 24 hours monitoring of the blood pressure showed permanent hypertension with an average of 150/100 mmHg. Catecholamines in the urine were normal. She had cardiac 2/6 systolic murmur. Femoral artery pulse was weaker on palpation. Blood pressure on the lower limbs was 110/80 mmHg. Doppler pletismography showed attenuated pulsations on the lower limbs. On ultrasound of the hearth, dilated and elongated aortic arch was detected, with subsequent continuous narrowing towards abdominal aorta. Hypertrophy of the myocardium of the left hearth chamber and septum were seen . Aortography confirmed enlarged and elongated arch of the aorta and narrowing of the aorta all the way to the renal arteries. At the renal angiography several hypoplastic renal arteries were detected at each port of the horseshoe kidney, finding consistent with MAS. Numerous collateral vessels emerging from the abdominal aorta were also detected .\n\n【6】Other problems of the patient consistent with Turner syndrome were also addressed. During the follow up, she developed autoimmune hypothyroidism. TSH was 72.99 mU/ml, with increased thyroid antibodies; anti mitochondrial antibodies were > 250 U/ml (ref < 60 U/ml), and anti thyroglobulin antibodies were 86.20 U/ml (ref < 60 U/ml). Therapy with Levothyroxine was introduced and she is on this treatment continuously with normal results of TSH subsequently.\n\n【7】Growth hormone values were normal. She was introduced on therapy with GH at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg/d with a modest effect (she grew 5 cm during a year of treatment).\n\n【8】The girl was followed up for 10 years. Her final height was 148 cm, and puberty was successfully introduced using estrogen patches and cyclic estrogen/progesterone therapy.\n\n【9】Although most of the findings in this girl were typical for Turner syndrome, to our knowledge, this is a first patient with Turner syndrome accompanied with MAS.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Cardiovascular malformations and complications are common in Turner syndrome with a prevalence ranging from 17 - 45% . Coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve, alone or in combination comprise 50% of cardiac malformations . Other vascular anomalies such as pulmonary, duodenal and jugular vascular anomalies have been described . Venous anomalies have also been reported . Structure of the large arteries differs in Turner women compared to healthy controls which might contribute to the vascular complications . Aortic dissection is among the most severe complications of the bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta. Aortic root diameter has been found normal according to the area of body surface in Turner girls although it is larger compared with the diameter in the general population with the same body surface . This finding is less pronounced in adolescents compared with adult patients . It is not known whether the baseline aortic diameter changes over time since no longitudinal studies of aortic root diameter changes in Turner women have been reported.\n\n【12】Hypertension is a frequent finding in Turner girls and women. About 1 in 3 young girls and 1 in 2 adults have a high blood pressure requiring treatment. Most of these hypertensive patients in adulthood will have essential hypertension. In young girls it is due to the coarctation of the aorta or kidney malformations that are variable and more common in Turner girls than in the general population. Horseshoe kidney does not regularly cause hypertension. Our patient, in addition to the horseshoe kidney had severe hypoplastic renal arteries due to MAS which was probably the main cause of severe hypertension and difficulties in the treatment. Hypertension is perceived as a common reason for aortic dissection. In a series of 101 Turner patients Mortensen KH at al. performing cardiovascular magnetic resonance found dilatation of aorta in all checked points including the descendent part. They confirmed the association of a larger aortic caliber with the rate of dissection .\n\n【13】MAS is an uncommon condition characterized with narrowing of abdominal aorta and stenosis of its major branches. Total of 102 cases were analyzed by Setha BC et al where the mean age at diagnosis was 14.3 years . Although it appears mostly in children and young adults, several newborns and premature infant with this syndrome have been recently described . Smooth segmental narrowing of the abdominal aorta with concomitant stenosis at the origins of the renal arteries was detected in 91% of the patients . Hypertension was a leading sign, and angiography was the method of choice for the diagnosis even in the youngest age group. Thus, our patient has all vascular characteristics of MAS. Some of the patients had different syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, Williams syndrome and persistent eosinophillia . Findings in our patient suggest that MAS should be sought in Turner patients also, especially if a refractory hypertension is detected. One can speculate that if aortic lumen is investigated by angiography, more hypertensive patients with Turner syndrome might be found to have MAS. In rare occasions, as in our patient, even ultrasound examination could point to MAS . Recently, computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are proposed as a method of choice for the confirmation of the diagnosis . Collateral widening of the blood vessels is a regular finding in these patients and was present in our patient. Collaterals prolong the survival of the kidneys which will suffer hypo-perfusion eventually. Kidney damage is a cause of death in patients with MAS before the fifth decade of life if not treated surgically. Aortic by-pass grafting is a method of choice for treatment of MAS. The timing is usually dependent upon the possibility for conservative control of the hypertension . Reported medical management options include percutaneous intervention, renal auto transplantation, and bypass of diseased portions of the aorta with prosthetic or autologous conduits. Operative treatment is not always easy and depends on the lumen and position of the stenosis . In our patient, it was not possible due to the extremely narrow lumen and position of the renal arteries.\n\n【14】In conclusion, we present a new aortic anomaly, e.g. MAS in a patient with Turner syndrome accompanied by horseshoe kidney, and we suggest that in patients with Turner syndrome who have hypertension, the aortic evaluation should encompass all length of the aorta rather than the aortic arch only.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

GrMF is caused by unusual expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 T lymphocytes, a part of immune system. GrMF has an incidence of 1 in 100,000 - 350,000. Most cases are in people 40 - 55 years of age. It is twice more common in males than in females. The granulomatous component may be intense and obscures the lymphomatous component in some patients . We present a 51-year-old female with significant plaque measuring about 10 cm in the L3 - L5 lumbar area and a similar plaque in the region of right ankle which was initially diagnosed as sarcoid granulomatous dermatitis on immunohistopathology. It was later diagnosed as GrMF on repeat biopsies of the plaques. GrMF simulating sarcoidosis has rarely been reported in literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 51-year-old Caucasian woman with diabetes, hyperlipidemia and chronic pain initially presented to the clinic after she noticed a patch associated with pruritus on her right ankle, below medial malleolus. A similar lesion was found on her back in L3 - L5 dermatomal region . Further history and exam were largely unremarkable. Skin biopsy with immunohistopathology of the two regions showed areas of epithelioid histiocytes with multinucleated giant cells mixed with a significant lymphocyte component. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen showed no adenopathy. The granulomatous reaction was initially diagnosed as sarcoidosis, and was started on corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there was no improvement in the lesions.\n\n【4】Subsequently few years later, two other biopsies of the hyperpigmented and erythematous plaques were performed. Immunohistochemical staining of the specimen composed of T-helper cell subtypes CD2+, CD3+, CD5+ with partial loss of CD7. Numerous T-suppressor/CD8+ subsets was seen with none expressing B-cell markers. There was prominent positivity of numerous histiocytes with CD4. A few rare cells stained CD30+. Loss of one or more of the pan T-cell markers, mostly CD5/CD7 is common in mycosis fungoides. Twenty percent of early mycosis fungoides show CD8+ . Molecular studies with T-cell receptor gene rearrangement showed evidence of T-cell clonality, favoring diagnosis of GrMF.\n\n【5】Bone marrow biopsy was unrevealing, dismissing the possibility of systemic involvement. TNM classification was T1 N0 M0 (stage Ib). Patient skin lesions were refractory to ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy. Hence, immunotherapy with brentuximab was initiated. Patient initially responded to this treatment with mild improvement of the plaques. However, she later developed significant numbness and tingling of the toes as an adverse effect of brentuximab, leading to its discontinuation. The biopsy at this stage stained positive for CD30. Finally, radiation therapy was started, following which the lesion showed marked improvement in its appearance .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Mycosis fungoides is the most commonly described primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. GrMF is a rare subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma first described by Ackerman and Flaxman in 1970. GrMF is characterized by dermal invasion of T cells with associated epithelioid and giant cells. It typically affects middle-aged adults and may present initially as a patch and then progresses to plaque and eventually evolve into a tumor in some individuals. In different studies, it is also found that there is a slightly increased incidence of lympho-proliferative disease, occurring after chronic sarcoidosis, probably as a consequence of immunologic abnormalities observed in lymphoproliferative disease .\n\n【8】A strong granulomatous component can sometimes obscure the underlying cutaneous lymphoma, which is mistaken for cutaneous sarcoidosis . Only few cases have been reported in literature about GrMF being mistaken for sarcoidosis as depicted in our case . In most cases, cutaneous granulomatous lesions follow the course of underlying lymphoproliferative disease and are considered as a possible malignant lymphoma .\n\n【9】Diagnosis can be challenging due to heterogeneous clinical and histopathological features. No particular diagnostic clinical criteria are available for diagnosis of GrMF, because of its variable presentations and hence the detection of GrMF is primarily considered histopathology diagnosis .\n\n【10】Histologically, GrMF shows dermal T-cell intrusion with epithelioid and giant cell granulomas without necrosis mimicking other granulomatous disease like sarcoidosis. Variants may be misleading simulating other inflammatory dermopathies when the epithelioid and giant cell feature dominates . Distinct clinical characteristics are not present. Apart from granulomatous formation, no other noticeable features are evident. The same features were seen in our patient, which misdirected the diagnosis as sarcoidosis. The International Society of Cutaneous Lymphoma consensus algorithm advocates immunophenotyping and molecular gene rearrangement studies to aid clinic-pathological diagnosis of GrMF .\n\n【11】Patients with stage 4 disease, advanced age, blacks have worse prognosis, while a survival rate of stage 1 disease is more than 20 years. The clinical significance of granulomas in prognostication of mycosis fungoides is uncertain as both indolent and aggressive cases have been described.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】GrMF is a diagnostic challenge, in the light of perplexing histopathological variants. Our case adds to growing number of GrMF cases misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis highlighting the plight of diagnostic obstacles. When the patient’s clinical course does not support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the coexistence of granulomas and typical histologic features of mycosis fungoides should indicate GrMF. Clinical dissection of atypical clinic-pathological variants coupled with immunophenotyping and molecular genetics, is crucial for early diagnosis and accurate treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a531911c-1616-4eef-b7f3-780647106f78", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Recent attention has been focused on the potential deleterious neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia during infancy and early life . Although the exact implications of this effect have yet to be proven, media attention has been raised and many parents are aware of the potential for such problems . The potential neurocognitive effects of various general anesthetic agents have been demonstrated in laboratory animals and suggested from retrospective clinical trials . The anesthetic agents identified as possible neurotoxins include either γ-amino-butyric-acid (GABA) agonists including the volatile anesthetic agents, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and propofol or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as nitrous oxide or ketamine. Although spinal and regional anesthesia are acceptable alternatives and have seen increased use in an attempt to eliminate the concerns of such problems, many surgical procedures may not be amenable to regional anesthesia .\n\n【2】We report a 3-year-old boy presenting for excision of an enlarging left ear cyst. During the preoperative visit with the surgeon, the patient’s mother expressed concerns regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia. General anesthesia was provided using a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. Previous reports of the use of this unique combination of agents are reviewed and its potential role in this scenario was discussed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for presentation of single case reports at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). The patient was a 3-year-old, 14 kg boy who presented for excision of a left ear cyst that had been enlarging over the past 11 months. His past medical history included varicella, parainfluenza respiratory infection, hand-foot-mouth disease, and a single episode of a febrile seizure at 17 months of age. There was no past surgical history. The patient had no ongoing co-morbid conditions and he was not taking any regularly scheduled medications. Preoperative physical examination revealed a young child in no acute distress. Preoperative laboratory evaluation was normal. The patient was admitted on the day of his surgery. During the preoperative surgical visit, the mother had expressed concerns regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia. These concerns were based on information from various internet sites and the media. Based on these concerns, it was decided to proceed with a general anesthesia using dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. Two options were presented for obtaining intravenous (IV) access including either a brief exposure to sevoflurane and nitrous oxide or a topical anesthetic cream with awake IV cannulation. The mother chose brief exposure to sevoflurane; however, premedication with oral midazolam was declined. The patient was held nil per os for solids for 6 h and for clear liquids for 4 h prior to surgery. The patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Preoperative hemodynamic data included blood pressure (BP) 90/58 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) 97 beats/min. Seventy percent nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via face mask for 60 s followed by the administration of 8% sevoflurane. Peripheral IV cannulation was achieved within 2 min and the nitrous oxide and sevoflurane were discontinued. Dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg) and fentanyl (1.5 µg/kg) were administered intravenously over 1 - 2 min as a bolus dose and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were started at 1 μg/kg/h and 0.2 μg/kg/min, respectively. To ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia, a bispectral index (BIS) monitor was placed. Due to technical problems, only intermittent readings were able to be obtained, ranging from 40 to 60. Sensory nerve supply to the ear was blocked by local subcutaneous infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:200,000). Spontaneous ventilation was maintained throughout the case with an inspired oxygen concentration of 40-50%. Intraoperatively, the HR varied from 90 to 130 beats/min. The BP was well maintained during the intraoperative course (BP: 70 - 100/40 - 50 mm Hg). No abrupt changes in oxygen saturation or end-tidal carbon dioxide were noted. The remainder of the intraoperative course was unremarkable. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 70 min. At the conclusion of the procedure, the dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were discontinued. The wake-up time from the completion of the surgical procedure to removal of the LMA was 1 - 2 min. The patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The remainder of his postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged home on the same day.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Dexmedetomidine is an α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonist which initially received approval by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 for the sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation. In 2009, it subsequently received FDA approval for monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Although only FDA approved for use in adults, dexmedetomidine has been shown to be efficacious in several different clinical scenarios in infants and children including sedation during mechanical ventilation, procedural sedation, supplementation of postoperative analgesia, prevention of emergence delirium, and treatment of withdrawal . However, to date, there are limited reports of its use as the primary part of a general anesthetic regimen .\n\n【7】Beneficial and protective effects on the central nervous system during hypoxia or ischemia have been demonstrated with dexmedetomidine in animal studies . Unlike agents that act as GABA agonists or NMDA antagonists, animal data have demonstrated limited impact on apoptosis and neurocognitive outcome . In addition to its lack of pro-apoptotic effect, dexmedetomidine has been shown to decrease the pro-apoptotic effect of the volatile anesthetic agent, isoflurane, in laboratory animals .\n\n【8】Remifentanil is a synthetic opioid derivative that was introduced into clinical practice in the United States in 1996 . It has a strong affinity for μ opioid receptors with less affinity for other opioid receptors (κ and σ). Its potency and respiratory depressant effect is generally considered to be twice that of fentanyl. However, its half-life is significantly shorter due to modification of its chemical structure with the incorporation of a methyl-ester ring into the molecule thereby allowing its hydrolysis by non-specific plasma and tissue esterases. These characteristics result in a unique pharmacokinetic profile with a rapid onset, easy titration by continuous infusion, and a short context-sensitive half-life with rapid elimination across all age ranges, including neonates. These characteristics make it a valuable agent for the provision of intense intraoperative analgesia with a rapid recovery regardless of the dose or duration of the infusion. Furthermore, the opioids have been shown in laboratory animals to have limited pro-apoptotic effects . In particular, remifentanil has been shown to have neuroprotective effects during ischemia in laboratory animals and potentially the ability to blunt the pro-apoptotic effects of other agents .\n\n【9】In our patient, the mother had requested the use of “neuro-safe” medications given her concerns following her reading of articles from the internet and publications from the lay press. As such, we chose a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil, two medications which have been shown in laboratory animals to be free of pro-apoptotic effects. When choosing this anesthetic, several concerns were encountered including whether premedication with midazolam should be used given concerns regarding benzodiazepines and their agonism at GABA receptors. Although our common practice includes the use of oral midazolam for anxiolysis to prevent separation anxiety, alternatives include parental presence or the use of other distraction techniques to avoid the need for such medications . Alternatively, although onset times may be longer than oral midazolam, both oral and intranasal dexmedetomidine have been used for premedication prior to anesthetic induction.\n\n【10】Another aspect of concern was the technique for IV cannulation as this is usually performed following the induction of general anesthesia with sevoflurane in pediatric patients. After discussion with the mother, it was decided to proceed without premedication, but to briefly administer nitrous oxide with sevoflurane to allow for placement of an intravenous cannula. Alternatively, use of a topical anesthetic cream may provide an alternative for awake venous cannulation without the need for sevoflurane or nitrous oxide. The presence of an IV cannula would also allow the preoperative administration of IV dexmedetomidine which may be used to facilitate parental separation and transport to the operating room.\n\n【11】Following placement of the IV cannula, the sevoflurane was discontinued and a bolus dose of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine was administered followed by placement of an LMA. Maintenance anesthesia was provided by continuous infusions of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil, which were started at 1.0 μg/kg/h and 0.2 μg/kg/min, respectively and titrated according to clinical need. Given its intense analgesic effects, the remifentanil infusion was titrated to control the hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation and allow for spontaneous ventilation, while the dexmedetomidine infusion was used to provide amnesia and adjusted according to the BIS. Previous reports regarding the use of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil for general anesthesia are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【12】While anecdotal experience suggests efficacy of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil for intraoperative anesthetic care, potential concerns include lack of significant data demonstrating the amnestic effects of dexmedetomidine, adverse hemodynamic effects, and the potential for prolonged awakening given the longer duration of action of dexmedetomidine compared to other agents. Ensuring adequate amnesia is one of the goals of intraoperative anesthetic care. Although it is accepted as an effective agent for providing sedation and anxiolysis, there are limited data to clearly demonstrate the amnestic effects of dexmedetomidine. In a randomized, cross-over trial, nine adults received either propofol or dexmedetomidine using computer-controlled infusions targeting an effect-site concentration of 1, 2, and 4 µg/mL for propofol or a plasma concentration of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 ng/mL for dexmedetomidine . Using these graded infusions, the authors then compared the BIS number with the depth of sedation as assessed using the observer’s assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) score. The cutoff values of BIS for an OAA/S score ≤ 2 (a depth of sedation that would ensure amnesia and prevent recall) were obtained by analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves. The median BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during propofol sedation were 95.5, 78, 67, 57, and 34, respectively. Median BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during dexmedetomidine sedation were 95, 62, 45.5, 39.5, and 24.5, respectively. BIS values were significantly less with dexmedetomidine than propofol at OAA/S responsiveness scores of 2, 3, and 4. With propofol, the calculated cutoff BIS values for an OAA/S score ≤ 2 were 67 (sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 97%, and area under the curve of 0.98). With dexmedetomidine, the values were lower: 46 (sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 91%, and area under the curve of 0.96). Other studies have demonstrated effective amnesia as evidenced by impaired long-term picture recall with dexmedetomidine .\n\n【13】Regardless of the anesthetic agents used, adverse effects on respiratory and hemodynamic function may occur. Like all opioids, remifentanil will depress respiratory function in a dose-related manner resulting in respiratory depression and eventually apnea. Higher dosing regimens may require assisted or controlled ventilation. However, when compared to other anesthetic agents such as propofol, there is less impairment of respiratory function with dexmedetomidine . Adverse hemodynamic effects, albeit rare in the pediatric-aged patient, include bradycardia and hypotension. Hemodynamic effects are more common following bolus dosing, in patients with comorbid cardiac disease, and generally resolve with a decrease of the infusion rate .\n\n【14】In summary, we present the use of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil to provide anesthesia during a minor surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia. The impetus behind such care was prompted by maternal concerns over the potential long-term deleterious effects of general anesthesia on neurocognitive outcomes. Although there remains limited anecdotal experience with such a combination, given the animal data demonstrating a lack of a pro-apoptotic effect, this potentially “neurocognitive safe” anesthetic may warrant further investigation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is characterised by the proliferation of dendritic cells (Langerhans Cells) normally concerned with antigen presentation . LCH has an estimated incidence of 2 to 5 cases per million per year , recently given as 4.1 cases per million per year for children in the United Kingdom aged 0 - 14 years . First described by Alfred Hand in 1893 , LCH has been loosely and incompletely categorised into several eponymous and non-eponymous conditions :  eosinophilic granuloma of bone;  Hand-Schüller-Christian Disease (triad of exophthalmos, skull defects and diabetes insipidus (DI)) and  Letterer-Siwe Disease (acute, progressive multisystem infiltration in the very young, < 3 years of age).\n\n【2】The presenting features are variable in both adult and paediatric groups  but isolated bone lesions are a common mode of presentation in both age groups, and have excellent prospects of disease free survival after treatment . Multi-system variants have variable clinical findings - including dyspnoea, diabetes insipidus, hepatosplenomegaly, hypothyroidism, mucous membrane (especially oral) lesions and skin rashes . LCH in adults (in contrast to the condition in children) tends to be a multisystem disease, but the highest mortality is seen in those with isolated pulmonary involvement .\n\n【3】DI is a rare presenting feature in solitary system disease but more common in multisystem disease - in the recent UK case series of 94 patients aged 0 - 14 years, 69 (73%) had single system disease, of whom only 2 had pituitary involvement; conversely of the 25 multisystem cases, 5 had DI . Overall, 17-25% of children with LCH develop DI (10 - and references therein). In the situation of a child/young adult carrying a diagnosis of central DI, LCH was found in 12 out of 79 patients (15%) . Therefore, though rare, central diabetes insipidus should raise the possibility of an underlying diagnosis of LCH , and an extracranial survey (with a view to identifying other sites of LCH which may be more amenable to biopsy) has been advocated .\n\n【4】Several authors have focussed on periodontal and gingival disease in LCH  because the incidence of oral lesions is high - 77% has been quoted , though Annibali et al  described a series of 31 LCH patients of whom 12 (namely 39%) developed oral lesions . When oral lesions and DI co-exist in the same patient, there should be a strong index of suspicion for LCH.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 27 year old female salesperson was referred with a three week history of severe pain - including night pain - and tenderness in the region of her right temple in December 2000. There was no history of trauma. Her past medical history included extremely poor dentition since childhood and Diabetes Insipidus (DI), diagnosed in 1993, for which she took daily intranasal desmopressin acetate. Blood tests, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, and liver function tests, were within reference ranges.\n\n【7】Skull X-rays showed a well demarcated lucent area of approximately 2 cm diameter in the right temporal bone and evidence of periodontal disease . Temporal excision biopsy was performed, with histology showing Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH).\n\n【8】In April 2003, the patient developed severe atraumatic pain in her right groin, which was worse on walking and also at night. Examination demonstrated a tender focal area overlying the greater trochanter. Blood tests were again unremarkable. Radiographs showed a lucent area in the greater trochanter. Curettage of the lesion allowed histological confirmation of LCH recurrence at this site.\n\n【9】Due to long-term dentition problems, a phased dental clearance was initiated in February 2004, leading to a significant improvement in the patient’s quality of life. No granulomas were demonstrated in tissue cleared - however it is considered likely that LCH was implicated at this site also. Similarly, later curettage of a possible right iliac crest lesion  was not confirmed as LCH on histology. She remains free of further LCH recurrence  and continues to take desmopressin for her DI.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Our patient had an uncommon presentation of a rare condition - central diabetes insipidus (DI) associated with extremely poor dentition/gingival disease. Until the emergence of more typical localised bone pain in her skull and orthopaedic referral, the possibility of LCH had not been considered.\n\n【12】In conclusion, LCH is a rare and enigmatic condition , which infrequently presents as central DI. Clinicians encountering a combination of DI and gingival disease should consider the possibility of LCH, and investigate further.\n\n【13】Consent\n\n【14】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and the accompanying image.

This syndrome is mostly associated with a disorder of calcium and phosphate metabolism, especially to hypoparathyroidism (HPT) , but can also be attributed to other different etiologies, including infectious, metabolic, and genetic diseases .\n\n【2】The clinical manifestations can be paresthesias, seizures, myoclonus, tetany, parkinsonism, and neuropsychiatric disorders (such as cognitive and psychotic disorders) . Early treatment, if instituted correctly, can reverse neurological symptoms and prevent irreversible alterations thus emphasizing the need to recognize early clinical manifestations .\n\n【3】The current article reports a case of Fahr’s syndrome due to hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】The female patient, who was 53-years-old and brown skinned, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a condition of status epilepticus for 24 hours associated to acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Regarding her past medical history, the patient had undergone a thyroidectomy 22 years ago, when she started involuntary lasting muscular contractions of the upper extremities, which progressed to convulsions throughout the years. She also had episodes of paresthesia of the lower extremities and was a long-term user of Phenytoin. Her physical examination revealed poor general condition, pallor, hydrated, afebrile, anicteric and acyanotic. Her blood pressure was 125 × 79 mmHg and her heart rate was 78 beats per min. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in right hemithorax. There were spastic tetraparesis with muscle shortening and stiffness of respiratory and shoulder girdle muscles, also Chvostek and Trousseau signs.\n\n【6】On admission, the laboratory tests showed hypocalcemia (total calcium of 3.2 mg/dL (normal level 8.4 - 10.5), and ionic calcium 0.55 mmol/L (normal level 1.12 - 1.23 mmol/L)). White blood cell count, and hemoglobin level were 15,500/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and 9.5 g/dL, respectively. The levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal (22 mg/dL and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively). The parathormone (PTH) level was 1.3 pg/mL (normal level 15 - 65 pg/mL). Chest radiograph showed alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe. Computed tomography scan of the brain showed intracranial symmetrical calcifications of the basal nuclei, semioval center, occipital, and cerebellar cortex, and no compressive effect . According to the clinical presentation, examination findings, and subsequent investigation exams, our case was diagnosed as Fahr’s syndrome due to post-thyroidectomy HPT.\n\n【7】Upon admission to the ICU, she was placed on mechanical ventilation. She was kept sedated and initiated treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, and ampicilin/sulbactam. Attempts were made to suspend the sedation, but the patient kept presenting global muscle stiffness. On the third day, we initiated oral calcium and calcitriol. On the sixth day, we took out the sedation and the patient showed active movement but with loss of muscle strength and muscle shortening, with total calcium level of 9.3 mg/dL. The mechanical ventilation was withdrawn on the ninth day, after reduction of the spastic hypertonia of respiratory muscles and presented active movement of the extremities with discrete muscular hypertonia. On the thirteenth day, she was discharged stable but with mild disorientation.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】HPT may be associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations . One of these is Fahr’s syndrome, that is characterized by seizures, extrapyramidal, and neuropsychiatric signs as a result of symmetric and bilateral calcifications of the nucleus pallidus, the putamen, the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (striato-pallido-dentate calcinosis), and hemispheric white matter . In 1930, Karl Theodor Fahr, a German pathologist, first described this syndrome in a case of a man with seizures, and diffuse calcifications of brain vessels, and basal ganglia .\n\n【10】The prevalence of Fahr’s syndrome is unknown, but an incidence of basal ganglia calcifications (BGC) ranging from 0.3% to 1.2% has been reported in routine radiological examinations . Kazis  analyzing 7040 computed tomography scan of the brain reported an incidence of 1.02% of symmetrical intracranial calcifications. In this study, all patients who had more extensive calcifications showed clear findings of HPT. Goswani et al  reported the occurrence of BCG in 73.8% in idiopathic HPT.\n\n【11】The pathogenic mechanisms of BGC are unknown, although it is believed to be due to poor calcium and phosphorus control in the HPT, associated to hypokalemia, and low calcium/phosphorus ratio . Active role of PTH in basal ganglia physiology may also be involved . On histopathological study, Fahr’s syndrome can be labeled as intracerebral small vessel and perivascular space mineralization primarily of basal ganglia, cerebellar structures and white brain matter , that consists mainly of hydroxyapatite of a nature similar to that found in bones, and other elements (such as, zinc, iron, and magnesium) enmeshed in a protein rich stroma without collagen or mucopolysaccharides .\n\n【12】Intracranial calcifications are a common finding in neuroimaging. Although the most common cause of BGC are disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism, more than fifty clinical conditions have been associated with BGC, including inflammatory, infectious, tumoral, endocrine, hypoxic, vascular, toxic, metabolic, and genetic disorders  . Among these conditions, the endocrine diseases, especially HPT, are the most common causes of Fahr’s syndrome .\n\n【13】About half of the patients with BGC exhibit neuropsychiatric manifestations and deficits. The most common neurological symptoms are headache, vertigo, movement disorders (such as Parkinson’s tremor, dystonia, and cerebellar ataxia), myoclonus and seizures . Other neurological symptoms consist of stroke like events, speech disorders, coma, cognitive impairment, and syncope . The psychiatric symptoms are usually more prominent than the neurologic symptoms in the onset of the disease . Forty percent of patients with BGC present themselves with psychiatric symptoms at the beginning of the disease, and usually precede neurological manifestations . The psychiatric symptoms may be composed of a wide variety of symptoms ranging from depression to psychosis . Among these, cognitive and psychotic disorders are most prominent .\n\n【14】In the presence of BGC, especially with symptoms, laboratory investigation should be performed to assess the occurrence of HPT. The typical findings in untreated HPT are low circulation PTH levels, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, low levels of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and relatively high urinary calcium excretion. Laboratory evaluation also should include serum creatinine, and magnesium levels. The finding of hypocalcemia associated to undetectable PTH levels is sufficient to confirm diagnosis, since it rules out all other causes of hypocalcemia, which would lead to an increase activity of the parathyroid gland .\n\n【15】As regards the present case, the patient had undergone a previous thyroidectomy. The most common cause of HPT is inadvertent damage or removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy . After total thyroidectomy, transient HPT can be observed in as high as 10% of patients. Most of these patients recover parathyroid function within several months, however about 4.4% develop permanent HPT . In postoperative HPT, BGC will develop in untreated patients after a median of 17 years .\n\n【16】The treatment of Fahr’s syndrome is directed to the identifiable cause . Especially in HPT, the early treatment can prevent calcifications and neurophysiological disorders . Goswami  reported a reduced risk of BCG progression with treatment to restore calcium/phosphorus ratio in patients with idiopathic HPT. In symptomatic patients, seizures show poor response to anticonvulsants, and resolution when normal plasma calcium level is reached . Parkinsonism is also characterized by resistance to standard treatment, and in early cases may respond to calcium therapy . The psychiatric symptoms usually improve with normalization of calcemia, although the dementia has the worst response . It is noteworthy that the prognosis is variable, cannot be predicted and is unrelated to the extent of calcifications . Death is usually due to neurological deterioration .\n\n【17】The standard treatment of HPT involves calcium supplementation and vitamin D or 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) . The treatment goals include symptoms control, and maintaining serum calcium in the low to normal range, serum phosphorus within normal limits, 24-hour urine calcium under 7.5 mmol/day (300 mg/day) and the calcium-phosphate product under 55 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L) . It is notable that HPT is one of the few endocrine diseases that are not routinely treated by the replacement of the missing hormone, although subcutaneous synthetic PTH could be used in refractory HPT .\n\n【18】Despite its rarety, the possibility of Fahr’s syndrome should be considered in patients with neuropsychiatric disturbances and seizure disorder. In presence of BGC, HPT should be investigated, especially in patients who had undergone thyroidectomy. This case report stresses the major benefits of calcium supplementation and calcitriol, even with the patient being in advanced stage of disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

RAI is an important radiopharmaceutical agent in nuclear medicine practice for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer . One of the longterm side effects of ionising radiation is the possibility of radiation induced malignancy. In the literature, many reports have been published in terms of radiation induced thyroid malignancy after Chernobyl accident . Likewise, it is reported that thyroid cancer can be developed after I therapy for thyrotoxicos . It is also reported that I therapy for diagnostic purpose does not increase the risk of thyroid malignacy although it is commonly used . Besides, radiation exposure can cause thyroid malignancy, RAI therapy is recommended as the first choice for toxic adenoma by American Thyroid Association (ATA) without performing fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). As there is no reported cancer case that developed from hot nodule, routine FNAB is not recommended by ATA . In this report, a case with papillary thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic thyroid nodule is presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A thirty-four year old female patient was admitted to hospital for toxic adenoma in 2007. At the initial investigation, TSH, FT <sub>4 </sub> , FT <sub>3 </sub> , anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibody and antithyroglobulin autoantibody (Anti Tg) levels were 0.189 µIU/mL (N:0.35-5.5 µIU/mL), 1.48 ng/dL (N: 0.85 - 1.78 ng/dL), 3.26 pg/mL (N: 157 - 4.71 pg/mL), 133 IU/mL (N: 0 - 35 IU/mL) and 337 IU/mL (N: 0 - 40 IU/mL), respectively. Thyroid ultrasonography (USG) showed a calcified solid nodule with cystic degenarations, in a size of 2 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm, at right thyroid lobe and the <sup>99m </sup> Tc thyroid scintigraphy showed a hyperactive/hot nodule at right thyroid lobe . After the diagnosis, 444 MBq (12 mci) I treatment was administered orally in June, 2007. After RAI therapy, patient remained in euthyroid status.\n\n【4】On January 2010, she was admitted at the hospital with a mass at the left side of her neck. After a physical examination, there was a palpable mobile mass at the left side of thyroid lobe. Thyroid USG showed two classified nodules at right thyroid lobe (9.5 and 10 mm in diameter), a heterogeneous mass with cystic areas and lobulated contours (30 mm × 17 mm × 44 mm) at the left side of the cervical region and lymph node with narrow hilus at bilateral cervical regions, larger one measuring 11 mm×5.5 mm. FNAB was performed and it revealed “papillary thyroid carcinoma” in the thyroid nodule at right lobe and “suspected for malignancy” in the mass at the left side.\n\n【5】On April 2011, the patient underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection. The histopathological examination showed papillary carcinoma in size 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm at right thyroid lobe, 0.4 cm in left thyroid lobe and five metastatic lymph nodes at the left central neck . On L-thyroxine replacement therapy, post-operative serum TSH, thyroglobulin and anti Tg levels were 0.01 µIU/mL, < 0.2 ng/mL (1.6 - 59.9 ng/mL) and 63.2 IU/mL, respectively.\n\n【6】On September 2011, the patient underwent 5550 MBq (150 mCi) radioiodine ablation therapy and post therapy, on the 9th day,the whole body scan revealed a remnant at the left thyroid region .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting papillary thyroid cancer arising from toxic adenoma following RAI therapy. The prevalence of thyroid nodule increases with age and it is more common in women. Nearly less than 10% of all thyroid nodules are toxic . Initial evaluation of all thyroid nodules require FNAB, however, as the rate of malignancy in toxic nodule is low and benign hyperfunctioning nodules may be cytologically indistinguishable from non functioning benign follicular neoplasms and follicular cancer, ATA doesn’t recommend it for toxic ones . It is reported that toxic nodules are almost never malignant and cold nodules are 5 - 8% malignant .\n\n【9】The usage of RAI therapy for toxic goitre is increasing worldwide and the disadvantage of radioactive iodine therapy is the possibility of radiation induced malignancy. I has relatively high photon energy (364 keV), long half life (nearly 8 day) and the presence of beta particle emissions . Latency period between radiation exposure and development of thyroid cancer ranges between a minimum of 3 - 7 years and a maximum of 40 - 50 years . The risk of the development of thyroid malignancy decreases with age and after the age of 20 years the risk is less . In our patient, if we accept that the thyroid cancer developed as a consequence of first RAI therapy, there had been nearly 4 years between first RAI therapy and the diagnosis of cancer. This was consistent with the literature for the development of the thyroid cancer after radioiodine.\n\n【10】In the literature, there are few reports about thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic nodulary or diffused goiter. Staffurth et al. reported a folliculary thyroid cancer following RAI therapy for Graves’ disease . In their case, FTC derived 17 years after the RAI therapy. Similarly, there are some reports of anaplastic thyroid cancer after RAI therapy for toxic goiter .\n\n【11】In the case, FNAB was not performed before the first RAI therapy. It is not known whether the cancer had been there before the therapy or it was developed after the therapy. Therefore, FNAB must be performed for all nodules before RAI therapy.\n\n【12】In conclusion, differentiated thyroid cancer can be found incidentally in toxic nodule or can be developed as a consequence of RAI therapy for toxic nodule. FNAB must be performed for all the patients with hot or cold thyroid nodules before RAI therapy and all the patients taking RAI theraphy should be closely followed in terms of nodule growth and cancer development.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "6d5c3bfd-2d79-47a3-90d3-02e01079b504", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic debilitating disease and it is difficult to diagnose and treat. Actinomycosis can involve almost any organ system but actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall is rare and follows recent abdominal organ surgery. We describe herein a rare primary anterior abdominal wall actinomycosis without abdomional organ involvement.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 50-year-old male complained of chest pain and an 8 cm sized mass in the right lower lateral chest wall that he had fist noticed 6 years previous to admission. There were no remarkable findings in his family and past history. His vital signs were stable and the results of routine blood tests were within normal ranges. Computer tomography (CT) indicated an 8 cm sized mass in the right lower hemithorax with extension of the right abdominal wall . An isotope bone scan showed an increased hot uptake in the 9th rib . We recommended preoperative culture and biopsy of the mass but the patient refused and wanted surgery for correct diagnosis and complete removal of mass . A 10 cm transverse skin incision was made on his mass area in the left lateral position under general anesthesia. There were inflammatory change on muscle, ribs and diaphragm. En bloc resection including latissimus dorsi muscle, external oblique muscle, intercostal muscles including 9th and 10th ribs and a partial portion of diaphragm was made. And direct closures of the diaphragm and abdominal wall defects were possible without prosthetic material. The cut surface of the resected specimen showed several necrotic areas in the fibrotic background on gross appearance. Microscopically, tangled clumps of filamentous organisms were found in the neutrophilic abscess. The filaments had a radial distribution. Neutrophils were adherent to the periphery of the colonies of organisms . The microorganisms were consistent with diagnosis of actinomycosis. The patient was discharged on the seventh day after the operation following an uneventful recovery. The patient has been receiving minocycline for three months now due to positive penicillin skin test.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Actinomycosis is a rare chronic, supporative pseudotumoral disease caused by an anaerobic gram positive organism that is most frequently Actinomyces Israeli . In healthy subjects, Actinomyces is a part of normal flora of the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the genital tract. Healthy mucosa acts as a barrier to the spread of the organism, but tissues damaged by neoplasm, surgery, trauma, or foreign body allow multiplication and spread of actinomycosis . Actinomycosis most commonly affects the head and neck (50%) but can involve almost any organ system . Abdominopelvic actinomycosis is uncommon and typically follows recent bowel surgery such as procedures for acute appendicitis, diverticulitis or abdominal trauma .\n\n【6】Primary actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall is very rare and has been reported only in 29 cases in the literature by 2010 . Immunocompromised status, such as diabetes mellitus, steroid therapy, and neoplasm, is a significant predisposing factor for actinomycosis .\n\n【7】Patients usually present with a slowly developing indolent swelling of the soft tissue. The disease usually presents as a slowly growing mass with eventual formation of sinuses discharging serosanguinous pus containing “sulfur” granules, which represent macrocolonies of actinomyocytes . The “sulfur” granules are pathognomonic, but these are not always present . In most cases, clinical and diagnostic exams are not able to identify the disease and therefore the treatment becomes complex. Hematological laboratory exams show elevated non specific inflammatory markers and serology is not diagnostic . Ultrasonography, computed tomography or MRI do not suffice to differentiate between actinomycosis and other inflammatory or neoplastic processes .\n\n【8】It is also very difficult to isolate the bacterium from cultures . Negative culture rate was reported to be 76% . The most difficult task for the management of actinomycosis is to reach a diagnosis before a surgical approach. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of non-specific clinical, laboratory and imaging findings. In many cases, the diagnosis is often possible during surgical exploration or after extensive debulking .\n\n【9】This is the reason why a wide primary resection including the surrounding tissue is inevitable . Operative management is required for diagnostic biopsy or total excision.\n\n【10】Surgery is necessary in many cases, especially when the mass is large or there are some complications such as peritonitis, compression of abdominal organ . Surgery is also necessary when there is no benefit and general health conditions deteriorate after a week of antibiotic treatment .\n\n【11】The treatment of choice is proper surgical drainage at the primary site of infection. If a soft tissue tumor is suspected, a wide primary resection including the surrounding tissue is sometimes inevitable. The abdominal wall defect may be closed by prosthetic mesh if the abdominal wall defect is large and direct closure is impossible . Surgical treatment without antibiotic therapy is not always sufficient to achieve a cure for actinomycosis. When antibiotic therapy is combined with surgery, it is relatively simple to treat and the cure rate is more than 90% . Intravenous penicillin is the initial therapy of choice. In the case of penicillin allergy, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin or minocycline are acceptable alternatives . Our patient had positive penicillin skin test so, we started minocycline. The patient will take minocyline for six months.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "63214ff8-8f01-467e-a69c-f328bda71b76", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Few cases of calcific tendinitis of the longus colli have been described in the literature of specific specialities, notably radiology and otorhinolaryngology. However, this entity is not well known by general practitioners and internists who may encounter this rare, but underrecognized, disease. Given its tendency to mimic severe, and sometimes life-threatening conditions, we believe that physicians of all specialities should be aware of this entity in order to avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient, a 34-year-old woman, presented to our hospital for severe neck pain, restricted neck movements and odynophagia. She was an office worker, previously known only for accompanied migraines and remote appendicectomy and tonsillectomy. She did not take any regular medication and her life habits were unremarkable. She presented to the hospital with a 4-day history of severe neck pain radiating to her left arm, without paresia. The pain was accompanied by important limitation in neck movements in all directions. She reported a concomitant headache without sono or photophobia and of different quality than her usual migraines. She had tried anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, physiotherapy and acupuncture without success. In the last 2 days, she had noticed a new onset dysphagia and odynophagia with a choking sensation when she was lying on her back. She denied any fever, chills or recent infection. There was no history of trauma. However, she mentioned that, 2 weeks prior, while hiking in the woods, she had suffered a tick bite to the anterior neck. She had removed the tick herself, less than 3 h after its installation. The next day she had felt pruritis and irritation at the site of the tick bite, which quickly resolved. No rash or erythema migrans was noticed in the weeks following the incident. Upon examination, the patient was not toxic and appeared well. She was afebrile and eupneic. No stridor was heard. She noticeably held her neck very still and was not able to rotate it more than 5° in any direction. She could do a neck flexion of about 70°, but could not extend her neck. Paraspinal neck palpation was painful. There was no sensitive or motor deficits in the arms, and the reflexes were normal. The throat was exempt of erythema and swelling. No rash was noted. The rest of the examination was normal.\n\n【4】Her labs revealed a slight neutrophilic leucocytosis at 12.8 (N: 4-11). Hemoglobin and platelets were within the normal range. There was a mild elevation in the sedimentation rate at 24 (N: 0-20) and in the CRP at 23.8 (N: < 5). Neck X-rays were performed and revealed a thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues up to 8.2 mm at the level of C1 . A CT-scan of the neck showed a fluid infiltration in the retropharyngeal space, without abscess formation. There were calcifications at the insertion site of the longus colli muscle in front of C1 . Based on the clinical presentation and the pathognomonic findings on the CT-scan, a diagnosis of acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli was made. The patient was treated with one dose of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine followed by a 2-week course of anti-inflammatories. She was released from the hospital on her second day, having improved with the dexamethasone. The patient brought the tick she had removed for analysis and it was confirmed to be an ixodes scapularis. The PCR of the tick was negative for borrelia burgdorferi and anaplasma phagocytophilum.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Neck pain is a relatively common patient complaint. Some accompanying features such as fever and dysphagia suggest a more severe and worrisome cause of neck pain. Given its propensity to present that way, calcific tendinitis of the longus colli should be recognized when characteristic features are present. This condition is a rare, but probably underrecognized  form of calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease . The entity was first described by Hartley in 1964  and later proven histologically to be due to calcium hydroxyapatite by Ring and his colleagues in 1994 . The incidence of calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscle is unknown. It is estimated by some to be around 0.5 per 100,000 persons per year , but is probably underestimated because it is a little known self-limiting entity. As in the other forms of calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease , its cause is incompletely understood. It has been speculated that crystal deposition may occur following injury, tissue necrosis, ischemia and repetitive trauma. The longus colli muscle is a weak neck flexor that is one of the four anterior vertebral muscles. It extends from the anterior tubercle of C1 to the vertebral body of T3 and comprises three components: the superior, central and inferior fibers . The superior fibers are the most commonly affected by the calcium hydroxyapatite deposits. The proposed mechanism is one similar to its correlates in other locations, that is, rupture of the calcific crystals leads to inflammation in the tendon. In longus colli tendinitis, a reactive effusion occurs in the retropharyngeal space, which is separated from the prevertebral space by the deep cervical fascia .\n\n【7】This condition affects men and women from age 21 to 81, but typically presents between the third and sixth decades . The case described here presented with the characteristic triad of severe neck pain, neck stiffness and dysphagia and/or odynophagia . However, our patient did not have the low-grade fever found in other cases. Upon examination, patients have very limited neck range of motion in all directions. The head is held in slight flexion. There may be posterior pharyngeal erythema or edema . Blood work may show slightly elevated sedimentation rate and CRP and mild leucocytosis . A history of minor trauma or upper respiratory tract infection in the prior weeks is often, but not always, present. In this case, the patient presented with a history of a recent tick bite to the neck. No case of acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli following a tick bite was reported in the literature. However, we think that it is possible that the neck tick bite was the initiator of the inflammatory reaction in our patient. The short duration of tick attachment and the analysis of the tick support the absence of a tick-borne disease to explain the patient symptoms.\n\n【8】The clinical presentation of calcific tendinitis of the longus colli may suggest other worrisome diagnosis such as retropharyngeal abscess, meningitis, infectious spondylodiscitis or cervical fracture if there is a history of trauma . Similarly, our patient’s symptoms evoked the possibility of a retropharyngeal abscess. Prompt recognition of this benign condition is important to avoid unnecessary and invasive tests and procedures. The diagnosis can be suspected by the presence of calcifications anterior to C1-C2 on plain neck radiographs. In our case, it was this astute observation by the radiologist that led us to the diagnosis . However, the sensitivity of neck X-rays is low and the gold standard for the diagnosis is a CT-scan of the neck. The characteristic findings on CT are as follows: 1) pathognomonic calcifications in the superior fibers of the longus colli muscle; 2) fluid effusion without ring enhancement in the retropharyngeal space; and 3) exclusion of an infectious process or fractures by the absence of retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the absence of destructive changes in the adjacent anterior vertebral body . The pathognomonic calcifications on the neck CT-scan of our patient in fact confirmed the diagnosis . MRI of the neck may be useful in distinguishing reactive effusion from abscess in the retropharyngeal space, but is much less accurate in identifying the calcifications, and for this reason, the CT scan remains the first choice of imaging modality . Calcific tendinitis of the longus colli is a benign auto-resolutive disease over the course of 2-3 weeks. However, patients are often severely limited by the neck pain and dysphagia; therefore, a short course of conservative treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and mechanical avoidance of movement with or without a soft collar is recommended. Corticosteroids may be used for severe cases . Since our patient had failed low-dose anti-inflammatories and presented with bothersome dysphagia, neck pain and chocking sensation, we chose to administer one dose of dexamethasone, which rapidly improved her symptoms. No follow-up is usually necessary for calcific tendinitis of the longus colli. If the symptoms persist for longer than 2-3 weeks, an alternative diagnosis should be sought.\n\n【9】In conclusion, acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli is an underrecognized cause of severe neck pain and odynophagia that may be confounded with more severe conditions. Its pathognomonic appearance on neck CT-scan should be sought in order to avoid unnecessary or invasive procedures and to promptly begin a symptomatic treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1a4a6ce4-032c-4957-8d61-6123b23fdf18", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Dobutamine stress test is commonly used in the assessment of patients with ischemic heart disease. Adverse effects are reported to occur in up to 75% of cases which include ST segment changes on ECG (in up to 50% cases), chest pain, palpitations and significant supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Various case reports published in literature show occurrence of broken heart syndrome (Takotsubo syndrome)  prolonged left ventricular dysfunction , transient global amnesia , cardiac rupture  and papillary muscle rupture . We describe a case of spinal subdural haematoma occurring as adverse effects of dobutamine stress test, which to our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature so far. This case also highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of a similar situation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 76-year-old independent lady underwent the dobutamine stress test for assessment of ischemic heart disease. The test did not reveal myocardial ischemia. During the test she experienced symptoms of headache and dry mouth which improved after retiring to bed early in the evening. On waking the next morning, she experienced severe, sharp pain in her lumbar spine area more so on left side, radiating downwards. The pain worsened with movements and was associated with a dry mouth. There was no history of fall or trauma to the back. She was seen by the family physician and was thought to be dehydrated secondary to a urinary tract infection and was started on treatment. Despite treatment for 3 days her pain was progressively worsening, therefore she was admitted to the hospital. Her past medical history included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, one episode of transient ischemic attack 10 years previously, and atrial fibrillation for which she was on Warfarin treatment with good INR control. Other medication included Carvedilol, Simvastatin, Digoxin, Furosemide and Valsartan.\n\n【4】At the time of admission to hospital, neurological examination revealed a normal gait, power of 5/5 in all limbs, normal reflexes and intact sensation. Blood results showed a raised white cell count of 12.5, ESR of 37, creatinine of 109 and INR of 2.5. She was diagnosed to have pyelonephritis and was started on antibiotics.\n\n【5】She developed urinary retention the day after admission and was catheterised. She also complained of weakness of her left leg, examination of which revealed a reduced power of 3/5 in proximal muscle groups and 2/5 in distal muscle groups of the left leg. Power in the right leg was normal. Sensory examination was normal. Anal tone and perianal sensation was normal. On the next day, she was reviewed by the neurosurgical team and an urgent MRI scan of spine was requested. Neurological examination now showed deterioration with a power of 0/5 in the left leg, and 2/5 in the right leg proximally and 0/5 distally. The scan showed a spinal subdural haematoma at level ofT9/T10 displacing the cord to the right side. She was commenced on treatment for reversal of coagulation and prepared for surgery. She underwent dorsal spinal laminectomy at level of T7-T11 and evacuation of haematoma. Postoperatively, some neurological improvement was noted.\n\n【6】Later, she was transferred to the spinal rehabilitation unit where she underwent rehabilitative treatment for 8 months and was discharged home. At the time of discharge she was left with a power of 3/5 in right leg and 2/5in left leg. Her bladder was managed with a suprapubic catheter due to loss of bladder function her bowels were managed with suppositories and manual evacuation. Due to her disabilities, she needed care assistance at home for washing and dressing, adaptations at home and a powered wheelchair for mobilisation.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Spinal cord haematoma is a rare entity and commonly due to a spinal pathology like vascular malformations, trauma, spinal surgery, tumour, abscess or inflammatory myelitis. Intrinsic  and acquired  coagulation abnormalities are attributed as cause in cases where they are present in absence of primary cord pathology. Deger SM et al  described a case of spontaneous spinal haematoma in a patient on haemodialysis. Lumbar and C1-C2 spinal puncture is also reported as a cause . This case report describes development of spinal subdural haematoma after a dobutamine stress test.\n\n【9】Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine which directly stimulates beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. There is dose related increase in heart rate, myocardial contractility and blood pressure. Dobutamine stress test is used to look for any myocardial ischemia under stress in patients in which routine exercise testing is contraindicated due to chronic debilitation, decreased functional capacity due to old age or physical problems like injury, arthritis etc. Other candidates for this test include patients on negative chronotropic agents like beta blockers that would inhibit the ability to achieve adequate heart response. In this lady dobutamine stress test was requested as she had 80% mid left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis on angiography and hypokinesia of left ventricular wall on echocardiography suggesting ischemia of myocardium. Her INR control was good during the time of test, and she developed symptoms after the test. Therefore it is the most possible cause for development of spinal cord haematoma.\n\n【10】Regardless of aetiology, the principal initial symptom of spinal cord haematoma is excruciating back pain in the region of the haematoma and the underlying pathology. Neurological deficit also relates to the site of haematoma and may include variable degrees of motor, sensory and autonomic disturbances. It may occur acutely along with pain or may present after 2-24 hours or maybe even days. Spinal haematoma requires prompt diagnosis and MRI spine is the investigation of choice. It demonstrates both the haematoma and the underlying pathology. It would also demonstrate other underlying pathologies in the absence of a spinal haematoma . Management of such cases includes an urgent reversal of any intrinsic or acquired coagulopathy and surgery to prevent neurological damage. Lawton et al  reported better neurological outcomes in patients who underwent surgery within 12 hours of onset of symptoms and fair to good motor function below injury level (Frankle Grade D). McQuarrie et al  showed that a delay of more than 6 hours prior to surgery reduces probability of recovery. Foo and Rossier  concluded that recovery depends on the preoperative neurological condition of patient.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】This case illustrates development of spinal subdural haematoma in a patient after dobutamine stress test. Aside from above mentioned adverse effects, no literature indicates occurance of such complication. Though our patient was on warfarin treatment, but good INR control around the time and occurrence of symptoms right after the test indicate it to be the most likely cause.\n\n【13】Furthermore, the diagnosis of spinal subdural haematoma is often delayed despite availability of the modern imaging techniques. Prompt treatment with surgery can prevent damage to the cord and permanent disability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, there has been only one reported case of optic chiasm involvements in addition to optic neuritis and retinitis caused by VZV infection . Here, we describe a first reported case of isolated optic chiasmal neuritis (OCN) secondary to VZV viremia.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old woman without contributory medical history presented with persistent pain and scatteredvesicular cutaneous eruptions in the left-sided second cervical dermatome on February 2011. She was diagnosed as having zoster by the dermatologist, and oral valaciclovir at 3000 mg/day was initiated. Five days later, she complained of visual field defect in both eyes, which gradually worsened. Therefore, she was admitted to our Neurologic Ward. The zoster skin lesions were improved, and no other abnormalities like erythema, discoid rash or photosensitivity disorder were noted. General examination findings were normal. Corrected visual acuity was 1.5, and critical flicker fusion frequency was within normal ranges in both eyes. Confrontational visual fields suggested a defect in the temporal field of both eyes and Goldmann perimetry confirmed a bitemporal heminopsia . In both eyes, the diameter of the pupil was 3 mm in the lightened room. Light and near reflexes were prompt in either eye. There was no relative afferent papillary defect. Restriction of eye movements was not observed. Palpebral fissure was 9 mm in both eyes. Funduscopic findings did not demonstrate any abnormalities in either eye. Other than a mild sensory disturbance in the region of the left second cervical dermatome, the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. In the laboratory examinations of the blood, complete blood counts, blood chemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thyroid function, angiotensin coverting enzyme level, and vitamin B12 level were within normal ranges. Both the serological test for syphilis and treponema pallidum hemagglutination were negative. In the blood, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of VZV was positive, though IgM titer of mumps virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were all negative. On the immunological examination, despite a slight elevated titer of anti-nuclear antibody at 1: 80, anti-Smith antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. In the complement tests, the levels of C <sub>3 </sub> , C <sub>4 </sub> and CH <sub>50 </sub> were within normal ranges. Urinary examination demonstrated normal findings. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was watery clear appearance. The CSF examination demonstrated an initial pressure at 130 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O, cell counts at 3 /mm <sup>3 </sup> (all was mononucleocyte), glucose level at 60 mg/dl, and total protein concentration at 20 mg/dl. The cytological examination, the culture test, oligoclonal IgG band, and the PCR test of VZV resulted in negative study in the CSF. Chest roentgen and electrocardiogram findings were normal. Not only cranial and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but also cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Then, she was considered as having isolated OCN secondary to VZV viremia. Under 7 days of intravenous aciclovir at 1500 mg/day, her bitemporal hemianopia gradually improved.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Visual field defect may be the earliest symptom in patients with lesions involving the optic chiasm .Consequently, perimetry is the most important clinical tool for detecting chiasmal lesion, and bitemporal hamianopia is commonly observed . On the other hand, chiasmal involvement may be induced by extrinsic or intrinsic abnormalities . Regarding intrinsic chiasmal lesions, neoplasm , chiasmal infarction , sarcoidosis , and OCN  have been reported. Among them, OCN is a relatively rare symptom consisting of acute visual loss due to chiasmal inflammation , and commonly occurs as an idiopathic event, either in isolation or in the setting of multiple sclerosis . Furthermore, previous reports have noted that VZV infection, infectious mononucleosis due to EBV , CMV infection , mumps parotitis , Lyme disease , neuromyelitis optica , systemic lupus erythematosus , vitamin B12 deficiency , and ethchlorvynol toxicity  might induce OCN. Among them, there has been only one reported case of OCN due to VZV infection . This patient was an immunocompromised host . Bitemporal hemianopia with severe bilateral impairment of corrected visual acuities, and retinochoroiditis in the right eye were initially observed . MRI demonstrated involvements of the chiasm and bilateral optic nerves . Antiviral agent was not administered . Then, within a week, retinitis also appeared in the left eye . In 2 days, he became blind . Based on the postmortem examination, infiltration of VZV to the optic nerves as well as retinae was confirmed .\n\n【6】In our present patient, no other ophthalmological abnormalities except for bitemporal hemianopia were observed. MRI demonstrated no abnormalities in the vicinity of the optic chiasm. In addition, VZV viremia was proved by the PCR test. She was not an immunocompromised host, and intravenous antiviral agent was immediately initiated when bitemporal hemianopia developed. Therefore, it was considered that infiltration of VZV might not be severe, and be localized to the optic chiasm. In conclusion, we emphasize that this is a first reported case of isolated OCN secondary to VZV viremia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Antibiotics, especially the fluoroquinolones, have been reported to be associated with alterations in glycemic control among patients with diabetes as well as those without diabetes . However, cephem or macrolide antibiotics have rarely, if ever, been reported to induce hyperglycemia.\n\n【2】We herein report the case of a patient with diabetes who developed severe hyperglycemia following treatment with a cephem antibiotic, cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride (CFPN-PI), and a macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin (CAM), for acute sinusitis.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient was a 67-year-old Japanese man with diabetes and hypertension (height, 172 cm; weight, 66 kg). He also had a history of coronary artery disease as he had suffered a myocardial infarction and undergone percutaneous coronary intervention 5 years previously. His medications included enalapril maleate 2.5 mg/day (an ACE inhibitor), ticlopidine hydrochloride 100 mg twice daily (an anticoagulant), and rebamipide 100 mg twice daily (a stomachic). His cardiac function was stable and he had not felt any cardiac symptoms for several years. Although he had diabetes, he had never taken any medications for diabetes, but instead had controlled his condition with diet and exercise. Over the past several years, his random serum glucose levels were between 5.83 and 9.66 mmol/L, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c, NGSP) level had been stable at 6.6-7.2% .\n\n【5】In December 2010, the patient presented at an otolaryngology clinic with symptoms of nasal discharge and rhinorrhea. He was diagnosed with acute sinusitis and administered oral CFPN-PI on December 20, 2010. Although his otolaryngeal symptoms were slight and disappeared a few days after taking CFPN-PI, he was switched to CAM on December 27, 2010, when he experienced a sudden onset of thirst and pollakiuria. Eighteen days later (on January 14, 2011), he was diagnosed with hyperglycemia and referred to our endocrinology clinic for an evaluation of the sudden deterioration in serum glucose levels. At this point, his random serum glucose level was 29.4 mmol/L and his HbA1c level was 10.6%. Other laboratory findings were as follows: blood urea nitrogen, 4.2 mmol/L (reference, 2.9 - 7.1); serum creatinine, 73.3 mmol/L (reference, 54.0 - 92.0); plasma beta-hydroxybutyric acid, 97 mmol/L (reference, < 76); random serum C-peptide, 0.80 nmol/L. An anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody test was negative. His serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and white blood cell (WBC) count were less than 0.48 nmol/L (reference, < 2.86) and 4.63 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference, 3.3 - 9.0), respectively. Although the patient’s sinusitis symptoms had disappeared a few days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, his serum glucose readings ranged from 22.2 to 27.8 mmol/L. Thus, the patient required insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】It is common to encounter cases of deterioration of glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes. Although CFPN-PI or CAM might be considered a possible cause, the other factors also should be taken into consideration. Various factors affect glycemic control, including deteriorations in the living environment of the surrounding area, other diseases, physical stress induced by infection , and drugs .\n\n【8】In our case, no changes in the patient’s living environment had occurred at that point in time. He had no pertinent history of alcohol or tobacco use. He drank Japanese tea, but not sweet beverages, eliminating the possibility of soft-drink ketosis. Extensive investigations confirmed that no diseases of the liver, pancreas, or gastrointestinal system were present (data not shown). The stress by infection is a known cause of hyperglycemia . However, the patient’s otolaryngeal symptoms were slight, and they improved rapidly a few days after CFPN-PI administration. About 3 weeks after the improvement of symptoms, severe hyperglycemia was recognized (on January 14, 2011), when markers of inflammation (CRP and WBC) were within normal limits. Thus, it is unlikely that a stress-induced phenomenon led to the marked hyperglycemia observed in our patient. Drug-induced hyperglycemia thus remains a possibility . Disorders of glucose metabolism have been associated with a number of drugs, including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and antipsychotic agents. Our patient’s medications (enalapril, ticlopidine, and rebamipide) are unlikely to inhibit glucose homeostasis because the patient had been taking these medications on a regular basis for several years prior to his developing severe hyperglycemia.\n\n【9】Antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, etc), have been reported to cause abnormalities in blood glucose homeostasis, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia . In vitro studies showed that some fluoroquinolones can block ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic β-cells and stimulate insulin secretion, leading to hypoglycemia . On the other hand, Yamada et al. showed that chronic treatment with gatifloxacin decreases islet insulin content by inhibiting insulin biosynthesis . Ishiwata et al. showed that levofloxacin  and gatifloxacin  associated histamine releases can lead to increased serum epinephrine concentrations and hyperglycemia in rats. These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones can induce hyperglycemia by several mechanisms. Thus, the accurate mechanisms by which antibiotics induce hyperglycemia remain to be determined. Considering the worldwide prescription of CFPN-PI and CAM, it may be prudent to use these antibiotics with caution in patients with diabetes.\n\n【10】Our patient’s clinical course was characteristic. A few days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, the patient’s otolaryngeal symptoms disappeared, whilst he had a sudden onset of thirst and pollakiuria. It seems to be associated with the fact that an antibiotic-induced hyperglycemia often takes several days to develop . His intrinsic insulin secretion was not depleted and he had no ketosis, suggesting the deterioration of insulin resistance. The relationship between the administration of CFPN-PI or CAM and our patient’s subsequent development of hyperglycemia might be possible, as measured by the Naranjo probability scale .\n\n【11】In conclusion, we have presented the case of a patient with diabetes who developed severe hyperglycemia following antibiotic treatments. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous report of a deterioration in glycemic control in a patient with diabetes administered a cephem (CFPN-PI) or macrolide (CAM) antibiotic. Whether the initiation of antibiotic therapy itself or other factors precipitated the severe hyperglycemia is unknown. Further studies are warranted to determine the incidence rate of hyperglycemia among patients with diabetes who are administered cephem and macrolide antibiotics. In addition, further evaluation is needed to establish the mechanisms for precipitation of hyperglycemia in patients treated with antibiotics.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Lymphoproliferative disorders are often caused by the suppression of T-cell activity by immunosuppressants . It is extremely unusual for antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine to cause lymphoproliferative disorders except after transplantation.\n\n【2】In the case reported here, we present a lymphoproliferative disorder in the lungs caused by ATG and cyclosporine that were administered for the treatment of aplastic anemia. To our knowledge, case report of pulmonary lymphoma caused by ATG and cyclosporine outside of the post-transplantation setting is very rare.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 70-year-old woman with aplastic anemia treated with ATG (8 months ago, 2.5 mg/kg for 5 days), prednisolone (started on 15 mg 8 months ago, with dose tapered to 7.5 mg) and cyclosporine (started 6 years ago, with trough levels maintained between 150 and 200 ng/mL) visited our hospital complaining of fever and general fatigue for a week. Although no respiratory symptoms and no abnormal physical findings were observed, chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan showed patchy consolidation in both lungs . We diagnosed pneumonia or septic emboli and started antibiotics . We started treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate and moxifloxacin and switched to cefepime, clindamycin and minocycline because of persistent fever, but the fever continued and the chest radiograph showed aggravated consolidation and left pleural effusion after a week of antibiotics therapy.\n\n【5】We performed transthoracic needle lung biopsy of a nodule. The cultured specimen showed no evidence of bacterial or fungal infection, and histological analysis of the specimen showed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . We diagnosed immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder resulting from treatment with ATG and cyclosporine. The serum EBV DNA load was 6.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> copies/10 <sup>6 </sup> cells. A whole-body trunk CT scan with contrast enhancement showed no other region of lymphadenopathy or nodule. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed bone marrow involvement of lymphoma. After the diagnosis, we discontinued cyclosporine and antibiotics therapy. Because the chest radiograph showed regression of consolidation and the fever had declined by 2 weeks after discontinuation of the immunosuppressant , the patient was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】We report here a case of a 70-year-old patient with lymphoproliferative disorder in the lungs caused by immunosuppressive treatment with ATG and cyclosporine for aplastic anemia. Histological investigation showed EBV-positive DLBCL, and we administered ATG, cyclosporine and prednisolone, although not for transplantation. Primary pulmonary lymphoma of the lungs is a rare disorder; the incidence of primary pulmonary lymphoma is 0.3% of all primary lung neoplasms and less than 0.5% of all lymphomas . The most common type of primary pulmonary lymphoma, accounting for approximately 70%, is marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, but it is reported that most human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients have high-grade, EBV-positive DLBCL . Patients with EBV-positive immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the lung may tend to have DLBCL. Moreover, iatrogenic lymphoproliferative disorder, except in the post-transplantation setting, is extremely rare. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature about immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative lung disorder in relation to EBV outside of a post-transplantation setting.\n\n【8】It is known that ATG use in a preparative regimen of bone marrow transplantation confers a high risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, especially EBV-related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder . This case was not a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, but ATG may have contributed to the development of the lymphoproliferative disorder because EBV proliferation was observed in this case. According to previous studies, the time between ATG administration (combined with cyclosporine in most cases) and the onset of the lymphoproliferative disorder was 1 - 20 months, indicating the contribution of ATG in these cases .\n\n【9】Because the chest radiograph showed resolution of the consolidation of the lungs and soluble interleukin-2 receptor decreased after discontinuation of cyclosporine, cyclosporine may also play some role in the development of lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【10】We should consider the possibility of malignant lymphoma when CT scan showed multiple patchy consolidations with random pattern in both lungs as septic pulmonary emboli in patients with immunosuppressive treatment.\n\n【11】In conclusion, after treatment of aplastic anemia with ATG, cyclosporine and prednisolone, EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorder may develop, although rarely.

{"seq_id": "d8cc4e31-6e82-48eb-bdac-f843ec311624", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is an increasing public health concern worldwide. As of 1980s, peritoneal dialysis got into the use in renal replacement therapy of ESRD patients as well as hemodialysis. The advantage of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) compared with hemodialysis is the lower risk of blood borne diseases, the lack of need for systemic heparinization and better preservation of residual renal function. Since CAPD provides a flexible treatment independent of dialysis center, it is a desired treatment by patients .\n\n【2】Acute massive pleuroperitoneal leak-related hydrothorax is a rare, but life-threatening complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) . The prevalence of hydrothorax in ESRD patients treated with PD is reported to be approximately 2% . In general, right-sided pleural effusion, transudative in nature develops right after the initiation of the PD or within a few days post-treatment. The late development of hydrothorax in patients treated with CAPD is quite rare. Dyspnea is the most important complication in patients with hydrothorax, and the extent of dyspnea depends on the severity of the pleuroperitoneal leak. The differential diagnosis of pleuroperitoneal leak-related hydrothorax should be made from the transudative effusion in congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, and excessive volume overload . The interpretation of pleuroperitoneal leak-related hydrothorax as a volume overload and subsequent application of hypertonic peritoneal exchange worsen the clinical course and can lead to mortality.\n\n【3】We here present the data from a patient who developed acute bilateral hydrothorax at the 16th month of CAPD treatment.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 43-year-old female, with end-stage renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis, on CAPD for 19 months presented to the emergency room with acute dyspnea. Patient had approximately 1,000 mL urine; PD prescription consisted of four cycles of 2 L exchanges (32 mL/kg) with 1.36% dextrose solution per day. One week before the onset of dyspnea, the patient moved house and actively participated in this move. Patient reported the presence of similar symptoms about 6 months ago when she was noncompliant with her sodium restricted diet. Thus, she tried to comply with sodium restricted diet and continued to have CAPD. She presented to the emergency room with nocturnal shortness of breath, and respiratory rate, blood pressure and pulse were measured 23/min, 138/83 mm Hg and 74/min and rhythmic, respectively. Patient weighed 69.2 kg (dry weight measured in last visit 63.5 kg). Physical examination revealed bilateral lower extremity edema (++), bilaterally decreased breath sounds more prominent in the right hemithorax and dullness to percussion in the right middle zone. Electrocardiogram was consistent with the previous recordings. Laboratory findings consisted of creatinine 6 mg/dL, BUN 51 mg/dL, albumin 3.5 mg/dL, sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, AST 21 U/L, and ALT 20 U/L. In complete blood count, WBC was 6,700 mm <sup>3 </sup> , Hb was 11.1 g/dL, and PLT was 298,000 mm <sup>3 </sup> . pH, HCO <sub>3 </sub> and pCO <sub>2 </sub> were measured 7.4, 21 mEq/L and 36 mm Hg respectively in arterial blood gas analysis. The P/A chest X-ray revealed extensive right-sided pleural effusion and admitted to the hospital with the preliminary diagnosis of volume overload.\n\n【6】Patient complaining of weakness and fatigue, vomiting and cough productive of phlegm and reporting the relief of symptoms in the sitting position was administered 80 mg of IV loop diuretic. The initial dialysate exchange was performed with 2,000 mL PD solution containing 2.7% glucose and patient’s shortness of breath got worse. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed and revealed pleural fluid glucose 439 mg/dL, LDL 23 U/L, and total protein 286 mg/dL. Simultaneous to the thoracentesis, a sample of serum was obtained and glucose was measured 105 mg/dL. In order to confirm the diagnosis of the pleuroperitoneal leak-related hydrothorax, scintigraphic imaging using a dose of 6 mCi of technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc99m-MAA) was performed . Dynamic and static SPECT images showed the presence of a pleuroperitoneal leak in left and right hemithorax, with leakage being evident in the right hemithorax. PD is discontinued. Since patient refused pleurodesis, permanent dialysis catheter was placed and hemodialysis was initiated. After 8 weeks of hemodialysis treatment, SPECT evaluation repeated for the patient who prefers to do PD . Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) was initiated after confirming the absence of pleuroperitoneal leak. The patient was followed up once a week, and then every 2 weeks and no hydrothorax observed.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The fluid passage between the peritoneal and pleural cavity stems usually from the congenital or acute diaphragmatic defects . It has been mooted that during the PD treatment, increased intraabdominal pressure can tear the previously intact collagen fibers and eventually leads to leakage . In addition, it has been reported that the PD treatment in patients with disturbances in the lymphatic drainage can be the cause of the hydrothorax . Krishnan et al  identified the frequent development of acute hydrothorax in patients on PD initiated at 40 mL/kg dialysate volume compared to the patient’s dialysate volume gradually increased. It is evident that acute hydrothorax can develop in few hours to few years in patients having CAPD . Pleuro-peritoneal leak secondary to congenital defect usually develops shortly after the initiation of the PD treatment . However, like in our case, there are patients presenting with the late development of hydrothorax even in the eighth year of PD treatment . Hydrothorax usually develops in the right side since left diaphragmatic defects are covered by heart and pericardial surface .\n\n【9】In cases developing hydrothorax, depending on the severity of the leak, majority of the cases present with sudden-onset dyspnea as well as asymptomatic cases . Dyspnea is more prominent at night and it resolves in the sitting position. Pleura-peritoneal leak-related hydrothorax cases can present with ultrafiltration failure, discomfort in the chest and cough. Physical examination consists of unilateral (leak side) decrease in breath sounds, increase in thoracic vibrations and dullness to percussion. P/A chest X-ray demonstrates leak side pleural effusion. Congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, tuberculous pleurisy and ultrafiltration failure should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pleuroperitoneal leak-related hydrothorax . Misdiagnosing hydrothorax and treating this condition as an ultrafiltration failure and increasing the dialysate osmolarity can cause worsening of clinical course .\n\n【10】Biochemical examination of the pleural fluid in cases developing hydrothorax secondary to pleuro-peritoneal leakage is guiding for the clinician. Pleural fluid is in transudative in nature and protein and LDH concentration is lower than the serum; in contrast pleural fluid glucose concentration is higher than the serum glucose concentration and therefore called “sweet” hydrothorax . The diagnostic cut-off value of the pleural glucose concentration is obscure. Even though pleural fluid glucose concentration is recommended to be > 300 - 400 mg/dL in terms of diagnosis , there are pleuro-peritoneal leakage cases reported with the pleural fluid glucose concentration of 123 mg/dL . In order to diagnose the leakage, Chow et al  suggested to use pleural fluid-to-serum glucose gradient and > 50 mg/dL gradient being the cut-off value rather than using pleural fluid glucose concentration. However, even in less gradient change, it has been reported that pleural fluid collection can be secondary to pleura-peritoneal leakage . The glucose content of pleural fluid depends on the diameter of the defect causing the leakage, absorption rate of glucose from the pleural surface, glucose concentration of the dialysate and the duration between the dialysate exchange and pleural fluid sample collection . Variations of values in all these studies probably result from the above mentioned factors. Therefore, a precise cut-off value for the pleural fluid glucose concentration and the pleural fluid-to-serum glucose gradient could not be determined. Demonstration of the presence of D-lactate in the pleural fluid, a molecule not synthesized in human body and used to buffer peritoneal dialysis fluids, is beneficial in terms of diagnosis. Lack of analysis of this lactate isomer in majority of the centers limits its usage .\n\n【11】Radionuclide scanning is a trusted method in the diagnosis of the pleuro-peritoneal leakage . In order to visualize the leakage 3 - 10 mCi dose of Tc99m-MAA or sulfur colloid is added to the dialysate and periodic images from 30 min to 4 h are obtained. Activity in the thorax is considered the proof of leakage.\n\n【12】In patients identified with pleuro-peritoneal leakage, as the initial step of the treatment PD should be paused and symptomatic relief should be provided with the help of thoracentesis. Secondly, repair of the defect causing the leakage could be performed. Suspending PD treatment for 2 - 8 weeks and temporary hemodialysis during this period is the frequent treatment of choice . Removal of the pressure gradient between peritoneum and pleura can lead to healing of the diaphragmatic defect causing the leakage. Because temporary interruption of CAPD risk-free, it is generally recommended as the first-line treatment option. This approach results in recovery in 50% of the cases, but there is a high rate of recurrence . Another option is the surgical closure of the defect causing the leakage with conventional pleurodesis, open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). In conventional pleurodesis, sclerosing agents like talc, autologous blood, glue, bleomycin, doxycycline or tetracycline can be infused after the insertion of a thorax tube into the hemithorax with pleuroperitoneal leakage. Fibrosis resulting from the inflammation caused by a sclerosing agent can permanently patch the defect causing the leakage . It is adequate to wait for 10 days prior to resuming PD treatment in cases having pleurodesis. It should be bear in mind that pleurodesis is a painful treatment and there is 50% recurrence rate . In open thoracotomy, defect in the diaphragm is accessed through a small intercostal incision. Diaphragm is directly visualized and other possible defects can be identified with the concurrent infusion of fluid into the peritoneum. Defect can be repaired with sutures and Teflon patch may be used to reinforce the repair. After the repair, infusion of fluid into the peritoneum helps identification of any remnant leakage. In cases repaired by open thoracotomy, no recurrence has been reported . VATS can be utilized in the treatment since it enables minimally invasive visualization of the diaphragm, repair of the potential defect or infusion of the sclerosing agent directly into the defective region. In patients treated with thoracoscopic pleurodesis, PD treatment can be restarted in 3 - 4 weeks post pleurodesis with a very low rate of recurrence . On the other hand, it has been shown that thoracoscopic diaphragm plication allows starting peritoneal dialysis on the week of operation .\n\n【13】In conclusion, development of acute hydrothorax in end-stage renal failure patients on CAPD is a rare, but life-threatening complication. Major complaint of the patients is the acute dyspnea, exacerbating at night and resolving in the sitting position. Diagnosis is made by the demonstration of the increased glucose content of the pleural fluid compared to serum in biochemical examination and identification of the leakage using the imaging techniques. Discontinuation of PD treatment 2 - 8 weeks for the self-healing of the diaphragmatic defect or repairment of the defect with conventional pleurodesis, open thoracotomy, VATS allows patients to resume PD treatment after the complicating leakage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The early postoperative period was uncomplicated; the patient was discharged home with bariatric liquid diet on day 7 after the procedure.\n\n【4】On postoperative day 14, the patient developed abdominal pain radiating into the right and left shoulder, diaphoresis, tachycardia (heart rate 102 beats per minute, blood pressure 134/70 mmHg). Her white blood cell count was 16.0 х 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen demonstrated a large rim-enhancing multiloculated air and fluid collection near the gastrojejunal anastomosis and a small amount of free intraabdominal fluid . Fluoroscopic study of the esophagus and stomach with gastrografin (Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) demonstrated a large extraluminal contrast collection close to the gastrojejunal anastomosis with abscess formation . An urgent diagnostic laparoscopy with on-table flexible gastroscopy was performed. No free purulent secretion was found in the abdominal cavity; only a small amount of serous fluid was aspirated. The abscess cavity was not entered. Flexible gastroscopy identified a large blow out of the gastrojejunal anastomosis and an abscess cavity behind it. Gastroscopic air insufflation and methylene blue injection into the gastric pouch and the adjacent abscess cavity did not demonstrate any bubbling or blue dye leak into the abdominal cavity. The leakage thus was found to be contained. A nasogastric tube was placed into the abscess cavity with the flexible gastroscope. The abdominal cavity was drained with a Jackson-Pratt drain placed into the left subdiaphragmatic space. The gastrostomy tube, placed in the original procedure and still remaining in a good position, was connected to a straight drain.\n\n【5】Postoperatively, the patient was stable, slowly improving. Enteral feeding through the gastrostomy into the gastric remnant was continued during all the time of hospital admission and after the discharge home on postoperative day 25. No oral intake was allowed. Subsequent flexible gastroscopy and serial radiological studies with oral water-soluble contrast two and three weeks later demonstrated decrease in the size of the abscess and no intraabdominal leak of contrast . No gastrointestinal content or purulent material was detected coming from the Jackson-Pratt abdominal drain. After her hospital discharge, patient continued recovering with enteral feeding via gastrostomy; her nasogastric tube was removed and the gastrostomy tube was discontinued later, after subsequent follow up controls confirmed her favorable evolution.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】The leakage from the gastrojejunal anastomosis after RYGB is one of the most serious complications in bariatric surgery. It was reported to occur in 1.4% of RYGB patients . The leaks are recognized as risk factors related to postoperative mortality . mmediate recognition of a leak is crucial to prevent severe surgical sepsis and death. The diagnosis of the anastomotic leak includes clinical signs (tachycardia, fever, pain radiating to shoulders, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability), urgent radiological investigations, such as CT of abdomen and upper gastrointestinal series with water-soluble contrast, or direct visualization of the leaking site on urgent laparoscopy or laparotomy in unstable patient. Urgent surgical exploration has an advantage of a possible mechanical closure of the defect or exact placement of drains in the desirable position. These leaks can generate an important amount of effluent and the correct drain position is paramount. Intraoperative flexible gastroscopy is imperative, as it allows to assess the location and extension of the defect, and to insufflate air or methylene blue into the stomach, permitting thus to identify any luminal connection with the abdominal cavity. Stable patients can be managed non-operatively, provided that an adequate drainage of the extraluminal collection is achieved. Typically, such extraluminal collections are drained externally under radiological guidance, CT or ultrasound, if no surgical drain is in place from the original procedure . External drainage of an upper gastrointestinal leak can lead to formation of a chronic fistula, which can persist for a long time. Open RYGB represents a specific challenge in case of postoperative complication as created postoperative adhesions may preclude urgent laparoscopic exploration. Laparoscopic approach is preferred due to its lower morbidity. In the reported case, the performance of the exploration by less traumatic laparoscopic approach permitted to mobilize a morbidly obese patient and restart enteral feeding sooner, contributing in this way to a faster recovery. External drainage of the intraabdominal abscess was achieved by flexible gastroscopy, avoiding the risk of formation of external fistula. Other crucial components of management of gastrojejunal leak include parenteral or enteral nutrition via gastric remnant or jejunostomy and antibiotics.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Gastrojejunal anastomotic leakage following RYGB can be life threatening and difficult to manage. The present report describes a successful completely endoscopic management of a contained leak with a placement of nasogastric draining tube and enteral feeding via gastric remnant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

AL amyloidosis is the most commonly diagnosed form of cardiac amyloidosis. It is associated with a B-cell dyscrasia and AL amyloid fibrils are composed of fragments of either kappa or lambda monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. In some patients, overt multiple myeloma may co-exist and is associated with a poorer prognosis . One or many vital organ systems may be involved (commonly the kidneys, liver, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems and soft tissues). The heart is frequently the predominant organ affected by amyloid deposition and is the sole organ involved in a small proportion of patients .\n\n【2】Although AL amyloidosis typically is viewed as a rare disease, its incidence is similar to that of Hodgkin’s lymphoma or chronic myelogenous leukemia . It is estimated to affect 5 - 12 people per million per year, although autopsy studies suggest that the incidence might be higher .\n\n【3】The condition usually presents as a restrictive cardiomyopathy that leads to death from heart failure in most patients. Diagnosis at early stages of the disease and prompt initiation of therapy are crucial.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our cardiology clinic with a history of exercise-induced retrosternal pain and dyspnea. She denied any history of smoking or alcohol/drug abuse and was not on any medications. On physical examination, vital signs were normal. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable, in particular no signs of heart failure. Laboratory values on admission revealed elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. A 12-lead electrocardiography showed a bifascicular block and T-wave inversion in the anterior chest wall leads . A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular systolic function, infero-lateral apical hypokinesis, impaired relaxation and elevated filling pressures. A coronary angiography was performed which revealed no epicardial coronary artery stenosis .\n\n【6】The clinical picture was initially interpreted as perimyocarditis. Therapy was therefore started with diclofenac. Cardiac amyloidosis was also considered; however, the protein electrophoresis was unremarkable, in particular no monoclonal gammopathy.\n\n【7】The follow-up took place 1 month later. The patient was still complaining of exercise-induced pectanginous symptoms. A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal global left ventricular function (EF 58%) with persistence of inferolateral hypokinesis. For further investigation, a cardiac MRI adenosine stress test was carried out. This revealed no indications of myocarditis or myocardial fibrosis. A relevant infarction was excluded. The left ventricular myocardium showed borderline thickening and a detectable endocardial delay in perfusion in almost all sections of the wall . Microvascular dysfunction or cardiac syndrome X was initially postulated and a therapy was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blocker.\n\n【8】Over the further course of treatment, the patient suffered relapses resulting in several hospitalizations due to cardiac decompensation. Over time, she developed a severe heart failure. A follow-up revealed an LVEF of 35% with diffuse hypokinesis. Impaired relaxation and elevated filling pressures with restrictive mitral inflow pattern were consistent with severe diastolic dysfunction. Also noted was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. An additional coronary angiography was carried out. It still revealed normal epicardial coronary arteries with clear slow flow at the level of the intramyocardial vessels (myocardial blush) as a sign of possible microvascular dysfunction. No improvement of the symptoms was achieved in spite of intensification of the anti-ischemic therapy with nicorandil, nebivolol and isosorbide dinitrate.\n\n【9】Right heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy was performed during her last hospitalization, which took place about 15 months after the onset of symptoms. In addition to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures, it showed the dip-and-plateau sign noted on right ventricular pressure tracings. The biopsy revealed abundant AL amyloid deposits . The bone marrow biopsy revealed plasma cell infiltration of 70%, leading to the diagnosis of amyloidosis associated with AL kappa multiple myeloma. In addition, the amyloidosis was found to have affected the liver (hepatomegaly), kidneys (proteinuria), joints and soft tissue (macroglossia and suspected carpal tunnel syndrome). There was still no visible M component in the protein electrophoresis, but hypogammaglobulinemia was detected.\n\n【10】Chemotherapy was started with bortezomib and dexamethasone which had to be discontinued due to adverse reactions. The patient opted for a supportive and palliative care and expired on the 45th day of hospitalization.\n\n【11】The autopsy of the patient revealed kappa-type plasmocytoma with moderate bone marrow infiltration and generalized systemic AL amyloidosis as cause of death .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The typical patient with heart failure resulting from AL amyloidosis frequently presents with rapidly progressive signs and symptoms. Progressive dyspnea is common, almost always associated with evidence of elevated right-sided filling pressure. Peripheral edema may be profound, and in late-stage disease, ascites is not uncommon. Weight loss, which is common, may represent the effects of the systemic disease or may be a manifestation of cardiac cachexia. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis may present with chest discomfort. Usually this is not typical of angina and is associated with congestive heart failure. However, typical angina can occur because of involvement of the small vessels of the heart. Characteristic electrocardiogram features include low voltage in the limb leads or loss of anterior forces consistent with anteroseptal infarction. There have been case reports of intramural coronary artery stenosis and obstruction in patients with amyloidosis and concurrent heart failure, angina, or arrhythmias, but many patients with infarct patterns on electrocardiogram do not have major underlying atherosclerotic disease. These infarct patterns may be caused by amyloid-mediated occlusion of smaller intramyocardial arteries. Atrial fibrillation and heart block are also common electrocardiogram findings. When present, symptomatic conduction system disease often follows the onset of congestive heart failure and may require pacemaker placement. Imaging studies may be positive, leading to cardiac catheterization with apparently normal epicardial coronary arteries on coronary angiography. Myocardial flow reserve in such patients is impaired because of the small vessel involvement, and a small but persistent elevation in serum troponin may be present, leading to a misdiagnosis of non-Q-wave infarction. Presumably, the troponin elevation represents ongoing myocyte necrosis and it has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor. Small vessel cardiac amyloid may occur in the absence of wall thickening on the echocardiogram, although there is often a mild elevation of left ventricular filling pressure suggesting diastolic abnormalities of the ventricle. This presentation of amyloidosis is rare; it is seen in only 1-2% of patients with cardiac involvement .\n\n【14】The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires demonstration of amyloid in tissue and demonstration of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Tissue amyloid deposits demonstrate apple-green birefringence when stained with Congo red and viewed under polarizing microscopy. Once a tissue diagnosis of amyloidosis has been established, confirmation of AL disease requires demonstration of a plasma cell dyscrasia by a bone marrow biopsy showing predominance of λ- or κ-producing plasma cells or by the presence of a monoclonal light chain in the serum or urine . The recently introduced serum free-light-chain (FLC) assay, a nephelometric immunoassay, has a sensitivity for circulating FLCs that is reportedly > 10-fold that of immunofixation electrophoresis .\n\n【15】The treatment and prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis directly depend on the underlying etiology of amyloid deposition. However, in general calcium channel blockers are contraindicated due to case reports of worsening left ventricular function in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, thought to be related to their negative inotropic effects . Beta blockers are often avoided for the same reason . Digoxin should be used with caution because it is bound extracellularly by amyloid fibrils, which may cause patients with amyloidosis to be “hypersensitive” to its effects . ACE inhibitors or other vasodilating agents are of varying utility depending on the presence or absence of comorbidities such as the nephrotic syndrome or refractory orthostatic hypotension. Pacemakers may be required depending on the degree of conduction system disease . Some clinicians also advocate treating patients with warfarin with a goal international normalized ratio of 2.0 - 3.0 because of the higher incidence of intrachamber thrombi seen in cardiac amyloidosis, even in the absence of atrial fibrillation .\n\n【16】Several case reports and retrospective cohort studies have described a marginal benefit with the use of internal cardioverter defibrillators in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Detection of early cardiac involvement and proper identification of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to rapid progressive amyloidosis needs to be defined .\n\n【17】The prognosis for patients with AL amyloidosis is poor. Median survival is 13 months without treatment and can be extended to 17 months with cyclic oral melphalan and prednisone therapy . However, such treatment rarely results in complete remission of disease or reversal of end organ dysfunction because of amyloid deposits. Only 5% of patients survive for more than 10 years . Recently, high-dose intravenous melphalan has been combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation resulting in varying degrees of hematologic response, decreased end-organ dysfunction and prolonged survival in some patients . High-dose thalidomide and dexamethasone have been tried as well, but few patients are able to tolerate the toxicity of this regimen . Cardiac transplantation has been used in some patients with AL amyloidosis, but long-term survival is less favorable than in patients transplanted for other conditions .\n\n【18】This is an unusual case of cardiac amyloidosis with atypical clinical presentation and negative initial workup for amyloidosis, including serum/urine protein electrophoresis tests. Serum FLC assay was not performed as the index of suspicion for systemic amyloidosis was initially low. Both coronary angiography and CMR imaging showed evidence of microvascular dysfunction. This pattern may be caused by amyloid-mediated occlusion of smaller intramyocardial arteries.\n\n【19】In conclusion, patients with cardiac amyloidosis have very poor survival without therapy. Diagnosis at early stages of the disease and prompt initiation of therapy are crucial. Non-invasive diagnostic methods, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular MRI, are useful for diagnosis in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive heart failure, but some findings are not specific for cardiac amyloid and can be found in other restrictive cardiomyopathies.\n\n【20】A high index of suspicion for systemic amyloidosis warrants obtaining also a serum FLC assay as it can detect circulating FLC with 10-fold greater sensitivity than immunofixation in AL amyloidosis .\n\n【21】Endomyocardial biopsy is the only method by which the presence of cardiac amyloidosis can be directly verified but this method is invasive, expensive and not always available .\n\n【22】A rapid initial therapy mainly with diuretics is usually needed to stabilize patients with congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure drugs are usually not well tolerated and the long-term benefits are uncertain. Chemotherapeutic agents could delay the progress of the disease and prolong survival in some patients, but rarely result in complete remission or reversal of end organ dysfunction. Cardiac transplantation, although still controversial, should be considered in highly selected cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a6c2dfc3-ec45-4187-8fd7-ba1d6d357107", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder resulting from a primary disorder of connective tissue, first described by the Parisian pediatrician, Antonie-Bernard Marfan in 1896 . Its incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 - 20,000 individuals, and it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, although at least 25% of cases result from a new mutation in the FBN1 gene . The clinical diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent criteria and can be confirmed by genetic testing . The primary organ systems involved include the heart, aorta, eye, musculoskeletal, skin, lung, and central nervous system . Involvement of the heart and aorta are recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MFS. Dilation of the ascending aorta occurs in 77% of affected individuals, with progression to dissection in 14% of patients .\n\n【2】The primary cellular defect of MFS is a mutation of the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) on chromosome 15 (15q21.1) . Fibrillin-1 is a matrix glycoprotein essential for the formation of microfibrils that regulate the formation and repair of connective tissue throughout the body. These microfibrils are also integral to the normal control and function of growth factors including tissue growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which are responsible for the development and repair of connective tissue. Fibrillin-1 regulates TGF-β which activates metalloproteinases (MMPs). The combination of structural microfibril matrix abnormalities and dysregulation of matrix homeostasis mediated by excess TGF-β and overexpression of MMPs is responsible for the phenotypic features of MFS in various organ systems .\n\n【3】The imbalance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) damages the elastin structure, leading to loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, with the associated clinical manifestations involving the aorta and heart. Given the multisystem involvement of MFS, anesthetic care is frequently required during surgical or orthopedic procedures . We present a 15-year-old adolescent who required anesthetic care during spinal fusion. The perioperative implications of MFS are presented, previous reports of anesthetic care reviewed, and options for perioperative care discussed.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 15-year-old, 54 kg adolescent who presented for posterior spinal fusion for the treatment of thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis. Her past medical history was significant for MFS, psychiatric disorder with a history of aggressive behavior, and attention deficit disorder. Her past surgical history included mechanical aortic valve replacement 3 years prior to the current surgery. Aortic valve sparing aortic root replacement and mitral valve repair were performed 6 years prior to surgery. Her medication regimen included warfarin 5 mg once a day, aspirin 81 mg once a day and losartan 25 mg once a day.\n\n【6】Warfarin and aspirin were discontinued 4 days prior to surgery and full anticoagulation provided by a continuous heparin infusion. Echocardiogram 5 months prior to the procedure demonstrated mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation and normal systolic function. The heparin infusion rate was based on laboratory parameters (partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and anti-factor Xa assay). The patient was held nil per os for 8 h. The heparin infusion was discontinued 4 h prior to the surgery; however, the PTT remained elevated at 60 s, so the surgical procedure was delayed for 1 hour and a repeat PTT was obtained (44 s).\n\n【7】The patient was premedicated with intravenous midazolam (2 mg) through a pre-existing peripheral intravenous cannula, and transported to the operating room, where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Following preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg), lidocaine (60 mg), and sufentanil (20 µg). Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty. Rocuronium (50 mg) was administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade and revealed a Cormack-Lehane Grade 1 view. A 7.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed on the first attempt. Two 16 gauge intravenous cannulas were placed. A 20 gauge arterial cannula was placed in the left radial artery. Neurophysiological monitoring, including motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was performed.\n\n【8】Following our usual practice to allow for neurophysiological monitoring during spinal surgery, anesthesia was maintained with desflurane titrated to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) at 50 - 60 and a sufentanil infusion of 0.1 - 0.3 µg/kg/h to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 55 - 65 mm Hg . An esmolol infusion (25 - 30 µg/kg/min) was administered to maintain the heart rate at the baseline rate of 60 - 80 beats/min and a lidocaine infusion (30 µg/kg/min) was administered to prevent arrhythmias and to provide analgesia. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. The surgical procedure included an anterior arthrodesis of the thoracic and lumbar spine (T11-L4) through an anterior thoracoabdominal incision. The surgical duration was 400 min. Total blood loss was estimated at 750 mL and urine output was 325 mL. Total fluids included 1,774 mL of isotonic crystalloid, 500 mL of 5% albumin, and one unit of packed red blood cells.\n\n【9】During wound closure, the sufentanil infusion was discontinued. Acetaminophen (1,000 mg) and hydromorphone (0.5 mg) were administered to provide postoperative analgesia. After completion of the surgical procedure and prior to tracheal extubation, bilateral ultrasound-guided, erector spinae blocks were performed with 0.25% ropivacaine (20 mL) with epinephrine (1:200,000) and preservative-free dexamethasone (4 mg). Following completion of the blocks, the patient was turned supine and her trachea was extubated in the operating room. She was transported to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU). Postoperative pain control in the CTICU was provided with hydromorphone delivered via a patient controlled analgesia device. Warfarin was restarted on postoperative day (POD) 1. Enoxaparin was administered from POD 1 to 4. The remainder of her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged on POD 6.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MFS is a well described, autosomal dominant connective tissue disease caused by mutation of the FBN1 gene. The diagnosed is based on the revised Ghent nosology established in 2010 . Aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva (z value ≥ 2), aortic root dissection, ectopia lentis, and the FBN1 mutation are the most important factors for diagnosis . Effective perioperative care begins with a thorough preoperative evaluation, with identification of anatomical and end-organ effects of MFS, as well as adverse effects or implications related to therapeutic interventions, such as the long-term anticoagulation required in our patient. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers is the potential for difficult endotracheal intubation related to a high arched palate and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation . A significant percentage of patients with MFS have a high arched palate (59%). TMJ involvement is also common, with symptoms of TMJ dysfunction noted in 52% of patients with MFS, of whom 35% had previously received medical treatment, and 24% had symptoms of subluxation . Given these concerns, the appropriate equipment for dealing with a difficult airway, including an indirect laryngoscopy device, should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction . If there are concerns, general anesthesia can be induced by the incremental inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation until effective bag-valve-mask ventilation is demonstrated. Alternatively, as in our patient, intravenous induction can be achieved with propofol, and effective bag-valve-mask ventilation can be followed by the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent.\n\n【12】Airway involvement with craniofacial abnormalities and laxity of upper airway musculature results in a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with MFS, even in the absence of obesity. Craniofacial and upper airway skeletal muscle involvement results in increased nasal airway resistance and upper airway collapse . Given the residual effects of opioids and neuromuscular blocking agents on respiratory function, postoperative monitoring may be indicated, especially when ongoing pain management requires the use of opioids .\n\n【13】In addition to airway abnormalities, respiratory and pulmonary involvement may predispose to barotrauma due to blebs or bullae. The frequency of spontaneous pneumothorax has been reported to be as high as 4-15% in patients with MFS . Apical blebs or bullae significantly increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. When there are concerns noted on a preoperative chest radiograph, computed tomography may help in risk stratification. Additionally, chest wall and vertebral bony abnormalities (scoliosis or pectus excavatum) may impact respiratory function. Progressive scoliosis is a well-known cause of pulmonary dysfunction. Scoliosis with a curve greater than 65, 100, and 120 degrees may result in restrictive lung disease noted only on pulmonary function testing, symptomatic lung disease with a clinical impact, and alveolar hypoventilation, respectively .\n\n【14】Patients with MFS and scoliosis or pectus excavatum may have marked reductions in total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ). Pulmonary function values calculated by body height underestimate true values in patients with MFS because of long-bone overgrowth. Expected values calculated by normalized or sitting height are suggested to give a better evaluation of true pulmonary function . Given these concerns, intraoperative strategies to minimize barotrauma may be indicated, including the use of lower tidal volumes, careful monitoring or peak inflating pressure, prolongation of the inspiratory time, and pressure-controlled ventilation with monitoring of exhaled tidal volume. If alterations in compliance or resistance are noted, the potential for a pneumothorax as the etiology must be considered.\n\n【15】Postoperatively, severe kyphoscoliosis related to neuromuscular disease, as well as OSA and primary respiratory involvement, may predispose to respiratory insufficiency or failure. Patients who have abnormal results on their pulmonary function test, particularly a forced vital capacity less than 30%, or those who have hypercapnia preoperatively have been shown to have a higher need for postoperative ventilation . Preoperative optimization of pulmonary function is suggested, including the aggressive treatment of respiratory infections and instructions regarding the use of postoperative incentive spirometry. Non-invasive techniques of respiratory support, such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), may facilitate postoperative tracheal extubation and avoid postoperative respiratory insufficiency or failure in patients with pre-existing pulmonary dysfunction .\n\n【16】As noted in our patient, the cardiovascular system is frequently affected in patients with MFS, including aortic and pulmonary artery dilation, valvular regurgitation, left ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. MVP is the most common cause of severe mitral valve regurgitation, as upregulation of TGF-β results in myxomatous changes of the atrioventricular valves . This results in elongation and thickening of atrioventricular valve leaflets. By 30 years of age, the Weibull cumulative distribution has been reported to be 42.6% for MVP, 56.5% for MVR of any degree, 6.7% for severe MVR, and 0.9% for MV endocarditis in patients with MFS . In children with early onset of severe MFS, mitral valve dysfunction, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure, is the leading cause of death in infancy. Tricuspid valve regurgitation and prolapse can also occur, although surgery is rarely required . Aortic valve regurgitation can occur as well, but it generally occurs in the second and third decade of life, related to progressive aortic root dilation.\n\n【17】Aortic root dilation is the most common cardiovascular manifestation of MFS, occurring in 60% of affected individuals. Aortic root rupture and dissection remain the most life-threatening events in patients with MFS. The aorta dilates most between 6 to 14 years of age . Management may include both medical and surgical management options. Medical therapy includes a combination of β-adrenergic antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Beta-adrenergic blockade reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and aortic root dilation . The target heart rate is less than 60 - 70 beats per minutes at rest . Intraoperatively, esmolol may be used to provide rapid and precise heart rate control. ARBs regulate excessive TGF-β signaling, which may play an etiologic role in aortic root dilation .\n\n【18】Ascending aorta root replacement is the only way to prevent fatal events including dissection and rupture. Elective surgery is recommended when the maximum aortic root diameter is greater than 5.0 - 5.5 cm in adult patients. If the patients have a family history of aortic rupture, or increase in aortic diameter exceeding 1 cm/year, earlier surgical intervention is recommended. Various surgical procedures have been offered, including various valve sparing procedures which preserve the native aortic valve and eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation . When mechanical valve replacement is performed, long-term anticoagulation with coumadin is required.\n\n【19】Guidelines for perioperative anticoagulation therapy have been published by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology . As in our patient, coumadin or other oral anticoagulation agents are stopped 3 - 4 days prior to surgery, and full anticoagulation started with heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) once the international normalized ratio (INR) falls below the therapeutic threshold. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is stopped 4 - 6 h prior to surgery and subcutaneous low molecular heparin is stopped 12 h prior to surgery, to allow return of coagulation function to normal. Anticoagulation is restarted as soon as the postoperative bleeding risk allows, typically 12 to 24 h after surgery.\n\n【20】In addition to valvular dysfunction and aortic root dilation, ventricular arrhythmias may occur in up to 21% of patients with MFS, with one report suggesting that this was the cause of death in 4% of patients . Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was also noted in 40% of patients. Microfibril abnormalities in the matrix of the myocardium result in arrhythmogenesis and may affect conduction . Given these concerns, a preoperative 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram are suggested. A more thorough workup such as a Holter monitor may be indicated in patients with symptoms.\n\n【21】Ocular involvement, including ectopia lentis, is common in MFS and may predispose to perioperative visual loss (POVL) during spine surgery. Additional ocular involvement may include thinning of the cornea, early onset of cataracts, glaucoma, strabismus, and retinal detachment. Although POVL is rare, its impact on the quality of life is significant, and spinal surgery represents a high risk population with an incidence of POVL ranging from 0.017% to 0.1% . Ischemic injury to the optic nerve due to venous congestion is the most common cause of POVL following spinal surgery. Symptoms present immediately after the surgery and are typically bilateral. Risk factors include anemia, hypotension, blood loss, prolonged surgical times, large fluid requirements, male gender and obesity . Prevention should remain the primary focus, with routine position checks to ensure that there is no direct pressure on the eyes or orbits. Others have suggested the use of colloid instead of crystalloid as well as avoidance of hypotension, anemia, and hypovolemia. A staged procedure should be considered if a long surgery is anticipated.\n\n【22】Finally, intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord function with somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) further impacts anesthetic management during PSF . Both inhaled and intravenous anesthetic agents may depress SSEP and MEP signal attainment . Our general practice includes the use of a low dose of an inhalational anesthetic agent combined with the infusion of a potent opioid (sufentanil or remifentanil) . When inhalational anesthetic agents are used, it is generally recommended to maintain end-tidal concentrations levels at or below 0.5 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) to allow for adequate MEP monitoring. These agents provide an effective intraoperative anesthetic while allowing for neurophysiological monitoring and providing a rapid emergence at the conclusion of the case.\n\n【23】In summary, we present the perioperative management of an adolescent with MFS for spinal fusion. As the primary defect affects fibrillin-1, a matrix glycoprotein essential for the formation and repair of connective tissue, multisystem involvement is present. Progressive skeletal deformities may require orthopedic procedures such as spinal fusion. Most importantly, the cardiovascular system may be involved with valvular regurgitation, aortic root dilation, and arrhythmias. Additional comorbid concerns include airway involvement (difficult intubation, sleep disordered breathing), respiratory involvement (risk of barotrauma), and ocular involvement.

No previous case reports have described spondylodiscitis due to Bacteroides fragilis that occurred after a spine trauma. We assume that spine trauma could represent a “ locus minoris resistentiae ” facilitating the initiation of a new focus of infection for Bacteroides fragilis from a primary intestinal infective focus.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 41-year-old white Caucasian man was admitted to our Operative Unit because of abdominal pain and fever. Past medical history revealed bilateral nephrolithiasis and depressive syndrome. One year before he had experienced a thoracic trauma, secondary to car crash, without any neurological consequences. His medications included an antidepressive drug (venlafaxine) and benzodiazepines.\n\n【4】On admission the patient presented a temperature of 38.8 °C and complained colicky abdominal pain. A thorough physical examination was performed. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness without signs of peritoneal irritation; Murphy’s sign, renal and appendicular punches were negative. Heart, neurological, and thoracic examinations were unremarkable. On laboratory tests, the cell count demonstrated 12,470 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, with 70% neutrophils. C-reactive protein (PCR) was 21.6 mg/dL. Hepatic, renal, coagulative function, and urinalysis were within normal limits. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Abdominal X-ray, chest radiography, and abdominal ultrasounds showed no abnormalities. The abdominal CT scan demonstrated sub-acute appendicitis. Surgical treatment was not indicated and an empirical antibiotic therapy with I.V. levofloxacin and antipiretic drug (paracetamol) and was started. After 7 days, the patient presented a complete remission of the symptoms; a control TC scan of the abdomen showed the regression of appendicular inflammation; nevertheless, within a few days fever accompanied by shivering recurred. Because of the persistent febrile status of unknown origin, blood culture specimens were further collected and a 2-\\[ F\\]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was requested. Contrast tomography (CT) attenuation images were used for PET correction (PET/TC). PET/TC revealed an intense FDG uptake in the intervertebral disc between thoracic vertebra 6 and 7; no abnormal FDG uptake was recognized in other areas and diagnosis of discitis was made . T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense signal in T6 and T7 vertebral bodies and in the corresponding intervertebral disc , where post-gadolinium T1-weighted MRI demonstrated a strong enhancement associated with the presence of an extradural collection . These radiological findings were consistent with spondylodiscitis. Once blood cultures grow Bacteroides fragilis , the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis was made. As expected on the basis of clinical course, Bacteroides fragilis strain was resistant to quinolones, while it was sensitive to metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. A combined treatment with these drugs was started, while levoxacine was discontinued, with complete remission of fever. After 2 months follow-up, a thoracic spine MRI showed a complete regression of the inflammatory pattern.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Spondylodiscitis due to Bacteroides fragilis in an uncommon finding . Most cases of spondylodiscitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis result from hematogenous spread from a digestive portal of entry . The patient’s previous vertebral trauma might have represented the so-called “ locus minoris resistentiae ”  facilitating the initiation of a new focus of infection for Bacteroides fragilis . We assumed that the traumatized bone and discal tissues might be more vulnerable to invasive hematogenous bacterial infection, and that appendicular tract represented primary infective focus. Recently has been reported a case of spondylodiscitis caused by direct inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis that occurred after a percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis .\n\n【7】To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports of spondylodiscitis due to Bacteroides fragilis that occurred after a spine non-iatrogenic trauma.\n\n【8】As described in other clinical reports , our report confirms that PET/CT could be very useful in detecting spondylodiscitis in asymptomatic subjects.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】Our case report suggests that spondylodiscitis due to Bacteroides fragilis should be considered in differential diagnosis in patients with fever of unknown origin and past history of spinal trauma, even if asymptomatic for spinal pain, especially in those who have experienced a recent abdominal infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

PHA has been further sub-classified into PHA I or classical form and PHA II or Gordon syndrome (GS). PHA II or GS is a rare renal tubular defect characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis in the presence of normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), low renin and normal aldosterone levels, reported both in children and adults . It is an autosomal dominant disease. The molecular basis for most individuals who have GS is linked to the loss-of-function mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 or KLHL3 and CUL3 mutations . Patients with GS are traditionally managed with dietary sodium restriction and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) . However, we report three patients who presented with GS as adults and their management with a low potassium diet contrary to a restricted sodium diet and HCTZ diuretic.\n\n【2】Case Reports\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】A 70-year-old female was referred to the clinic for the workup of hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.2 mEq/L). She was reported to have hyperkalemia for the past several years. Other laboratory data showed serum sodium level of 146 mEq/L and CO <sub>2 </sub> of 30 mEq/L. She did not complain of polyuria, oliguria, hematuria, weakness, palpitation, headache or dizziness. Her past medical history included aortic incompetence, mitral regurgitation and urethrocele. There was no family history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperkalemia or kidney failure. On examination, she was awake and alert, oriented × 3 with a blood pressure of 121/60 mm Hg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. There was no peripheral or periorbital edema, abdominal tenderness or swelling. Workup for hyperkalemia displayed low potassium excretion (urine potassium 18) in the presence of markedly elevated serum potassium levels (serum potassium 6. 2 mEq/L) . A diagnosis of GS was made based on hyperkalemia, low potassium excretion, normal aldosterone, normal GFR (65 mL/min) and no history of NSAID overdose, ACEI abuse, diabetes mellitus and hypoaldosteronism. She was started on a low potassium diet as patient refused to take any medication including hydrochlorthiazide. Patient was already on a sodium-restricted diet. Four weeks follow-up showed a serum potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L .\n\n【5】Case 2\n\n【6】A 61-year-old female was referred to the clinic for isolated hyperkalemia (serum potassium: 6.1 mEq/L) for the past several years. She had no other complaints. She had a past history of hyperlipidemia. There was no family history of hypertension, hyperkalemia or kidney disease. On examination, she had a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. Workup done for hyperkalemia showed urine potassium excretion of 7.5 mEq/L, serum potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L, GFR of 60 mL/min and normal aldosterone level . Based on these laboratory findings, a diagnosis of GS was made and the patient was started on a restricted potassium diet. The patient refused to take any medication including hydrochlorthiazide. This patient was already on a sodium-restricted diet. Three weeks follow-up showed normal potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L without any medication .\n\n【7】Case 3\n\n【8】A 79-year-old female presented with weakness and dizziness. She had no complaints of hematuria, polyuria, oliguria, edema leg or pain abdomen. She had a history of hypertension and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. There was no family history of hypertension, diabetes or kidney failure. On examination, she had a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Workup done showed serum potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L, urine potassium excretion of 7 mEq/L, and a GFR of 70 mL/min . Based on these laboratory findings, a diagnosis of GS was made and the patient was started on 25 mg HCTZ and a low potassium diet. The patient was already observing a sodium-restricted diet. Four weeks follow-up showed serum potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L, normal blood pressure (120/80 mm Hg) and no complaint of weakness .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】According to a recent survey, 29.1% of USA population is suffering from hypertension . Although 90-95% of these cases are due to essential hypertension, 5-10% cases are due to secondary causes . Renal parenchyma and renal vascular disorder constitutes one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension . GS is a rare cause of adult hypertension and hyperkalemia. Most patients of GS are asymptomatic until adolescence, when hypertension develops. However, GS can present with normal blood pressure and isolated hyperkalemia . The three cases presented had hyperkalemia; however, only one had hypertension. All were following a sodium-restricted diet and all three responded to a potassium-restricted diet with resolution of hyperkalemia. Only one patient required HCTZ, which controlled hypertension in that patient.\n\n【11】Management of GS is based upon the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder. It has been postulated that hypertension in GS is caused by an increase in sodium reabsorption in the distal nephrons through gain of function of sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) and activation of the OSR1/SPAK-NCC phosphorylation cascade . There is an associated decrease in renal outer medullary potassium channels (ROMK) (decreased potassium excretion), increased epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) (enhanced sodium reabsorption) and increased para-cellular transport of chloride through tight junctions . All these factors together contribute to hypertension, hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. It is important to recognize that plasma renin level is usually low/normal. Plasma and urine aldosterone levels are usually normal because low renin tends to lower and hyperkalemia tends to increase aldosterone levels .\n\n【12】Conventionally, patients with GS respond well to aggressive salt restriction and low dose thiazide diuretics . Thiazide diuretics inhibit NCC and hence reduce sodium reabsorption. In a study by Mayan et al on eight affected patients with GS, marked sensitivity to HCTZ was noticed with normalization of blood pressure and sodium . In contrast, two of our patients had normal blood pressure and refused to take HCTZ. All of our patients were already observing a low-sodium diet. Hence, we for the first time, prescribed a low-potassium diet to our three patients with GS. One of the patients had hypertension and agreed to take HCTZ. The sodium-restriction that this patient was observing did not help with hyperkalemia or hypertension. This patient responded well to a low-potassium diet and HCTZ. Follow-up laboratory results after 3 - 4 weeks in all three patients displayed correction of serum potassium level and normal blood pressure in the patient who also suffered from hypertension.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】While GS has been reported previously in adults and can present with normal blood pressure, to the best of our knowledge, its management by restricted potassium diet has not been reported previously. GS should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with unexplained hyperkalemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Metastatic BCC is rare, affecting 0.028-0.5% of the population . Once it metastasises BCC is highly malignant with short survival times, usually measurable in months. We present a case of BCC on the shoulder that metastasised to bone.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 86 year old housewife presented to her GP complaining of right hip and left thigh pain for 2 months. She reported weight loss of 2 kg over the last 6 months. She had a past medical history of a thyroidectomy for a multinodular goitre in the 1940’s, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension.\n\n【4】Her GP arranged a plain radiograph of her pelvis which demonstrated a lytic lesion in the left femur and right acetabulum . He referred her urgently to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic.\n\n【5】On examination she was comfortable, but cachectic and pale. An 80 x 60 mm exophytic tumor with an ulcerated, haemorrhagic surface was found on her left shoulder  with left sided axillary lymphadenopathy. On further questioning she admitted to having noticed what she thought to be a ‘patch of eczema’ on her left shoulder for the last 4 years, which had ulcerated over the last 18 months. She did not want to be a bother to her doctor and so had been dressing the ulcerated tumor herself.\n\n【6】She was admitted for further investigation.\n\n【7】Her myeloma screen was negative. A CT chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed bony lesions in her sternum, first rib, sacrum, right acetabulum and left shaft of femur .\n\n【8】Hisological examination of a biopsy from the left shoulder lesion confirmed an ulcerated BCC  and biopsies of the bony lesions in the sternum and first rib were provisionally reported as “either BCC with squamoid differentiation or basaloid SCC” .\n\n【9】The tumor was CK5 positive, consistent with a BCC or a squamous cell carcinoma: the positive BerEP4 was consistent with a BCC of skin, however, a basaloid SCC of endodermal origin (namely, oropharyanx, oesophagus, lung or anal canal) would also show this immunohistochemical profile, but in this case the clinical examination eliminated this possibility. Therefore a diagnosis was made of metastatic basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】Our patient commenced on treatment with imiquimod cream to the primary BCC, had uneventful rodding to her left femur in order to prevent a pathological fracture and was offered palliative radiotherapy for the metastatic deposits, which she declined. She died six weeks later.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】BCC is a common skin cancer and is showing a worldwide increase in incidence by up to 10% per year . Thankfully, the incidence of metastatic basal cell carcinoma is rare, affecting just 0.028-0.5% of the population .\n\n【13】One of the predictors of aggressive behaviour is a large primary, as large blood vessel supply may facilitate seeding of the tumor via the haematological route . BCC’s of the face and scalp are thought to have a greater tendency to metastasise because of the increased concentration of large-calibre vessels .The incidence of metastatic spread has been reported as 2% in BCC’s with a diameter larger than 3 cm, 25% for diameters larger than 5 cm and 50% for tumors with a diameter larger than 10 cm . The most common sites of metastasis are the regional lymph nodes, followed by the lungs and bones . Metastatic spread to skin, liver, and pleura has also been observed, but is less common .\n\n【14】Once it metastasises, BCC is highly malignant with a median survival of 8 months . The 5-year survival is estimated at 12% . It is not possible to tell how long our patient had had metastatic disease, though judging by the sizes of the deposits, it is likely they had been present for several months.\n\n【15】Our patient lived to a respectable age despite her metastatic cancer, but had she presented when her BCC was just ‘a patch of eczema’ the outcome may have been different.

We present a case of a 32-year-old woman of child-bearing age who initially underwent surgical laparoscopy for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy with elevated serum β-hCG levels but was unexpectedly diagnosed with synchronous ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma histologically.\n\n【2】Endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the ovary are malignant epithelial tumors associated with endometriosis . Up to one-third of patients with endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary also have synchronous endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinomas  with significant implications on fertility.

Fertility-sparing surgery may only be considered in a selected group of young patients seeking fertility, without compromising patient survival .\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 32-year-old nulliparous woman with no significant past medical history was referred to the Urgent Obstetrics and Gynecology Center where she presented with a sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain associated with vomiting for 2 days on a background of per vaginal spotting for 5 days.\n\n【6】On arrival, her vital signs showed tachycardia of 121 beats per minutes with a normal temperature of 37 °C and blood pressure of 101/87 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen was soft but distended with generalized tenderness. There was no rebound tenderness or guarding. Murphy’s sign was negative. Speculum examination showed a normal appearing cervix with cervical os closed and a small amount of old blood in the vagina. A bedside ultrasound scan showed an empty uterus, a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis and a left adnexal mass. Initial investigations revealed a positive urine pregnancy test with slightly elevated serum β-hCG of 8 IU/L, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 38.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and markedly raised creatinine of 176 µmol/L and urea of 9.2 mmol/L. Liver function test, serum amylase and lipase were normal.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】The clinical diagnosis then was that of a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient was counseled on differential diagnosis of an ovarian mass and the possibility of negative laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy. The patient was agreeable for and underwent an emergency diagnostic laparoscopy keep in view salpingectomy keep in view proceed.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】Intraoperative findings revealed large amounts of ascitic fluid in the abdominal cavity. A total of 2,550 mL of ascitic fluid was aspirated. There was no hemoperitoneum seen in the pelvis. Peritoneal survey performed showed a large 20-cm multiloculated large ovarian mass in the pelvis arising from the left ovary with small bowel adhesions to the mass . The uterus, left tube, right tube and ovary appeared normal and no fallopian ectopic mass was seen.\n\n【11】Clinical decision was made to convert to a midline laparotomy instead in view of the intraoperative findings above. Adhesiolysis was performed to free the cyst from the small bowel and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The ovarian mass was removed whole and intact . A small bowel serosal defect was repaired. Hemostasis was ensured and the abdomen was closed in layers. A left pelvic drained was placed. Gentle curettage to the endometrium did not yield any obvious products of conception. The estimated blood loss was 300 mL.\n\n【12】Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit for acute kidney injury and T-wave inversion noted intraoperatively. Serum creatinine later normalized to 78 µmol/L 12 h post operation, and serum troponin down-trended from 122 ng/L to 54 ng/L. The patient was then transferred to high dependency ward on postoperative day 1, and then to general ward on postoperative day 2. The pelvic drain output down-trended and was removed on postoperative day 4. The patient was discharged well on that same day.\n\n【13】Further investigations postoperatively included ovarian tumor markers, which revealed raised carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 40.5 µg/L and a markedly raised cancer antigen (CA) 125 of 3,099.2 kU/L. A computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was done for staging, which showed no evidence of residual tumor at the surgical bed, no regional or systemic lymphadenopathy and no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n【14】Histopathological analysis of the operative specimen showed a well differentiated endometrioid cystadenocarcinoma arising in endometriotic cysts. There was no vascular space tumor emboli or surface involvement, and the left fallopian tube was normal. The ascitic fluid was found to contain hyperplastic mesothelial cells and was negative for malignant cells.\n\n【15】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【16】Subsequently, the patient was later referred to the gynecological oncology service for discussion of fertility-sparing surgery as she was a young 32-year-old nulliparous female with desire for future fertility. Her case was discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting with a panel of specialists including gynecological oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, and radiology. The patient was counseled on the options of full ovarian cancer staging surgery versus fertility-sparing surgery, and the possibility of a third surgery for full ovarian cancer staging if fertility-sparing staging were to yield malignant histology.\n\n【17】The patient opted for fertility-sparing surgery and underwent a fertility-sparing laparoscopic staging surgery with left pelvic lymph node dissection, para-aortic lymph node dissection, infracolic omentectomy, adhesiolysis, right ovarian nodule biopsy, bladder peritoneum biopsy, hysteroscopy dilation and curettage and hydrotubation. Intraoperatively, a bladder peritoneum nodule of 1 cm and a right ovarian nodule of 2 cm were biopsied. The endometrium appeared fluffy on hysteroscopy and curettage was performed. The right fallopian tube was found to be patent on hydrotubation.\n\n【18】Histological examination revealed that the bladder, peritoneal and ovarian nodules were in keeping with a diagnosis of endometrioid carcinoma, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  grade 1. Pelvic lymph nodes obtained were benign. Endometrial curettings were also in keeping with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, FIGO grade 1.\n\n【19】As histology showed synchronous ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma, the patient was counseled that she was unfortunately not suitable for fertility-sparing surgery. She finally underwent completion full cancer staging surgery with total laparoscopic hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, right pelvic lymph node dissection and peritoneal biopsies. Histological examination revealed endometrial endometrioid carcinoma of 20 mm involving the lower uterine segment, with 11% myometrial invasion. The isthmus was involved while cervical glands and stroma were not involved. There was no lympho-vascular invasion. A focus of grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma of the right ovary arising in an endometriotic cyst was also noted with no ovarian surface involvement. Peritoneal biopsies and dissected pelvic lymph nodes did not show any evidence of malignancy. Peritoneal washing cytology, however, was suspicious for adenocarcinoma.\n\n【20】Consequently, the patient was finally diagnosed to have a grade 1, stage IIB synchronous ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma after clinical-pathological features favored a more likely dual primary cancer, given her younger age, earlier stage and histologically lower grade as compared to metastatic disease and the tumor did not have any choriocarcinomatous elements. A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion among the various specialists as mentioned previously suggested for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy which she later received.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include previous adnexal surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, use of intra-uterine devices (IUD), endometriosis, and previous fertility treatment . Other differential diagnoses for ectopic pregnancy also include ovarian masses like endometriomas and ovarian cancer. Correct diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is made based on patient history, clinical acumen, serum β-hCG levels, pelvic ultrasound with preoperative diagnosis often difficult, challenging and unpredictable in our case where the ovarian mass was “masked” in its similar presentation to an ectopic pregnancy, with large amounts of free fluid in the abdo-pelvis suggestive of hemoperitoneum instead of ascites. Multiple cases of neoplasms mimicking ectopic pregnancies have also been reported in literature, including that of germ cell tumors and mature teratomas, making the diagnosis further challenging .\n\n【23】While the median age of diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinomas is in the sixth decade , it can also arise in women of child-bearing age and mimic an ectopic pregnancy in its acute presentation. The most common presenting symptoms of an endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary are pelvic pain with gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal distension and per vaginal bleeding, all of which were present in the patient discussed above. The combination of a raised β-hCG and an adnexal mass in a female of reproductive age was highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. Additional features of free fluid in the abdo-pelvis on ultrasound, acute onset of generalized abdominal pain and a low hemoglobin further warrants the suspicion of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy associated with increased morbidity and mortality that warranted an emergency surgical intervention.\n\n【24】The incidence of synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer occurs in 3.1-10.0% of patients with endometrial cancer and 10% of those with ovarian cancer . These tumors are more common in younger patients, are associated with low-grade disease and can be diagnosed at an early stage like our patient . The etiology of synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer is not well understood where several mechanisms have been proposed including the extended or secondary mullerian system and theories of endometriosis involving a malignant transformation on endometriotic implants and environmental, immunological, hormonal and genetic factors . The origins of synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer include dual primary cancer, endometrial cancer with ovarian metastasis and ovarian cancer with endometrial metastasis .\n\n【25】Distinguishing between dual primary cancer from metastatic disease is essential for choosing the optimal adjuvant treatment and predicting patient prognosis. Reported clinical-pathological features of dual primary cancer include younger age, earlier stage, histologically lower grade, and a more favorable prognosis than metastatic disease . When intraoperative findings yielded an ovarian mass with gross ascites rather than an ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum, decision was made to remove the tube and ovary for pathological diagnosis and assess patient’s desire for future fertility. Follow-up fertility-sparing staging surgery was attempted; however, with a diagnosis of synchronous ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma, the patient eventually required completion ovarian cancer staging surgery with a total laparoscopic hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection and infracolic omentectomy.\n\n【26】Fertility-sparing surgery is currently safe and feasible in stage IA and IC grade 1 - 2 non-clear cell epithelial ovarian cancer. A multidisciplinary approach may help these patients achieve their fertility goals . However, controversial areas include evaluating the safety of fertility-sparing surgery in patient with high-risk factors such as stage IC, grade 3 tumors, and clear cell histology and type of surgery performed such as salpingo-oophorectomy vs. cystectomy . Patients with synchronous tumors localized to the uterine body and adnexa showed a very low risk for recurrence. Currently, further studies are necessary to identify selected group of patients who may benefit with adjuvant therapy .\n\n【27】In conclusion, an elevated serum β-hCG level accompanied by clinical signs of acute abdomen with ultrasound features of abdominal free fluid in the pelvis and an adnexal mass warrants a high clinical suspicion for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. It is also important to recognize ovarian malignancy as a rare but differential diagnosis to suspected ectopic pregnancy in patients with acute abdomen where urgent surgical intervention is necessary.\n\n【28】Learning points\n\n【29】It is important to consider malignant ovarian neoplasm as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with raised β-hCG level and an adnexal mass. Furthermore, it is paramount to evaluate a patient’s presentation and clinical condition as a whole and intervene emergently when an immediate life-threatening condition such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy is suspected. When a diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma is made in a young female of reproductive age with desire for future fertility, urgent timely referral to a gynecologic oncology service is essential for assessing suitability for fertility-sparing treatment and follow-up. Up to one-third of patients with endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary also have synchronous endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinomas with significant implications on fertility.\n\n【30】While the gold standard treatment for ovarian cancer remains as full completion staging surgery, a multidisciplinary tumor board discussion for fertility-sparing surgery in women of child-bearing age with early-stage disease may be considered in suitable women and definitive treatment should be pursued without delay.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Cancer cells likely have characteristics that enable them to deposit within microvasculature systems because neoplastic spread is thought to most frequently occur via the hematogenous route and the lung is the most common site for metastases .\n\n【2】Initial symptoms of TE to the lungs are often similar to those of non-malignant pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE) including shortness of breath, varying degrees of hypoxemia, and normal or minimally abnormal chest radiography . Involvement of a significant portion of the pulmonary microvasculature can result in progressive pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, although the classic signs of right heart failure may be seen in only a minority of patients . Most reported cases of TE are associated with breast, lung, or gastric adenocarcinomas, the same tumor types that put individuals at increased risk for VTE . Discerning TE from non-malignant VTE is further complicated because VTE is approximately twice as common in patients with malignancy as in those without .\n\n【3】The utility of advanced imaging for revealing TE is largely unknown. Most cases of documented TE to the lungs have not shown any significant parenchymal abnormalities on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest although “dilated and beaded” subsegmental pulmonary arteries have been described . Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy can reveal multiple peripheral and subsegmental mismatched defects . Short of a lung biopsy, cytologic analysis of a blood sample obtained from the distal port of a wedged pulmonary artery catheter is a definitive way of making the diagnosis although the sensitivity of this maneuver is not known . Cavitary lung lesions are most often associated with infectious processes, but rapidly-developing cavitations can occur in the setting of infarction due to VTE or necrosis secondary to a malignancy .\n\n【4】We present the case of rapidly-forming cavitary lung lesions due to pulmonary infarction from diffuse TE and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such case reported.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】History of present illness\n\n【7】A 64-year-old man who was diagnosed two years ago with Stage 2a (T1N1) adenocarcinoma of the lung presented with acute onset of shortness of breath. Treatment for his cancer included a right upper lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol. Surgical margins of the resected lobe were clear of malignancy and follow-up surveillance imaging had not revealed any clear evidence of recurrence. A persistent non-productive cough began six weeks prior to admission (PTA). Chest radiograph obtained one week PTA revealed vague patchy infiltrate in the right superior lung field and right perihilar areas . Non-contrasted chest CT obtained at the same time demonstrated only ground glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes . Bronchoscopy at that time revealed scant hemorrhage from the right lower lobe. All cultures and cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative.\n\n【8】Physical exam and data\n\n【9】On presentation, temperature was 99.2 °F, heart rate 120 beats per minute, blood pressure 114/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 84% on room air. Notable findings included diminished breath sounds in both lung bases, and crackles over the right superior lung field.\n\n【10】White blood cell count was 21 500 /mL with 88.5% neutrophils. Hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dL. Serum lactate concentration was 4 mmol/L. Troponin level was 0.07 ng/mL and reached a peak of 0.53 ng/mL. Arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.49, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> of 22.9 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> of 67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 L/minute of supplemental oxygen. Liver tests were notable for an aspartate aminotransferase of 96 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 101 IU/L, and an alkaline phosphatase of 414 IU/L. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) tests were negative.\n\n【11】CT angiogram on admission revealed a pulmonary embolus to the left upper lobe . Two large, thick-walled cavities in the right middle and lower lobes, bilateral ground glass opacities, and a small right pleural effusion were also seen . The locations of the cavities corresponded to the ground glass opacities seen on the CT obtained only one week prior .\n\n【12】Hospital Course\n\n【13】The patient was begun on intravenous heparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible necrotizing bacterial pneumonia. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular function but right ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal flattening consistent with elevated right ventricular pressure. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was estimated to be 37 mmHg but may have been under-estimated due to poor tricuspid articulation.\n\n【14】On the second hospital day, increasing oxygen requirement and markedly-increased labor of breathing necessitated endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. All sputum and blood cultures were negative for bacterial pathogens. On the seventh hospital day, he became obtunded despite adequate oxygenation and blood pressure. Noncontrast CT of the brain revealed multiple hypodense areas with lesions in the right frontal lobe and right cerebellar lobe . Given the grave prognosis, comfort care was instituted after family members conveyed his wishes to the medical team. The patient died shortly thereafter.\n\n【15】Post-mortem Analysis\n\n【16】Post-mortem examination was restricted to the lungs and liver. Sectioning of the lungs did not demonstrate any gross VTE in the main pulmonary arterial branches. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissues demonstrated innumerable TE throughout both lungs including prominent TE in vessels leading to the cavitary lesions . Cell morphology and focally-positive staining for mucin and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) was consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Acid-fast and Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS) stains of the lung tissues around the cavities were negative for acid-fast organisms or fungi. There were two foci of intrapulmonary metastases, one in the left lower lobe and one in the right lower lobe. Neither of these metastatic foci showed significant tumor necrosis and the right lower lobe focus was separate from the cavitary lesions of the right lung. TE also invaded the splanchnic circulation with widespread hepatic involvement, causing portal vein thrombosis and parenchymal metastasis causing centrilobular necrosis. Although post-mortem examination was not performed on the brain, cerebral TE with brain infarctions were likely responsible for the obtundation and the abnormal brain imaging.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This case describes a patient with rapidly developing cavitary lung lesions associated with respiratory failure. It illustrates that in someone with a history of a malignancy, this unusual complication of cancer (i.e. TE), which can mimic other disorders and is difficult to diagnose pre-mortem, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Since our patient did not have evidence of VTE to the right lung on CT angiogram or at autopsy, and there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for his rapid deterioration, we posit that embolic infarction from widespread TE caused the rapidly developing cavities; this complication of TE, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported.\n\n【19】The overall prognosis of critically ill patients with TE is grave, despite treatment with chemotherapy . Because the diagnosis of TE is frequently not considered and is difficult to confirm pre-mortem, the diagnosis is often revealed at autopsy . Both TE and VTE may simultaneously occur in the pulmonary capillary beds ; we believe that in our patient, however, TE was the cause of the lung cavities and respiratory failure. Additionally, the presence of TE in the lung likely indicates diffuse involvement elsewhere in the body . Because microthrombi may simultaneously occur with TE, optimal treatment may require therapy for both types of clot burden with anticoagulation as well as chemotherapy . Treating both processes early and aggressively may prolong survival .\n\n【20】In summary, we propose that extensive TE can rarely cause cavitary infarction of the lungs and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly-developing cavities, particularly in patients with a known history of malignancy. Early recognition of atypical manifestations of TE may allow more effective therapies and ultimately improve outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It can involve the lung in various forms. Nodular involvement is a rare form of pulmonary sarcoidosis which can be mistaken for malignancy. Diagnosis requires compatible clinical picture along with imaging findings suggestive of the disease and non-caseating granulomas on histopathology.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 38-year-old woman presented to the hospital with 1-month history of cough and shortness of breath, and the cough is productive of thick yellow sputum, associated with subjective fever and dyspnea on exertion. She also reports fatigue. She denies chest pain, hemoptysis, joint pain, eye pain, abdominal pain or leg swelling. She is a smoker and works as a housekeeper in a hotel. She emigrated from West Africa 15 years ago but denies recent travel or tuberculosis exposure. She keeps no pets at home.\n\n【4】Physical examination showed normal vital signs, and chest and cardiovascular exams were unremarkable. Lab investigations including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed diffuse airspace opacities with peripheral distribution . The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of presumable community-acquired pneumonia. Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient’s condition did not improve significantly. Pro-calcitonin was measured and levels were normal, and workup for fungal infection was negative. She underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast that revealed extensive multifocal bilateral airspace opacities with significant hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . Given the lack of improvement in clinical picture, the decision was made to obtain a lung biopsy. Cultures of the biopsy were negative. Histopathology of the lung biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were elevated. The patient was started on steroids and her condition improved clinically and on radiological imaging.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that affects multiple organ systems, and the lung is the most commonly affected organ. Ungprasert et al showed equal involvement for men and women with a median age at diagnosis of 42 and 48 years, respectively. Intrathoracic involvement was demonstrated in 97% of patients affected with sarcoidosis . Pulmonary involvement can be in forms of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, ground glass opacities, bronchial wall thickening, lung fibrosis, or nodular masses. In our report we present a case of nodular sarcoidosis which is a rare form comprising 2.4-4% of sarcoid lung involvement .\n\n【7】Nodular sarcoidosis was described mainly in African American patients, with more women being affected than men, and the mean age is 35 as described by Malaisamy et al . These nodules form as a result of coalescence of multiple granulomas to form masses up to 5 cm in size . In our case report, the chest CT scan revealed multiple nodules measuring up to 7.5 cm. Patients with nodular sarcoidosis can present with fever, fatigue, weight loss and chronic cough. A study by Abehsera et al to correlate CT scan patterns of sarcoidosis with pulmonary function found that nodular sarcoidosis results in minimal functional impairment .\n\n【8】CT of the chest can demonstrate multiple lung nodules or solitary nodules. These lesions tend to be peripheral, predominantly involving the upper lobes and associated with lymphadenopathy . Histopathology is crucial for the diagnosis, and it demonstrates non-caseating granulomas.\n\n【9】Nodular sarcoidosis has favorable prognosis with resolution of radiographic lesions and improvement of clinical picture either with systemic steroids or spontaneously .

{"seq_id": "79dad764-7b1b-4c0a-afdb-6f7fbedec2bd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Diffuse coronary aneurysm or ectasia is a relatively uncommon finding on angiography. The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with coronary ectasia and large intracoronary thrombi has been culled from case reports. Due to the large coronary segments and heavy thrombus burden, standard treatment may fail. Distal microembolization and improper stent sizing among these patients also raised concern during early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ACS . We present a case of a patient with diffuse coronary ectasia and a large intracoronary thrombus presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was managed successfully with triple antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel, and intracoronary and intravenous GIIb/IIIa inhibitors), anticoagulation, and adjunctive PCI (thrombectomy, angioplasty, and stenting).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A.P. a 55-year-old male, non-diabetic, non-hypertensive, sought consult for severe chest pain. He had no prior complaints, until 2 - 3 h prior to admission; he experienced sudden onset chest pain at rest, VAS 10/10, retrosternal and heavy in character, and associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. He sought consult at the UP-PGH emergency room. He is a 30-pack-year smoker, but denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He had a history of dengue fever during childhood. He has no history of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or renal disease. His father was hypertensive and his older brother died of “heart disease”. He had no other complaints in other systems.\n\n【4】At the emergency room, he was received with on-going chest pain. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 per minute. He had no neck vein engorgement, bibasal rales, and no wheezing. His apex beat was not displaced. S1 was soft. He had a normal rate and regular rhythm and no murmurs. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, normal axis, complete right bundle branch block, and ST-elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL (with reciprocal changes in II, III, aVF), consistent with a massive ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Troponin-I was significantly elevated. Other blood workups were non-contributory. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was offered, however, the patient opted medical management. He was successfully thrombolysed immediately with streptokinase 1.5 million units intravenously. Post-thrombolysis, ST-segment elevations decreased in amplitude, chest pain resolved, and vital signs remained stable. He was then transferred to the medical ICU on oral medications. We planned to do coronary angiography with intent to revascularize should the patient consent during the admission.\n\n【5】On the third hospital day, he had recurrence of angina, mild (VAS 2/10) in severity and heavy in character. We emphasized the importance of rescue PCI, for which he then consented. He was immediately brought up to the cath lab. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant circulation with a dilated (ectatic) right coronary artery, left anterior descending (LAD), and left circumflex artery. Vessel diameters ranged from 5.2 - 5.9 mm. The LMCA, RCA, and LCX were free of significant disease. In the proximal LAD, there was note of a round, lucent structure measuring 5.3 × 5.8 mm and almost totally obstructing flow to the distal segments. This was consistent with a large burden intracoronary thrombus. The figures  demonstrate the angiographic images.\n\n【6】He was managed with intravenous heparin, oral and intravenous antiplatelets, and various percutaneous techniques. A PTCA balloon was inserted and inflated at the area of the thrombus. Placement of a drug eluting stent was planned, but a large-sized stent was not available. Manual thrombectomy was also done with multiple passes, but resolution of the thrombus was not achieved. Final angiogram showed reduced obstruction in the proximal LAD, but still with TIMI flow 2 with the large thrombus still present. Intracoronary and intravenous tirofiban was then given, with intent to repeat the coronary angiogram between 1 - 2 weeks. The procedure was uneventful. Repeat angiogram 2 weeks after revealed dissolution of the thrombus with triple antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel, tirofiban, and heparin). Figure 3 shows the final angiographic shots.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Detection of intracoronary thrombi heralds a poor prognosis in STEMI . Effects of intracoronary thrombus impair epicardial flow by occlusion of major coronary vessels and impair perfusion of the myocardium by distal embolization. Intracoronary thrombus is angiographically defined as the presence of a filling defect with either: 1) Total occlusion with convex, irregular, or hazy distal margins and post-injection contrast retention of staining; and 2) Partial occlusion circumferentially outlined by contrast medium . Thrombus may be graded (TG) by the TIMI thrombus grading. TIMI TG 0 - 3 suggests small thrombus burden; while TIMI TG 4 suggests a large thrombus burden .\n\n【9】Management of STEMI is straightforward, and immediate reperfusion is necessary. Subgroups may benefit more from adjunctive pharmacological and interventional strategies, such as large thrombus burden. In our case, aside from PCI with stenting of the involved segment, thrombectomy may be of benefit for angiographic success , which was done. The combination of STEMI with ectatic (aneurysmal) coronaries and a large intracoronary thrombus burden is uncommon and its management varies from a few published case reports. The common denominator in the management of the few similar cases documented is adjunctive therapeutic decisions, including thrombectomy and GIIb-IIIa-inhibitors. Table 1  summarized published case reports with similar presentation and management.\n\n【10】Conclusions\n\n【11】We have demonstrated that thrombectomy, angioplasty, chronic anticoagulation, and aggressive antiplatelet therapy (given orally, intracoronary, and intravenously) may be effective in these cases. Management of such atypical and rare cases should be individualized.

{"seq_id": "747cc56b-0c7d-4c28-b96e-294a8ad89e12", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The triad of hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice in the setting of chronic alcohol abuse and liver damage compose Zieve syndrome . This constellation of clinical findings was first described by Leslie Zieve in 1957 . It is estimated that this syndrome is seen in approximately 1 in 1,600 hospital admissions . The exact pathogenesis remains elusive, and our current knowledge remains confined to multiple hypotheses. Identification of Zieve syndrome is essential to provide timely treatment and high-value care without subjecting the patient to unnecessary testing in the search for a diagnosis.\n\n【2】The syndrome is slowly gaining recognition in the literature, and as a result, the clinical significance is not well understood. We present a rare case of Zieve syndrome with the unusual finding of a normal reticulocyte count to bring further awareness of this diagnosis, with an emphasis on the pathogenesis, presenting symptoms and labs, prognosis, and clinical management. We explain why an unconventional treatment strategy might prove beneficial in this unique variant. Additionally, we reviewed the literature for cases of Zieve syndrome dating back to 1958 to better characterize the clinical presentation and overall survival rates of this condition.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypothyroidism and alcohol use disorder, presented with a complaint of jaundice for the last 10 days. She also reported a 2-month history of weakness and lethargy. A targeted review of the systems was found to be negative. She reported a history of drinking three to four glasses of hard liquor every night for many years. Her only medication was 50 µg of levothyroxine. In the emergency department, the patient had tachycardia of 103 beats per minute with all other vitals within normal limits. Physical exam was significant for mild tachycardia, scleral icterus, jaundice, and mild abdominal distension with no fluid shift noted. She reported no family history of autoimmune disorders or liver disease, no recent blood transfusions, and no other over the counter medications or herbal supplements.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Initial laboratory values on admission are shown in Table 1 .\n\n【8】Other workup included a blood alcohol level of 0.306% (reference range < 0.005%), negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, normal ceruloplasmin levels and normal hepatitis panel. Peripheral blood smear showed mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, along with slight anisocytosis, slight macrocytes, moderate target cells. Direct Coomb’s showed a negative elution test and hence it was not considered significant by the lab. The anemia was hemolytic and non-immune in origin. Thus, laboratory findings were consistent with Zieve syndrome. Hemoglobin continued to downtrend during the patient’s hospital stay .\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】Due to downtrending hemoglobin, gastroenterology was consulted. Additionally, a psychiatry consult was placed for assistance with alcohol cessation. The patient was started on appropriate therapy with furosemide and spironolactone, along with lactulose. She was monitored for alcohol withdrawal and counseled extensively on alcohol cessation. She was also recommended for an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for varices. Discriminant function  was noted to be elevated at 47 so she was started on a 1-month course of prednisolone daily. Her condition improved and she was discharged with advice to follow-up with both gastroenterology and psychiatry as an outpatient.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】At a follow-up visit 1 month later, the patient abstained from alcohol and completed the prescribed steroid course. Repeat labs  at this time showed improvement in all three cell lines and a decrease in the total bilirubin suggesting resolution of hemolysis.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Chronic alcohol use predisposes individuals to a wide range of adverse medical conditions such as macrocytic anemia, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis . The goal of our case is to bring awareness to a rarely documented and an underrecognized complication of alcohol abuse known as Zieve syndrome. This disease process was first described by Dr. Leslie Zieve in 1958 and is composed of a specific constellation of clinical and laboratory findings which includes hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice . The pathophysiology of Zieve syndrome remains poorly defined, but multiple theories have been proposed. It is suspected that the hemolysis seen in these patients results primarily from a profound elevation in triglycerides. The altered synthesis of lipoproteins, cholesterol, and fatty acids may induce hemolysis via instability of the erythrocyte membrane . Recent studies now suggest that both toxic metabolites from ethanol and alcohol-induced vitamin E deficiency may also compound the red blood cell destruction through impaired functioning of crucial metabolic enzymes . The multifactorial mechanism for red blood cell destruction directly results in hemolytic anemia, contributing also to an elevation in unconjugated bilirubin levels. Often the hyperbilirubinemia that is seen is substantial as concurrent alcohol-mediated hepatocellular toxicity induces chronic cholestatic injury .\n\n【15】Clinicians should have a high degree of clinical suspicion for Zieve syndrome in individuals with a known history of excessive alcohol use who present with hemolytic normocytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, especially when subsequent workup is negative for gastrointestinal bleeding. The hemolytic nature of anemia can aid as a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate Zieve syndrome from isolated cases of alcohol dependence which often involves macrocytic anemia . While Zieve syndrome typically can be identified by the classic triad, additional clinical findings may aid in the diagnosis. For example, abdominal pain was a universal finding seen in all 20 patients that Leslie Zieve studied . Additional nonspecific symptoms that have been reported in the literature include fatigue, fever, nausea, and vomiting . Given the hemolytic nature of anemia, labs generally reveal elevated reticulocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased haptoglobin, with elevations in direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Coomb’s test is also negative . The clinical importance of recognizing this syndrome comes from the fact that most patients rapidly recover within weeks of alcohol cessation . Following alcohol abstinence, there is an intracellular shift of lipids from the plasma to adipose tissue in hepatocytes, thus eliminating the hypertriglyceridemia which is a suspected inciting trigger for the development and propagation of this unique syndrome .\n\n【16】The excessive alcohol consumption that is seen in this specific patient demographic can have toxic effects on the bone marrow as well. Suppression of hematopoietic stem cells results in impaired production of all three major cell lines, leading to decreased production of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets . It is possible that the bone marrow suppression induced by chronic alcohol use in our patient was insufficient to mount a proper response to the hemolytic environment in our patient. The most effective treatment for Zieve syndrome continues to be complete abstinence from alcohol . Unconventional therapies such as plasmapheresis in a patient with massive elevations in triglyceride have also been reported . It is believed that the commonly used scoring system of Maddrey discriminant function, which screens alcoholic patients who benefit from steroids, is ineffective in Zieve syndrome due to the temporary elevations in bilirubin levels that normalize after alcohol cessation . In fact, the recommendation is to avoid corticosteroids entirely due to a lack of any proven efficacy . While this may be true for patients with Zieve syndrome that have functional marrow, our patient was seen to benefit from both alcohol cessation in addition to steroids. We believe this to be due to the effect of steroids to stimulate the release of cells from the bone marrow, which has been proven in prior studies . Our success mirrors that of other conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, where corticosteroids can result in appropriate elevation in reticulocyte count with subsequent improvement in hemoglobin .\n\n【17】To date, there is a substantial gap in knowledge regarding the clinical presentation and overall prognosis of patients affected by Zieve syndrome. Following the initial pronouncement of this syndrome by Leslie Zieve in 1958, there have been over 100 documented cases in the literature. The only aggregate analysis of these case reports that we identified was by Liu et al in 2017, with a brief review focusing on the time period, country of origin, and subtype of each publication . As a result, we aimed to conduct a more thorough review of documented case reports of Zieve syndrome with an emphasis on clinical presentation, lab values, and treatment outcomes while also including any additional cases that were published after 2017. After an extensive PubMed literature review of all case reports dating back to 1958 using the search term “Zieve syndrome”, we identified 31 documented cases . Inclusion criteria included: publications dated after Leslie Zieve’s original manuscript and cases that met all three components of the clinical triad including hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice. Exclusion criteria included: articles that were not open access or written in English text.\n\n【18】We document and summarize our findings below . Overall, patients that met the triad for Zieve syndrome were on average 42.2 years of age with 54.8% being male. While abdominal pain was reported in nearly all of Zieve’s original 20 patients and has historically been considered a classic associated feature of this syndrome, our analysis demonstrates that this complaint is seen in just slightly over half of patients. Over the 31 patients we collected data on, the average initial triglyceride level was significantly elevated at 822.5 mg/dL. A majority of patients were anemic with an average hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL and all patients reported so far had an elevated reticulocyte count. Overall, we demonstrate that Zieve syndrome carries a favorable prognosis, with 93.5%  of individuals being successfully discharged and only two patients experiencing inpatient mortality.\n\n【19】It is important to recognize the typical findings that characterize Zieve syndrome since this diagnosis is relatively unknown. A high index of clinical suspicion is warranted in patients with alcohol use disorder who present with hemolytic anemia and jaundice. Additionally, a special emphasis should be placed on studying rare variants, such as our patient with a normal reticulocyte count, as they might help uncover undiscovered mechanisms at play. Ultimately, while our data suggest that this condition carries a favorable prognosis with timely identification and treatment interventions, further research regarding the pathophysiology of this syndrome is needed to better target future treatment strategies.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】Our case aims to bring further awareness to the rare combination of clinical features, along with the complex pathophysiology, which underlies Zieve syndrome. Additionally, we present a unique subtype of Zieve syndrome with bone marrow suppression as demonstrated by a paradoxically low reticulocyte count which benefited from the use of corticosteroids. Following an extensive review of the literature, it is evident that Zieve syndrome can be promptly identified by the classical triad of clinical features on presentation including hyperlipidemia, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice. Additionally, abdominal pain may not be as reliable of a clinical finding as once previously thought. We demonstrate that appropriate intervention, primarily alcohol cessation, can result in promising recovery for these patients. Ultimately, we hope that our contribution to the knowledge of Zieve syndrome may lead to improved patient outcomes and a more robust treatment protocol in the future. We also hope to increase recognition of this rare variant of Zieve syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a24d9fc9-36fd-4298-b7f6-3183ac9552af", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disease of a neuromuscular junction disorder with typical clinical manifestations of proximal muscle weakness, decreased tendon reflexes and autonomic dysfunction . More than half of the LEMS cases occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS), most commonly with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) . The anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody is detected in almost all cancer patients with LEMS, and in 91% of non-malignant patients with LEMS . Thus, this antibody is a diagnostic biomarker for LEMS. When PNS of LEMS is found together with malignancy, cancer-directed treatment should be taken on the highest priority. Symptomatic treatments for LEMS include 3,4-diaminopyridine, which acts directly on the neuromuscular junction and is globally the leading treatment option. However, this drug remains not to be approved by Japanese medical insurance. Instead, pyridostigmine, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, is actually used for LEMS in Japan.\n\n【2】Durvalumab and atezolizumab are both immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1) antibody. For untreated extensive stage (ES) of SCLC, these ICIs presented a revolutionary strategy of cancer immunotherapy by CASPIAN and IMpower133 phase 3 trials. The addition and maintenance of durvalumab and atezolizumab on and after platinum plus etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC . We should be careful of various immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), including rare but severe neurological disorders. We previously reported the first case of imAE of LEMS caused by nivolumab, anti-PD-1 antibody, in a 73-year-old and heavily pretreated Japanese woman with c-stage IV of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma . Our previous case suggested LEMS as a result of imAE due to ICI. On the other hand, it remains unknown whether ICI may deteriorate underlying and preexisting PNS of LEMS.\n\n【3】We report a patient with ES-SCLC and pre-existing LEMS, who was treated with durvalumab-combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 62-year-old Chinese woman living in Japan suffered from weakness of lower extremities after accidental employment injury of comminuted fracture of the right ankle in September 2020, which lead to edema and pain of her lower extremities, gait disturbance and repeated falls. She also developed ptosis, diplopia, and tinnitus in February 2021. She was hospitalized in the Department of Neurology of another hospital in April 2021 because of sudden onset of dizziness, tinnitus, abdominal pain and cold sweat at home. In the admission, her serum anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-muscle-specific kinase antibodies were both negative. She was referred to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of our hospital in June 2021 because of mediastinal tumors and left hilar lymphadenopathy on chest computed tomography (CT) . She was a current smoker with a 24 pack-year smoking history. She had a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis in 30s with unknown details and had no other significant medical history but hypertension at that time.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】She underwent endobronchial ultrasound-guided trans-bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) from the right hilar lymph node and was pathologically diagnosed as SCLC . Her serum pro-gastrin releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) value showed elevated up to 496 pg/mL. Contrast-enhanced CT detected a pancreatic metastasis. Thus, her clinical stage was determined as c-stage IVA (cTxN <sub>3 </sub> M <sub>1b </sub> ).\n\n【9】On her neurologic examination, she presented bilateral proximal limb weakness (manual muscle test (MMT) 3 - 4), decreased deep tendon reflexes, disability in the daily activities with modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 4, and a positive edrophonium responsiveness with disappearance of her ptosis. Nerve conduction studies of the left median, ulnar and tibial nerves detected reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude at rest, and then showed five-fold (from 0.7 mV at resting to 3.5 mV after exercise), 2.4 (1.2 to 2.9 mV) and 7.1 (0.7 to 5.0 mV) increases after 20 s exercise, respectively . Repetitive nerve stimulation of the left ulnar nerve showed a waning phenomenon with 3 Hz repetitive stimulation  and waxing phenomenon with 30 Hz repetitive stimulations . Electroencephalogram did not find epileptiform discharges. Based on these neurological findings, she was diagnosed as PNS of LEMS. Thereafter, the titer of anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies was found to be elevated up to 1,419.2 pmol/L in her serum.\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】We administered pyridostigmine for the purpose of improving the symptoms of LEMS. On the other hand, we proposed two regimen options for ES-SCLC; conventional platinum-based chemotherapy alone or anti-PD-L1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy. We obtained her informed consent after thorough explanation of the possible risk of exacerbating her LEMS and the survival benefits of immunotherapy. She started triweekly combination immunotherapy of carboplatin (area under the curve 5 mg/mL/min, day 1) and etoposide (80 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , day 1 - 3) with durvalumab (1,500 mg/body, day 1). Four courses of this regimen achieved nearly complete response . Pro-GRP decreased from 496 pg/mL before the treatment down to 49.8 pg/mL after four courses of the induction immunotherapy.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】After two courses of durvalumab maintenance, we found multiple brain metastases, despite of normal range of Pro-GRP (56.2 pg/mL). She received whole brain irradiation and then amrubicin as the second-line regimen. She was still alive and continuing chemotherapy 1.5 years after the diagnosis without exacerbation of LEMS.\n\n【14】Six months after the initiation of the first-line combined immunochemotherapy, when we confirmed disease progression, her CMAP amplitudes did not change significantly in the nerve conduction study. Nerve conduction studies of the left median, ulnar and tibial nerves showed 4.1- (from 1.5 mV at resting to 6.1 mV after exercise), 3.5- (0.85 to 3.0 mV) and 1.6-fold (2.6 to 4.2 mV) increases after exercise, respectively. However, her decreased deep tendon reflexes recovered. Her proximal limb weakness and disability in the daily activities also improved to MMT 5 or 5-, and mRS of 1, respectively. The titer of anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies decreased to 263.5 pmol/L.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】This is the first case of durvalumab for ES-SCLC with PNS of LEMS. In our case, combined immunochemotherapy did not exacerbate the preexisting LEMS. To our knowledge, there were only four malignant cases who had preexisting LEMS but had been treated by ICIs . These rare cases suggest that ICI is a possible treatment option for cancer patients with LEMS.\n\n【17】The most important finding of our case was that four induction courses of durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy and two additional courses of durvalumab maintenance did not exacerbate the preexisting LEMS. Reviewing the previous four cases, ICIs remain controversial for preexisting PNS of LEMS . LEMS improved in two cases but deteriorated in the other two cases. Among five cases, one Swedish and one Japanese case presented different clinical courses of LEMS. In the Swedish case, LEMS was already improved at the introduction of avelumab for Merkel cell carcinoma by the previous treatment of local irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. These treatments reduced the titer of anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies from 65.2 pmol/L at the diagnosis to undetectable level at the initiation of ICI. In this case, LEMS did not deteriorate by 1.5-year administration of avelumab, which was discontinued because of imAEs of hypothyroidism and drug-induced pneumonitis . The Japanese case by Takigawa et al  presented a 73-year-old woman who maintained complete remission from localized stage of SCLC associated with LEMS 22 years earlier. Her LEMS recurred by only four courses of pembrolizumab with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel for c-stage IIIB of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. However, her neurological symptoms were improved by discontinuation of pembrolizumab and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Then, she could continue chemotherapy without pembrolizumab. On the other hand, ours and the other two cases introduced ICIs soon after the confirmed diagnosis of malignancy and worsening LEMS . Among these three cases, LEMS improved by combination immunotherapy in two Japanese cases, but deteriorated by ICI monotherapy in the other German case. Our case was very similar in clinical course, treatment regimen and outcomes to the other Japanese case by Sakaguchi et al . The difference between these two Japanese cases was ICI drug, i.e. durvalumab vs. atezolizumab. In contrast, LEMS exacerbated in the German case, which dared to continue avelumab concurrently with intravenous immunoglobulins and kept complete remission of Merkel cell carcinoma . In our opinion, ICI is not absolute contraindication, but a possible treatment option for cancer patients with preexisting stable LEMS, because flare-up of LEMS was manageable in the previous cases.\n\n【18】The second important finding was that only our case followed the titer of anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody and confirmed the remarkable decrease of this serum biomarker before and after the immunotherapy. As a result, we observed significant improvement of symptoms and physical examinations, despite of no remarkable change of CMAP amplitudes and detectable level of the remaining anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody. We should be still careful of flare-up of LEMS, because we did not confirm complete disappearance of antibody biomarker. However, our monitoring results may encourage oncologists to dare to use ICI for PNS of LEMS. Thus, ICI is not strongly recommended and remains challenging for malignancy with PNS of LEMS, but can be considered as a treatment option.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we successfully treated an ES-SCLC patient complicated with preexisting PNS of LEMS by durvalumab plus chemotherapy without a flare-up of LEMS. We also confirmed the remarkable decrease of the serum titer of anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody. ICI in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy is still challenging but may be a treatment option for ES-SCLC patients complicated with PNS of LEMS.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】This case highlights no harmful influence of durvalumab on the preexisting stable PNS of LEMS. The main take-away points from this case report is that ICI is a possible treatment option for cancer patients with preexisting LEMS. According to the previous cases, flare-up of LEMS can be managed by immunoglobulin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In rare clinical scenarios, alterations in glucose regulation and hyperglycemia may result from pharmacologic interventions and the introduction of new medications . Although used most commonly to control fluid balance, an uncommon adverse effect of the thiazide diuretics is hyperglycemia. We present a 6-year-old girl with congenital heart disease (CHD) who developed profound hyperglycemia when a thiazide diuretic was added to her medication regimen. Previous reports of similar responses are reviewed, physiologic mechanisms are postulated, and treatment strategies are proposed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 6.5-year-old, 17.75 kg girl who was sent to the emergency department after clinical blood work revealed an elevated blood glucose level. She had originally been brought in for outpatient blood work 1 week after the addition of an additional diuretic, chlorothiazide, to her medication regimen. The laboratory analysis at the outpatient clinic revealed a blood glucose level greater than 700 mg/dL. Additional complaints included that she seemed more tired than usual and there had been a 2.1 kg weight loss from the prior week’s appointment. There was no history of other constitutional symptoms such as fever, cough or diarrhea. Her past medical history was significant for a congenital hyperinsulin state controlled with oral diazoxide, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), and coarctation of the aorta. Her past surgical history included multiple cardiac procedures for surgical palliation of HLHS including: a stage 1 hybrid procedure in 2009 which was followed by balloon atrial septostomy 6 - 8 weeks later, surgical atrial septectomy later that year, and a modified comprehensive stage II procedure with a Glenn shunt, followed most recently by a Fontan procedure in 2015 . The Fontan procedure was complicated by a chronic pleural effusion requiring an implanted pleural catheter. Other associated co-morbid conditions included gastroesophageal reflux, a seizure disorder, previous hypoxic-ischemic insults, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Her home medications included spironolactone 20 mg twice a day, aspirin 81 mg once a day, diazoxide 50 mg three times a day as well as the recently added chlorothiazide 250 mg once a day. There were no known drug allergies. Following admission to the Cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU), the blood glucose values remained elevated ranging from 569 to 702 mg/dL along with low sodium and chloride values. The venous blood gas at the time of admission to the CTICU showed a normal pH and normal lactate levels (pH 7.36, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 52 mm Hg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 47 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> 22 mmol/L, base excess +3.3 mmol/L, and lactate 1.3 mmol/L). The chlorothiazide and diazoxide were stopped; however, the blood glucose values did not return to normal so an intravenous insulin infusion was started at 0.02 units/kg/h. This was continued for 3 days which resulted in control of her blood glucose values. Her insulin regimen was then transitioned to intermittent subcutaneous insulin for 1 week at which time chlorothiazide was restarted. Following the restarting of chlorothiazide, the insulin therapy was slowly withdrawn without any clinically significant change in her blood glucose values. The remainder of the hospital stay was uneventful with close monitoring of blood glucose values which remained within normal limits. The patient was discharged home 18 days after the initial admission date.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Hyperglycemia in children may present simply as increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue or in the later stages as severe as nausea, vomiting, alterations in the pattern of respiration (Kussmaul breathing), abdominal pain, and even coma. While there are several potential causes of hyperglycemia, the most common in children is a decrease in the production of insulin by the pancreas which results in diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is generally classified as type 1 or type 2. Type 1 DM is the result of an autoimmune process with destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. In contrast, various pathophysiologic processes contribute to type 2 DM including varying degrees of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency . The clinical features of DM may be modified by genetic or environmental influences.\n\n【6】There are major metabolic derangements that may occur in patients with either DM type 1 or type 2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) generally occurs as a complication of DM type 1 and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia (HHS) as a complication of DM type 2 . Both of these are life-threatening emergencies requiring hospitalization and aggressive therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality. A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as was noted in our patient, was previously known as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic coma (HHNC). It is a less common consequence of profound hyperglycemia, seen most commonly in the adult patient with DM type 2. The terminology was changed because coma occurred in less than 20% of patients. HHS most commonly occurs in patients with type 2 DM who have a concomitant illness that leads to reduced fluid intake. HHS is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity and dehydration without ketoacidosis; however, it carries a higher mortality rate than DKA estimated at approximately 10-20%. Most patients present with severe dehydration and focal or global neurological deficits. In as many as one-third of patients, the clinical features of HHS and DKA overlap. In our patient, hyperglycemia and subsequently HHS coincided with initiation of therapy with the diuretic, chlorothiazide. This interaction has been documented by other reports . Treatment with thiazide diuretics has been shown to be an independent predictor of the onset of new diabetes among patients with hypertension . While the exact process responsible for the hyperglycemia associated with the thiazides diuretics remains speculative, it has been postulated that they may increase serum glucose values by activating the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems . These mechanisms are supported by the fact that the effects of thiazides on serum glucose can be mitigated by inhibiting the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone axis. Alternatively, it has been suggested that hypokalemia causes an indirect reduction in insulin secretion, thereby leading others to suggest strategies that maintaining normal potassium concentrations may prevent glucose intolerance .\n\n【7】In summary, we present the development of clinically significant hyperglycemia following the addition of a thiazide diuretic to the medication regimen of a 6-year-old girl with associated CHD. The clinical consequences were likely magnified by the accompanying administration of diazoxide to treat a previously diagnosed hyperinsulin state. Once the diazoxide was discontinued, it was then feasible to reinstitute chlorothiazide therapy without alterations in serum glucose levels. Given this and additional adverse effects of the thiazide class of medications, other agents are generally used as first-line treatment of hypertension in adults. Although uncommon, when such effects are seen in the pediatric population, alternative diuretics should be used. Alternatively, it appears that the response may be mitigated by maintaining the serum potassium value within the normal range through the use of potassium-sparing diuretics and/or oral potassium supplementation. In specific patient populations, close monitoring of blood glucose values may be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "cab9acf4-5340-47e5-a99c-8c651b7a8876", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Lymphoepithelioma was first described arising in the nasopharyngeal mucosa of a population of patients with a distinct geographic distribution, most prominently in patients from China and Southeast Asian nations . The malignancy features a distinctive histologic pattern which includes a malignant component with squamous differentiation, as well as a characteristic lymphoid-rich stroma from which the malignancy takes its name . Since its original description from the nasopharyngeal region, a series of cancers with similar histologic features and a lymphoid-rich stroma have been described in a multitude of other organs, including lung , bladder , uterine cervix , esophagus , stomach , and colon . These carcinomas have been included under the broad umbrella of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELCs). In addition to sharing many similar histologic features with lymphoepithelioma, many of the LELCs also share an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection . Case reports and series examining the LELCs have suggested the malignancies have a better prognosis than non-LELC malignancies in the same organs .\n\n【2】Primary LELC of the liver is an exceedingly rare entity, and to this point very few cases have been described in the literature. In the cases that have been reported, histologic features resembling both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma have been described . Here, we report three cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC.\n\n【3】Case Reports\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】An 89-year-old previously asymptomatic female presented to her primary care physician with right upper quadrant pain in July 2011. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.6 cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver. The patient has a past medical history of hepatitis C viral infection diagnosed 16 years prior to presentation, breast cancer diagnosed 20 years prior to presentation, and a history of “colon polyps” 9 years prior to presentation. An abdominal MRI confirmed the presence of a heterogeneous enhancing mass in segment VIII of the liver, measuring 5.2 cm in greatest dimension and showing regions of central necrosis. The background liver showed features suggestive of early cirrhosis, with atrophy of the right, left and caudate lobes. The hepatic vasculature was patent, and no additional abnormalities were seen. Liver enzymes performed at the time of presentation to our institution revealed normal values for ALT (19 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), AST (36 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (84 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), and total bilirubin (0.5 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL). Hepatitis C viral RNA quantification by PCR was positive at 297,000 IU/mL. The patient’s serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was markedly elevated at 1,054.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 11 ng/mL). Based on the findings, the decision was made to proceed with surgical resection. Prior to the procedure, the patient underwent embolization of the right portal vein, which was followed by a right hepatectomy during which a 410 g segment of the patient’s right liver lobe was excised.\n\n【6】Upon gross examination of the resection specimen, a single mass was identified, measuring 5.1 cm in greatest dimension . The mass was well-circumscribed, soft, and white, with a bulging cut surface. Necrosis comprised approximately 20% of the mass (not photographed). Wire coils and rubbery beads, relics of the preoperative embolization, were identified in the vasculature (not photographed). A hemorrhagic area was noted near the tumor, likely secondary to embolization of the right portal vein. No additional masses were identified. The background liver showed no evidence of cirrhosis on macroscopic examination .\n\n【7】On histologic sections, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells . There was no evidence of large vein invasion but microscopic lymphovascular invasion was identified. No conventional HCC component was identified. The background liver showed a chronic hepatitis of mild activity with portal and periportal fibrosis (Batts and Ludwig: grade 2/4, stage 1-2/4) without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. There was no evidence of iron deposition on Perl’s Prussian blue iron stain or alpha 1 antitrypsin inclusion on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain with diastase digestion. Immunohistochemical studies through use of a battery of antibodies including hepatocyte (HepPar-1, OCH1E5, 1:800, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); CD3 (2GV6, prediluted, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ); CD20 (L26, 1:25, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); CD4 (1FC, 1:10, Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK); CD8 (1A5, 1:10, Biogenex, Fremont, CA); TIA-1 (TIA-1, prediluted, Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA); CD138 (BC/B-B4, 1:200, Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA), and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER CISH, ISH I-VIEW Blue Plus kit, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ), as well as kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains (kappa light chain messenger RNA and lambda light chain messenger RNA, performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, Ventana Medical System, Inc. Tucson, AZ). The malignant cells showed focal positivity for HepPar-1, supporting their hepatocellular origin. The lymphoid population showed a subpopulation of CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, as well as a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population. The T-cell population consisted of both CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes and CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells which also showed staining for T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). The cytotoxic T cells predominantly consisted of the intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes located within the malignancy itself . A CD138 stain highlighted the plasma cell component of the lymphoid infiltrate; however, the plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Chromogenic in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA was negative in both the lymphoid cells and the malignant cells. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of “HCC with a dense lymphoid stroma (hepatocellular lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma), stage II (according to AJCC cancer staging manual, the 7th edition)” was considered. The patient is alive without recurrence at 38 months after surgery.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A 64-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B infection of approximately 30 years was noted to have a 2 cm mass in the left lobe of the liver with diffuse fatty changes in the rest of the liver during follow-up imaging for esophageal cancer. A liver biopsy 10 years ago showed chronic hepatitis with moderate lobular activity and mild periportal fibrosis. One year prior to presentation the patient had undergone an esophagectomy for intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Liver function tests performed at the time revealed normal values for ALT (18 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), AST (21 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (81 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), and total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL). Serology test performed at the time showed negative hepatitis B viral DNA, negative Hep B surface antigen, negative HBV E antigen, negative HBV E antibody, positive HBV surface antibody and positive HBV core antibody. The patient’s serum AFP level was elevated at 305.5 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 11 ng/mL). No additional serum tumor markers were performed. This liver lesion was biopsied and showed HCC with a rich lymphoid stroma. Based on these findings, the patient underwent a left lobectomy.\n\n【10】Upon gross examination of the resection specimen (measuring 11.7 × 11.1 × 3.0 cm and weighing 170 g), a single mass was identified, measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension. The mass was well-circumscribed, soft, and white. A hemorrhagic area (0.8 × 0.7 cm) was noted near the tumor. No additional masses were identified. The background liver showed no evidence of cirrhosis on macroscopic examination.\n\n【11】On histologic section, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. No conventional HCC component was identified. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells. The background liver showed a chronic hepatitis of mild activity with minimal portal fibrosis without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. There was no evidence of iron deposition on Perl’s Prussian blue iron stain or alpha 1 antitrypsin inclusion on PAS stain with diastase digestion.\n\n【12】Immunohistochemical studies (performed on the liver mass biopsy specimen) revealed that the malignant cells showed focal positivity for HepPar-1 supporting their hepatocellular origin. The tumor demonstrated membranous and canalicular staining pattern for polyclonal CEA, but was negative for MOC31 and CK7, in line with its hepatocellular origin. The lymphoid population showed a subpopulation of CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, as well as a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population. The T-cell population consisted of both CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes and CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells which also showed staining for TIA-1. The cytotoxic T cells predominantly consisted of the intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes located within the malignancy itself. The plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Chromogenic in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA was negative both in the lymphoid cells and the malignant cells. Based on these findings in the biopsy and resection specimens, a diagnosis of “HCC with a dense lymphoid stroma (lymphoepithelioma-like HCC), stage I (according to AJCC cancer staging manual, the 7th edition)” was considered. The patient received no further HCC-specific treatment and is alive without recurrence 26 months after surgery.\n\n【13】Case 3\n\n【14】A 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C infection of approximately 20 years and was noted to have an elevated AFP level at 45.1 ng/mL. An abdominal MRI study revealed two T2 intense liver lesions (5.6 cm and 1.6 cm) in the right lobe of the liver. There were no accompanying symptoms such as jaundice, ascites, or GI bleeding. There was no documented history of alcohol abuse. The patient has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of 5-year duration and cholelithiasis status post cholecystectomy 2 years ago. Liver tests performed at the time revealed a normal value for ALT (45 U/L, normal range: 0 - 45 U/L), a slight increase in AST (62 U/L, normal range: 7 - 40 U/L), a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase (159 U/L, normal range: 40 - 150 U/L), normal value for total bilirubin (0.6 mg/dL, normal range: 0.0 - 1.5 mg/dL), a decrease in total protein (5.3 ng/dL, normal range: 6.0 - 8.4 g/dL) and albumin (3.1 g/dL, normal range: 3.5 - 5.0 ng/dL). The patient had normal serum alpha 1 antitrypsin level at 187 mg/dL (normal range: 100 - 220 mg/dL). Hepatitis C viral RNA quantification by PCR was positive, at 426,000 IU/mL. Needle biopsy of the larger liver mass was performed.\n\n【15】On histologic sections of the liver mass biopsy, the tumor was composed of markedly pleomorphic, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, a dense lymphoid stroma was associated with the carcinoma cells, and was composed of a mixture of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lymphoid infiltrate was present both at the periphery of the tumor, as well as within the tumor, intimately intermixed with the carcinoma cells. There was no non-neoplastic liver parenchyma present for the evaluation of background liver disease. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the malignant cells were positive for HepPar-1, supporting their hepatocellular origin. The tumor cells also demonstrated membranous and canalicular staining pattern for polyclonal CEA. The plasma cells were polyclonal on kappa and lambda light chain CISH. Based on the overall findings, the liver mass was diagnosed as HCC with a rich lymphoid stroma.\n\n【16】Because of the patient’s severe COPD and the HCC being beyond Milan criteria, the decision was made to proceed with locoregional therapy with chemoembolization. The patient died of disease at 31 months after the diagnosis of HCC despite the treatment.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The clinicopathologic features of rare HCCs with marked lymphocytic infiltration have been documented in case reports and series in Japan , the largest of which comprised 11 cases examined by Wada et al in 1998 . In 2000, Emile et al published a small case series that examined five cases of what the author termed “HCCs with lymphoid stroma”, or hepatocellular CLS, likely corresponding to the cases of HCC with marked lymphocytic infiltration previously described by the Japanese publications . The following year, Szekely argued that the entities described by Emile were indistinguishable from the LELCs described in multiple other organ systems, and advocated terming the liver malignancies as LELCs in order to emphasize their similarities to those previously described . In the intervening years, additional case reports have been published detailing findings consistent with those initially described by Emile et al . However, lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs remain a rare entity. Our current report adds three additional cases to the existing literature. It should be noted that cases of cholangiocarcinoma with components of LELC have also been documented arising in the liver ; these lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinomas were not included in this review. The detailed literature review of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC is summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【19】The three patients described in our series had documented hepatitis C (two cases) and hepatitis B viral infection (one case), a finding which is consistent with the cases previously described in literature. None of our cases had evidence of cirrhosis. Of the 27 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC described in literature, 21 patients (78%) demonstrated seropositivity for either hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or in one case, hepatitis B and C viral infection . In addition, four other cases of LELC arose in patients with a documented history of underlying liver disease, including hereditary hemochromatosis , previous HCC status post right lobectomy , alcohol use  and Clonorchis infection . Only two cases of LELC have been documented as arising in the absence of hepatitis viral infection or underlying liver disease . However, despite the presence of underlying liver injury in 25 of the 27 documented cases of LELC (93% of cases), 48% of reported cases (13/27), including all three cases described in this paper, lacked either gross, histologic, or clinical evidence of cirrhosis . Whether underlying liver disease, viral or otherwise, can be considered an etiologic factor for LELCs of the liver has yet to be determined. The absence of cirrhosis in 13 of the 27 (48%) described cases, however, demonstrates that LELCs have the potential to develop in non-cirrhotic livers, with or without a documented underlying liver disease.\n\n【20】EBV infection has long been acknowledged as playing a role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and EBER CISH performed on these malignancies show a characteristic strong positivity in nearly all of the malignant cells . The association of EBV with LELCs of various organ systems, however, is less distinct. In a literature review performed by Iezonni and colleagues in 1994, LELCs of the salivary gland, thymus, lung and stomach demonstrated positivity for EBV. In contrast, LELCs of the uterine cervix, bladder, skin and breast were negative for EBV . Subsequent case reports which described LELCs in additional organ systems have demonstrated EBV positivity in LELCs of the esophagus, colon and rectum . Of the 27 cases of liver LELC reviewed in Table 1 , 15 cases were evaluated for the presence of EBV. Thirteen of the 15 cases (87%) were negative for EBV . Only two cases demonstrated EBV positivity within lymphoepithelioma-like HCC . Of the two EBV-positive cases, one showed focal differentiation of cholangiocarcinoma ; EBV positivity has previously been demonstrated in lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinomas . The ultimate role of EBV in the pathogenicity of these and other LELCs remains unclear, and the fact that the majority of lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs reported in the literature arose in its absence indicate it is not the major etiologic factor in their development .\n\n【21】On review of LELCs of various organ systems, it has become generally accepted that LELCs carry a better prognosis than comparable malignancies in the same organ systems. In the lung , stomach , uterine cervix , and bladder , studies have reported favorable prognoses when compared to non-LELC malignancies, and this finding has been described in HCCs as well . As the number of reported lymphoepithelioma-like HCCs remains small, the evaluation of prognostic implications is limited. Of the 27 cases of LELC including 24 published cases and three cases described in this report, 25 had follow-up data available for review. With follow-up periods ranging in length from 4.5 months to 8 years, including one case with an unknown length of follow-up, 21 of the 25 patients (84%) were alive without recurrence of disease, while one (4%) was alive with recurrence . Of the four cases where the patient died of their disease, one developed multiple recurrences following liver transplant and died shortly thereafter ; one developed metastatic disease to parapancreatic and para-aortic lymph nodes, progressed to hemoperitoneum, and died 21 months following right lobectomy ; one had a previously documented history of HCC and had undergone right hepatectomy 2 years prior to liver transplant, died at 7.7 years after liver transplantation ; and one had progressive disease and died 31 months following chemoembolization treatment alone. Among the four patients who died of disease, one had EBV-positive LELC which had metastasized to a portal lymph node and this patient developed recurrence and died shortly after liver transplant. It remains to be determined whether the immunosuppressant status post-transplantation accelerates the recurrence of the disease. In addition, of the four patients who died of disease, one had tumor beyond Milan criteria at the time of diagnosis (case 27, our current report) and received chemoembolization treatment only. It has been suggested that the accumulation of inflammatory cells at the site of LELCs may contribute to their observed favorable prognoses, representing a localized immune response to the malignant cells . In studies that have characterized the lymphoid component of LELCs in various organ systems, a prominent CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T-cell population has been described, which has been observed to be associated with co-expression of cytotoxic markers including CD8 and TIA-1 ; these findings were also observed in the cases described in our report.\n\n【22】In summary, we have reported three cases of lymphoepithelioma-like HCC arising in patients with chronic, non-cirrhotic, viral hepatitis. Given the small number of these malignancies that have been described, many aspects of these tumors, including etiologic agents, remain unknown. Based on previously described cases of hepatocellular LELCs, the malignancies appear to carry a favorable prognosis when compared to classical HCCs, and therefore warrant recognition as a unique entity distinct from conventional HCC. However, further conclusions on the pathogenesis and prognosis of these malignancies would require additional studies in larger cohorts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Cinacalcet is used in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in such patients, and in selected patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. It is variably tolerated and has several well documented side effects, the most common of which is gastrointestinal upset. Here, however, we present a unique case and novel association of a serious clinical consequence of this increasingly used drug. We describe an acute dilated cardiomypathy associated with cinacalcet use in a haemodialysis patient, which fully reversed on withdrawal of the drug and for which no other cause was established.\n\n【2】We feel this is an important and valuable clinical lesson which nephrologists worldwide should be made aware of, with important clinical consequences.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We present a 55-year-old Afro-Caribbean man with a background of end-stage renal disease secondary to adult polycystic kidney disease and longstanding hypertension. He had been on renal replacement since 2006, initially on peritoneal dialysis for 2 years but converted to hemodialysis following a left nephrectomy for recurrent urosepsis. At the time of commencing cinacalcet in November 2009, he was on thrice weekly hemodialysis for 4.5 hours per session through a Fresenius <sup>™ </sup> FX100 dialyser. He was anticoagulated with the low molecular weight heparin tinzaparin, and achieved blood flow rates of 300 - 340 mL/min through a left radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula that had been in use for 8 months. He was anuric, with modest interdialytic weight gains of between 1.7 - 2.4 kg between dialysis sessions, and had excellent blood pressure control off any antihypertensives. His mean pre- and post-dialysis blood pressures in November were 141/79 and 133/78 respectively. He did not experience any intradialytic hypotension with ultrafiltration towards his dry weight, and dialysed against a stable dialysate sodium and calcium (1.25 mmol/L).\n\n【5】He had no history of cardiac disease and no angina or breathlessness. An echocardiogram performed as part of a renal transplant assessment showed that the left ventricle (LV) was normal in size with normal wall thickness. Diastolic function was mildly impaired, but there was only mild global systolic dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 45%.\n\n【6】In mid-2009 he was noted to have severe and escaping secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) with an intact PTH of 1927pg/mL (normal range 10 - 60 pg/mL) and his vitamin D analogue (alfacalcidol) was increased without effect. In November his intact PTH remained above 850 pg/mL, with a corrected serum calcium (cCa) of 9.6 mg/dL (NR 8.4 - 10 mg/dL) and a phosphate of 5.48 mg/dL (NR 2.48 - 4.34 mg/dL) on dietary phosphate restriction, alfacalcidol 0.75 µg od and sevelamer HCl 2.4 g tds prior to meals as a phosphate binder. He was thus commenced on cinacalcet 30 mg od.\n\n【7】He was admitted in January 2010 for an expanded criteria deceased donor renal transplant, but had primary graft failure with renal vein thrombosis. He received induction immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin, ciclosporin (3 doses at 7.5 mg/kg/day in divided doses), mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone for 48 hours only. He recovered well post-operatively, and post-discharge his iPTH was persistently elevated at 792 pg/mL (cCa 9.02 mg/dL, Po4 4.03 mg/dL). His cinacalcet was dose-increased to 60 mg od in January. By March 2010 he had controlled SHPT with an iPTH of 365 pg/mL, aiming for 3 - 5 times the upper limit of normal as ideal in patients on dialysis .\n\n【8】Subsequently over a 4 week period he developed breathlessness and chest tightness on exertion, orthopnoea and a cough. Examination revealed a tachycardia, an elevated jugular venous pressure and bibasal crepitations in keeping with heart failure despite being dialysed to his dry weight. Chest x-ray showed new cardiomegaly. His ECG, which had been normal in January, now showed widespread T wave inversion across the chest leads. Coronary angiography revealed unobstructed coronary arteries with global hypokinesia and severely impaired systolic left ventricular function . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed severe biventricular dysfunction with a calculated ejection fraction of 21.5% . A diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy was made and he was commenced on a beta-blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\n【9】A careful clinical review revealed no cause for the development of the evolving and severe dilated cardiomyopathy. His dialysis parameters remained stable, with consistently good adequacy (Kt/V of > 1.4), and modest interdialytic weight gains. Vascular access Doppler confirmed flows estimated at 1,200 mL/sec, consistent with ideal flow through a functioning brachiocephalic fistula fashioned for haemodialysis. Full virological screening was negative.\n\n【10】At this point cinacalcet was proposed as a potential causative agent and the drug was withdrawn. Within three months his heart failure symptoms had totally resolved. Echocardiography now showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50%, the improvement in left ventricular function being confirmed by follow-up cardiac MRI , One year after stopping cinacalcet, he remains free of cardiac symptoms.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent which acts by allosteric activation of the calcium sensing-receptor (CaR). The CaR is expressed on various cell types, including the parathyroid gland where it has been identified as the main regulator of PTH secretion. It is activated by small changes in extracellular calcium concentration and regulates bone turnover through its influence on PTH, 1α-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcitonin secretion and urinary calcium excretion . In clinical studies cinacalcet has been shown to lower PTH while simultaneously lowering calcium, phosphate, and calcium-phosphate product . A combined post-hoc analysis of clinical events using data from 4 (n = 1,184) cinacalcet phase II and III studies suggested it confers a beneficial effect on relative risk of parathyroidectomy, fracture, and hospitalization for cardiovascular complications .\n\n【13】Cinacalcet is used at therapeutic doses from 30 mg to 180 mg od. It has several documented side effects, most commonly experienced are gastrointestinal disturbance and up to 10-15% of patients are intolerant for this reason. Transient hypocalcaemia is also recognised but is usually asymptomatic. Given the ubiquitous distribution of the CaR (it is present in brain tissue, the intestinal tract, vascular tissue including endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular neurons) there are relatively few site-specific side effects documented as a result of activation of CaR .\n\n【14】Experimental data has suggested a role for CaR in blood pressure modulation , in ischemic preconditioning in perfused mouse hearts , and in mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis . Given that calcium is an important second messenger throughout the cardiovascular system, and that the CaR is functionally expressed in atria and ventricles of rats , surprisingly little is known about calcium signalling through the CaR, and even less of any cardiac effects through calcimimetic activation of these receptors.\n\n【15】We could find one other documented case report of a patient with known non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy who was started on cinacalcet following unsuccessful surgical parathyroidectomy which precipitated severe decompensation of his cardiac failure. The symptoms resolved on withdrawal of the drug and worsened again on reintroduction. The authors suggested that the cardiac function may have adapted to the elevated serum calcium and became destabilised after reduction of the calcium levels with cinacalcet .\n\n【16】To our knowledge this is the first report of a new cardiomyopathy which developed after the initiation of cinacalcet and which resolved after withdrawal of the drug. The clear time line for the development and recovery of the severe left ventricular dysfunction in relation to the initiation and cessation, respectively, of cinacalcet implicate the drug as the causative agent. We conclude that the development of left ventricular dysfunction in patients receiving cinacalcet should prompt cessation of the drug.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

To combat this contagious disease, a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimens are now under evaluation in clinical trials . Immunotherapy in the form of vaccines have been proven to be beneficial in viral infections. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a form of passive immunotherapy that can provide effective prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against specific diseases . These are a novel class of antiviral agents that can neutralize the virus in infected patients . In 1975, mAbs were first developed by Kohler and Milstein with palivizumab being the first antiviral mAb approved for the prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus in high-risk infants by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The early stage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and the use of antibody-based treatments are likely to be beneficial in this stage. Here in, we report three cases in which patients with suspected Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 were treated with mAbs and hospitalized for progression of disease.\n\n【2】Case Reports\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 75-year-old female with a past medical history (PMH) of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and peripheral arterial disease presented to the emergency department (ED) on December 13, 2021 with complaints of loss of appetite and cough for the past 3 days. The patient stated the cough was dry, non-productive and non-bloody. The patient denied any weight loss, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, or shortness of breath. She is not vaccinated for COVID-19. Medications include carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, aspirin 81 mg once daily, atorvastatin 40 mg once at night and insulin. The patient is compliant with her medications with no change in use or dosage of current medications. She did not report any change or exacerbation of her chronic medical conditions. On examination the patient was afebrile with temperature of 37 °C, pulse 78 beats/min (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) 18 breaths/min, blood pressure (BP) 169/64 mm Hg, saturating 100% on room air (RA). Cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examination were within normal limits.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】On laboratory evaluation, COVID-19 antigen and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were positive. The high sensitivity troponin (HS troponin) and creatinine were elevated. The remainder of the laboratory parameters were unremarkable. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm. The chest X-ray showed no infiltrates as shown in Figure 1 . The patient received bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1,400 mg transfusion and was discharged. The patient returned to the ED after 6 days for persistent loss of appetite and cough. She stated that the cough had worsened, was dry and non-productive. She denied any fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea. Review of systems was otherwise negative. She was afebrile with a temperature of 36.8 °C, pulse of 72 bmp, RR 17 breaths/min, BP of 156/69 mm Hg, saturating 96% on RA. Physical examination including the respiratory and cardiac examination was unremarkable. The COVID-19 antigen test was negative, but the PCR test was positive. The inflammatory markers including ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated. Chest X-ray showed multifocal airspace disease as shown in Figure 2 . Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest without contrast showed bilateral peripheral multifocal consolidation. Doppler venous ultrasound of bilateral lower extremity was negative for acute deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】The patient was given a 3-day course of remdesivir and prophylactic anticoagulation. Her cough and appetite improved during the hospital stay and she was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on a month of 5 mg apixaban daily with out-patient follow-up.\n\n【10】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【11】On the follow-up visit after 2 weeks the patient reported recovery of her symptoms.\n\n【12】Case 2\n\n【13】Investigations\n\n【14】A 75-year-old male with a PMH of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis presented to the ED on December 21, 2021 from a long-term care facility with complaints of cough for the past 2 days. The patient stated the cough was non-bloody and productive of yellowish sputum. He denied any shortness of breath, fever, or chills. His past medical conditions were reported to be stable with regular follow-up in the facility. Medications include abacavir-lamivudine, fosamprenavir with CD4 count of 354 and unknown viral load with no change in the dosage or use of current medication. The review of the system was otherwise unremarkable. He received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination 8 months ago but did not receive the booster dose. Patient was unaware of which type of vaccine. On examination the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.6 °C, pulse 70 bpm, RR 20 breaths/min, saturating 95% on RA. The patient appeared alert on physical examination. The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with labored speech and respiration. The rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.\n\n【15】Diagnosis\n\n【16】The laboratory parameters were within normal limits. The PCR test for COVID-19 was positive, but the antigen test was negative. The chest X-ray was positive for hilar vascular congestion as shown in Figure 3 . The patient was given casirivimab-imdevimab 1,200 mg mAb treatment in the ED and was discharged back to the facility. The patient presented back to the ED for worsening shortness of breath after 18 days. As per the facility nurse the patient had increased cough and shortness of breath in the past week. He was placed on a high flow nasal cannula in the facility. On evaluation in the ED the patient was in moderate respiratory distress and was unable to answer questions comprehensively. Patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.8 °C with a pulse of 73 bmp and RR of 28 breaths/min, BP of 122/61 mm Hg, saturating 95% on continuous bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) device. On examination the patient had bilateral crackles with poor air entry bilaterally. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. The inflammatory markers including ferritin, D-dimer and LDH were markedly elevated. The COVID-19 antigen and PCR tests were negative. The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. The chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates as shown in Figure 4 . Echocardiography showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50-55%. His initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.446 (7.34 - 7.44), pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 44.4 (35 - 48 mm Hg), pO <sub>2 </sub> of 45.7 (75 - 100 mm Hg) and bicarb of 29.8 (22 - 28 mmol/L). Doppler venous ultrasound of bilateral lower extremity was negative for acute deep vein thrombosis. The blood cultures were negative.\n\n【17】Treatment\n\n【18】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for increasing oxygen requirements. He was started on dexamethasone and prophylactic anticoagulation.\n\n【19】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【20】During ICU stay the patient’s BP decreased, and he was started on pressor support. Goals of care were discussed with the patient who did not wish to be intubated. The code status was confirmed as do not resuscitate, do not intubate. His oxygen requirements continued to increase, and he expired on day 10.\n\n【21】Case 3\n\n【22】Investigations\n\n【23】A 54-year-old female with no significant PMH presented to the ED on December 27, 2021 with complaints of fatigue and loss of appetite for the past 4 days. She complained of mild shortness of breath with dry, non-bloody cough and 2 - 3 episodes of loose stools. The patient is not vaccinated for COVID-19. She denied any headache, chest pain, palpitations, or abdominal pain. The patient was afebrile with pulse 82 bmp, RR 20 breaths/min, saturating 97% on RA and body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . The physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【24】Diagnosis\n\n【25】The COVID-19 antigen and PCR tests were positive. The remainder of the laboratory investigations were within normal limits. The chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion as shown in Figure 5 . The patient was given casirivimab-imdevimab 1200 mg mAb treatment in the ED and was discharged, with instructions to self-isolate. The patient returned to the ED 4 days later with complaints of shortness of breath. She stated she felt short of breath on exertion. She also complained of a cough producing yellowish sputum. She still complained of loss of appetite and stated that she had fever and chills at home. She denied any chest pain, palpitations, headache, dizziness, nausea, or abdominal pain. Review of systems was otherwise negative. On evaluation she was febrile with Tmax (the maximum recorded temperature at a given station on a given day) of 39 °C , BP of 129/66 mm Hg, RR 18 breaths/min, pulse 97 bpm, saturating 92% on RA. On respiratory examination the patient had diffuse rales bilaterally. The remainder of the physical examination was within normal limits. The inflammatory markers were mildly elevated. The patient had leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The other laboratory parameters were unremarkable as shown in Table 1 . The chest X-ray showed diffuse patchy airspace disease as shown in Figure 6 .\n\n【26】Treatment\n\n【27】She was given a 7-day course of dexamethasone, 5 days of remdesivir and prophylactic anticoagulation. The patient’s oxygen requirements improved, and she was discharged on apixaban 2.5 mg daily for 2 weeks with out-patient follow-up.\n\n【28】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【29】On the subsequent visit the patient denied any active complaints.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health crisis globally and warrants the timely creation of optimal preventive and therapeutic interventions . SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the organs with a high quantity of virus targeted receptor protein: angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which includes the lungs, heart, kidney, and small intestine . Clinical manifestations include mild symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath and cough to severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, widespread thrombosis, renal failure, and death . Current treatment modalities for moderate and severe for COVID-19 include antiviral agents, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and supportive management .\n\n【32】Recently mAbs have emerged as a beneficial tool for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 based on their specificity, ability to prevent disease progression and reduction of disease period . It follows the hypothesis that passive immunotherapy might be useful for the management of COVID-19 since patients who develop antibodies soon after disease occurrence have better prognosis than those with delayed antibody response . The mAbs are derived from the B cells. These antibodies neutralize the virus by binding to the spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 and block the entry of the virus into the host cells thereby reducing the viral load . The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of mAbs for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease within 10 days of symptom onset including bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, bebtelovimab and sotrovimab; however, the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab against Omicron variant was later revised in January 2022 due to lack of efficacy against the variant. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2) binds to the epitopes of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 and blocks the virus binding to the human receptors causing decrease in the viral load . Bamlanivimab-etesevimab also has a similar mechanism of action and can be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and high risk of progression to severe disease . Clinical trials for the efficacy, rate of hospitalization and mortality benefits of mAbs for COVID-19 are currently underway for patients with early disease . However, limited benefit has been observed in patients with severe disease .\n\n【33】A study conducted by Bariola et al showed that 15 out of 232 propensity matched patients were hospitalized after treatment with bamlanivimab and only four of these patients died . This study emphasized that bamlanivimab therapy reduced the hospitalization and mortality in patients more than 65 years of age with COVID-19. Another study conducted by Gupta et al showed that only three out of 291 patients with COVID-19 treated with sotrovimab had disease progression leading to hospitalization and death . The emergence of viral variants, however, is an issue of concern since it may undermine the clinical effectiveness of current mAbs therapy . Omicron (B1.1.529) is a new variant with missense substitutions in the spike protein receptor domain that might not be neutralized by casirivimab and imdevimab as per unpublished in vitro studies . If this hypothesis proves true, then it will significantly compromise the efficacy of mAbs against the Omicron variant . The National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines also recommend against the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab for Omicron variant and as such have revoked the EUA of these mAbs due to lack of efficacy against the Omicron variant as of January 2022 .\n\n【34】We compiled the data of 125 patients with mild and moderate symptoms of COVID-19 who received mAbs over the course of 2 months from October 2021 to December 2021. Twelve patients out of 125 received sotrovimab whereas 55 received casirivimab/imdevimab and 58 received bamlanivimab/etesevimab. Most of the patients were Hispanic. Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. Majority of the patients were male. We report three cases of hospitalization out of these 125 patients post mAbs treatment. One patient received bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1,400 mg transfusion whereas the remaining two received casirivimab-imdevimab 1,200 mg mAb treatment. Out of the three, one patient who received casirivimab-imdevimab, passed away due to progression of disease. It is to be noted that the patient had multiple comorbidities which might be a cofounder to the efficacy of mAbs. All patients were above 54 years of age. Two patients were hospitalized within a week of mAb administration whereas one patient was hospitalized after 2 weeks for worsening clinical symptoms. Only one patient was upgraded to the ICU due to progression of the disease. All the patients were given prophylactic anticoagulation whereas, only two patients received remdesivir and dexamethasone. One patient had no significant PMH except obesity whereas the other two had multiple comorbidities. All of the patients showed progression of disease on imaging; however, the only patient with unfavorable outcome had significant co-morbidities which might have played a role in the severity of his symptoms. A study conducted by Lovett et al demonstrated that out of 270 patients treated with bamlanivimab only five patients (1.9%) required hospitalization and the risk of hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb treated patients as compared to untreated patients . These cases coincide with the beginning of the spread of the Omicron variant and even though the viral genome was not sequenced due to the paucity of funds in the community hospital, the timing of the cases suggest infection with the Omicron variant and the therapeutic failure of the mAbs might be due to the reduced activity of mAbs against the newer variant. It is to be noted that mAbs are susceptible to mutations and not useful for permanent intervention.\n\n【35】Future prospective studies are required to explore medical conditions and viral variants that may benefit from mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19. Outpatient strategies to decrease the rate of hospitalization and death are imperative to reduce the disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 and as such also supports the investment of funds for the development of infusion infrastructure.\n\n【36】Learning points\n\n【37】The use of neutralizing antibodies has a potential utility as a treatment option for COVID-19 and clinical trials are underway to determine the optimum strategic use. The emergence of viral variants is a limiting factor for the treatment with mAbs and should be kept in consideration while using the mAbs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b5d34777-ad72-4ba7-8da6-b61beca5848c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】The majority of ureteral injuries are iatrogenic in nature. Such injuries are often known to occur most frequently during urology, gynecology and general surgery . However, ureteral obstruction due to surgical clip migration into the ureter is an extremelly rare phenomenon . We report here an interesting case of spontaneous migration of metal clip into the ureter in a female patient that underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 1 year previously for polymyomatous uterus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case decribed in a patient after laparoscopic hysterectomy. The purpose of presenting this case report is not only to report an uncommon case of surgical clip migration, but also to raise awareness among clinicians that this rare entity can occurs after laparoscopic hysterectomy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 45-year-old lady presented with repeated episodes of right flank pain since 3 weeks. Her past history was significant for laparoscopic hysterectomy for polymyomatous uterus 1 year ago. Plain radiography of the abdomen revealed a 5-mm opacity projected over the pelvic portion of the right ureter . The renal ultrasonography showed moderate right ureterohydranephrosis without detectable lithiasis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography scan revealed a 0.5-cm opacity (arrow) on the right lower ureter .\n\n【4】Ureteroscopy with the patient under general anesthesia showed metalic foreign body at the lower right ureter  with incomplete stenosis that was dilated by a balloon. The medium-sized surgical clip was identified and removed using a dormia basket device and a double J stent was placed for 2 months. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with absolutely normal renal function test and absence of ureterohydonephrosis in abdomen ultrasonography.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Surgical clips have been used for many years in a variety of surgical procedures and they have proven competency and efficacy. The number of the surgical clips used is variable and unpredictable which depends on the procedure. However, regardless of their type, migration of the surgical clips away from the surgical site is a well-known phenomenon that occurs quite regularly.\n\n【7】While migration of clips into the common bile duct has been previously reported in several laparoscopic cholecystectomies , migrations of surgical materials into the urinary tract like pelvicalyceal system, ureter and bladder are a rare condition. It has been reported following various urological procedures either in the ureter after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy  or into the bladder after surgery laparoscopic radical prostatectomy . Moreover, a case of intrarectal migration after prostatectomy  and a case of migration in the colon after partial nephrectomy  have also been reported.\n\n【8】This case is very interesting because to the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of migration of surgical clip into the ureter after laparoscopic hysterectomy.\n\n【9】It was suggested that migrated clips are more often associated with laparoscopic procedures . This implies that we would expect to see more of migrated clips with the vast preferred use of laparoscopy\n\n【10】The exact sequence of events leading to clip migration is poorly understood, but is thought to be partly affected by technical factors such as correct placement and use of minimal numbers of clips . A proposed mechanism of clip migration after cholecystectomy involved the compression of the clipped cystic duct by the liver. The cystic duct and clips then become inverted into the lumen of the common bile duct. Over time, this structure becomes necrotic, and the clips fall away into the common bile duct. The number of clips used during the initial surgery is also an important factor . In our patient, the non-absorbable surgical clip probably eroded into the ureter which has obstructed subsequently probably due to chronic inflammatory reactions, and caused ureterohydronephrosis.\n\n【11】The median time of clip migration is usually 2 years, but it can vary from 11 days to 20 years, while the median number of migrated clip is 1 (range: 1 - 6) . In this patient, clip migration was diagnosed 1 year after laparoscopic hysterectmy which concord with the literature.\n\n【12】The choice of treatment is based on the location, type and extend of ureteral injury caused by migrated clip .There is a report of the migration of absorbable Lapra-Ty suture clips in the collecting system after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy , and Massoud  also reported the migration of a metal surgical clip into the ureter after open partial nephrectomy, all of which were passed spontaneously. The majority of patients with delayed diagnosed ureteral injuries should be managed by an initial endourological approach.\n\n【13】To improve the management of ureteric injury, there must be a high index of suspicion, especially after laparoscopic operations. Most reported cases were treated with endourological treatment which yields acceptable results.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Surgical clips may migrate postoperatively and cause secondary complications. Therefore, the surgeon must be aware of the possibility of clip migration. Furthermore, clips should be absorbable and applied selectively over vessels and far from the collecting system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Fulminant GBS mimicking clinical brain death has been described in the literature and has overall poor prognosis . We describe a case of fulminant GBS mimicking clinical brain death where patient died of unexplained cardiac arrest related to severe dysautonomia.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A healthy 44-year-old male with no significant medical history presented to our hospital’s emergency department with complaints of acute shortness of breath requiring initiation of mechanical ventilation. He also gave history of vomiting, diarrhea and fever of 5 days duration. His neurological exam was consistent with severe flaccid quadriparesis and complete areflexia in all four extremities but intact extraocular movements and pupillary anisocoria. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head was unremarkable. On day 2 of ICU stay, his neurological exam became consistent with clinical brain death as he developed coma, bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils and loss of extraocular movements. He was not triggering the ventilator. Initial lumbar puncture (LP) was non-confirmatory but repeat cerebrospinal fluid analysis done 1 month later showed albuminocytological dissociation . Electromyographic (EMG) study showed findings consistent with primary demyelinating neuropathy with secondary axonal degeneration. Electroencephalographic (EEG) study demonstrated intact cortical function with patient in persistently awake state. His ICU course was complicated by episodes of severe dysautonomia, extremes of blood pressure and symptomatic bradycardia requiring insertion of temporary pacemaker. He received one course of plasmapheresis and two courses of IV immunoglobulin with no clinical recovery. He underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement and died about 6 weeks later after developing sudden unexplained asystolic cardiac arrest related to his severe dysautonomia.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】GBS, first described in 1916, is an immunologically mediated disease of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by acute areflexic paralysis with albuminocytological dissociation (high protein levels and normal cell counts) on CSF analysis . It is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide since the eradication of poliomyelitis, with slight male predominance. Up to 20% of the patients remain severely disabled and about 5% die, despite immunotherapy . Our patient presented with diarrhea and up to two-thirds of cases are preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or diarrhea . Thirty percent of infections have been attributed to campylobacter jejuni infection. Various forms of GBS have been described including typical acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) and Miller-Fisher variant.\n\n【6】Serious and fatal autonomic dysfunction, like arrhythmias and extreme hypertension or hypotension, has been well described in patients with GBS . Three to eight percent of patients with GBS die from complications like sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, or in rare cases, unexplained cardiac arrest, related to dysautonomia . Sixty-five percent of patients are left with persistent minor deficits, 20% with serious disability and only 20% with no residual problems .\n\n【7】Our patient developed fulminant GBS and had clinical exam resembling brain death. Our differential diagnosis included tick paralysis, botulism, brainstem cerebrovascular accident, brainstem encephalitis or fulminant axonal neuropathy. We did not perform any apnea test since patient was not brain dead. Brain death is defined as an irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including brain stem. There should be an underlying etiology leading to brain death and all reversible causes should be ruled out first. Our patient’s EEG also showed activity consistent with persistently awake state, thus ruling out brain death. The patient had albuminocytological dissociation on second CSF sample. Albuminocytological dissociation on CSF was reported in nine out of 12 cases of fulminant GBS mimicking brain death in series by Vargas et al . EEG typically shows presence of alpha rhythm which is unresponsive to painful and auditory stimulation or preserved sleep patterns or reactivity to sound. EMG studies show inexcitability of all nerves, due to distal pathology of the motor axons, either distal conduction block or axonal degeneration. Severe axonal degeneration in GBS is associated with poor clinical outcomes whether the axonal damage is a primary event or is secondary to inflammatory demyelination . Our patient had EMG consistent with axonal degeneration.\n\n【8】GBS mimicking clinical brain death is rare occurrence and about 20 cases have been reported in the literature. This condition has a poor recovery rate and a high mortality, particularly, related to dysautonomia . Outcomes of this subset of patients have been described by Vargas et al in the largest case series of 13 patients in 2000. Of the three deaths, two died from cardiac arrest due to dysautonomia and one died due to large anterior wall MI. Only two patients recovered with minor deficits and rest were severely disabled . We report, to the best of our knowledge, the third case of death related to dysautonomia leading to sudden explained asystolic cardiac arrest. Nithyashree et al reported that markers of poor prognosis in fulminant GBS included elderly patients with a mean age of 60 years, prior diarrheal prodrome, rapid progression of muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation within 24 h, dense weakness of all four limbs with cardiovascular autonomic symptoms and inexcitable peripheral nerves . Our patient had most of these features excluding age. Ahmed et al reported a case of young patient with GBS masquerading as brain death who recovered clinically after receiving mechanical ventilation for 150 days . Bernard et al described a patient with fulminant GBS mimicking brain death who died from nosocomial infection after 158 days without any motor recovery .\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Fulminant GBS mimicking clinical brain death is associated with poor prognosis as most of the patients either die or are left with severe disability. Dysautonomia is a poor prognostic sign and a marker of mortality in this patient population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Osteochondromas are seen more in adolescents or children than infants or newborns . This tumor is defined as a cartilage-capped bony projection arising on the external surface of bone . Osteochondroma is often asymptomatic, but the only clinical symptom is a painless slow-growing mass on the involved bone . When compression, fracture, bone deformity and mechanical joint problems occur with symtoms . In addition, surgical treatment is considered because of pain, disturbance of growth, decreased range of motion, cosmetic, symptoms secondary to compression of anybody organ, fracture and malign transformation .\n\n【2】In this case report, we discuss an acute pedicle fracture of humerus by an osteochondroma with radial nerve neuropraxia, resulting in a pain and low motion. This fracture occurred in a boy, and its presentation was similar to that of low energy pedicle fracture with radial nerve neuropraxia.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 13-year-old boy presented to the outpatient orthopedics clinic with pain in his right arm after the arm tourniquet inflated to measure blood pressure by orthopedic nurses. On physical examination, there was localized tenderness over proximally and posterior medially aspect of his arm with palpation. Joint of shoulder and elbow range of motion were normal. Vascular examination revealed no abnormality. There was radial nerve injury after the arm tourniquet inflated while motor function was normal, but there was hypoesthesia on the hand dorsum. His past medical history was not remarkable. Soft tissue injury was initially doubted. Direct radiography showed a pedicle fracture of an osteochondroma on the one-third of the proximal metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of humerus . The operation was carried out under general anesthesia. The position of the patient was semi-supine. The approach was done on the right arm through an approximately 5 cm longitudinal midline posterior-laterally incision. Firstly the exposure was found between biceps and triceps inter-muscular septum, and then achieved the fracture of osteochondroma. It was seen that triceps muscle was injured by pedicle of osteochondroma. Total excision of the osteochondroma was performed without complication . The diagnosis of osteochondroma was confirmed after pathological examination of the removed part . The postoperative period was quiet, and the patient has returned to his preoperative level of activity within 2 weeks. The radial nerve deficit was completely healed within 6 weeks.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Osteochondromas are osteocartilaginous exostoses tumors . Osteochondroma occurs in 3% of the general population. It accounts for 30-49% of all benign bone tumors and 10-15% of all bone tumors . It is typically characterized by metaphyseal location of the long tubular bones, and it is rare on the diaphyseal or the epiphysis . Epidemiologically 70% of affected patients occur at 20 years or younger, and the male to female ratio is 2:1 or 1:1 . In our case, it was localized in metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of humerus, and the age of patient was similar in the literature.\n\n【7】Although osteochondromas are generally asymptomatic, it can occasionally come to clinical attention for various reasons . While our case had swelling, it was not painful before it was fractured. He did not receive any treatments.\n\n【8】The symptoms are painful swelling, cosmetic problems, restricted motion, nerve or vascular compression and pathological fracture . In the literature, for pathological fracture, bone fracture was more than pedicle fracture . The fracture of our case was pedicle.\n\n【9】If symptoms of patients are typical of fracture, it seems local pain and swelling. Initial pain later subsided considerably . Although the literature contains about 20 issued cases of fracture of an osteochondroma, it is unclear. Because more cases are asymptomatic, these were not published . The fracture of pedicle of osteochondroma with radial nerve neuropraxia is a rare complication . The case was a rare complication after the arm tourniquet inflated to measure blood pressure that caused low energy pedicle fracture with radial nerve neuropraxia in the pediatric ages.\n\n【10】The treatment of fracture of pedicle is divided into conservative or surgical. While conservative authors offer the observation that has a long time pain and more analgesic, surgical authors offer excision that provides faster recovery and return to normal daily activity . We preferred the surgical excision for the case, so he had painful swelling and reduced to extension mechanism. There was no any complication about surgery. After the surgery, the patient was suggested to strengthen for extension mechanism; thus he faster recovered and returned to normal daily activity in the 2 weeks.\n\n【11】Kose et al  published low energy fracture of distally metaphyseal of humerus without muscle injured. Reize et al  published non-traumatic subscapularis tear, where the tendon had been peeled off the lesser tuberosity by osteochondroma of a young man. Lee et al  published restricted motion within a shoulder osteochondroma. Our case was different from others by the localization of diaphyseal . Besides, the case was distinguished to have muscle injury , faster recovery and returned to normal daily activity from others . Follow-up showed that the radial nerve deficit completely healed within 6 weeks .\n\n【12】This case report should lead the novice medicine clinician. The case was a rare complication after the arm tourniquet inflated to measure blood that caused low energy pedicle fracture with radial nerve neuropraxia pressure with pediatric ages. The treatment of osteochondroma is very simple. In additional, fracture may be the first symptom of an osteochondroma, and we recommend immediate surgical excision without complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3b5ba89c-c194-457e-b33e-e09ca92c4a12", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, weakness of the proximal muscles, pathognomonic skin rashes, including heliotrope rash, and Gottron’s papules with onset during childhood . Recent identification of novel myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) frequently detected in JDM, such as anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ (TIF1γ), anti-melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA5), and nuclear matrix protein-2 (NXP2), has provided further understanding of the clinical characteristics of JDM . Anti-NXP2 antibody is detected in 15-23% of patients with JDM and is associated with a severe phenotype that involves contracture and weakness of the muscles and subcutaneous calcification .\n\n【2】The pathophysiology of JDM is regarded as a combination of various mechanisms: vasculopathy based on autoimmunity and subsequent ischemic changes, activation of dendritic cells and upregulation of type I interferon, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress in affected tissues . Hyperproduction of type I interferon is regarded as the central pathogenesis of JDM, and can be applied to the assessment of disease activity and represents a potential target of future specific treatments for JDM. Here, we describe a case of anti-NXP2-positive JDM in which the patient presented with typical symptoms and was treated by glucocorticoids, methotrexate and additional intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) and high-dose immunoglobulin. We demonstrate his clinical course, histological findings, as well as serum cytokine profile and the time course of changes in CXC-motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10, an interferon-induced protein.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】An 8-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of muscle weakness and a rash on his limbs and eyelids. He had progressive muscle weakness which left him unable to get up from a squatting position without support of his hands, and he was also unable to open the screw cap on plastic bottles. On examination, he had low-grade fever, weakness of the proximal muscles of the legs and arms, heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules and erythema over his knees and elbows . His height was 118 cm (-1.2 SD) and body weight was 19.4 kg, giving a body mass index of 13.8. Laboratory findings  showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase levels, although the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was within the normal range. Although the patient was negative for C-reactive protein, his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and ferritin, serum β2-microglobulin (β2MG), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were elevated. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer was 1:640, and he was positive for the anti-NXP2 autoantibody evaluated through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting , but negative for other autoantibodies such anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, anti-Sm, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Jo-1, anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA5, and anti-TIF1γ. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging for high-intensity areas throughout all skeletal muscles using T2-weighted and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images . The childhood myositis assessment scale (CMAS)  was scored as 23, although there was difficulty in obtaining sufficient cooperation.\n\n【6】We carried out muscle biopsy from the left biceps brachii muscle, with the histological findings as follows. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a collection of atrophic fibers with basophilic cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei in the perifascicular areas, indicating perifascicular atrophy. No apparent endomysial fibrosis was observed. Minimal lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the perivascular area, and macrophages were scattered throughout the perimysium . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed, in addition to the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC with perifascicular enhancement, the expression of myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA), which is a diagnostic marker of dermatomyositis in terms of muscle pathology , and membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition in the endomysial capillaries, which is also diagnostic of dermatomyositis .\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Based on the observations of typical skin rush and muscle weakness, increase in serum myogenic enzyme, positivity for anti-NXP2 antibody, and typical histological findings, we diagnosed the patient with JDM.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】We then administered two courses of methyl-prednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy followed by 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone and weekly oral methotrexate (MTX). Laboratory findings of muscle-derived enzymes showed transient improvement after treatment; however, a subsequent increase in aldolase was observed. We, therefore, additionally provided six courses of IVCY and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. As a result, the laboratory findings for aldolase, β2MG, and sIL-2R gradually improved and oral prednisolone was successfully decreased.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】The patient’s muscle weakness also gradually improved, and his CMAS was about 37 at 4 months and 41 at 9 months after admission, which was sufficient for activities of daily life. He has been followed up for 24 months to date, and although one mild relapse occurred, presumably due to non-adherence to the medication, the patient has been stable and has not developed calcinosis to date.\n\n【13】Additional investigations\n\n【14】We also retrospectively evaluated the serum concentration of several cytokines using the Bioplex multiplex assay system (Bio-RAD, CA, USA). Human cytokine assay kits for IL-6 (#171B5006M), soluble tumor necrotizing factor receptor (sTNFR)-1, sTNFR2 (#171BL034M and #171BL035M), IL-18 (#171B6023M) and CXCL-10 (#171B5020M) were individually purchased and each cytokine was mixed and evaluated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The assays were performed on serum samples from healthy adults (n = 8), from a patient with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) (n = 1, four samples obtained before treatment initiation), patients with Kawasaki disease (n = 6), and this patient (two samples obtained before treatment initiation, and a further 16 consecutive samples). Compared to healthy adults, the cytokine profile of the sJIA showed an IL-18-dominant pattern, while that for Kawasaki disease showed an increase in IL-6 and sTNFR, which was consistent with previously reported results  . The cytokine profile for our patient before treatment initiation showed a noticeably CXCL-10-dominant pattern . Additionally, the time course of CXCL-10 concentration showed continuing elevation. Interestingly, although transient decreases in serum CXCL-10 after the two courses of mPSL pulse were observed, it remained increased for a certain period, and only gradually decreased after the administration of IVCY and IVIG .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】JDM is a heterogeneous disease and autoantibodies are potentially useful biomarkers by which to divide patients into homogeneous subgroups and provide information on prognosis. Anti-NXP2 was first identified from a JDM cohort and reported in 1997 as anti-MJ. Espada et al  suggested an association between anti-NXP2 and a significant compromise in functional status characterized by muscle contracture and atrophy. Furthermore, studies of other independent cohorts in France and the UK subsequently revealed that anti-NXP2 was associated with a severe subtype of JDM in which patients developed severe muscular disease with a lower remission rate . Furthermore, the association between anti-NXP2 and a high frequency of calcinosis was reported . Additionally, several risk factors for a refractory clinical course among patients with anti-NXP2-positive JDM have been reported. Wang et al  reported an analysis of 26 anti-NXP2-positive JDM cases and found that edema, skin ulcers, significant muscle weakness, low CD4/CD8 ratio and high serum ferritin level at disease onset were associated with a refractory clinical course. Importantly, the serum levels of muscular enzymes at onset did not provide a basis for differentiating clinical outcomes. In our case, the increases in serum muscular enzymes were only modest, and no edema or ulcers were observed. On the other hand, significant muscle weakness and increases in serum ferritin level were observed, and the response to initial treatment was limited. It appeared that our patient was at a comparatively high risk and aggressive treatment including IYCY, IVIG in addition to mPSL pulse and short MTX therapy was necessary.\n\n【17】The association of type I interferon with JDM pathophysiology has been the subject of a considerable amount of researches. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells were shown to be the predominant subsets of inflamed muscle tissue , and serum interferon-α activity was also reported to be elevated . The global gene expression pattern in the peripheral blood cells of JDM patients shows a subset of type I interferon-inducible genes . To investigate the pathophysiology, we carried out cytokine assays of IL-6, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, IL-18 and CXCL-10 , and observed a solely CXCL-10-dominant pattern. As CXCL-10 is a chemokine that attracts lymphocytes to production sites and, at the same time, belongs to the interferon-induced protein family, the increase in CXCL-10 may be the result of excessive type I interferon. In fact, a previous report showed an increase in serum CXCL-10 along with disease activity in JDM patients . Additionally, we found that the increase in serum CXCL-10 was more prolonged than expected, and persisted even after multiple courses of mPSL pulse therapy. This indicated that the disease activity of JDM lasted for a certain period, even after the serum concentrations of myogenic enzymes were within their normal ranges.\n\n【18】The development of calcinosis in JDM is associated with delayed diagnosis, a chronic disease course and inadequately treated disease . It is also associated with a lower age at disease onset and anti-NXP2 positivity . As calcification is regarded to result from chronic inflammation, our finding showing a persistent increase in CXCL-10 in a patient with JDM with anti-NXP2 antibodies who received comparatively aggressive treatment might have an impact on the future management of this disease in terms of the importance of the adequate induction of clinical remission. Further, our findings appear to support the further progress toward to more disease-specific agents to reduce the interferon-induced pathophysiology, such as Janus-kinase inhibitors, which have recently been reported to be effective in the treatment of JDM . Further investigation is required to prove this hypothesis.\n\n【19】Learning points\n\n【20】A continuous increase in CXCL-10 in this patient implies the need for aggressive intervention in anti-NXP2-positive JDM patients. Moreover, the development of a pathophysiologically specific treatment is desirable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Pathologic examination showed that the lesion was a breast hemangioma. A breast hemangioma is extremely rare in a male breast and has only been reported a few times before.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 52-year-old Caucasian male patient was admitted to our breast care clinic after noticing a small mass in his right breast which persisted for several months. His medical history included a thoracic aorta aneurysm and COPD, but no known malignancies or an increased risk for breast cancer.\n\n【4】A mammography was performed in a right cranio-caudal (RCC) and right medial-lateral oblique (RMLO) direction . The obtained images revealed two round, circumscribed, high-density lesions in the breast.\n\n【5】The first lesion was located prepectorally in the upper outer quadrant.\n\n【6】The second lesion showed the same characteristics on mammography and was located in the lower outer quadrant. No anomalies were seen regarding the skin, areola or nipple.\n\n【7】An ultrasound of the right breast was performed for further detailed characteristics. The lesion in the upper outer quadrant measured approximately 11 mm in length and showed well-defined margins . This lesion was mixed echoic with a hyper-echoic center and a hypo-echoic outer lining of 1.7 mm in thickness. Color Doppler ultrasound showed a single vascular pole. There was a horizontal orientation and no invasive features or distortion of the surrounding tissues. The mass showed typical characteristics of a lymph node with a fatty center and was therefore considered to be a BIRADS-2, according to the “Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System” classification.\n\n【8】The lesion in the lower outer quadrant measured 7 mm in diameter and was also round and well-defined. Furthermore, it showed a mixed echo texture without invasive features or distortion of the surroundings in any way. No flow was seen on Doppler ultrasound . Although the lesion showed benign morphologic characteristics, it did not show the typical benign features of male breast tissue. The lesion was considered to be a BIRADS-3 and therefore a core biopsy was performed.\n\n【9】The results of the histopathologic evaluation showed varying vascular structures with varying thin and thick walls, covered in flat endothelial cells; tissue was consistent with a hemangioma.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】A hemangioma is a very rare tumor in the male breast with an unknown incidence. Up until now, only large palpable masses have been reported as histological proven hemangiomas in male breasts.\n\n【12】A case of a hemangioma in the male breast has been reported four times before. The sizes of the hemangiomas varied from 4 to 51 cm. In all cases, the patients presented themselves in the clinic with a palpable mass. Core biopsy showed endothelial lining. In some cases, where the hemangioma was big in size, a resection was performed .\n\n【13】As far as we could find in online scientific databases, these are the only reported cases of proven hemangiomas in the male breast.\n\n【14】In this case, we have reported the smallest hemangioma in a male breast up until now, measuring only 7 mm. Unlike previously reported cases, lobulation was not a feature of this hemangioma.\n\n【15】Besides the lack of available pathognomonic characteristics on conventional imaging, the size of the hemangioma made diagnosis even more challenging.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Mammographically, hemangiomas appear as round or oval masses with sharp margins and may contain calcifications. Calcification is a known feature, but unspecific in order to distinguish from malignant lesions.\n\n【18】Sonography usually shows lobulated and well-circumscribed masses with variable echo patterns, mostly due to vascular channels and phleboliths. The surrounding tissue is usually not affected and drop shadow is not a typical feature. Unfortunately, sonographic characteristics are unspecific as well and make it difficult to distinguish between other benign lesions such as fibroadenoma, hematoma, arteriovenous malformations, venous malformations, lymphatic malformations or capillary malformations. Moreover, malignant tumors such as fibro-sarcoma and even angiosarcoma, should also be considered. They can show similar features on sonography, but Doppler might show multiple vascular poles suggesting vascularization.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of hemangioma is based on histopathologic analysis. Histologically angiosarcomas can present like hemangiomas; however, they show necrosis and hemorrhages on a frequent basis .\n\n【20】If the tumor cannot be differentiated through histopathology, resection is recommended in case of doubt . In our case, we have a histologically proven benign tumor, therefore resection was not necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "eb926dd9-ff5e-4ead-aa2d-2bb54bfc7555", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Hemophilia is a hereditary disease caused by reduced coagulation factor activity. Hemophilia A (HA) is caused by a deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII), and hemophilia B (HB) by factor IX (FIX) deficiency. Hemophilia is uncommon; the morbidity of HA is one in five thousand, and HB morbidity is one in thirty thousand. Both HA and HB follow X-linked recessive inheritance, 50% of males born to hemophilia carriers are affected. Hemophilia causes severe bleeding in newborns during the perinatal period, and excessive postpartum hemorrhages (PPH) in carriers.\n\n【2】In hemophilia cases, carrier diagnosis, sex determination of infants, and selection of delivery mode are critical factors. The British guidelines for perinatal management of hemophilia  recommend avoiding vacuum extraction and forceps in delivery to prevent neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) . The guidelines do not provide whether vaginal delivery (VD) or cesarean section (CS) is preferred. Upon delivery cord blood samples should be taken to measure clotting factor levels and the diagnosis of hemophilia . Excessive bleeding necessitating administration of coagulation factors should be anticipated, and hemophilia-related deliveries require planning. Induction of labor (IOL) is often selected to assist in coordinating the obstetrics and neonatal staff.\n\n【3】Based on data from deliveries of hemophilia carriers at our hospital, we clarified the problems of perinatal management retrospectively, and evaluated the appropriate mode of delivery.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Thirteen carriers of hemophilia, registered at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, who had obstetric care at this hospital between 2005 and 2018 were investigated.\n\n【6】Patients were classified as either obligate or possible carriers. Obligate carriers were defined as all daughters of a father with hemophilia, mothers with one son with hemophilia and who have at least one other family member with hemophilia, or mothers with two or more sons with hemophilia. Possible carriers were defined as all daughters of a carrier, mothers with one son with hemophilia but who do not have any other family members with hemophilia, sisters, mothers, maternal grandmothers, aunts, nieces, and female cousins of carriers .\n\n【7】Fetal sexing was performed by ultrasound (US) examination. Planned VD cases were performed by IOL before natural labor pain, employing cervical balloon dilatation and uterotonic medications (oxytocin, prostaglandin E2).\n\n【8】We defined neonatal bleeding as that occurring within 28 days after birth except for subcutaneous hemorrhage. We also investigated PPH and defined it as more than 500 mL bleeding in VD cases or more than 1,000 mL in CS cases within 24 h after parturition.\n\n【9】The mothers’ data of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and coagulation factor activity were collected and adopted at the 34th - 36th weeks of pregnancy. The cord blood samples were taken to measure clotting factor levels and APTT.\n\n【10】Among the 13 cases, 10 were carriers of HA (76.9%), and three were carriers of HB (23.1%). There were four obligate carriers of HA (30.8%), six possible carriers of HA (46.1%), and three possible carriers of HB (23.1%). There was no sporadic case. All infants were correctly identified as male pre-delivery by US scan.\n\n【11】VD was performed in 10 cases (76.9%) and CS in three cases (23.1%). One VD case was breech presentation, all others were cephalic deliveries. All CS were planned to avoid neonatal ICH, and no delivery was performed during labor. No instrumental delivery was performed. Nine cases of the 10 VD cases (90%) included IOL .\n\n【12】Two cases had PPH (15.3%). Both of them were VD but needed no treatment for bleeding . Five neonates were diagnosed with hemophilia (38.5%). Two neonates exhibited ICH (15.4%). Both cases were born by IOL.\n\n【13】The first ICH case was scheduled for elective CS because of a pelvic presentation. However, the mother experienced a premature rupture of the membrane (PROM) and had strongly requested VD, which was performed by IOL with oxytocin. The male infant’s APTT was less than 100 s and his FVIII activity was less than 1%. HA was accordingly diagnosed. The infant’s color appeared pale and his hematocrit decreased at 7 days of age. We diagnosed ICH by head computerized tomography. In the second ICH case IOL with PGE2 and oxytocin required 2 days. The male infant had apnea at 4 days of age. HA and ICH were diagnosed similarly. Both cases had severe neurological sequelae.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Hemophilia is a risk for severe bleeding in newborns during the perinatal period. Critically, the mortality of ICH is high, as is the morbidity of long-term sequelae . Carrier diagnosis, sex determination of infants, and selection of delivery mode are important. Less invasive delivery modes should be selected and instrumental delivery such as the use of suction and forceps should be avoided . However, it is not clear whether VD or CS is preferred. Some papers report that normal VD is safe , while others propose CS for hemophilia carriers . The optimal mode of delivery is open to some debate. One report suggests no significant difference in the risk of ICH in newborns between planned VD and planned CS among carriers of hemophilia , but no study evaluates the presence or absence of IOL, as far as we know.\n\n【16】In our study, two out of the five hemophilia male infants experienced ICH complications (40%), and both were delivered by IOL. The risk of neonatal ICH of hemophilia is high (3.5-4%), compared to full-term healthy neonates (0.04%) . The morbidity due to ICH in our study was much higher, and we suspect that the cause was IOL. The reason that we chose IOL for hemophilia carriers was to prepare for PPH and fetal complications. However, IOL tends to have a longer delivery time. One report describes the active phase of labor as longer when induced compared to spontaneous labors in nulliparous women . IOL is also likely to induce a mechanical delivery and an emergency CS and induced nulliparous pregnancy may also have an increased risk of PPH and CS . Therefore, we recommend not to choose IOL as the mode of delivery for hemophilia carriers, especially among nulliparous women.\n\n【17】In the first case of fetal ICH was performed IOL because the mother expected to have VD, though selective CS had been recommended due to a breech presentation. Infants delivered in vaginal breech had 6.7 times higher odds of ICH . If they have hemophilia, further morbidity can be expected. In the second case IOL preceded VD without invasive treatment but required two days. Some papers report that IOL by oxytocin leads to oligodendrocyte cell death in neonatal mouse brain and anoxia in neonatal rat one . One study observed that IOL at term was associated with cerebral palsy and speculated that one of the causes was a decrease in oxygen supply due to excessive uterine contraction . Encephalopathy and hypoxic encephalopathy caused by IOL may indirectly induce ICH. We suspect the prolonged delivery led to ICH. We suggest that spontaneous VD or elective CS were appropriate for a delivery in hemophilia. Even in spontaneous VD cases, switching to emergency CS must be judged early in order to avoid prolonged deliveries.\n\n【18】The mode of delivery in hemophilia carriers should be scheduled for early diagnosis of bleeding after the child is born, and medicating blood coagulation factor preparations if necessary. No serious PPH that required treatment occurred including both VD and CS cases in our study. One study observed that selective CS had less incidence of ICH than natural delivery . In order to avoid complications in infants, the number of cases that choose selective CS is increasing. Therefore, for hemophiliac neonates, we suggest that cesarean delivery is preferred to prevent ICH. If a mother wishes a VD, we recommend spontaneous delivery without the induction of labor.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】We looked at thirteen deliveries of hemophilia carriers at our hospital from 2005 to 2018. Of the five male neonates diagnosed with hemophilia, two suffered complications of ICH (40%). Both were delivered by induced labor. These data indicate that IOL may provoke ICH in infants with hemophilia. We suggest that IOL is not preferable for pregnant women who are hemophilia carriers to avoid neonatal ICH. According to the literature and our data, selective CS or VD without IOL is safer delivery mode for newborn infants affected with hemophilia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Apparent supportive relationships can also have a negative effect. When a patient cannot provide informed consent, the involvement of support person(s), particularly the surrogate decision-maker, becomes critical. At times, surrogates may not protect the patient’s autonomy when making medical decisions due to various reasons . The situation is even more complex when the surrogate has priorities other than the best outcome for the patient. When a patient’s longitudinal course appears atypical, factitious disorder (FD) and factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In FDIA, caregivers fabricate or induce signs and symptoms in a dependent person, meeting their own psychological needs through the attention from medical personnel caring for their dependent, most of whom are children but rarely, can be compromised adults  like Mr. A.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Mr. A was a manual worker in his 50s at the time of his accident. His long-time common-law partner was Ms. B, also in her 50s. Neither of them had children. There was no psychiatric history prior to his head injury, which resulted in a left subdural hematoma. After his 7-month admission to an acute facility, Mr. A lived in a series of personal care homes. His challenges included cognitive impairment, mood lability, disinhibition, perseveration and aggression. Eventually, after a psychiatry unit admission lasting several months, he was placed in long-term care.\n\n【4】As Mr. A’s guardian, Ms. B met with Dr. C during the initial consultation at the long-term care facility. Mr. A had just started treatment with carbamazepine. Ms. B insisted that carbamazepine should be discontinued if she was not satisfied within 6 weeks. Since the serum level of carbamazepine was subtherapeutic, an increase in the dose was suggested in two increments, testing the level 1 month afterwards. Ms. B demanded the second increment take place only after the level was obtained. Paradoxically, she also challenged the use of carbamazepine level in clinical decision-making. During this meeting, Ms. B sat unnecessarily close to Dr. C. She was confrontational. Toward the psychiatry resident, she remarked, “So, you’re tagging along?” Alternatively, when her requests were accommodated, she became over-familiar. Thereafter, Ms. B frequently requested meeting with Dr. C and regularly questioned the level of carbamazepine.\n\n【5】Three months later, Ms. B requested replacing as needed haloperidol with lorazepam. Dr. C explained that benzodiazepines can disinhibit head-injured adults. Ms. B persisted and ultimately, Dr. C agreed to a 2-week trial, hoping to gain Ms. B’s trust. In the next 3 days, Mr. A’s outbursts soared. Ms. B consented to stopping lorazepam. Ten days later, Ms. B demanded a retrial, which Dr. C declined. Dr. C expressed concerns about Ms. B’s behaviour to the unit manager, who responded that Ms. B had Mr. A’s “best interest at heart”.\n\n【6】Despite steady increments, carbamazepine remained subtherapeutic, even with the auto-induction properties of carbamazepine taken into consideration. Ms. B wanted it discontinued because she claimed carbamazepine caused Mr. A’s pain, which never resulted in behaviour observable to the staff.\n\n【7】Ms. B had idiosyncratic beliefs about various metabolic issues. For example, she insisted that Mr. A consume eight to 10 glasses of water around each meal to treat dehydration, despite the lack of clinical evidence of dehydration in Mr. A. In fact, his blood tests showed hyponatremia (that was later concluded to be the consequence of excessive water intake). She also demanded Dr. C to amend entries in Mr. A’s chart that related to her requests of medications for him. After further incidents at the long-term care facility, Dr. C documented that Ms. B’s interference could “seriously impact clinical decisions”. This was noted by Ms. B during her weekly review of Mr. A’s chart. She immediately terminated Dr. C. The unit manager asked Dr. C to “try working with Ms. B.” Unbeknown to Dr. C, another unit manager had written to Ms. B regarding boundary issues with other residents at the facility. Management then sought legal counsel, who informed Ms. B of the need to follow medical recommendations. Concerns about her capacity to be Mr. A’s guardian were dismissed by management. Ms. B disregarded the lawyer’s letter and started to openly interfere with the administration of carbamazepine. She drew staff into protracted and counterproductive conversations. Ultimately, Dr. C contacted the Canadian Medical Protection Association. The medical officer of the association suggested that the health team had the duty to bring the matter to the attention of the public trustee. Subsequently, management became more receptive. The team decided to challenge Mr. B’s status as the guardian. Mr. A’s hospital charts were reviewed in preparation of the affidavit. In addition to a similar pattern of interference from Ms. B in Mr. A’s previous hospitalization, the review also uncovered a documented incident of her administering an unknown substance to Mr. A.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Establishing the diagnosis of FDIA is difficult. Perpetrators conceal their activities. Once these activities are uncovered, it is seldom easy to ascertain intentions. In this case, Mr. A had a clearly established diagnosis of acquired brain injury, with cognitive impairment and behavioural disturbance. It was difficult to see which part of Mr. A’s behavioural symptoms was due to his head injury and which were the consequences of Ms. B’s withholding his medications, her exaggeration or misreporting, his hyponatremia due to the polydipsia forced by Ms. B, and even her covert administration of unknown substances. Ms. B’s presentation was dominated by her exaggerated concerns and boundary issues. The deceptive component, essential for the diagnosis of FDIA, was subtle. The possibility that she had been knowingly withholding Mr. A’s carbamazepine for months, while constantly questioning its level, only surfaced after she openly refused to let Mr. A take the medication. Other examples of deception involved more fabrication than induction. Her excessive demand of attention from medical staff and her insatiable need to be involved in medical minutia are commonly observed in FD and FDIA.\n\n【10】Rigour is critical in distinguishing intentional interference of a caregiver from alternative explanations. Once diagnosed, the treatment team initiates dialogue with the perpetrator, who often disengages him- or herself and the victim from the institution, and begins dealing with new and unsuspecting care providers, similar to cases of factitious disorder imposed on self . Therefore, when the team decided to challenge Ms. B’s guardian status, restrictions were immediately placed on her visitations, even before the court application was filed. In contrast to her usual demand to meet with team members, Ms. B refused to attend the meeting scheduled by the team to discuss her guardian status, once she realized that legal counsel would be present.\n\n【11】Aside from Ms. B’s unhelpful behaviour, management’s approach perpetuated the situation. It is disconcerting for healthcare providers to see patients’ family as ill-willed. It was counterintuitive to view Mr. A, a tall and muscular male aggressor, as a victim. Contemporaneously, staff had been under stress because of other residents who were lodging unfounded complaints. This further promoted management’s conflict avoidance. Addressing the interference of Ms. B required a concerted approach from the team. In this case, simply informing the management about FDIA and the potential outcome did not control the splitting, as they had been driven by fear of litigation. Strategically, consultation with the medical protection association provided the necessary medicolegal base for management to confront Ms. B. No less importantly, the medical protection association also counselled Dr. C on the potential of legal action from Ms. B against Dr. C and offered further support in the future.\n\n【12】Suspension of Ms. B’s guardian status was granted by the public trustee. Restrictions to Ms. B’s visitations were maintained, specifically to stop the interference around medications and excessive water consumption. With the lack of willing family members to assume the surrogacy role, medical decisions were to be made by agreement between two physicians, under the Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act. Ms. B’s interactions with other residents were monitored as well. Improvement of Mr. A’s mental state soon followed. Verbal aggression, physical aggression, and perseverations decreased by 75%. Staff ensured his compliance and his carbamazepine level became therapeutic. His hyponatremia normalized. Notwithstanding, Ms. B still triangulated a family physician from outside the facility into challenging Mr. A’s fluid requirements. Notably, the family physician displayed characteristics of the likely physician in the patient-perpetrator-physician triad in Squires’s review . He stated that, in his experience with institutions, “things are not always done properly”. He favored other explanations for Mr. A’s hyponatremia. He acknowledged having 3-h counseling sessions with Ms. B. Later, Ms. B reported that Mr. A had flank pain due to dehydration. The concern was investigated and proven unfound.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】FDIA can have profound impact on the presentation and management of adult patients who are cognitive impaired or otherwise incapable of advocating for themselves. When the clinical presentation is atypical, FDIA should be considered in the differential diagnoses. Familiarity with FDIA, careful documentation not only of the patient’s state but also the behaviour of support persons, and comprehensive chart reviews can help establish the diagnosis. Physician and systems factors can exacerbate or mitigate the impact of FDIA. Protecting the interests of the compromised patient is essential, and may require challenging the established surrogacy status and minimizing the potential of elopement or sabotage. Medicolegal counsel is invaluable. Gains can be achieved and sustained with appropriate limit-setting.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) have traditionally been seen in older populations and are associated with significant tobacco and alcohol consumption.\n\n【2】Recent studies have shown what has been described as an epidemic of HPV oropharyngeal cancers in younger populations . HPV SCCs are estimated to make up around 70-80% of all oropharyngeal cancers . We are seeing a new subset of patients presenting in their thirties and forties with well-advanced head and neck tumors rarely seen in this population before. We present here the first case of HPV oropharyngeal SCC arising in a pregnant woman.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 30-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a rapidly increasing, large right-sided neck lump. She was febrile with a level II neck mass, erythematous and warm to touch. She had trismus with an otherwise patent airway. Clinically the oropharynx was unremarkable. She was a non-smoker and did not drink alcohol. There was no other significant medical history.\n\n【5】Computed tomography (CT)  showed large lobulated, cystic appearing, right neck lymphadenopathy with low Hounsfield unit (HU) of 30 - 35; also noted was right tonsillar enlargement without any imaging evidence of tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. The appearance was atypical for infection as there was no fat stranding or inflammatory change seen in the right neck in spite of large size of the nodes. She underwent incision and drainage under otolaryngology and pus samples grew Streptococcus pneumonia . She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and improved clinically.\n\n【6】Twelve months later she presented with a neck mass at the same location on the right neck. This had increased in size over a 2-week period and there was no improvement on oral antibiotics. She was 31 + 1 pregnant at the time (G3P1T1) and her pregnancy to date had been uncomplicated. She was referred to otolaryngology.\n\n【7】Clinically she was afebrile with large level II/III mass neither fluctuant nor erythematous. The airway was uncompromised. On examination, the right tonsil was enlarged without inflammation or exudate. Nasal endoscopy and blood inflammatory markers were normal. Serology indicated previous Epstein-Barr virus infection. Ultrasound showed no drainable collection and core biopsy of the mass revealed a poorly differentiated SCC of basaloid variant. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  found solid right neck lymphadenopathy, predominantly in levels II, III and V with small necrotic areas. A right oropharyngeal mass suggested a tonsillar primary. The imaging was performed without gadolinium because of patient’s pregnant status.\n\n【8】At 33 weeks into her pregnancy, the patient underwent tonsillectomy and panendoscopy. Histology of the right tonsil confirmed SCC of basaloid variant, with immunoperoxidase staining positive for HPV p-16, giving the diagnosis of T1N2b SCC right tonsil, HPV p-16 positive.\n\n【9】In consultation with obstetrics, the decision was made to induce labor at 34 weeks so that full staging CT and positron emission tomography (PET) workup could be completed and chemoradiotherapy could be commenced as a priority.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HPV oropharyngeal SCCs (OPSCCs) arise from chronic HPV infection of the oral cavity, the most prevalent strain being p-16. The primary tumor is of the palatine tonsils or base of tongue and disease is linked to risky sexual activity and cigarette use . Infection is thought to occur via local transmission of the HPV virus.\n\n【12】HPV OPSCCs commonly present as locally advanced disease with secondary lymph node metastases and a small or inconspicuous primary (T1-2, N2-3). Lymph nodes are often large and cystic in nature . On MRI, HPV positive nodes are large, cystic and demonstrate high T2 signal with a well-defined hypointense rim. On post contrast images, they usually demonstrate smooth rim enhancement and have low HU like our patient had an HU of 31. p-16 positive neck lymphadenopathy is indistinguishable from lymphoma or suppurative lymphadenitis on clinical grounds alone. Treating clinicians must be aware of this increasing new trend to avoid delay in the diagnosis. HPV OPSCC has a cure rate of > 90% if picked up early . Initial clinical presentation and CT of our patient raises the possibility that the first episode may have been a cystic p-16 positive lymphadenopathy with tonsillar primary. Young age and possible secondary infection complicated things further, hence delaying the diagnosis.\n\n【13】Whilst women are less commonly affected by oral HPV than men (1:3), it is important to recognize that HPV OPSCC is arising in women of childbearing age. As prevalence continues to increase, with it estimated to overtake that of cervical cancer by 2020 , we will inevitably be seeing more patients presenting during pregnancy. This will bring on new challenges in directing investigation and treatment when weighing up risks to the mother and baby. For this reason, we feel there is a need for defined management of HPV OPSCC during pregnancy.\n\n【14】In pregnant patients, staging workup involving CT should be avoided and PET is contraindicated. Similarly MRI can be performed as the only relatively safe modality but gadolinium is avoided; this makes the study suboptimal for assessment of nodes. Safety of MRI in first trimester is still questionable .\n\n【15】Chemotherapy agents commonly used with proven efficacy in HPV OPSCC include cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and doxetaxal. Such regimes combining chemoradiotherapy are associated with significant toxicity  and are detrimental to the fetus. Radiation should not be given during any stage of pregnancy .\n\n【16】Current guidelines exist for management of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and breast, cervical and ovarian cancers during pregnancy. The mainstay of therapy is balancing the health of the mother and the fetus. We expect guidelines for treatment of pregnant women with HPV OPSCC would follow a similar principal.\n\n【17】With the introduction of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the National Immunization Program in Australia in 2006 for females, and most recently adolescent males in July 2012, we hope to see a decrease in HPV related OPSCC. Its efficacy against oropharyngeal disease, however, is yet to be established.\n\n【18】As the prevalence of head and neck HPV SCC continues to rise, we are likely to see more young women presenting during pregnancy. This poses a diagnostic and management challenge. p-16 positive neck lymphadenopathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass in a young patient.\n\n【19】This case also illustrates the need for approved management guidelines in such a challenging clinical scenario.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b1e125c6-205b-4d76-a8ff-dbe8362e897d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】We present the only case report in which an abdominal aortic endograft has been infected with Clostridium septicum in the presence of documented myelodysplastic syndrome. Clostridium septicum has been associated with a variety of malignancies, particularly gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancies; however, only 8% of C. septicum infections are vascular-related. To our knowledge, there are only 31 reported cases of C. septicum causing aortic infection in the English literature, and this case represents the third report of post-endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) stent graft infection with C. septicum .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 81-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with a 2-h presentation of sudden onset of severe bilateral lower leg, back, and localized periumbilical abdominal pain. She previously underwent an infrarenal EVAR with bilateral iliac artery limb extension as well as pacemaker insertion approximately 1.5 years prior. Past medical history consisted of myelodysplastic syndrome with chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count normally around 40,000), COPD with home oxygen usage, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, endocarditis, and history of myocardial infarction.\n\n【4】On admission, vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 82/50, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 36 °C, and pulse oximetry of 95% on 3 L nasal cannula. Physical examination revealed the patient to be in moderate shortness of breath at rest. She appeared pale and restless, yet she was able to give an adequate history. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She had palpable pulses distally and no cyanosis or edema in her lower extremities.\n\n【5】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, and initial treatment consisted of fluid resuscitation, morphine, and piperacillin-tazobactam. After 2 L of normal saline (NS), she remained hypotensive. Dopamine infusion was then started at 5 mcg/kg/min. The patient appeared to have decreased respiratory effort and became more lethargic. Endotracheal intubation was performed and a subclavian central venous catheter was inserted. Dopamine infusion was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min, and a third liter of NS was given.\n\n【6】Laboratory data revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 20,100 with 80% neutrophils and 3% bands. Hemoglobin measured 10.8 g/dL, serum lactate was 7.9, and the platelet count was 5,000. A complete metabolic panel, amylase, lipase, cardiac enzymes, and a urine analysis were all within normal limits.\n\n【7】A computed tomographic (CT) angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed an enlarging saccular infrarenal native aneurysm sac of 6.1 x 5.6 cm compared to a previous scan 2 months prior, which measured 5.8 x 5.3 cm. A type I endoleak appeared to arise from the left limb of the endograft  where the native aorta was noted to be emphysematous at the anterior margin of the native capsule , consistent with clostridial infection.\n\n【8】Immediately after the CT scan was completed, the vascular surgery team was notified and the patient was taken to the operating room. The retroperitoneum was explored through an anterior midline incision. There was no visible purulence, hematoma or active bleeding surrounding the native aneurysm; however, the tissues were extremely hyperemic and weak. The native aneurysm did appear to have contained the small leak as seen on the CT scan. The endograft was explanted. A 16 mm Dacron graft was cut to appropriate size and sutured end-to-end from the infrarenal aorta to the origin of the common iliac arteries. The patient was given 4 units of blood, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 18 units of platelets intraoperatively.\n\n【9】The operation was completed without complication and the patient was then transferred to the ICU in severe septic shock. Blood and tissue cultures were positive for C. septicum . The patient was seen by infectious disease immediately after her surgery, and clindamycin and metronidazole therapies were also instituted. Despite all resuscitative efforts, the patient’s postoperative course was complicated by systemic multiple organ failure and she expired 36 h after surgery.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】C. septicum is a Gram-positive, highly motile bacillus that rarely causes bacteremia, and because of their fastidious nature, these organisms are often difficult to isolate from infected sites . The mortality rate of C. septicum bacteremia is between 33 and 64%, whereas the mortality rate associated with tissue infection is approximately 70-100% . C. septicum is believed to cause less than 1.3% of all clostridial infections . To our knowledge, only 31 reported cases of C. septicum causing aortic infection exist in the English literature  and of those, only four cases report a concomitant myelodysplastic syndrome and a C. septicum bloodstream-related infection , and none of these patients had a documented aortitis.\n\n【12】Hermsen et al extensively researched PubMed in 2008  ADDIN EN.CITE ADDIN EN.CITE.DATA evaluating infectious phenotypes and survival among 231 patients with C. septicum and found that the vascular phenotype occurred in only 8% of the patients with a 68% survival rate. Their extensive review also noted that patients with a C. septicum vascular infection had an 80% survival rate with surgery compared to 25% survival rate with without surgery, a statistically significant finding. Of the seven anatomically based phenotypes, the most common was non-traumatic infection of the skin and soft tissues (52%), secondly, bacteremia (23%), and the remaining were vascular, intraperitoneal, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, and head and neck infections. Of note, although they discovered diabetes to be a risk factor for development of a skin and soft tissue C. septicum infection, they did not note a difference in survival between diabetics and non-diabetics.\n\n【13】C. septicum has been associated with a variety of malignancies, particularly gastrointestinal or hematologic malignancies . Hermsen et al found that C. septicum infection occurs in only 20% of patients without known or occult malignancies. Despite a widely held belief that C. septicum is part of normal gastrointestinal flora, a previous study which examined the stool of healthy individuals only isolated C. septicum in one individual . Nonetheless, when isolated in a patient with systemic illness, it generally has been known to cause rapid progressive soft tissue infection and myonecrosis .\n\n【14】The pathophysiology of C. septicum to proliferate in ill patients is not entirely clear. The mechanism of pathogen propagation has been shown in tissues with low pH and oxygen levels . Clostridial spores arise with arterial injury and flourish in tissues associated with necrosis, ischemia, anoxia, and increased lactic acid levels . A fairly accepted postulation that explains the association of C. septicum with gastrointestinal malignancies has to due with the disruption of the mucosal surface, which may serve as a portal for clostridial organisms to enter the bloodstream and seed at atherosclerotic junctures . Furthermore, hematologic diseases compromise the immune system and may cause thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, thus altering the endothelial tissues, preventing barrier protection . Hence, in our case, the patient was not only immunocompromised but she also had previous tissue disruption from her EVAR surgery, which we believe made her more susceptible to the portal entry of anaerobic organisms. To note, this case is only the third report of post-EVAR stent graft infection involving C. septicum . The rate of infection with EVAR is unknown. Review of the literature demonstrates an overall incidence of prosthetic aortic graft infection to be approximately 0.43-1.17% , thus leaving the rate of EVAR infection to be even less.\n\n【15】Gas formation surrounding the aorta or peripheral arteries is a typical presentation of clostridial infection and emergent surgical treatment is the current consensus to achieve optimal results . Sailors et al found that 7 out of 8 patients with intramural gas involving the arterial wall died as a result of arterial C. septicum infection, which is a sign of poor prognosis. Thus, a lack of emergent and direct adequate therapy against these organisms is more likely to result in death.\n\n【16】Surgical treatment options include debridement of the infected arterial segments and extra-anatomic revascularization with an axillary bifemoral bypass versus in situ graft replacement. We chose a midline abdominal approach to explore the aneurysm sac and to evaluate for possible leak or rupture, followed by replacement of the endograft with an in situ Dacron tube graft. In support of undergoing surgery, Seder et al revealed a 75% 6-month survival rate in patients treated with in situ grafting (Dacron, polyethylene terephtahalte, or polytetrafluoroethylene) after C. septicum aortic infection, and a 100% mortality within 6 months if surgical treatment was not instituted as part of the therapy.\n\n【17】It has been documented that once C. septicum is identified in arteriosclerotic lesions, it cannot be eradicated with antibiotic therapy alone . However, antibiotics should be administered immediately, and this has shown to consistently improve survival . Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered. The most effective are clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, a combination of penicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, and the carbapenems . In our case, we used a combination of clindamycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam, which were ideal for this patient despite her outcome. If she had lived, life-long antibiotic therapy would have been considered.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Presumptive identification of C. septicum should be based on awareness of periaortic gas seen on the preoperative CT scan, Gram stain during surgery, and awareness of C. septicum as a paraneoplastic syndrome. As a differential diagnosis, the definitive therapy should be immediate antibiotics and surgery. Furthermore, if periaortic gas is present, then the disease is far advanced and the prognosis is poor regardless of treatment.\n\n【20】Due to the low number of reported cases and limited information regarding myelodysplastic syndrome and C. septicum , meaningful comparisons are not possible. However, this case report reaffirms the relationship of C. septicum infection with active immunosuppression and is only the third case report of post-EVAR stent graft infection with C. septicum .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9a23d9a9-494f-4b20-9d77-1bbb8b0aac28", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】We report about a complication similar to a toxic retinopathy in a case. The operation is implantation of seconder scleral-fixed intraocular lens. Obstruction of central retinal artery, occlusion of central retinal vein, peripapiller and macular hemorrhage and optic atrophy occurred right after the operation. After 6 months, haze in the upper side of the cornea occurred .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient is a 70-year-old man. He does not have any disease such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Two years ago the patient had an accident by cow horn backlash and underwent limbocorneal suturation and anterior vitrectomy in the primer surgery and the surgery resulted in aphakia. The eye was not vitrectomised but the patient lost a large amount of vitreus during perforation. Fundoscopic examination showed normal retina and pre-operative visual acuity of the patient in the operated eye with pinholl was 0.6.\n\n【4】The anesthesia was applied topically with subtenon enjection and intracameral plain lidocaine was given towards the end of surgery. Two percent sodium hyaluronate was used as viscoelastic and sefuroksim aksetil was injected to anterior chamber for endophthalmitis prophylaxis. Intraocular pressure rose up to about 50 mmHg, 8 hours after operation antiglaucomatous drugs were given. Corneal edema was cleared in two weeks but the patient complained from blindness and defined only light perception. Central retinal artery obstruction, central retinal vein occlusion, peripapiller and macular hemorrhage and optic atrophy were observed in the fundus examination. This complication was not an intraocular infection because the media was clear and there was not redness or pain. After 6 months, corneal haze, especially on the upper side, occurred and the retina has become invisible. Thus, further examination such as fluorescein angiography failed due to corneal haze . This complication is similar to hemorrhagic infarction of the retina.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The cause of this complication may be viscoelastic agents, due to the injection of lidocaine into the anterior chamber or cefuroxime. The most important postoperative complication of viscoelastic agents is elevation of intraocular pressure. Increase in intraocular pressure is dose-related and of a transient nature, generally within the first 6 - 24 hours after surgery and typically resolved within 72 hours. Increased intraocular pressure may cause central retinal vein occlusion or central retinal artery obstruction . But the complication occurring in this patient was more serious than complications due to elevated intraocular pressure.\n\n【7】One of the other suspected substances is lidocaine. Hoffman and Fine reported transient amaurosis cases due to intracameral lidocaine . Lincoff H and others reported retinal toxicity after injection of lidocain intraocularly . Liang C reported electroretinogram changes in the rabbit retina but he did not observe any histologic abnormalities after injection of lidocaine hydrochloride intravitreally . All the reported toxicities related to lidocaine do not cause permanent blindness whereas retinal toxicity in this case caused permanent blindness.\n\n【8】The most suspected substance is cefuroxime but there was not major evidence in the literature to prove so. Delyfer MN noted intracameral injection of high doses induced anterior and posterior inflammation . Conversely, Sakarya Y and Sakarya R reported inadvertent intracameral (3 mg in 0.1 ml) cefuroxime injection did not cause any detectable adverse effect on ocular tissues .\n\n【9】Research for possible side effects of intracameral lidocaine, viscoelastic agents and intracameral cefuroxime were made in Medline and a few side effects were found. But these complications are not similar by the complication that we reported. Two percent sodium hyaluronate, intracameral lidocaine and cefuroxime have been used for many years and are unlikely to be the cause of the findings. The retinal hemorrages may be related to a vascular event or other pathology anytime from surgery to two weeks post-op, but this patient complained of blindness immediately after surgery and a rapidly atrophy of optic disc is not a usual presentation of vascular event. Retinal hemorrhage in this patient confined in the central, but central retinal vein, occlusion makes widespread retinal hemorrhage and visual deterioration at the level of light perception is required a much more intense bleeding.\n\n【10】We cannot find any related results between the above-mentioned substance and the complication, however and without any doubt it developed as a whole as a result of the surgery. Overall it is clear this complication is a toxic retinopathy and a result of sequence of events resulted by hemorrhagic retinal infarct. The development of corneal haze after hemorrhagic retinal infarct reinforces the idea that these complications are as result of toxicity. We think this toxicity was caused from an ingredient of the drugs or using of excess dose than the recommended dose of any drug during the operation accidentally. After all, a case which has resulted to such a complication in a surgery has never been reported previously, thus we wanted to point it out.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Gross in 1939 . Left posterolateral thoracotomy is the standard surgical approach in PDA cases for decades after Dr. Gross. Median sternotomy was also administered by a smaller group of surgeons. Over the past several years treatment of PDA considerably evolved through less invasive techniques such as percutaneous transcatheter coil occlusion, video-assisted thoracoscopic occlusion (VATS) and non-surgical indometasin treatments.\n\n【2】Despite the modern days tendency of less invasive and smaller incision therapeutic options, morphology and location of PDA, clinical situation with age and size of the patient and the experience of a clinic determine the technique of choice.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 4 year young female patient administered to the pediatric department with a history of dyspnea episodes and frequent attacks of pneumonia. Initial physical examination and trans-thoracic echocardiography demonstrated a PDA as typically located between left pulmonary artery and aorta. Following the routine clinical evaluation, hematological tests and chest roentgenogram were performed. Attempting pediatrist decided to occlude PDA percutaneously by a coil. Catheterization initiated via artery and venous access with a pediatric anesthesiologist providing sedation. A 4F sheath was placed into the femoral artery and a 5F sheath into the femoral vein. Adequate heparin and cefazoline antibiotic prophylaxis were given as the case progresses. Estimation of PDA diameter was obtained by angiography which demonstrated a flow pattern in through the PDA and a moderate diameter less than 2 mm . A 5F venous sheath was used in order to deliver the coil and its adjacent guide wire to aortic side. Inadaptability and incompatibility of diameter differences between the sheath and coil adjacent resulted with separation of the coil in femoral vein side. Disconnected part of the coil was observed stable in the femoral vein sheath. At that phase the catheterization was ended and the child referred for surgery as emergency.\n\n【5】On the operating table, physical examination presented an appearance of respiratory distress with cyanotic limbs. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 180 per minute. Routine monitoring included transcutaneous oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure, and electrocardiogram. Preoperative radiological scopy to determine the definitive localization demonstrated that the coil migrated from iliac vein to right ventricle during short transport time . Under general anesthesia, a median sternotomy was initially performed. Heparin injection with 350 units/kg to reach the activated clotted time for over 400 seconds. Following pericardiectomy, aorto-bicaval cannulation was performed within 28 °C of body core temperature. Cross clamp was applied to both aorta and pulmonary artery to prevent the continuation of the coil migration more distally through the lungs. Cardiopulmonary bypass was accomplished with centrifugal pump and membrane oxygenator. For myocardial protection, we used three steps of cardioplegia: 500 mL of normothermic blood cardioplegia, cold cardioplegia in 10 mL/kg in 40 mmHg pressure. Neither additive cardioplegia doses were necessary due to the short period of cardiac arrest. After securing the caval blood flow with tightened snears over cannulas, right atriotomy performed. Coil was observed between the tricuspid valve structures and reaching into the right ventricle with its free end. Coil removed gently to avoid any harm on tricuspid valve . Right atriotomy closed and cardiopulmonary bypass ended. Total cardiopulmonary time was 41 minutes and total cross clamp time was 17 minutes. Heparin antagonization maintained by protamine sulfate. Existing PDA between left pulmonary artery and aorta occluded with transfixion sutures with clear visualization. An epicardial pace-maker was replaced. Following the homeostasis maneuvers, surgical drains replaced and sternum closed. Patient transported to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit. The intubation time was 180 minutes and total drainage volume was 210 milliliters. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms approved the closure of PDA. The child was discharged at the postoperative day of 8, uneventfully.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Fetal circulation is maintained by ductus arteriosus allowing most of the blood from the right ventricle to aorta in circumstances of by-passing the immature pulmonary bed. As defined clearly, ductus arteriosus is closed spontaneously by multi-factorial conditions at the early postpartum period in the first 15 hours functionally.\n\n【8】Persistent patency of ductus arteriosus, defined as PDA, is a relatively common congenital cardiac abnormality. Overall incidence differs between 0.02% and 0.006% of live births. High altitude births, perinatal asphyxia, lower birth weights, and premature births may elevate the risk of PDA. Clinical presentation differs on age and symptoms depending on the size and natural of the PDA. A left to right flow pattern usually causes with overload of pulmonary vascular resistance. Uncommonly, an adult may present with a murmur which is caused by a small and tolerated PDA.\n\n【9】Morphologically, PDA is mostly located between the left pulmonary artery and proximal part of the descending aorta. Some rare cases may present between the right pulmonary artery and main pulmonary artery. Atypical localizations tend to be concordant to other cardiac and other defects. Mortality rates differ between 0.5% to 4% depending on the severity of left to right shunt and age of the case . Different diagnoses may include sinus of valsalva aneurysm, aortopulmonary window, coronary artery fistula and atypical forms of Fallot’s Tetralogy.\n\n【10】Treatment of PDA starts with an administration of indometasin or ibuprofen at the early diagnoses . Treatment success of intravenous medications is questionable in some cases. Thus, over the last three decades several techniques of catheterization closure are described . Success rates are significantly higher for PDA within a diameter smaller than 2.5 mm. PDA equal or larger than 3 mm diameter is a subject of other occlusion techniques rather than catheterizations. These risks of catheterization may include embolization of occlusive device, recurrent PDA, central or peripheral arterial or venous vascular injury, stroke, mild to severe lower limb ischemia and deaths. Large ductus treatments include conventional left thoracotomy and VATS. Thoracotomy approach may result with surgical ligation or surgical ligation with division. This technique has a very low mortality and morbidity risk on experienced hands, and has achieved excellent results. VATS is a more difficult technique especially for cases with calcification, bigger ductus with a wider risk of hemorrhage and vascular injury . In the presence of a doubt on VATS or conventional posterolateral thoracotomy, a possibility for median sternotomy with or without cardiopulmonary bypass always remains as a last resort for a cardiovascular surgeon.\n\n【11】In our opinion, percutaneous coil occlusion techniques are cost-effective, safe, effective on recurrence rates and less traumatic for the patient. Small to moderate PDA within 1 to 2 mm diameters has a chance for percutaneous transcatheter coil occlusion. Larger PDA or insufficient PDA neck morphology requires a surgical approach for the best outcomes. Coil occlusions are also with certain rates of complications, as in our case. Thus, these techniques may only be wisely performed with a possibility of surgical support for complicated cases of emergency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The affected heart valves are thickened and retracted, resulting in valvular regurgitation, and less commonly, valvular stenosis. Left heart valve involvement is rare. Carcinoid tumors are uncommon slow-growing neuroendocrine malignant tumors, beginning in the gastrointestinal tract or bronchopulmonary system. Carcinoid syndrome refers to the development of vasomotor symptoms, such as flushing, diarrhea and bronchospasm in response to secretion of vasoactive hormones by a carcinoid tumor .\n\n【2】Echocardiography is used to screen for cardiac involvement in all patients with a carcinoid tumor or carcinoid syndrome. Dyspnea and fatigue highly suggest some degree of cardiac involvement, with levels of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) usually elevated (NT-proBNP > 260 pg/mL or > 30 pmol/L). The chest X-ray is typically normal, but findings may include cardiac enlargement (especially right-sided chambers) and pleural effusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used if the severity of valvular regurgitation is dubious .\n\n【3】Valve replacement surgery is recommended to be performed in patients with symptomatic and severe valvular dysfunction. Medical therapy is provided to patients scheduled for valve replacement (including somatostatin analogs such as octreotide) weeks before the surgery to control tumor related symptoms and to prevent carcinoid crisis. Valve replacement increases survival in patients with carcinoid heart disease. Patients are followed up every 3 to 6 months after valvular surgery with a clinical exam, laboratory tests and echocardiography .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 53-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 6 years ago, right after a carcinoid tumor was found while undergoing work up for symptoms of chronic diarrhea and persisted wheezing. The tumor originated from the appendix, and over the years, the disease progressed to a carcinoid tumor of the liver. At that time, the patient underwent liver embolization with postoperative chemotherapy. The disease was controlled with monthly lanreotide injections, until he developed symptoms of right heart failure 1 year ago, including ascites, peripheral edema and shortness of breath. Upon further evaluation, multiple metastases were found in an abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast (with additional images suggestive of severely dilated right ventricle) along with a new diagnosis of liver cirrhosis . Cardiac work up revealed new onset atrial fibrillation in a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and a 2D echocardiogram with evidence of severely dilated right ventricle and severe tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation . Due to the severity of carcinoid heart disease and profound symptoms, he was referred for evaluation to perform valvular replacement and Maze procedure. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, categorizing the patient as a low-risk for open-heart surgery.\n\n【6】During the surgical procedure, the epicardium and the right atrium were found to be enlarged and fibrotic, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves were sclerotic. The patient underwent a cardiopulmonary bypass with a Maze procedure, and left atrial appendix was excised. Pulmonary and tricuspid valves were replaced with a Biocor prosthesis #27 and #33, respectively. Finally, he was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated well-seated and functional valves . Valve remnants, both the pulmonic and tricuspid, were sent to pathology. After the procedure, the patient was started on octreotide infusion with close monitoring for the development of carcinoid crisis.\n\n【7】The final pathological findings included the following: pericardial fluid sac with proteinaceous material with an early organization and clusters of macrophages staining with CD68 by immunohistochemistry and mesothelialm without evidence of malignant cells; pulmonary valve with fibrosis and mild chronic inflammation (the fibrosis replaced the spongiosa layer of the semilunar valve leaflet), without evidence of giant cells or granulomata and no evidence of vegetations; left atrial appendage with findings of histologically normal myocardium.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】More than half of patients with carcinoid syndrome can have carcinoid heart disease, presenting with valvular involvement and symptoms of heart failure (mostly edema, ascites and shortness of breath) . Right-sided heart failure can be the initial presentation of carcinoid syndrome in up to 20% of patients. Carcinoid heart disease has characteristic plaque-like deposits of fibrous tissue, consisting of smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts, extracellular matrix and an overlying endothelial layer. These deposits are often found in the tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, cardiac chambers, pulmonary artery, vena cava and the coronary sinus . Fibrous reactions occur most often in the endocardium of the valvular cusps; nevertheless, it can also involve the sub-valvular apparatus and the papillary muscles. This reaction leads to valve stenosis or regurgitation.\n\n【10】Right-sided carcinoid heart disease, like that of our patient, is the most common type of heart carcinoid disease . Medical therapy is limited to symptom control and palliation. Valve replacement surgery is advised in patients with carcinoid heart disease and symptom-controlled carcinoid disease. Having surgery early in the onset of cardiac symptoms is preferable, as a delay can result in worsening of right-sided heart failure and increase the mortality risk during surgical valve replacement. Patients with progressive fatigue, worsening exercise capacity and declining right ventricle function, like in our patient, in addition to well-controlled metastatic disease, should be rapidly evaluated for valve surgery . Tricuspid valve replacement is the gold standard, without the need for long-term anticoagulation when bioprosthetic valves are chosen, but these valves are highly susceptible to premature degeneration. Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction may occur from thrombosis, carcinoid plaque deposition, or accelerated degeneration . Pulmonary valve replacement can also be performed due to the reduced risk of adverse right heart dilation after surgery. While most patients require replacement for right-sided valve involvement, concomitant left-sided carcinoid heart disease can sometimes lead to triple or even quadruple valve surgery . Patients with carcinoid heart disease often have advanced disease at the time of the diagnosis, leading to high overall mortality and poor long-term survival . Valve surgery for carcinoid heart disease should be considered for symptomatic patients with controlled metastatic carcinoid syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to achieve optimal management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "78812cdf-e297-4731-9164-1241af972e26", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Multiple intracranial lesions represent a diagnostic dilemma and commonly represent metastases, lymphoma, infections, vascular or demyelinating disease. Multicentric gliomas are uncommon lesions but important. The rate of true multicentricity in gliomas is defined as lesions with no gross or microscopic linkage and has been reported to be 2-10% based on necropsy studies . On CT scan, the incidence is reported to be 2.5% . We discuss a case of multicentric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and review the relevant literature. Multiple gliomas were first observed by Virchow in 1864 and Bradley in 1880  in their seminal paper published in 1962. The clinical presentation and imaging appearance of multicentric gliomas can mimic metastatic, encephalitis and other lesions. However, the treatment of these disease entities is considerably different . Therefore, it becomes imperative to determine the histology of one of the lesions in the presence of multiple lesions on imaging .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 58-year-old man presented with general tonic clonic seizures and cognitive impairment in the emergency department of our hospital. Patient had mild fever and headache for 2 days. On neurological examination at the time of admission, memory impairment was observed, and no other focal neurological deficits were noted. There was no past history of medicine intake, drug abuse and toxins exposure. He had no familiar or personal history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, or in particular, of epileptic disease. He was a doctor and he had always done an efficient and competent job. He does not smoke and he drinks alcohol only occasionally.\n\n【4】Electroencephalogram was unremarkable which showed a bilateral, symmetrical 10 Hz alpha rhythm with normal arrest reaction to eyes opening, and did not reveal any epileptic rhythms or figures.\n\n【5】The routine electrocardiogram and blood investigations (blood cells count and morphometry, plasmatic glucose level, serum electrolytes, coagulation, kidney and liver function indexes) did not show any significant abnormalities. Blood pressure was normal. Examination of CSF revealed white blood cell of 7/mm <sup>3 </sup> (0 - 5/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), protein level of 38 mg/dL (15 - 50 mg/dL) and glucose level of 71 mg/dL (45 - 80 mg/dL). Herpes simplex virus-polymerase chain reaction (HSV-PCR) assay in the CSF was negative.\n\n【6】MRI study revealed asymmetrical multifocal lesions in bilateral frontal lobes, cingulate gyrus and left insular cortex with gyral swelling and effacement of sulci. The lesions appeared isointense on T1-weighted sequence  and hyperintense on T2-weighted  and FLAIR sequence . No obvious restriction was seen on the diffusion-weighted sequence and no appreciable contrast was seen on T1-weighted Gd sequence . On the basis of acute history and imaging features, possibilities of HSV encephalitis were considered. However, other possibilities of multifocal lesions like gliomatosis cerebri and transient postictal signal changes were also considered in the differential diagnosis. Close follow-up scan or stereotactic biopsy was advised. After treatment with intravenous acyclovir (30 mg/kg/day for 14 days) and methylprednisolone (1 mg/day for 5 days) under the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), his cognitive function was improved.\n\n【7】After 3 months, the patient had seizures and drowsy mentality. MRI of brain revealed multiple lesions at the same site and location of bilateral frontal lobes, cingulate gyrus and insular cortex, appearing iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted  and FLAIR sequence. No obvious restriction was seen. There was enhancement of these lesions on T1-weighted Gd sequence . As imaging showed enhancement and increased size of lesions, there was suspicion of neoplastic lesion. Patient denied stereotactic biopsy.\n\n【8】A follow-up scan was done after 1 month of previous imaging which showed multiple lesions at the same site appearing iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted  and hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR sequence . There was irregular peripheral enhancement on post-contrast study  with non-enhancing central necrotic/cystic areas. There was mass effect and midline shift towards left side. These images were suggesting of multicentric glioma and differential diagnosis included metastases.\n\n【9】Patient underwent right frontal craniotomy and resection of one of lesions in right frontal lobe was done. Histopathological examination of tissue showed gliofibrillary matrix and sheets of neoplastic astrocytes with moderate nuclear atypia and brisk mitosis. Multifocal microvascular proliferation and palisaded tumor necrosis were noted. Many gemistocytic tumor cells were seen, suggestive of GBM, WHO grade IV .\n\n【10】Postoperative MRI showed changes in the form of craniotomy defect in right frontal region, dural enhancement and hemorrhage in right frontal lobe and associated with abnormal signals at peripheral part of resection cavity and cingulated gyrus appearing isointense on T1-weighted  and hyperintense on T2-weighted  and FLAIR sequences , suggesting of residual lesion. There was abnormal signal in the left frontal lobe, extending into insular cortex appearing isointense on T1-weighted hyperintense on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequence. Lesion showed irregular peripheral enhancement on the post-contrast study with central cystic/necrotic area . Mild perilesional edema was seen. There was mass effect in form of effacement of the left lateral ventricle. Lesion in left frontal lobe increased in size as compared to preoperative MRI. The palliative IMRT was given at high dose on left frontal lobe, moderate dose at resection site and mild dose covering the entire brain sparing the vital structures like optic nerve, optic chiasma and pituitary gland. Patient was on follow-up.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】This case highlights unusual imaging features of multicentric glioma on MRI simulating with HSV encephalitis. However, similar clinicoradiological findings for glioblastoma and HSE can lead to delays in the diagnosis of glioblastoma and treatment of patients, and thus resulting in significant cerebral morbidity and poor prognosis.\n\n【13】HSE is the major cause of serious sporadic encephalitis with a predilection for the limbic system . Therefore, intravenous acyclovir should be continued until the limbic system lesion is diagnosed as any other diseases except HSE, because failure to consider the possibility of HSE can lead to a delay in accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, with a significant risk of mortality and morbidity . The HSV-PCR assay of the CSF is an invaluable test in the diagnosis of a patient with suspected HSE. However, it sometimes tends to remain false-negative in the acute phase of HSE because the intensity of the PCR product band of an earlier CSF sample is weak . For this reason, the negative result of the HSV-PCR assay in our case was overlooked and acyclovir continued to be intravenously administrated. The patient improved at the time of discharge. In retrospect, it may have been due to the corticosteroid effect but not acyclovir administration.\n\n【14】Primary and metastatic brain tumors, including glioblastoma, can present as acute encephalitis or encephalopathy, although the frequency is very low. Jasen  reported that one (1.5%) out of 65 patients with acute encephalitis actually had a brain tumor (oligodendroglioma). Chen et al  reported that five (5.3%) of 95 patients who were biopsy-negative for HSE had brain tumors, of whom three had primary CNS tumors (two patients with glioblastomas and one patient with primary CNS lymphoma) and two had metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Further, Kimberlin  reported three patients with high grade gliomas mimicking acute viral encephalitis. They suggested that stereotactic brain biopsy should be considered in patients with temporal lobe masses if a definitive diagnosis using PCR assays for common viruses is unavailable. If we had performed stereotactic brain biopsy on our patient based on the initial CNS manifestations, functional deficits would have been much less severe.\n\n【15】First, MRI is more sensitive than CT in the detection of brain tumors. However, patients whose initial MRIs were negative or had mild abnormalities, and soon thereafter had high grade glioma, were occasionally encountered. After all, in suspected tumors, serial brain imaging studies are needed to document the evolution of brain tumor and to rule out underlying encephalitis.\n\n【16】The imaging appearance of multifocal and multicentric GBM is indistinct from that of metastases, with MRI displaying multiple contrast-enhancing masses . Certain MRI features such as variable lesion morphology, mild peritumoral edema, and irregular tumor margins can suggest the diagnosis of multifocal or multicentric GBM . Since metastasis from extracranial primary tumors is the most common diagnosis associated with multiple brain masses, histopathological verification is imperative before making a diagnosis of metastasis, especially in patients with no known primary neoplasm . The diagnostic workup for multifocal and multicentric GBM is generally the same as that for solitary GBM. Dissemination of GBM, however, can occur intracranially or throughout the spinal axis . In such cases of GBM with leptomeningeal gliomatosis, either suspected clinically or radiographically due to the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement or hydrocephalus, complete neuroaxis MRI should be obtained. Cytological examination of the CSF can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Batzdorf and Malamud characterized the modes of growth in gliomas by establishing criteria to distinguish multiple and multicentric gliomas . Others have attempted additional classifications based on pathologic and radiologic criteria . Multifocal replaces multiple in the modern day classification. Therefore, multifocal glioma consists of tumors separated by white matter tracts within the same hemisphere, whereas multicentric glioma consists of tumors in opposite hemispheres or separated by the tentorium.\n\n【17】Multifocal and multicentric GBMs do not exhibit any histopathologic characteristics that differentiate them from typical, solitary supratentorial GBM . Pathognomonic features of GBM include pseudopalisading necrosis and neovascularization . The individual tumors in cases of multicentric GBM usually have the same pathologic appearance . Although there is still no unified theory regarding the pathogenesis of multifocal and multicentric GBM, several hypotheses have been developed. According to earlier theories, multicentricity arises from two events . The first stage is neoplastic transformation, in which a wide field becomes more susceptible to neoplastic growth. The second stage is tumor proliferation at two or more activated sites that can occur simultaneously in response to various stimuli including biochemical, hormonal, and viral triggers. More contemporary theories have looked at molecular associations. For example, there is a reported association between p53 mutations and multifocal GBM that correlates the pattern of p53 mutation to tumor migration and augmented growth. In a study of the growth factor receptor c-Met in GBM, one group found that 42.9% of tumors that overexpressed c-Met displayed invasive and multifocal features on initial MRI, whereas only 17.1% of tumors with little or no c-Met expression had similar characteristics (P = 0.036) . This molecular and genetic characterization of multifocal GBM has thereby implicated particular oncogenes and growth factors in the pathogenesis of multifocal and multicentric GBM.\n\n【18】In addition to the molecular pathways involved in multifocality and multicentricity, studies have correlated the tumor pattern at diagnosis and recurrence with the spatial relationship to the subventricular zone (SVZ) and cortex as seen on MRI . More specifically, patients with a contrast-enhancing lesion contacting the SVZ and infiltrating the cortex were most likely to have multifocal disease at the time of diagnosis and distant tumor recurrence. On the other hand, patients with a contrast-enhancing lesion neither contacting the SVZ nor infiltrating the cortex always had solitary lesions and contiguous tumor recurrences. Neural stem cells within the SVZ may give rise to multiple and multicentric GBM. Neural stem cells have been found to express matrix metalloproteinases, which are proteolytic enzymes implicated in tumor spread . Furthermore, the SVZ is thought to be a highly permissive environment for tumor growth and cellular migration.\n\n【19】Currently, there are no clear guidelines regarding the optimal management of multifocal and multicentric GBM . While the extent of resection is established as an independent determinant of survival in patients with solitary GBM, the role of surgery for multifocal and multicentric GBM remains controversial . Two strategies have been described. First one is surgery done in our patient, aggressive resection of one tumor focus, biopsy alone followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and second one is multiple craniotomies during a single operation with no clear indication of which modality is superior . The standard radiation treatment for GBM includes conformal radiotherapy that encompasses the tumor volume and margin along with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide . Regarding radiotherapy for multifocal and multicentric GBM, a study found no significant difference in the median time to progression or median survival time between conformal radiotherapy and whole brain radiation treatment .\n\n【20】Additionally, the role of radiotherapy to control infratentorial GBM is not yet defined . Some studies support the use of craniospinal radiotherapy with posterior fossa boost for malignant cerebellar gliomas, especially in children . However, other studies have found no benefit with craniospinal radiotherapy in GBM in adults and support whole brain radiation treatment with or without posterior fossa boost . Most authors agree that craniospinal irradiation is reasonable if CSF dissemination occurs . In patients with leptomeningeal gliomatosis, other treatments could also include intrathecal chemotherapy and CSF shunting for associated hydrocephalus.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Multicentric glioblastoma is a rare entity. The clinical presentation may develop extremely fast and can be characterized quite exclusively by cognitive symptoms; such symptoms can be very difficult to place, especially when focal neurological signs are not present. It is rare that high-grade brain tumors may present as acute encephalopathy with limbic system involvement by brain imaging.\n\n【23】In this particular case, the initial imaging was mimicking with acute HSV encephalitis and we could not expect a so relevant evolution in such short time. Therefore, an intensive follow-up with short repeat brain imaging as well as stereotactic biopsy is necessary in such patients if definite evidence for the diagnosis of HSE can not be obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1c657a8e-34cd-406d-b8bd-019317f8cd0a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】We describe a case of a 44-year-old male with coronary artery disease risk factors who presented with chest pain and syncope. On angiogram, the patient was found to have a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). This is a rather rare presentation in this patient subset that presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Spontaneous dissections are more often seen in young women and pregnant women as well. Clinicians must be aware of similar cases of SCAD and therapeutic options for these patients.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of smoking and hypertension who presented to the office complaining of chest pain and episodes of recurrent syncope. Because of his presenting symptoms, he was taken for cardiac catheterization. During his angiogram, he was found to have a chronic dissection of the mid left anterior descending (LAD) artery which filled via left-to-left septal collaterals . He was also found to have non-occlusive disease to his first obtuse marginal branch. He was treated conservatively with medical management. Upon follow-up, he continued to have typical angina with activity and rest. His exercise capacity was greatly limited due to ongoing chest pain.\n\n【4】Upon examination, the patient’s vitals were a temperature of 97.9 °F, blood pressure of 123/86 mm Hg, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 per minute and saturating 96% on room air. He was not in acute distress, and his heart was a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He was perfusing all four extremities and they were free of lower extremity edema. Because of the progressive and limiting nature of his angina, the patient was scheduled for a repeat angiogram. During this procedure, the chronic LAD occlusion was not able to be intervened due to a perforation of the LAD . A 2D echocardiogram was performed later which did not reveal a pericardial effusion. His ejection fraction was found to be normal at 60%.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】SCAD is a rare diagnosis that presents both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The incidence has been widely reported as anywhere from 0.28% and 1.1% . The amount of new cases has increased likely due to availability of coronary angiography and more awareness of the diagnosis. Also contributing to an increase in incidence is the newly described angiographic variants of SCAD. A new estimate of SCAD in patients presenting with ACS is 1.7-4% . Women have been reported in over 90% of cases with many cases also reported on pregnant females. Males who have been reported tend to be younger as well .\n\n【7】Arterial dissection in SCAD can occur within or between any of the three layers of the arterial wall. Two possible mechanisms for the initiation of arterial dissection have been proposed. The first is the intimal tear hypothesis in which a disruption in the intimal-luminal junction creates a nidus for intramural hematoma and separation of the arterial wall. The second mechanism is the medial hemorrhage hypothesis in which a hemorrhage occurs within the arterial wall due to spontaneous rupture of the vasa vasorum. This can cause a rupture into the true lumen in an almost reverse intimal rupture. In both cases, the principle abnormality is a plane of dissection which causes compression of the true lumen and threatens distal blood flow .\n\n【8】Diagnosis of SCAD is difficult as there may be many presenting signs and symptoms that are similar to acute coronary syndrome. Electrocardiograms can be non-specific but may also show ST-segment changes, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation arrest . Echocardiogram and biomarkers may be useful but can also be non-specific as well. Generally, cardiac angiogram is the diagnostic modality of choice. There may be a clear appearance of dissection with a false lumen . Data show a higher incidence of spontaneous dissections, many found post-mortem, than are reported on angiography. The use of intravascular ultrasound may be added to find dissections not easily found on angiography. Ultrasound increases the sensitivity of detection of medial dissection, hematoma, or small plaques . The ability of these tools has increased the diagnosis of SCAD as much of the presentation may be non-specific in patients who may not have coronary risk factors .\n\n【9】Treatment for SCAD can be either conservative or invasive in nature and is often based on presentation. Medical therapy may be appropriate in clinically stable patients with a limited dissection and small area of myocardium at risk. In a prospective study of 168 patients by Almeda et al, patients treated conservatively did develop spontaneous healing of their dissection . Conservative therapy has been proven in several trials to have an excellent long-term prognosis . Several cases have reported need for revascularization including a patient with cocaine abuse who had a left main artery dissection extending distally to the LAD and circumflex artery requiring four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting . Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has often been preferred to bypass grafting; however, thrombolytics have not been suggested for theoretical concerns . PCI does have a higher rate of complication than conservative therapy and may not prevent recurrent SCAD from occurring .\n\n【10】In conclusion, our patient was having episodic angina but was hemodynamically stable without EKG changes. He was treated conservatively initially; however, he returned to the clinic with worsening symptoms. Upon reevaluation, he was found to be worsening and a repeat angiogram was performed without intervention. Conservative management, with medical treatment, was correctly given upon initial discovery of the patient’s chronic spontaneous coronary artery dissection. When the patient’s symptoms worsened, it is reasonable to believe the patient failed medical therapy. Clinicians need to be aware of SCAD because it can occur in patients with minimal or no cardiac risk factors. More research needs to be performed on methods to treat patients who fail medical therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
