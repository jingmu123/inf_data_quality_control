Congenital refers to the fact that they start either very early in infancy or during fetal development. These genitourinary and other organ systems, as well as various portions of the urinary tract, can be affected by these disorders, including the following:\n\n【2】*   Kidneys.\n    \n*   Bladder.\n    \n*   Ureters (the tubes transporting urine from the kidneys to the bladder).\n    \n*   Genital organs.\n    \n\n【3】Depending on the disorder, these anomalies can be identified while still in the womb, during infancy, or throughout childhood. At the same time, some may only be discovered once symptoms appear during adolescence or adulthood.\n\n【4】What Kinds of Urological Anomalies Be Present at Birth?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Congenital urogenital abnormalities of the following types can affect infants, young people, and adults:\n\n【6】*   **Hydronephrosis:** The disorder known as hydronephrosis manifests as a clog or defective valve in the urinary tract. The kidneys become inflamed due to the obstruction of the tube connecting the kidney and bladder. In around one out of 100 pregnancies, it happens during fetal development. There are numerous causes of hydronephrosis, and in certain cases, the kidney(s) may be harmed if the main cause is not addressed and treated.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Cystic Renal Dysplasia - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    CAKUT Kidney - Types, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Can miscarriage happen after seeing heartbeat of fetus in earlier scans?\n    \n*   **Cryptorchidism, or Undescended Testicles:** This is the most prevalent birth abnormality affecting the genitourinary system in male infants. Males have two round organs called testicles, often found in the scrotum. In a typical male fetus, the testicles grow in the abdomen and travel (descend) to the scrotum before birth. The testicles typically descend within six months of birth if a baby is born without them. The testicles may not descend, instead staying in the groin or abdomen.\n    \n*   **Hypospadias:** Only male neonates are afflicted by this disorder. It happens when the urethra's opening - where urine leaves the body - is situated below the penis rather than at its tip. About five out of every 1,000 male neonates born in the US (United States) have it. This is one of the most frequent urological anomalies. It is possible for boys born with hypospadias to have undescended testicles or a bent penis. Due to difficulty controlling the pee stream, people could have trouble urinating.\n    \n*   **Spina Bifida:** A cleft spine is a birth condition that develops when the meninges (membranes protecting the brain and the spinal cord), spinal cord, or both are not fully formed during fetal development. The meninges surround the spinal cord and serve as a defense barrier. From mild to severe, there are four main forms of spina bifida. The most severe kinds might cause partial or total paralysis below the spinal opening in the affected individuals. Problems with the lower extremities and bladder or bowel disorders may develop from this.\n    \n*   **Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR):** The disorder is characterized by abnormal urine flow from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. Normally, the bladder stores urine produced by the kidneys, which exits the body through a tube attached to the bladder's base. The small tubes that connect the bladder and kidneys are known as the ureters, and vesicoureteral reflux occurs when urine runs back or refluxes into one or both of them. The urine might occasionally return to either one or both kidneys. Unilateral reflux occurs when only one ureter and kidney are damaged. Bilateral reflux is the medical term for when both are affected. VUR is more common in infants and young children, although it can also affect older kids and adults.\n    \n*   **Bladder Duplication Abnormalities:** A second kidney or another region of the urogenital tract can occur in cases with bladder duplication abnormalities.\n    \n*   **Cystic Kidneys:** These are fluid-filled growths on the kidney brought on by various conditions, including polycystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, medullary cystic disease, and medullary sponge.\n    \n*   **Fused Kidneys:** Fusion anomalies (horseshoe kidney or crossed-fused renal ectopia).\n    \n*   **Agenesis of the Kidneys:** The absence of one or both kidneys.\n    \n*   **Kidney (Renal) Dysplasia:** Abnormal development of the tissues inside the kidneys or tubules.\n    \n*   **Ectopic Kidneys:** An incorrect kidney position.\n    \n*   **Neurogenic Bladder:** This is one in which a brain and nerve condition brings on the inability to control one's urination.\n    \n*   **Urethral Meatal Stenosis (Urethral Stricture):** It is the narrowing of the entrance of the urethra (the tube that drains urine from the body).\n    \n*   **Urinary Tract Infections:** These are bacterial infections that cause swelling and obstructions in your urethra, bladder, or kidneys (urethritis, cystitis, and pyelonephritis).\n    \n*   **Bladder Exstrophy:** This uncommon congenital anomaly causes the bladder and related organs to be internally rotated. Through a hole in the abdominal wall, the back portion of the bladder wall is exstrophy (turned outward). The opening allows urine to spill into the lower abdomen. There are many severity levels for bladder exstrophy. The urethra, the tube that transports pee out of the body, has a malfunction, which results in the least serious kind. When the urethra and the tip of the penis are exposed from the top of the bladder, it is known as classic bladder exstrophy (in male children). It is unknown what caused the disease specifically. Kidney damage and bacterial urinary tract infections are examples of complications. Kidney failure and high blood pressure may be caused by scarring of the kidneys.\n    \n*   **Eagle-Barrett Syndrome:** Also known as prune belly, it is a rare hereditary condition that primarily affects young boys. The absence of all or part of the abdominal (stomach) muscles results in the belly's wrinkly or prune-like appearance. An enlarged bladder or occlusion of the bladder neck are two examples of associated urinary tract abnormalities. Expansion of the ureters and undescended testicles are examples of further abnormalities. The disorder may result in urine building up in the kidneys or ureters and flowing backward from the bladder to the ureters.\n    \n*   **Posterior Urethral Valve (PUV) Disorder:** Excess membrane flaps in the urethra's back produce this congenital disease. It only affects male newborns and prevents urine from passing through the urethra. PUV results in a urine backflow into the bladder, possibly thickening the muscle wall there. Possible bladder enlargement. The ureters and the kidneys may suffer injury when urine rises through the ureters and into the kidneys.\n    \n\n【7】How Are Congenital Anomalies of the Urological System Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The different investigations done to diagnose the urological system are:\n\n【9】*   **A Blood Test -** Blood tests, such as those that assess blood cell counts, electrolyte levels, and kidney function, may be used by the doctor to assess the status.\n    \n\n【10】*   **Biopsy -** A kidney biopsy is a procedure in which a laboratory collects and analyzes tissue from the kidney. Results aid in diagnosing renal illness, evaluating kidney damage, and selecting the most appropriate course of therapy.\n    \n\n【11】*   **Cystoscopy -** This method is carried on by using a small, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end. This assessment looks at the lining of the bladder and urethra.\n    \n\n【12】*   **Cystography -** Bladder cystography, also known as a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG), aids medical professionals in the diagnosis of urethral disorders or urinary dysfunction, including urinary tract infections, obstructions, and issues with bladder control (UTIs). An imaging technician will capture X-rays as one urinates while the bladder is filled with contrast dye during the operation. The doctor may also ultrasound the kidneys if they suspect vesicoureteral reflux.\n    \n\n【13】*   **Kidney Scan (Radionuclide Scan) -** This nuclear imaging test evaluates the kidney's blood flow and urine production by injecting a small amount of radiotracer chemical into the veins. The imaging technician utilizes a gamma camera or scanner, a specialized camera, to find the radiotracer outside of the body. Renal scans can reveal impaired kidney function brought on by illnesses, accidents, structural flaws, or blockages.\n    \n\n【14】*   **Urinalysis -** Doctors examine urine samples to check for red blood cells, white blood cells, or an abundance of protein. The doctor may collect a urine sample at the session, for 24 hours, or by using a catheter (thin, flexible tube) to remove a sample straight from the bladder.\n    \n\n【15】*   **Urography -** An imaging procedure called a urography looks at the kidneys, bladder, and ureters using a contrast dye and either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT).\n    \n\n【16】*   **Urethrography -** Urethrography is a diagnostic tool used by doctors to identify blockages, urethral constriction, and other anatomical problems. The test is virtually entirely administered to males. In this instance, the contrast dye is introduced into the urethra but does not reach the bladder entirely.\n    \n\n【17】What Are the Different Treatments Available for Congenital Urological Anomalies?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The different treatment options available for congenital urological anomalies are:\n\n【19】*   **Angiography and Stent Implantation -** The doctor might advise implanting a stent (a flexible mesh tube) in the restricted kidney blood channel to improve blood flow. The doctor uses X-ray guidance to make a tiny incision and introduce a catheter with a balloon that is attached but not inflated into the constricted conduit. The doctor inserts the stent into the vessel after inflating the balloon to keep it open.\n    \n\n【20】*   **Catheterization of the Bladder -** The physician might use a catheter to remove extra urine and stop additional harm.\n    \n\n【21】*   **Rehabilitation of the Bladder -** To treat bladder control issues, such as the inability to urinate due to paralysis, nervous system dysfunction, or other renal diseases, the doctor may advise physical rehabilitation therapy. In order to help with function improvement, specially qualified therapists offer instruction, physical therapy, and individual treatment programs.\n    \n\n【22】*   **Medicine -** The doctor may prescribe medication to treat an infection, lessen edema (swelling), manage pain, or relax the bladder.\n    \n\n【23】*   **Surgery -** In some cases, congenital urogenital abnormalities are treated surgically by doctors. If surgery is the best course, the doctor will review alternatives.\n    \n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】Healthcare experts collaborate with patients to solve various challenging urological and personal issues. Medication, surgery, or outpatient procedures may be used as treatments and counseling. Since many of these congenital defects are inherited, developments in prenatal diagnostics, imaging, genetic testing, laboratory surveillance, and medical therapy have improved the prognosis and quality of life for affected families.\n\n【26】Article Resources\n\n【27】*   Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract: A Clinical Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451090/\n*   Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/congenital-anomalies-of-kidney-and-urinary-tract/\n*   Congenital Urogenital Abnormalities  \n    https://umiamihealth.org/en/treatments-and-services/nephrology/congenital-urogenital-abnormalities", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

As a result, it results in generalized cellular hypoxia in the body. Hypovolemic shock is one of the most common forms of shock in children. There is a state of acute energy failure in the body due to dysregulation of glucose substrate and oxygen delivery. Blood volume refers to the total amount of blood present in the body. If the child suffers from hypovolemic shock, the blood volume drops significantly. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency as, in severe cases, it can result in organ failure. Therefore, diagnosing and treating it as early as possible is essential.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Hypovolemic Shock?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Hypovolemic shock is caused by sudden blood or fluid loss from the body. The loss of body fluids or actual blood loss results in a decrease in blood volume. As a result, there is a reduction in intravascular fluid volume and decreased stroke volume.\n\n【4】Following are the various causes of hypovolemic shock.\n\n【5】*   Dehydration is caused by vomiting and diarrhea.\n    \n*   Hemorrhage.\n    \n*   Pathologic urinary losses.\n    \n*   Prolonged Diarrhea.\n    \n*   Translocation of fluids due to a severe burn.\n    \n*   Excessive sweating.\n    \n*   Protracted vomiting.\n    \n*   Blood loss due to deep cuts or wounds.\n    \n*   Bleeding from the digestive tract.\n    \n*   Internal bleeding.\n    \n*   Blood in the urine.\n    \n*   Peritonitis.\n    \n*   Bowel obstruction.\n    \n*   Traumatic injury.\n    \n*   Pancreatitis.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Know All About Fluid and Electrolyte Management in Newborns!\n    \n*   Nephrotic syndrome.\n    \n*   Diabetes Insipidus.\n    \n\n【6】**What Are the Stages of Hypovolemic Shock?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Hypovolemic shock occurs in various stages. As it progresses, the symptoms are seen in children.\n\n【8】Following are the multiple stages of hypovolemic shock.\n\n【9】*   **Stage One -** In this stage, less than 15 percent of fluid is lost in the body. However, breathing and blood pressure appears normal at this stage. However, the child feels anxious, and their skin seems pale.\n    \n*   **Stage Two -** In this stage, 15 to 30 percent fluid loss is present. There is an increase in heart rate and breathing. Initially, blood pressure appears to be expected, but diastolic blood pressure increases as the disease progresses.\n    \n*   **Stage Three -** In this stage, 30 to 40 percent fluid loss is present. A significant drop in blood pressure and heart rate is increased to more than 120beats per minute. The breathing rate is increased, and the frequency of urination is decreased.\n    \n*   **Stage Four -** In this stage, there is more than 40 percent of bodily fluid loss. The condition of the child becomes critical. A child's pulse rate is decreased, and the heart rate is increased. The child almost stops urinating, and there is the presence of internal bleeding from the organ.\n    \n*   Hemorrhagic Shock occurs due to excessive blood loss from a child's body due to trauma or an accident. The child needs immediate medical attention because it can turn into a fatal situation. In addition, it can cause severe damage to tissue and organs in the body.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Hypovolemic Shock?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The symptoms of Hypovolemic shock change with the progression of stages.\n\n【12】Following are the various symptoms seen in children according to the settings.\n\n【13】*   **Stage One**\n    \n    *   It is the earliest stage; therefore, the symptoms are mild.\n        \n    *   There is no change in blood pressure and breathing.\n        \n    *   The child feels anxious.\n        \n    *   Pale skin.\n        \n*   **Stage Two**\n    \n    *   Increased heart rate\n        \n    *   High blood pressure.\n        \n    *   Sweating.\n        \n    *   Anxiety.\n        \n    *   Restlessness.\n        \n*   **Stage Three**\n    \n    *   Increased heart rate.\n        \n    *   Rapid breathing rate.\n        \n    *   Mental distress, including anxiety and agitation.\n        \n    *   Skin becomes pale and cold.\n        \n    *   Weak pulse rate.\n        \n    *   Sweating.\n        \n*   **Stage Four**\n    \n    *   Rapid increase in heart rate.\n        \n    *   Excessive rapid breathing.\n        \n    *   Urine output is decreased.\n        \n    *   Confusion.\n        \n    *   Weakness.\n        \n    *   Decreased pulse rate.\n        \n    *   Lips and fingernails become blue.\n        \n    *   Loss of consciousness.\n        \n    *   Mental status becomes abnormal.\n        \n*   **Hemorrhagic Shock**\n    \n    *   Severe abdominal pain.\n        \n    *   Blood is present in urine and stool.\n        \n    *   Melena.\n        \n    *   Presence of blood in vomit.\n        \n    *   Severe pain in my chest.\n        \n    *   The abdomen is swollen.\n        \n\n【14】What Are the Complications of Hypovolemic Shock?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Following are the various complications of Hypovolemic shock:\n\n【16】*   Lack of body fluid can lead to severe dehydration.\n    \n*   Damage to various organs such as the kidney and brain.\n    \n*   Severe hypoxia.\n    \n*   Metabolic acidosis.\n    \n*   Heart attack.\n    \n*   Severe tachycardia\n    \n*   Gastrointestinal diseases.\n    \n\n【17】What Are the Risk Factors of Hypovolemic Shock?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Hypovolemic shock can occur due to various causes, such as illness, medical condition, or injury. The risk factors can be external and internal.\n\n【19】*   **External Risk Factors -** Children suffering from diabetes insipidus, diuresis, and diarrhea risk hypovolemic shock. Trauma and surgery also increase the risk.\n    \n*   **Internal Risk Factors -** These factors cause fluid shifts such as bleeding, burns, ascites, peritonitis, and dehydration.\n    \n\n【20】How Is Hypovolemic Shock Diagnosed in Children?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The symptoms tend to arise as there is a progression of the stages. However, physical signs such as rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, low pulse rate, pale skin color, and cold extremities are evident. Following are the few diagnostic tests a pediatrician suggests if the child is suspected of hypovolemic shock.\n\n【22】*   Blood investigations.\n    \n*   Focused assessment with sonography for trauma.\n    \n*   Computed tomography scan.\n    \n*   Echocardiogram.\n    \n\n【23】What Is the Treatment Plan for Hypovolemic Shock?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】If the child suffers from hypovolemic shock, an intravenous fluid transfusion is done to recover the fluid loss. The primary goal of treatment is to control fluid loss and improve circulation. In addition, treating the primary cause, such as illness or injury, is essential to stabilize the damage caused by hypovolemic shock.\n\n【25】Following are the various treatment plans followed.\n\n【26】*   Medications to improve circulation such as dopamine, dobutamine, and epinephrine.\n    \n*   Antibiotic therapy to prevent bacterial infections and septic shock.\n    \n*   Blood plasma transfusion.\n    \n*   Platelet transfusion.\n    \n*   Administration of intravenous crystalloids.\n    \n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】Hypovolemic shock in pediatric patients can be challenging to diagnose for both parents and pediatricians. However, if mild symptoms such as a change in behavior, fussiness, or change in appetite are seen, parents should consider a healthcare visit. Detailed history and proper examination should be made to diagnose and sound management. A systematic approach should be made to treatment to ensure better care. Hypovolemic shock can turn into a life-threatening emergency if not treated at the proper time. It is essential to stabilize the condition of a child if the symptoms are severe.\n\n【29】Article Resources\n\n【30】*   Pediatric Hypovolemic Shock  \n    https://openpediatricmedicinejournal.com/contents/volumes/V7/TOPEDJ-7-10/TOPEDJ-7-10.pdf\n*   Hypovolemic shock in pediatric patients  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9654319/\n*   Shock in Pediatrics  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1833578-overview", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d0eea126-241e-4727-ab12-7852adfd297d", "title": "Post-pericardiotomy Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Post-pericardiotomy Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) was initially identified in 1953 in mitral valve surgery patients who developed fever and pleuritic pain. Patients typically appear with PPS a few days after surgery; however, clinical symptoms may arise as late as several weeks to months after surgery and may be accompanied by substantial morbidity. It is considered that post-cardiothoracic surgery-associated PPS is caused by a heightened immunological response to damage.\n\n【2】However, the post-pericardiotomy syndrome has also been described after myocardial infarction (Dressler syndrome) and as an uncommon complication following percutaneous procedures such as coronary stent implantation, after implantation of epicardial pacemaker leads and transvenous pacemaker leads, and after blunt trauma, stab wounds, and heart puncture.\n\n【3】Pericardial effusions frequently accompany the condition and can lead to early or late postoperative cardiac tamponade, as well as recurrent cardiac tamponade. In addition to pericardial or pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, friction rubs, pleural effusions, pneumonitis, and abnormal ECG and radiographic findings, the syndrome is also characterized by pericardial or pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, friction rubs, pleural effusions.\n\n【4】What Causes Post-pericardiotomy Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Postpericardiotomy syndrome is often caused by the development of anti-heart antibodies, which cause the pericardial space to become inflamed. The post-pericardiotomy syndrome may have more than one cause. A systematic review found that the inflammatory response, as well as bleeding and clotting during surgery, may be involved. Some of the things that were linked to a higher risk of this condition were:\n\n【6】*   Low interleukin 8, platelets, and hemoglobin before surgery.\n    \n*   Higher complement conversion products after surgery.\n    \n*   Younger age.\n    \n*   Transfusions of red blood cells.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Post-pericardiotomy Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Symptoms appear one to six weeks following cardiac surgery. In general, the disease is self-limiting, with modest symptoms and signs that resolve in two to three weeks. After the first postoperative week, the temperature normally reaches between 38 to 39 degrees Celcius orally, although it can exceed 40 degrees Celcius. Despite the fever, the patient may not appear to be ill. The fever normally goes away in two to three weeks.\n\n【9】Typical presenting symptoms include:\n\n【10】*   Malaise.\n    \n*   Chest discomfort.\n    \n*   Irritability and a loss of appetite.\n    \n*   Patients may also complain of dyspnea and arthralgia.\n    \n*   Children may complain of chest pain that worsens with inspiration and while lying down but improves when sitting upright and leaning forward.\n    \n*   Vomitings have also been recorded as the primary symptom in children with post-pericardiotomy syndrome and imminent cardiac tamponade.\n    \n\n【11】What Diagnostic Tests Are Done for Postpericardiotomy Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】When at least two of the following five diagnostic criteria are met, the post-pericardiotomy syndrome is diagnosed:\n\n【13】*   New or worsening pleural effusion.\n    \n*   New or worsening pericardial effusion.\n    \n*   Fever.\n    \n*   Pleural chest discomfort.\n    \n*   Pleural or pericardial rubbing.\n    \n\n【14】**Symptoms and History:**\n\n【15】*   Fever, chest discomfort, and dyspnea are common symptoms of postpericardiotomy syndrome. Malaise, decreased appetite, and arthralgia is the less severe symptoms of postpericardiotomy syndrome.\n    \n*   Physical Examination of the vital signs.\n    \n*   A cardiac pericardial friction rub is frequently present, as is an enlarged heart.\n    \n*   Pleural effusion signs may be found in the lungs.\n    \n*   Ruling out for pericardial constriction or effusion. There may be leg swelling.\n    \n\n【16】The diagnostic tests include:\n\n【17】**1\\. Electrocardiogram:** The diagnosis of post-pericardiotomy syndrome may benefit from an ECG. Pericarditis-related ECG findings include ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion, and PR depression in several leads.\n\n【18】**2\\. Heart X-ray:** The costophrenic angles are frequently blunted together with the presence of a pleural effusion. If there is a significant enough pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly may be observed.\n\n【19】**3\\. Ultrasonography or Echocardiography:** In order to properly diagnose post-pericardiotomy syndrome, echocardiography may be useful. Pericardial effusion is a finding on an echocardiogram of a post-pericardiotomy syndrome.\n\n【20】**4\\. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** The diagnosis of the pericardial effusion may benefit from a cardiac CT scan. Pericardial effusion is a finding on a CT scan that is suggestive of post-pericardiotomy syndrome, while pericardial thickening is a finding on a CT scan that is diagnostic of pericardial effusion.\n\n【21】**5\\. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** When determining the cause of postpericardiotomy syn, cardiac MRI may be useful. Pericardial thickening is a finding on MRI that suggests pericardial effusion.\n\n【22】How Is Postpericardiotomy Syndrome Treated?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】**1\\. Medical Therapy:**\n\n【24】*   Patients who might have postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) are usually evaluated outside a hospital. If the patient's blood flow is not affected, the testing and treatment can continue outside the hospital, but they should be closely watched.\n    \n\n【25】*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Aspirin are used to treat it medically. They are given for four to six weeks and then lessened as the fluid level goes down. For people who do not get better with Aspirin, Ibuprofen, or Naproxen, corticosteroids like Prednisone may be given for one week, then tapered over the next four weeks. There is very little information, if any, about how well colchicine works to treat PPS in children.\n    \n\n【26】*   One person with recurrent pericardial effusion was treated successfully with a single high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin and another with a low dose of Methotrexate once a week. More recently, two children who had heart surgery and had recurrent pericarditis were treated successfully with high-dose (two grams per kilogram) intravenous immunoglobulin every three to five months until their pericardial effusions went away.\n    \n\n【27】*   When a person with PPS is very sick, like when they have symptoms and signs of tamponade, they need to stay in the hospital. When a person has a tamponade, they must go to the hospital for pericardial drainage.\n    \n\n【28】*   Most patients can be treated without staying in the hospital after the pericardial effusion is drained and their symptoms get better.\n    \n\n【29】**2\\. Surgery:** Surgery is not advised for the treatment of postpericardiotomy syndrome.\n\n【30】**3\\. Nutrition and Exercise:**\n\n【31】*   Patients with the post-pericardiotomy syndrome usually have less of an appetite, but they do not usually need to change what they eat.\n    \n*   Patients who are thought to have or who have been diagnosed with the post-pericardiotomy syndrome should not do anything too hard. For mild cases, bed rest may be enough on its own. The person is seen to stay in bed until the fever is gone, and the chest x-ray and ECG show results that are close to normal.\n    \n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】PPS is a reaction to cardiothoracic surgery that causes inflammation. It is often marked by a new pericardial effusion and fever. Colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help treat PPS if they are given at the right time. Few studies have given a clear picture of the things that put people at risk for PPS. There is a need to find biomarkers that will allow patients who are at high risk of getting PPS after surgery to be treated in a more targeted way.\n\n【34】Article Resources\n\n【35】*   Postpericardiotomy syndrome incidence, diagnostic and treatment strategies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629199/\n*   PPS: Post Pericardiotomy Syndrome  \n    http://www.cachnet.org/patients/26-the-beat-newsletter/2003/72-pps-post-pericardiotomy-syndrome\n*   Postpericardiotomy Syndrome  \n    https://www.ajronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2214/ajr.138.3.503", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The primary function of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is to detect any abnormality in the cardiac heartbeat. In addition to this, it also helps in controlling and correcting irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias. Tachycardia is a condition where the heartbeat is extremely fast; on the other hand, bradycardia is a condition where the heartbeat is extremely slow.\n\n【2】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator monitors the heartbeat on a continuous flow and delivers an electric shock to the heart whenever necessary in order to reset the heart and release regular heart rhythm. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is suggested when the patient has a dangerously high heart rate that may lead to heart weakness and cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation are some of the conditions that may cause a high risk to the patient's cardiovascular output.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or ICD is generally of two types. This cardiac therapy device comes traditionally or subcutaneously. A conventional implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is implanted within the chest cavity, and lead or wires are attached to the heart. Traditional implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a highly invasive surgical procedure. On the other hand, a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is another option where the device is placed under the skin of the chest or the skin of the armpit. This is then attached to an electrode that runs below the breastbone. Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators are larger in size than traditional cardioverter defibrillators, but the difference is that subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators do not attach themselves to the heart.\n\n【5】When Is Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Suggested?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】There are many reasons why the healthcare provider may suggest an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. One of the main reasons is to instantly correct irregular heartbeats, whether it is too fast or too slow. In addition, keeping cardiac arrest or heart attack at bay is one of the main reasons to choose an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\n【7】Mentioned below are a few conditions where an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be suggested.\n\n【8】*   Frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia.\n    \n*   Frequent episodes of fainting.\n    \n*   Survival of a cardiac arrest.\n    \n*   History of coronary artery disease.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n    \n    How does a pigtail ICD work in lung abscess?\n    \n    Long QT Syndrome - Causes, Risks, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n    \n*   History of a heart attack.\n    \n*   Weak muscles of the heart.\n    \n*   Abnormal and enlargement of the heart.\n    \n*   Long QT syndrome.\n    \n*   Congenital heart disorders.\n    \n*   Structural defects of the heart.\n    \n*   Atherosclerosis.\n    \n*   Damage to blood vessels of the heart.\n    \n*   Ventricular fibrillation.\n    \n\n【9】What Are the Risks of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Risks and complications are a part of every treatment modality when concerned with the cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, the risks of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are quite a few, and if handled by a correct and experienced professional, these risks can be avoided easily. Mentioned below are a few of the risks and complications that have been documented regarding implantable cardioverter defibrillators.\n\n【11】*   Infection at the implant site.\n    \n*   Swelling.\n    \n*   Bleeding.\n    \n*   Bruising.\n    \n*   Blood vessel damage.\n    \n*   Bleeding around the heart.\n    \n*   Blood leaking through the heart valve.\n    \n*   Collapsed lung.\n    \n*   Cardiac perforation.\n    \n\n【12】How to Prepare for an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The healthcare provider will request the patient and several tests and clinical procedures before suggesting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. This is because the healthcare provider and the team need to make sure the patient is a good candidate for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and the prognosis is favorable. If there are any undesired results in any of the below-mentioned diagnostic tests, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is not advised, and another treatment modality is looked forward to. Additionally, it is also vital for the patient to inform the health care provider of a complete history of drugs and medical conditions as well as any family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【14】*   Electrocardiography is to measure the electrical conduction system of the heart.\n    \n*   Echocardiography is a type of heart ultrasound to give a complete picture of the heart structure.\n    \n*   Holter monitoring is a device that tracks the heart's rhythm and wants the health care provider about any signs and symptoms of a cardiac arrest. This is a wearable device that can be worn for two days.\n    \n*   Event recorder or Holter monitor.\n    \n*   An electrophysiology study is done to study the structures of the blood vessels of the heart and other features such as the conduction system, muscles, and cardiac output.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Long-Term Precautions of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】An interference of electrical conduction due to an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may have a few chances to develop but still is rare. Mentioned below are a few of the precautions that the patient needs to follow on a long-term basis for the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to work with maximum efficiency.\n\n【17】*   Mobile phones and other cellular devices should be kept six inches apart from the heart because the signal of the mobile and the signals of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interfere with each other and lead to sudden fatigue and loss of consciousness in the patient.\n    \n*   Metal hand detectors should not be allowed for more than 30 seconds around the chest or the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. It is always advised to the patient while traveling to carry the medical report of the presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to avoid any customs issues.\n    \n*   Diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography should be avoided or kept at bay. Nevertheless, the best person to decide is the health care provider. That is why it is a must for every patient having an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to inform the professional about the presence of this device.\n    \n*   It is advised to stand at a minimum of two feet from the power generator, welding pieces of equipment, high voltage transformer, or other motor-generator systems if the patient works around such equipment.\n    \n*   Headphones may contain magnetic substances that may interfere with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. It is advised to keep headphones at a distance of six inches from the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n    \n*   Wireless chargers and electronic devices should also be kept at about 15 centimeters distance from the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n    \n*   Magnetic induction of any sort may interfere with the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. It is wise to avoid using magnets or maintain a six-inch distance from the site of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n    \n*   Devices such as toasters, electric shavers, electric drill scanners, printers, radius computers, televisions, microwave ovens, remote controls, and electric blankets force little to no risk to an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The healthcare provider will give a detailed list of the risk factors and machinery that has to be avoided by the patient who has undergone the procedure of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n    \n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a device that may be used in an emergency setup or scheduled appointment by the health care provider. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is used to reset the heart suffering from an irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, or episodes of a heart attack. The procedure is relatively quick, and the outcomes are generally good. Patients need to follow the instructions provided by the health care provider, and the team post an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for the long life of the machine and good health of the cardiovascular system. Patients are allowed to live a fully functional life and continue with their day-to-day activities after a week of treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\n【20】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【21】* * *\n\n【22】#### **1.**\n\n【23】#### **How Long Is the Life of an Implanted Defibrillator?**\n\n【24】An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a tiny device powered by a battery and placed inside the chest.

{"seq_id": "2638ff13-df87-4f8e-888a-7ae6e83230de", "title": "Brachial Plexus - Structural Pattern, Possible Injuries, Diagnosis, and Treatment Plan", "text": "【0】Brachial Plexus - Structural Pattern, Possible Injuries, Diagnosis, and Treatment Plan\nWhat Is Brachial Plexus?\n------------------------\n\n【1】The brachial plexus is a bundle of nerves present in one's neck and shoulder. It is responsible for controlling all the muscular movements and sensations to and from the spinal cord to either arm. When trauma happens to the neck region, the brachial plexus gets injured, causing numbness, pain, and weakness in the shoulders, arms, and hands.\n\n【2】How Is the Brachial Plexus Structured to Control the Arm Function?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Nerves forming brachial plexus emerge as a cluster of nerve roots from the neck and shoulder portion of the spinal cord. They fuse and form a network at the shoulder level and connect with all the nerves in the arms. Their function is to control all the big and small activities of the arms, hands, and wrists. Feelings on the arms like pain, pressure, heat, cold, and vibrations are accurately communicated and perceived by the brain through the brachial plexus. The nerves known as the musculocutaneous nerve, axillary nerve, median nerve, radial nerve, and ulnar nerve are the five important extensions of the brachial plexus.\n\n【4】What Causes a Brachial Plexus Injury?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】The most common reason for injury is trauma. When the arm gets pulled or stretched beyond normal levels, the brachial plexus tends to get injured. Particularly when the arm is pulled down and the head is pushed in the opposite direction. The trauma can be due to anything ranging from automobile collisions, falls, gunshot wounds, and sports accidents to knife injury. It happens in newborns during a breech delivery (bottom first), prolonged labor, or trauma while passing through the birth canal.\n\n【6】What Are the Types of Brachial Plexus Injury?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Depending upon the amount of impact and severity of the trauma, injuries vary in degree of damage. The possible damages may be:\n\n【8】1.  **Avulsion** - A severe and irreparable damage to the brachial plexus where it actually gets pulled out of the spinal cord, detaching completely from its point of origin.\n    \n2.  **Stretch** - Where the nerves get pulled and stretched (neuropraxia) but do not break. It may heal on its own or with minor surgical repair.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Dystocia- Causes, Risk Factors, and Management\n    \n    Arm Strain - Types, Causes, and Treatment\n    \n    Fetal Macrosomia - Causes, Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n3.  **Rupture** - Partial or complete tear of the nerves due to forceful pulling or stretching. Surgical repair is possible for some individuals.\n    \n\n【9】Below listed are the types of injury caused by the damage to the brachial plexus mentioned above:\n\n【10】*   **Upper-Trunk Palsy Injury:** Causes weakening or paralysis of the shoulders and muscles of the upper arm. The individual may not be able to raise the arm or bend at the elbow. Also, there may be a loss of sensation in the shoulder, the outer portion of the arm, and the thumb.\n    \n*   **Lower-Trunk Palsy Injury:** The hands may lose their function, and the individual may be unable to perform any fine motor activities that involve the small muscles of the hands, like buttoning a shirt or tying shoelaces, etc. The finger tends to shrink inwards to look like a claw over time. Additionally, there will be a loss of sensation in the ring finger and small finger.\n    \n*   **Pan-Plexus Palsy Injury:** Leads to a ‘flail limb,’ meaning complete paralysis of the arm and hand. This happens due to severe injuries causing damage to nerves at all levels.\n    \n*   **Gunshot Wounds:** Nerves either get bruised or stretched depending on the speed of the bullet during an ambush. This may recover on its own over time though damage to adjacent blood vessels requires immediate repair.\n    \n*   **Penetrating Wounds:** Where a sharp instrument like a knife may cut the nerves into segments. This does not heal on its own and requires surgical repair.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms Suggestive of a Brachial Plexus Injury?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Based on the location and severity of damage to the nerves, symptoms may differ. The common symptoms are:\n\n【13】1.  One experiences severe neuropathic pain that lasts for a long period. The pain is worst when the injury is closer to the spinal cord and least when it is farther.\n    \n2.  Numbness and weakness with a possible burning sensation over the shoulders, arms, and hands.\n    \n3.  Inability to move and function with the affected parts.\n    \n4.  Loss of sensation.\n    \n\n【14】How Are Brachial Plexus Injuries Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The doctor will determine the severity of nerve damage and location of injury by asking questions about the incident of trauma. This is followed by a physical examination involving various movements and sensory stimuli of the shoulders, arms, and hands. Tests are conducted to determine the level of function controlled by each nerve group in the brachial plexus. Additional tests include:\n\n【16】*   Imaging studies such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the area of injury to visualize the damage.\n    \n*   Electrodiagnostic studies help confirm the diagnosis by evaluating the strength of nerve signals sent from the brachial plexus to different groups of muscles, which is indicative of functional impairment levels.\n    \n\n【17】How Is a Brachial Plexus Injury Treated?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【18】It is important to treat the injuries to the brachial plexus within a stipulated time frame from the event of injury to accomplish maximum recovery. Mild injuries may recover spontaneously in a few weeks to months after trauma. Meanwhile, one has to attend periodic monitoring and follow-up consults to ensure nerve healing. The other treatment modalities are:\n\n【19】1.  Surgical correction of the damaged nerves to restore functional abilities. One may attempt a nerve repair, nerve grafting procedure, or a never transfer to repair the damages. Tendon and muscle transfers are also attempted to regain the lost functions.\n    \n2.  Pain medications to help with the associated neuropathic pain.\n    \n3.  Physical and occupational therapies are recommended to prevent the muscles from going flaccid as regrowth and repair of nerves take a long time. Every surgical repair needs to be followed by a rehabilitation period to regain physical function.\n    \n\n【20】**Conclusion:**\n\n【21】Since more and more people are indulging in high-energy sports and high-speed motor vehicles, the incidence of brachial plexus injury is increasing every year. Mild to moderate injuries usually heal over time, and individuals can regain the functional abilities of their hands. Whereas severe injuries often require surgical correction. If one suffers from a neck or shoulder injury and has trouble moving or feeling the arm, the symptoms should be discussed with an expert medical professional and do the needful. Early intervention always brings in the best outcomes in a brachial plexus injury.\n\n【22】Article Resources\n\n【23】*   Brachial Plexus Injuries  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/brachial-plexus-injuries/\n*   Brachial Plexus Surgery  \n    https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/brachial-plexus-surgery\n*   Brachial Plexopathy  \n    https://www.aanem.org/Patients/Muscle-and-Nerve-Disorders/Brachial-Plexopathy\n*   Brachial Plexus Injury  \n    https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/brain-neurological-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury\n*   Take good care of a brachial plexus injury  \n    https://health.ucdavis.edu/orthopaedics/specialties/brachial-plexus-injury-treatment-surgery-sacramento.html\n*   Newborn Brachial Plexus Injuries  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/brachial-plexus.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "89c4f218-3d92-4e58-a825-80c78b7157e6", "title": "Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome - An Epidemic Borne From Capitalism", "text": "【0】Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome - An Epidemic Borne From Capitalism\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) is a rare systemic immune-mediated disorder that induced an epidemic in the United States during the late 80s due to ingestion of a highly popular and openly available health food supplement amino acid like L-tryptophan. This led to a complete ban and recall of the product in March 1990 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This restriction lasted until 2005, when L-tryptophan returned to the market.\n\n【2】Who Is Susceptible to Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】As per an estimate, nearly 5,000-10,000 individuals developed symptoms during the 1989 epidemic in the United States over six months. As per June 1993 reports, 1511 cases have been reported, out of which about 35 percent required hospitalization causing 37 deaths. About 84 percent of the population were females, and 97 percent were from non-Hispanic people. 86 percent of the population were above the age of 34, with a median age of 49. Almost all (over 98 percent) reported cases during the epidemic had consumed products from a single manufacturer. Similar cases were reported in Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.\n\n【4】What Causes Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome epidemic was caused by ingesting an L-tryptophan amino acid supplement manufactured by a single Japanese pharmaceutical company. The condition is attributed to L-tryptophan or 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) dietary supplements. 5-HTP is still being used as an L-tryptophan alternative. These supplements were used in body-building products, weight loss supplements, and sleep aids.\n\n【6】These synthetic amino acid supplements are produced by pharmaceutical companies with the help of genetically engineered bacteria. In December 1988, the manufacturer introduced a new strain of bacteria with a higher amino-acid yield. The bacterium is grown in vats and then goes through a series of filtration, crystallization, and separation steps. The purification procedure included the usage of activated carbon powder.\n\n【7】When the manufacturer started using the new strain, they reduced the quantity of activated carbon powder used for purification. Some of the fermentation batches manufactured between October 1988 and June 1989 skipped the filtration process, producing lower-grade amino acids. The triad of the new strain, along with decreased activated carbon and lower-grade products, led to the epidemic of 1989.\n\n【8】How Does L-Tryptophan Affect the Body?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】L-tryptophan gets converted into serotonin in the body. 5-HTP is also involved in the same metabolic pathway. Serotonin plays a crucial role in mood regulation, sleep cycle, digestion, nausea, wound healing, bone health, blood clotting, and sexual desire. Hence, the supplements were readily available to the general population having related complaints.\n\n【10】What Happened During the 1989 Epidemic?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   The first case appeared in October 1989 when three women who consumed L-tryptophan supplements presented with eosinophilia and myalgia. These findings were locally published. Thereafter, similar cases got reported all over the United States and several other countries.\n    \n*   Health departments conducted epidemiological studies within a few days, and by November, state health departments in New Mexico and Minnesota suspected a close association between L-tryptophan consumption and EMS.\n    \n*   CDC conducted national surveillance, and by November 11th, FDA issued a nationwide siren warning consumers against consuming the said supplement. The product was ordered to be recalled and removed from the shelves.\n    \n*   The number of cases sharply declined after the recall but not before the death of 37 patients. In most cases, patients were affected in the prime of their lives and developed deliberating diseases. The alertness of physicians and prompt responses by the CDC and FDA resulted in identifying the link between EMS and tryptophan-containing supplements.\n    \n*   In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Health Supplement Education Act (DHSEA), which greatly capped FDA’s control over supplements, due to which L-tryptophan-containing supplements legally returned to the shelves.\n    \n*   Isolated EMS cases were reported before the epidemic and after the ban. The pre-pandemic cases were attributed to L-tryptophan, but 5-HTP supplements were the causality of EMS during the ban since 5-HTP is involved in the metabolism of L-tryptophan to serotonin.\n    \n*   For the past several years, the National Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome Network (NEMSN) has reported many cases involving L-tryptophan and 5-HTP-containing supplements.\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The signs and symptoms of EMS are categorized into initial and later symptoms.\n\n【14】The initial symptoms include:\n\n【15】*   Acute pain.\n    \n*   Elevated eosinophil count (over 1000 cells/mm3).\n    \n*   Severe myalgias (muscle cramps and pain).\n    \n*   Myofascial pain syndrome (chronic muscle pain).\n    \n*   Neuropathy (numbness, weakness, burning pain, and loss of reflexes).\n    \n*   Neurologic pain in joints.\n    \n*   Tremor.\n    \n*   Peripheral edema.\n    \n*   Paresthesias (numbness, tingling, or burning sensation).\n    \n*   Fasciitis (inflammation of the fascia).\n    \n*   Morphia (yellow or ivory-colored dry skin).\n    \n*   Low-grade fever.\n    \n*   Pulmonary disorders.\n    \n*   Rashes.\n    \n*   Weakness.\n    \n*   Fatigue.\n    \n*   Gastrointestinal disorders.\n    \n*   Cardiac arrhythmias.\n    \n*   Hair loss.\n    \n*   Dyspnea or cough.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n\n【16】The later symptoms include:\n\n【17】*   Neurocognitive deficits (short-term memory loss, concentration, and communication problems).\n    \n*   Chronic myalgias and arthralgias (long-standing muscle and joint pains).\n    \n*   Severe axonal neuropathies (pain along a nerve cell).\n    \n*   Cardiomyopathy.\n    \n*   Liver cirrhosis.\n    \n*   Internal fibrosis of the bone.\n    \n*   Pulmonary hypertension.\n    \n*   A desmoid tumor (benign soft tissue tumors).\n    \n*   Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (autoimmune disorder by the histiocytes).\n    \n*   Scleroderma-like syndrome (skin disease with features similar to scleroderma).\n    \n*   Fibromyalgia syndrome (musculoskeletal pain and fatigue with sleep, memory, and mood issues).\n    \n*   Chronic fatigue syndrome.\n    \n*   Post-traumatic stress disorder.\n    \n*   Depression.\n    \n*   Visual and dental problems.\n    \n*   Sleeping disorders.\n    \n\n【18】How to Diagnose Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】EMS diagnosis depends on the physician’s observation and examination, as no serological tests are available for confirmatory diagnosis. The diagnosis criteria, as defined by the CDC in the wake of the 1989 pandemic, include the following:\n\n【20】*   Eosinophil count from a peripheral blood draw of above 1000 cells/mm3.\n    \n*   Severe muscle pain.\n    \n*   No other infection explains the presenting myalgia or eosinophilia.\n    \n\n【21】How Is Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Related to Toxic Oil Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Toxic oil syndrome is a rare systemic disorder that provoked an epidemic in Spain during the early 1980s. The condition was caused due to ingestion of rapeseed oil, intended for industrial use, fraudulently sold as olive oil. The consumers developed symptoms like dyspnea, cough, chest pain, headaches, fever, abdominal pain, dysphagia, nausea, skin rash, itching, tachycardia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, severe muscle pain, cramps, abnormally high levels of eosinophils.\n\n【23】According to a finding, the contaminant 3-phenyl amino-1,2-propanediol in the oil was chemically similar to phenylamino alanine (contaminant in L-tryptophan). The similarity in symptoms and chemical composition of the contaminants led to a probable hypothesis that there might be a similarity in the final pathway of neuromuscular damage seen in both conditions.\n\n【24】How to Treat or Manage Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】EMS symptom presentation is varied and diverse; hence a universal treatment protocol has not been established. Patients are prescribed symptomatic medication according to their specific manifestations. Muscle relaxants, analgesics, diuretics, and high doses of Corticosteroids (to reduce inflammation) are prescribed.\n\n【26】In the acute stages, patients are advised to reduce physical strain to avoid muscle cramps and myalgias. In chronic stages, individuals who practice regular physical activities tend to do better.\n\n【27】**What Is the Prognosis of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Most patients with EMS continue to live with the symptoms for three to four years after initiation of treatment. The severity of the condition depends on the quantity of supplements ingested prior to diagnosis. There tends to be severe muscle damage, causing lingering muscle spasms, pain, and fatigue. Patients with severe symptoms during the acute phase tend to have a poor diagnosis.\n\n【29】**What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   Toxic-oil syndrome.\n    \n*   Fibromyalgia.\n    \n*   Chronic fatigue syndrome.\n    \n*   Lupus (the body’s defense system attacks its own cells).\n    \n*   Arthritis (joint pain and swelling).\n    \n*   Eosinophilic fasciitis (inflammation of tissue under the skin).\n    \n*   Churg-Strauss syndrome (disease associated with blood vessel inflammation).\n    \n*   Hypereosinophilic syndrome (persistently high eosinophils-type of white blood cell).\n    \n*   Eosinophilic cellulitis (inflammatory skin disorder of unknown origin).\n    \n*   Scleroderma (an autoimmune disorder that causes the hardening of connective tissues).\n    \n\n【31】**What Are the Complications of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Untreated EMS can progress to several neuropathies, organ damage, fasciitis (fascia inflammation), gangrene (dead tissue), and, ultimately, death.\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】EMS is a condition borne out of negligence, but even after decades, the situation has not improved in the unregulated supplement industry. FDA currently has a limited say in the manufacture and distribution of supplements which has led to a manifold increase in unregulated and untested supplements flooding the market. Recently a similar adulteration in two popular protein-building supplements with ‘aegeline,’ which was not reported to the FDA, resulted in non-infectious acute hepatitis and liver failure. The FDA issued warnings to the manufacturer, and the Department of Justice brought criminal charges on all manufacturers that used the unreported product, which seems too little and too late.\n\n【35】Article Resources\n\n*   Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome - NORD  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/eosinophilia-myalgia-syndrome/\n*   Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome | Apfed  \n    https://apfed.org/about-ead/eosinophilia-myalgia-syndrome/\n*   National Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Network  \n    http://nemsn.org/node/1\n*   The clinical spectrum of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan ingestion.  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2360751/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It causes distortion or loss of central vision. It mainly affects the males, especially in the twenty to sixty age group. Above sixty years, the disease shows bilateral involvement. Females involved belong to an older age group. American Africans, Caucasians, and Asians are at a higher risk of contracting CSCR.\n\n【2】What Is Retina?\n---------------\n\n【3】The retina is present at the back of the eye and helps sense the external light and transfer the formed images to the brain. Retina has a rich meshwork of blood vessels and nerves.\n\n【4】What Is the Main Causative Factor of CSCR?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】CSCR is of multifactorial origin. Therefore, no single pinpoint cause is responsible for the development of the disease. However, there is a strong association between the abnormal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and CSCR. Other causative factors include:\n\n【6】*   Steroids, both exogenous and endogenous, are responsible for altering the permeability of the choroidal capillaries.\n    \n*   Stress and people with a low threshold for distress show overexpression of stress hormones like steroids and catecholamines.\n    \n*   Helicobacter pylori infection causes increased oxidative stress in the retinal tissues.\n    \n*   The use of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) modulates the choroidal blood flow.\n    \n*   Obstructive sleep apnea.\n    \n*   Increase in sympathetic activity.\n    \n*   Genetic factors.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Additional Contributing Risk Factors Associated With CSCR?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Numerous factors are linked to the initiation and progression of the disease. These include:\n\n【9】*   Pregnancy.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    I have sudden blurring of vision on one eye. Is it due to retinal detachment?\n    \n    What causes a sudden blurry vision in the left eye?\n    \n    I have a very large floater in my eye, and I rubbed it. Is retinal detachment the cause?\n    \n*   Antibiotic usage.\n    \n*   Alcohol abuse.\n    \n*   Untreated hypertension.\n    \n*   Disturbances in sleep pattern.\n    \n*   Psychiatric disorders like depression.\n    \n*   End-stage renal disease.\n    \n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus.\n    \n*   Organ transplantation.\n    \n\n【10】What Is the Mechanism Behind the Formation of CSCR?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】It is challenging to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the instigation of CSCR. However, the increase in vessel permeability supplying the middle layer of the eyewall (choroid) and choking (congestion) of the veins leads to fluid leakage from the capillaries. The leak reduced the blood flow (ischemia) and increased hydrostatic pressure in the choroidal network resulting in RPE damage and focal lesions. The retinal blood and external blood barrier break down, thus causing an accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space.\n\n【12】What Are the Different Forms of CSCR?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【13】CSCR is of two forms:\n\n【14】*   The acute form of the CSCR lesions is characterized by localized damage to the RPE, and the lesions regress spontaneously. In addition, there is an increase in choroidal thickness due to new blood vessels (choroidal neovascularization). However, other outer layers of the choroid are intact.\n    \n*   Chronic forms of CSCR show diffuse RPE lesions and result in deterioration of the visual acuity. In addition, it affects the inner layers of the choroid with thinning of the inner layers. It is also associated with choroid neovascularization.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Clinical Features of CSCR?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】The main symptom expressed by patients suffering from CSCR is loss of visual acuity.\n\n【17】*   Clinical examination with an ophthalmoscope reveals detachment of the macula. In addition, yellow subretinal deposits are seen in the region of nerve detachment.\n    \n*   The presence of gray, fibrous subretinal fluid leakage is seen.\n    \n*   In recent cases, multiple RPE lesions are seen in the case of macular edema with shallow detachments or elevation of the retina.\n    \n*   Other frequently encountered signs and symptoms include:\n    \n*   Reduction in the perceived size of the object (micropsia).\n    \n*   Abnormal color perception (dyschromatopsia).\n    \n*   Diminished contrast sensitivity by the eyes.\n    \n\n【18】How Is CSCR Diagnosed?\n----------------------\n\n【19】Diagnosis of CSCR is mainly made by clinical examination. Imaging and other diagnostic procedures aid in treatment planning and the diagnosis by ruling out other diseases with similar patterns.\n\n【20】*   Amsler grid is used to detect concealed macular edema lesions and localize the affected visual field.\n    \n*   Fluorescein angiography (FA) is performed to rule out any subretinal new blood vessel formation (neovascularization). It shows the classic ink-dot, smoke pattern appearance of the lesion.\n    \n*   Optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps assess the fibrous subretinal fluid and the patient's progress after treatment. It also majorly helps in detecting choroidal neovascularization.\n    \n*   Fundus autofluorescence is functional imaging performed to study the RPE, choriocapillaris, and choroid.\n    \n*   Indocyanine Green angiography helps detect the leakage from the blood vessels that enter the subretinal space. It also helps in investigating the abnormal functioning of choriocapillaris.\n    \n\n【21】What Are the Conditions That Mimic CSCR?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【22】Differential diagnosis of CSCR encompasses all the conditions causing macular detachment. The states with a neurosensory break in the macula include:\n\n【23】*   Macular derangement.\n    \n*   Choroidal tumor.\n    \n*   Hypertensive choroidopathy.\n    \n*   Retinal vein occlusion.\n    \n\n【24】How Is CSCR Managed?\n--------------------\n\n【25】CSCR being a limiting condition hardly requires any treatment. However, treatment is advised in case of recurrent or chronic lesions. Therefore, management of CSCR involves both medical and surgical management.\n\n【26】**Medical Management of CSCR Comprises O**f:\n\n【27】*   Anti-steroidal therapy with Spironolactone and Eplerenone is linked to decreased fluid accumulation. However, the anti-steroids are given with caution as they increase potassium in the body resulting in congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. In addition, melatonin, an endogenous neuromodulator, is known to have an inhibitory effect on steroids.\n    \n*   Treatment of the helicobacter pylori infection also is linked to faster resolution of the subretinal fluid.\n    \n*   Intravitreal and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is beneficial in patients with coexisting choroidal pathology.\n    \n\n【28】**Surgical Management of CSCR**:\n\n【29】It is recommended in chronic, long persistent, and recurrent cases.\n\n【30】*   Laser photocoagulation is considered in patients with RPE not involving the fovea present in the retina. It can cause other complications like choroidal neovascularization and scotomas (blind spots in vision).\n    \n*   Photodynamic therapy with Verteporfin and warm lasers help in damaging the newly formed vessels and intercepts the abnormal blood flow. It is given in low doses to avoid secondary complications like the stimulation of VEGF. PDT is more effective than the intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF.\n    \n*   Subthreshold micropulse laser overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional laser by emitting a pulse flow of light, hence preventing overheating of the adjacent tissues. In addition, it mainly inhibits the formation of new blood vessels (anti-angiogenic effect).\n    \n\n【31】What Are the Complications of CSCR?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】Recurrent and persistent infection of the lesion due to disruption of the retinal architecture leads to some lasting eye complications like:\n\n【33】*   Decrease in night vision.\n    \n*   Reduction of color discrimination.\n    \n*   Bullous retinal detachment.\n    \n*   Scarring of the RPE.\n    \n*   Fibrosis of the subretinal space.\n    \n\n【34】What Is the Prognosis of CSCR?\n------------------------------\n\n【35】CSCR is a self-limiting condition. The acute form of the disease resolves spontaneously. However, management is required in chronic states to minimize further complications. The overall prognosis of the disease is excellent. However, CSCR has a high recurrence rate.\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】CSCR remains a mysterious disease with a multifactorial cause. The initiation and progression of the disease are still unclear. Blurred vision is the chief problem encountered in these patients. However, most cases get resolved by themselves with good visual acuity.\n\n【38】Article Resources\n\n【39】*   Central serous chorioretinopathy  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17662099/#:~:text=Central%20serous%20chorioretinopathy%20(CSC)%20is,in%20men%20than%20in%20women.\n*   Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: Pathogenesis and Management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6897067/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "cea4a118-e200-44d4-a035-13c16052bf71", "title": "Tricuspid Valve Disease - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Tricuspid Valve Disease - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Tricuspid valve disease is a condition where the valve is situated between the right atrium and right ventricle of the heart. The valve may be stiff or narrow (stenosis), leak (regurgitation), and be formed incorrectly at birth (atresia). Over time the symptoms of this condition can cause heart damage. In most cases, tricuspid valve disease cannot be prevented. But seeking the proper treatment at an early stage and following the doctor’s instructions can help in managing the condition. Untreated cases of tricuspid valve disease often have a poor prognosis.\n\n【2】What Is Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Tricuspid valve disease is a condition of the heart that affects a valve situated between the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart has four chambers called the right atrium, right ventricle left ventricle, and left atrium. The tricuspid valve located between the right side chambers of the heart is one of the four valves of the heart, namely, the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, and aortic valve. The tricuspid valve opens and closes in a coordinated fashion to make sure that the blood flows in the right direction from the right atrium to the right ventricle. This enables efficient pumping of the blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs for adequate oxygenation. When this function is impaired, tricuspid valve disease occurs. In severe cases, surgical repair or replacement of the valve may be required to prevent complications, relieve the symptoms, prolong survival, and improve the quality of life.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The types of tricuspid valve disease are:\n\n【6】*   **Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation** **-** Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when the tricuspid valve does not close properly or tightly enough. Due to this, the blood leaks backward through the valve whenever the right ventricle contracts. The amount of blood in the atrium increases because of this leakage. This buildup of blood in the atrium can enlarge it and change the pressure in the heart and blood vessels, causing heart damage.\n    \n*   **Tricuspid Atresia** **-** It is a birth defect in an infant who has a solid piece of tissue in place of the tricuspid valve. This tissue limits blood flow and affects the development of the right ventricle. This condition can be corrected through surgery.\n    \n*   **Tricuspid Valve Stenosis** **-** Tricuspid valve stenosis occurs when the tricuspid valve is too narrow or stiff. Due to this, the blood flow is restricted between the two chambers of the heart. The right atrium is enlarged over time, affecting the blood flow and pressure. This condition can decrease the amount of blood that circulates through the lungs and the rest of the body.\n    \n\n【7】What Is the Etiology of Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】There are several things that can cause tricuspid valve disease, including:\n\n【9】*   Enlarged right ventricle.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Troponin-T, MR and TR levels are high after first heart attack. Please help.\n    \n    Kindly give a second opinion on my father's second heart attack and stent placement.\n    \n    Tricuspid Stenosis - Types, Causes, Symptoms, and Management\n    \n*   Congenital defects like Ebstein's anomaly (tricuspid valve is placed in the wrong position with malformed valve flaps).\n    \n*   Infections like endocarditis (infection of the inner lining of the heart) or rheumatic fever.\n    \n*   Carcinoid syndrome (a cancerous tumor that secretes certain chemicals into the bloodstream).\n    \n*   Systemic health conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (an inflammatory disorder that affects the joints, including the joints of hands and feet), Marfan syndrome (an inherited disorder affecting the connective tissue), or lupus (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks its own tissues).\n    \n*   Medications such as Fenfluramine and Phentermine.\n    \n*   Pulmonary hypertension (increased blood pressure affecting the arteries in the lung and the heart).\n    \n*   Injury or trauma such as damage from myocardial biopsy, pacemaker, or heart attack.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The signs and symptoms of tricuspid valve disease differ among patients. Some people with mild cases show no signs and symptoms, while those with moderate to severe cases might have noticeable symptoms like:\n\n【12】*   Weakness or fatigue.\n    \n*   Abnormal heart rhythm.\n    \n*   Swelling in the abdomen, legs, ankles, or feet.\n    \n*   Heart murmur.\n    \n*   Fluttering or pulsating feeling in the chest or neck.\n    \n*   Shortness of breath.\n    \n*   Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly).\n    \n*   Abnormally cold skin.\n    \n\n【13】How to Diagnose Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【14】To diagnose tricuspid valve disease, the doctor will ask about the symptoms and medical history and conduct a physical examination which involves feeling the veins in the neck, listening to the heart with a stethoscope, and taking the blood pressure.\n\n【15】*   **Echocardiogram** **-** It is the most common diagnostic test to diagnose tricuspid valve disease. This test provides detailed ultrasound imaging of the heart. The transducer or sound device may be inserted into the esophagus called a transesophageal echocardiogram or placed on the chest wall called a transthoracic echocardiogram.\n    \n*   **Electrocardiogram** **-** In this test, the electrodes are used to record the electrical signals from the heart to evaluate irregularities in the heart.\n    \n*   **Chest X-ray** **-** This test uses a small dose of ionizing radiation to create an image of the heart and nearby structures. It helps to check the size of the heart and other findings suggestive of tricuspid valve disease.\n    \n*   **Heart MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** **\\-** This test uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves, and a computer to produce a comprehensive image of the heart and nearby blood vessels.\n    \n*   **Cardiac Catheterization** **-** It is a diagnostic method that uses a thin, flexible tube known as a catheter. The catheter is inserted through a blood vessel into the heart, and it evaluates the abnormalities suggestive of tricuspid valve disease. This method also helps in the treatment of the condition.\n    \n\n【16】What Are the Treatment Options for Tricuspid Valve Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The management of tricuspid valve disease depends on the severity of the condition, the symptoms, and the underlying cause.\n\n【18】**1) Medications** **-** Certain medicines are prescribed to relieve the symptoms and prolong survival. The medicines include:\n\n【19】*   Antiarrhythmic medications.\n    \n*   Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\n    \n*   Digoxin (used to treat heart failure).\n    \n*   Anticoagulants.\n    \n*   Diuretics (used to remove the extra fluid from the body).\n    \n\n【20】**2) Surgery** **-** Surgical options include tricuspid valve repair or replacement. The tricuspid valve repair involves inserting a synthetic annuloplasty ring that helps in tightening and stabilizing the existing valve. Tricuspid valve replacement involves the removal of the existing damaged valve and the insertion of a new mechanical or biological valve. Insertion of the mechanical valve requires life-long treatment with blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clot formation on the valve. These surgical options can be done by minimally invasive approaches like robotic-assisted techniques. With all surgical procedures, there are risks of infection, bleeding, blood clot formation, and prolonged pain after the operation.\n\n【21】**Conclusion:**\n\n【22】Tricuspid valve disease is a heart condition involving the tricuspid valve located in between the right side chambers of the heart. It occurs when the function of the tricuspid valve is impaired. Mild tricuspid valve disease may not show any signs or symptoms. But moderate to severe cases show noticeable symptoms that, if left untreated, may lead to heart damage. The treatment involves medicines and surgical procedures.\n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Tricuspid valve disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494422/\n*   Tricuspid valve diseases  \n    https://ctsurgerypatients.org/adult-heart-disease/tricuspid-valve-disease\n*   Tricuspid Valve Disease  \n    https://www.umcvc.org/conditions-treatments/tricuspid-valve-disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is only 80 % effective, as precum can also result in pregnancy.\n\n【22】**Male Condom:**\n\n【23】A condom is a thin cover made of latex or polyurethane, which is put on the penis, that forms a barrier and prevents pregnancy by stopping the sperm from entering the vagina. It is 82 % effective. In addition, it also prevents the transmission of sexual infections.\n\n【24】_image source: avert_\n\n【25】**Female Condom:**\n\n【26】Female condoms are made of polyurethane with flexible rings at both ends. The inner ring holds the condom in place behind the pubic bone, and the other ring stays outside the vagina. A female condom is placed inside the vagina before sexual intercourse. It is 79 % effective.\n\n【27】_image source: avert_\n\n【28】**Birth Control Sponge:**\n\n【29】A contraceptive sponge is a soft disc-shaped polyurethane foam, which prevents sperm from entering the uterus. The sponge also contains spermicide that blocks and kills sperm. The sponge has a depression in the middle which holds it in place over the cervix. It is from 76 to 88 % effective.\n\n【30】The sponge needs to be thoroughly wet to activate the spermicide, so do not forget to wet it properly before inserting it.\n\n【31】_image source: img.webmd_\n\n【32】**Diaphragm Birth Control:**\n\n【33】A diaphragm is a dome-shaped barrier device made of rubber, which is placed behind the woman’s pubic bone. For more effectiveness, it is used along with spermicide or contraceptive jelly. The spermicide is filled in the dome-shaped structure before inserting. It is 88 % effective.\n\n【34】_image source: i.ytimg_\n\n【35】**Cervical Cap:**\n\n【36】A cervical cap is a deep silicone cup that is inserted into the vagina. It tightly fits over the cervix due to suction. It has to be filled with spermicide before inserting and is 88 % effective.\n\n【37】_image source: img.webmd_\n\n【38】**Copper Intrauterine Device:**\n\n【39】A copper intrauterine device is a T-shaped plastic body with copper wrapped around its stem. It can also be used as an emergency contraceptive if it is inserted within five days after unprotected intercourse. Once inserted by the doctor, it can last for up to 10 years. It is 99 % effective.\n\n【40】_image source: coopersurgical_\n\n【41】**Birth Control Pills:**\n\n【42】Birth control pills contain two female hormones, that is progesterone and estrogen. These pills work by preventing ovulation or by thickening the mucus around the cervix or by altering the uterine lining. There are two types of hormonal birth control pills:\n\n【43】*   **Combination pills** \\- They are the most effective and contain both the hormones.\n    \n*   **Mini-pills or progestin-only pills** - This contains a low dose of progesterone, and is slightly less effective.\n    \n*   If you take the tablets as prescribed without missing any pills, they are the most effective. In recent years, birth control pills are also prescribed through birth control prescription online consultations.\n    \n\n【44】**Birth Control Patch:**\n\n【45】It is a transdermal patch, which when applied on the skin prevents pregnancy by releasing synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone hormones. The patch is worn for three weeks on the lower abdomen or buttock, and it is not used on the fourth week for periods. It is 91 % effective.\n\n【46】**Hormonal Intrauterine Device:**\n\n【47】This intrauterine device releases progestin, which prevents ovulation. It will last for three to five years.\n\n【48】_imagesource: drugwatch_\n\n【49】**Birth Control Ring:**\n\n【50】Vaginal or birth control rings are made of plastic flexible rings, which release a continuous low dose of progesterone for 3 weeks. It works by preventing ovulation and by thickening the cervical mucus, thus preventing the sperm from entering the uterus. Due to human errors in placement, it is 91 % effective.\n\n【51】_image source: medlineplus_\n\n【52】**Birth Control Implants:**\n\n【53】A 40 mm flexible tube is inserted under the skin of a woman’s upper arm, which prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones. It is 99 % effective. The most common types of implants used are:\n\n【54】*   Single-rod Etonogestrel implant.\n    \n*   Double-rod Levonorgestrel implant.\n    \n\n【55】_image source: cdn-img_\n\n【56】**Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP):**\n\n【57】Pills used to prevent pregnancy by women who have had unprotected sexual intercourse or when the other birth control method has failed are called ECP or morning-after pills. This has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The earlier you take it, the more effective it will be. These pills either contain Levonorgestrel or Ulipristal acetate.\n\n【58】**Injection:**\n\n【59】The contraceptive injection is a long-acting progestin-only birth control drug, which is injected once in 3 months. It prevents ovulation and is 94 % effective.\n\n【60】**Female Sterilization:**\n\n【61】These are surgical procedures done to prevent a woman from getting pregnant permanently. These procedures are 99 % effective. The two procedures used are:\n\n【62】*   **Tubal Ligation** - It is a surgical procedure where the woman’s fallopian tube is cut or clamped or sealed to prevent the egg from reaching the uterus for implantation.\n    \n*   **Tubal Implant** - Here, the fallopian tubes are blocked by placing a coil in them, which results in tissue growth around the coil.\n    \n\n【63】**Male Sterilization:**\n\n【64】Male sterilization or vasectomy is a surgical procedure, where the vas deferens are cut or tied or sealed to prevent sperm from entering the penis from the testes.\n\n【65】**Conclusion:**\n\n【66】No birth control method is 100 % effective in preventing pregnancy. So consult your doctor and combine two methods to get extra protection. If you are still not sure about which birth control to choose, consult a gynecologist online, who will guide you in selecting the best method suited for you. Getting birth control prescription online is easier and reliable on telemedicine platforms.\n\n【67】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【68】* * *\n\n【69】#### **1.**\n\n【70】#### **How effective is birth control?**\n\n【71】Birth control's effectiveness depends on the method of birth control, how you use it, and other factors. For example, birth control pills are 99.9 % effective if you take them regularly, but if you miss a tablet, the effectiveness reduces to 91 %. The same goes for all other methods.\n\n【72】#### **2.**\n\n【73】#### **How does birth control work?**\n\n【74】\\- Most birth control methods, including pills and implants, provide estrogen and progesterone to the body, which prevents the body from ovulating. These hormones also thicken the cervical mucus, making it difficult for the sperm to reach the uterus.  \n\\- If the birth control method only releases progesterone, they mainly work by thickening the cervical mucus and thinning the endometrium (lining of the uterus).  \n\\- Physical barriers, such as condoms and vaginal cups, block the entry of sperm into the uterus.\n\n【75】#### **3.**\n\n【76】#### **How long does it take for birth control to work?**\n\n【77】If appropriately used, barrier birth control methods provide immediate birth control action. Birth control pills, however, will take anywhere from 2 to 7 days to start working.\n\n【78】#### **4.**\n\n【79】#### **What happens if you take birth control pills while pregnant?**\n\n【80】Some old studies suggest that continuing to take birth control pills even after conceiving can increase the risk of congenital abnormalities. According to a study conducted in 2015, taking pills when you are pregnant will not increase the risk of major birth abnormalities. A study conducted in 2016 showed that babies born to mothers who took birth control pills are more prone to wheezing and rhinitis.\n\n【81】#### **5.**\n\n【82】#### **What is the best form of birth control?**\n\n【83】Implants and IUD (intrauterine devices) are known to provide the best birth control, as they are the most convenient to use. The other methods, like condoms, pill, ring, patch, and injection, also are good options, provided you use them correctly.\n\n【84】#### **6.**\n\n【85】#### **How to get birth control pills without a doctor?**\n\n【86】Birth control pills, like all other medications, have some side effects. These side effects can be severe if combined with a pre-existing condition or interaction with some other drug you are on. To prevent this, it is crucial to consult a doctor and take birth control pills only if he or she prescribes them.\n\n【87】#### **7.**\n\n【88】#### **How to stop spotting while on birth control pills?**\n\n【89】Spotting is commonly seen in the first 3 to 4 months of using birth control pills. This can be prevented or reduced by taking the pill at the exact same time every day.\n\n【90】#### **8.**\n\n【91】#### **What medicines can interact with birth control pills?**\n\n【92】The following pills can make birth control pills less effective:  \n\\- Antibiotics (Rifampicin).  \n\\- Antifungal drugs (Griseofulvin).  \n\\- Antiepileptic drugs (Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)  \n\\- Drugs used to treat HIV.\n\n【93】#### **9.**\n\n【94】#### **How long do antibiotics affect birth control?**\n\n【95】The antibiotic Rifampin is known to reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. So to prevent pregnancy while on this antibiotic, use a condom or some other barrier birth control method during the antibiotic treatment and until a week after.\n\n【96】#### **10.**\n\n【97】#### **What happens if a man takes birth control pills?**\n\n【98】It will not make much difference if a man takes one or two birth control pills, as the levels of female hormones in the pills will not be enough to result in hormonal imbalance. But, taking these pills regularly for a prolonged period can result in breast enlargement, shrinking of testicles, decreased facial hair, and decreased sex drive. The hormones might protect against heart attacks.\n\n【99】#### **11.**\n\n【100】#### **What is the best time of day to take birth control pills?**\n\n【101】You can take pills at any time during the day, but make sure you take them at the same time every day. It is easier to remember if you take it before breakfast or before going to bed.\n\n【102】#### **12.**\n\n【103】#### **Which contraception has the least side effects?**\n\n【104】All birth control methods have some degree of side effects associated with them. IUD and implants are one with the least side effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "577e42af-341a-4176-b3df-976d44ace754", "title": "Pediatric Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome", "text": "【0】**Introduction**\n\n【1】Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMPS) is a term for non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain. Several studies have noted amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, usually in children ranging in age from 11.5 to 15 years, and often in girls. Children below four years of age have never been reported with the syndrome.\n\n【2】What Is Pediatric Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome is a condition in which excruciating pain is experienced anywhere in the body in children. The pain can be sudden in onset or persistent, localized to a particular area of the body or affect the whole body.\n\n【4】What Is the Cause of Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome in Children?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Amplified musculoskeletal pain in children could be caused by:\n\n【6】*   **Injuries -** Such as burns, deep cuts, fractures of the bone, or excessive strain on the muscle can cause a tear.\n    \n*   **Diseases -** Such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tendonitis, and influenza.\n    \n*   **Psychological Stress -** Due to an unfortunate event or childhood trauma.\n    \n\n【7】Normally, for an individual, the sensation of pain is due to the signal from the nerve endings that are sent to the brain from the site of the affected, through the spinal cord to the brain. In the case of an abnormal reflex, when this pathway is interrupted due to any of the causes, the pain signals go to the brain and autonomic nerves (neurovascular nerves). Autonomic nerves control blood flow through the blood vessels.\n\n【8】When the pain signal reaches the autonomic nerves, it causes the blood vessels to constrict. The constriction causes a decrease in blood flow to the organs and tissues, which causes waste to build up in the body. The decrease in oxygen and increase in waste products are responsible for the amplified pain the child experiences. This amplified pain further decreases the oxygen supply by going through the abnormal reflex pathway, and the cycle continues, causing excruciating pain throughout the body.\n\n【9】What Are the Types of Amplified Pain?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【10】Amplified pain can be continuously experienced or have the following characteristics:\n\n【11】*   **Localized Amplified Pain Without Autonomic Changes -** One or two affected body regions.\n    \n*   **Diffuse Amplified Pain -** Three or more affected body regions. It is also called total body pain or juvenile fibromyalgia.\n    \n\n【12】*   **Intermittent Amplified Pain -** The episodes of pain come and go away on its own.\n    \n*   **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) With Autonomic Changes -** Autonomic changes include color and temperature changes, for example, cold and blue or swelling and sweating.\n    \n\n【13】What Are the Symptoms of Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain in Children?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The symptoms of amplified musculoskeletal pain may be sudden in onset or develop over weeks. Some of the common symptoms of amplified musculoskeletal pain are:\n\n【15】*   Pain - localized or generalized which may be constant or intermittent.\n    \n*   Change in Skin Color or Temperature - Localized or all over the body.\n    \n*   Allodynia - Increased sensitivity, with a normal touch of the skin feeling especially painful.\n    \n*   Headache, abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Trouble Sleeping and Concentrating - due to pain.\n    \n*   Difficult in Mobility - due to stiffness and swelling in joints.\n    \n*   Anxiety and depression due to the excruciating episodes of pain.\n    \n*   Tremors, paralysis, blindness, or non-epileptic seizures without the presence of any underlying explainable conditions.\n    \n\n【16】How to Diagnose Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain in Children?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The diagnosis of amplified musculoskeletal pain is confirmed after all the other possibilities of pain are ruled out and by the child's presentation of episodes of pain.\n\n【18】*   A physical examination to assess the joints, mobility, and strength of muscles and bones is conducted.\n    \n*   X-rays and scans may help find the cause (a sign of injury) for amplified musculoskeletal pain. Blood tests are usually normal for amplified musculoskeletal pain unless an underlying disease condition is present (for example: juvenile idiopathic arthritis).\n    \n*   Any possibility of psychological stress for the child is carefully assessed; this could be a stressor for amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome or a consequence of the condition.\n    \n\n【19】How to Treat Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome in Children?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The treatment focuses mainly on the physical functioning and emotional well-being of the child.\n\n【21】1\\. **Regular Exercise:**\n\n【22】*   Regular exercise (physical therapy) is important for the child to improve blood flow and physical function including strength, balance, and flexibility. A trainer or a therapist can curate an exercise plan suited best for the child based on the symptoms experienced.\n    \n*   Highly intense aerobic exercises for up to six hours a day may also be done to improve circulation and mobility for the child.\n    \n*   Desensitizing techniques are exercises that are done to reduce sensitivity (allodynia) so that normal contact with the skin feels less painful. Texture rubbing (soap, lotion, towel, ice), constant touch, or pressure are some of the commonly used desensitizing techniques that can help children. The average duration of the training is two weeks. As the exercises progress, the location of pain may change for some children, and that is quite normal. The aim is to exercise through the pain and train the brain to respond normally to stimuli. Once the child cooperates and is motivated to get back to normal, the exercises can be done at home. Following the instructions and duration for the exercises is necessary to avoid a relapse of the condition.\n    \n\n【23】2\\. **Psychological Therapy:** On the evaluation of the child, if any possibility of a psychological factor being a stressor is uncovered, relevant counseling therapies are initiated. Psychological therapy helps the child express feelings and thoughts and to control the anxiety episodes and depression if present as a consequence of amplified musculoskeletal therapy.\n\n【24】Psychological therapy assists the child to relax and calm the body’s stress response. Meditation, imagination, or progressive muscle relaxation are some of the techniques that are practiced. Children also learn coping skills and stress management through journaling, creative writing, art, music, etc. These practices also help reduce the fear of pain in children. Sometimes, these sessions may include parents or other family members to ensure an understanding of the health condition from the child’s perspective.\n\n【25】Most children return to normalcy within a few weeks or a month of exercise. Some may occasionally continue to have episodes of mild pain, and recover over time. Some of the children experience relapses after six months of physical therapy and exercises, which are successfully managed with physical therapy itself. Recurrent relapse episodes must not be ignored, and exercises must begin early to prevent the development of any significant disabilities in the child.\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】It takes a team approach to treat the child’s condition and break the pain cycle. Once children with amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome understand that the body is not actually in pain, it helps the child cope better and work through the pain. With regular exercise following the diagnosis, the child can restore function, resolve the pain eventually, and lead a quality life.\n\n【28】Article Resources\n\n【29】*   Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS)  \n    https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/amplified-musculoskeletal-pain-syndrome-amps\n*   Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS)  \n    https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Amplified-Musculoskeletal-Pain-Syndrome-AMPS\n*   Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS)  \n    https://www.columbiadoctors.org/childrens-health/pediatric-specialties/rheumatology/treatments-conditions/amplified-musculoskeletal-pain-syndrome-amps#:~:text=What%20is%20AMPS%3F,it%20is%20often%20called%20fibromyalgia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are composed of various substances such as protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells. The presence of urinary casts can indicate a variety of kidney disorders, and their shape, size, and composition can provide important information about the underlying condition.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of the Urinary Casts?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are several different types of urinary casts, including hyaline, granular, waxy, and fatty casts. Hyaline casts are the most common type and are composed of protein. They are typically seen in patients with dehydration or kidney injury. Granular casts are also composed of protein, but they have a granular appearance. They are typically seen in patients with nephritis or other inflammatory kidney disorders.\n\n【4】Waxy casts are composed of lipids and are typically seen in patients with chronic kidney disease. They are a sign of advanced kidney damage. Fatty casts are composed of fat droplets and are typically seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【5】The presence of urinary casts can also indicate the presence of other kidney disorders such as kidney stones, acute kidney injury, or interstitial nephritis. In addition, urinary casts can also be caused by certain medications or toxins.\n\n【6】Urinary casts are usually detected during a routine urine examination. They can be seen under a microscope by a trained healthcare professional. The healthcare professional will examine the urine sample for the presence of casts and, if present, will describe the type and number of casts seen.\n\n【7】How to Perform a Urinary Cast Test?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】A urinary cast test is a laboratory test that is performed to detect the presence of urinary casts in a urine sample. The test is usually performed as part of a routine urine examination.\n\n【9】Related Topics\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Kidney Stones in Children\n\n【12】Abiraterone Acetate - Uses, Dosage, and Side Effects\n\n【13】From yesterday I have a problem while peeing. Please help.\n\n【14】The following are the general steps to perform a urinary cast test:\n\n【15】*   Collect a clean-catch urine sample. This involves cleaning the area around the urethra with soap and water and then collecting a midstream urine sample in a sterile container.\n    \n*   Label the container with the patient's name, date, and time of collection.\n    \n*   Take a small amount of urine from the container and place it on a microscope slide.\n    \n*   Add a few drops of urine to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge the sample for about five minutes.\n    \n*   Carefully pour off the supernatant fluid, and then resuspend the sediment in a small amount of the supernatant fluid.\n    \n*   Place a small drop of the resuspended sediment on a microscope slide, and then add a coverslip.\n    \n*   Examine the urine sample under a microscope using high power (40x). Look for any casts that may be present in the urine sample.\n    \n*   Record the type, number, and shape of the casts observed.\n    \n\n【16】Why Is the Test Performed?\n--------------------------\n\n【17】A urinary cast test is performed to detect the presence of urinary casts in a urine sample. The presence of urinary casts can indicate a variety of kidney disorders, and their shape, size, and composition can provide important information about the underlying condition. The presence of urinary casts can indicate a variety of kidney disorders, including:\n\n【18】*   **Nephritis:** An inflammation of the kidneys that can be caused by a variety of conditions such as infection, autoimmune disorders, or exposure to certain toxins.\n    \n*   **Acute Kidney Injury:** A sudden loss of kidney function that can be caused by a variety of conditions such as dehydration, sepsis, or exposure to certain toxins.\n    \n*   **Chronic Kidney Disease**: A gradual loss of kidney function that a variety of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or genetic disorders can cause.\n    \n*   **Nephrotic Syndrome:** A condition characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia that can be caused by a variety of conditions such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, or amyloidosis.\n    \n*   **Interstitial Nephritis:** an inflammation of the kidneys that can be caused by a variety of conditions such as infection, autoimmune disorders, or exposure to certain medications or toxins.\n    \n\n【19】The test is also performed to monitor the progression of a known kidney disorder or to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. In addition, urinary casts can also be caused by certain medications or toxins. This is why it is important to know if the patient is taking any medication or has been exposed to toxins.\n\n【20】What Do Normal Test Results Mean?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】A normal urinary cast test result means no casts were detected in the urine sample. This is considered a healthy result and typically indicates that the kidneys are functioning properly. However, it is important to note that a normal result on a urinary cast test does not necessarily indicate that there are no other issues with the patient's kidney health. Additional tests such as blood tests, imaging studies, or kidney biopsies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and to identify any underlying issues.\n\n【22】What Do Abnormal Test Results Mean?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】Abnormal results of the tests may include:\n\n【24】*   The presence of fatty casts in urine may indicate the presence of lipids and is typically a complication associated with nephrotic syndrome.\n    \n*   Granular casts are seen as an indication of different kidney diseases.\n    \n*   The detection of red blood cell casts in urine signifies that there is a small amount of bleeding occurring in the kidney,\n    \n*   Renal tubular epithelial cell casts in urine samples can indicate damage to the tubule cells in the kidney. This can signify conditions such as renal tubular necrosis, viral infections such as CMV nephritis, and kidney transplant rejection.\n    \n*   Waxy casts can indicate advanced kidney disease and chronic kidney failure. On the other hand, white blood cell (WBC) casts are often associated with acute kidney infections and interstitial nephritis.\n    \n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】In conclusion, a urinary cast test is a laboratory test that is performed to detect the presence of urinary casts in a urine sample. The presence of urinary casts can indicate a variety of kidney disorders, and their shape, size, and composition can provide important information about the underlying condition. Several types of urinary casts include hyaline, granular, waxy, and fatty casts.

The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The condition develops in a child of six months to 18 months old. The disease occurs frequently in the lower limb. The affected children can sit up but are unable to walk. Most children survive to adulthood.\n\n【2】What Is Intermediate SMA Type 2?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Intermediate SMA type 2 is a rare genetic disorder with progressive loss of lower motor neurons (nerves cell controlling voluntary movement) resulting in muscle weakness and wasting.\n\n【4】The disease develops during infancy. Mutations in both copies of the SMN1 (survival motor neuron) gene, which are responsible for forming proteins essential for motor neuron and muscle health. The disease is further classified into Type II A and II B. Type II A patients lose the ability to sit independently but Type II B patients retain the ability to sit.\n\n【5】What Are the Symptoms of Intermediate SMA Type 2?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The distinctive feature of the disease is progressive muscle weakness that is more pronounced in the legs than in the arms. The muscles of the chest, throat, and mouth can also be affected by this disease.\n\n【7】*   Low muscle tone causes the limbs to become flabby (lose muscle). The loss of muscle tone is more prominent among muscles closest to the trunk such as shoulders, hip, and back. Facial and eye muscles are unaffected.\n    \n*   The patient experiences absence of deep tendon reflexes. For example, the lack of knee reflex when tapped. Some children during the early course of the disease have distal reflexes (Achilles tendon, muscle connecting calf to heel).\n    \n*   Contractures of muscle and connective tissue around the joint cause it to become short and hardened.\n    \n*   Most patients experience a postural tremor in their hands known as polyminimyoclonus.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Effects of Dexamethasone on Blood Sugar Levels - Types and Side Effects\n    \n    Obesity - What You Need to Know Before Planning a Regime to Lose Weight?\n    \n    Insulin - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n    \n*   Affected individuals show delayed milestone attainment and motor development.

The patients may lose the ability to sit gradually.\n    \n*   Weakness of muscle in the mouth causes difficulties in eating, chewing, and swallowing. Few patients have tongue fasciculations (twitching).\n    \n*   Chest muscle or intercoastal weakness results in breathing and coughing difficulties. The patients may develop lung infections or restrictive lung disease (reduction in lung volume capacity for air). It can be overcome with airway clearance or noninvasive lung support.\n    \n*   Weakness of the back muscle leads to scoliosis (sideway curvature of the spine). Hip dislocations are also common.\n    \n*   Patients with movement disabilities have a high-fat index and are at risk of being overweight.\n    \n\n【8】How Are Intermediate SMA Type 2 Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Patients with clinical features and family history are suspected of the disease. In individuals with a family history of the disease, prenatal screening of fetuses or newborns are necessary. Genetic testing of suspected patients can detect disease-causing mutations in the SMN1 gene.\n\n【10】The SMN2 gene is known to influence disease severity. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing of blood can measure copies of the SMN2 gene. The disease severity is low in patients with a high number of SMN2 gene copies. In patients with intermediate SMA type 2, three copies of SMN 2 are frequently found. Since the disease is an inherited condition genetic testing helps identify carriers.\n\n【11】If there is confusion about the evaluation of genetic studies. The individuals undergo a further examination with an electromyogram or muscle biopsy. This is not a confirmatory test for the disease.\n\n【12】Electromyograms examine the status of muscles and neurons that supply them. This method can also record muscle response to electrical stimulations by neurons. Whereas, the muscle biopsy requires a small portion of muscle tissue from the upper thigh or other regions to look for disease characteristics.\n\n【13】What Are the Treatment Options for Intermediate SMA Type 2?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   **Disease-Modifying Therapy:**\n    \n    *   There are three drugs approved for the treatment. The drugs are Spinraza, Evrysdi, and Zolgensma and are non-specific therapy for intermediate SMA type 2.\n        \n    *   Spinraza (nusinersen) is administered to the spine by injection. The drug acts by masking signals from the SMN2 gene which causes the protein to be shorter than usual. Treatment starts with four loading doses followed by a maintenance dose administered every four months. The medication is approved for all age groups, patients and forms of the disease.\n        \n    *   Evrysdi (risdiplam) is administered daily. The drug increases SMN protein production from the SMN2 gene. The medication can be taken orally or through a feeding tube. The medications are approved for all major forms of SMA in patients above 2 months of age.\n        \n    *   Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovecxioi) is a gene therapy. A healthy copy of the SMN1 gene is delivered by adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9, modified virus) to increase SMN protein production. The medication is administered once. The drug is approved for use in all main types of SMA in infants and toddlers till two years of life.\n        \n    *   The approved medication can slow the disease progression but cannot reverse the damage in the body. Early initiation of therapy can provide better outcomes. However, patients with moderate to advanced stages of the disease require supportive care.\n        \n*   **Supportive Therapy:**\n    \n    *   Motor function and support posture are enhanced with physical therapy and exercises.\n        \n    *   Occupational therapy helps patients with their day-to-day activities.\n        \n    *   Speech and language therapy can help the patient with chewing and swallowing.\n        \n    *   The patient’s breathing ability is enhanced with respiratory therapy.\n        \n    *   Strollers and wheelchairs can help patients with severe diseases with mobility.\n        \n    *   Specialized seats or chairs help with feeding and bathing.\n        \n    *   Using braces or standards provide structural support.\n        \n    *   Lung functions are supported with ventilators or cough assistance devices.\n        \n    *   Patients facing difficulties eating are assisted with gastrostomy tubes.\n        \n    *   Diet counseling is necessary to maintain good nutrition and digestion.\n        \n    *   Palliative care improves the quality of life in patients suffering from the disease for a long duration.\n        \n\n【15】What Is the Prognosis for Intermediate SMA Type 2?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The prognosis differs based on disease severity. Most patients survive to early adulthood without adequate treatment. There is no available cure for the disease but the currently approved medication slows the disease progression. When these treatments are provided during the early stage of the disease the patient can attain developmental milestones without many difficulties.\n\n【17】**Conclusion:**\n\n【18】The patients suffering from intermediate SMA type 2 are normal at birth. The disease develops between six to eighteen months and varies in severity. The defining feature of the disease is the inability to stand or walk on their own. However, the patient can sit without any external help which is lost as the disease progresses. Most patients leave up to early adulthood or longer.\n\n【19】Article Resources\n\n【20】*   Spinal muscular atrophy type 2  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4945/spinal-muscular-atrophy-type-2/\n*   Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)  \n    https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy/types\n*   Spinal muscular atrophy  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/spinal-muscular-atrophy/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "08716263-2a97-4d10-9023-67fb414c2a6c", "title": "Penile Rehabilitation Programs", "text": "【0】Why Penile Rehabilitation?\n--------------------------\n\n【1】Penile rehabilitation is also called erectile function recovery therapy or penile rehabilitation therapy and is done following radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the entire prostate gland). It is done to restore natural erectile function.\n\n【2】Erectile dysfunction is the failure to obtain an erection or erection that is appropriate for penetration. It is a common complication associated with prostate cancer treatment in men, especially in the case of the surgical removal of the prostate. Erectile dysfunction is seen even in cases of bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.\n\n【3】The nerves involved with erection are close to the prostate gland and get affected during surgical prostate removal. This injury to the cavernosal nerve leads to hypoxia and fibrosis of the penile tissue. The restoration of erectile function may take around 1.5 to 2 years after the surgery. Other factors contributing to erectile dysfunction include:\n\n【4】*   The age of the patient.\n*   The surgery procedure (nerve-sparing or not).\n*   Erectile function before surgery.\n*   Lifestyle and habits.\n*   Hormones.\n*   Medications.\n\n【5】The penile tissue requires an oxygen-rich blood supply to prevent scarring and fibrosis. The interventions taken after surgery help prevent scar tissue formation in the penis.\n\n【6】What Are the Medications for Erectile Dysfunction?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Phosphodiesterase (PDE-5 inhibitors) are used for treating erectile dysfunction. PDE-5 inhibitors cause the relaxation of blood vessels in the penis that aids in a natural erection. However, these medications work only in the presence of adequately functioning nerves when sexual stimulation occurs. The associated side effects include the following:\n\n【8】*   Headache.\n*   Nose stuffiness.\n*   Facial flushing.\n*   Heartburn.\n\n【9】There are available in tablet form and include the following:\n\n【10】*   Tadalafil.\n*   Sildenafil.\n*   Vardenafil.\n\n【11】To obtain the required result, the medication should be taken for a minimum of three months regularly. Tadalafil has a longer duration of action, and usually, a dose of 20 mg is given thrice a week. Sildenafil is to be taken daily, and the dosage range from 25 to 50 mg. Vardenafil is taken thrice weekly, and its effects last for around 24 hours.\n\n【12】Related Topics\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Penile Rehabilitation Programs\n\n【15】Vaginal Dilators - An Overview\n\n【16】What does the prostate biopsy suggest?\n\n【17】When to Start Penile Rehabilitation and What Are the Different Rehabilitation Programs?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】About two months after prostatectomy surgery, the patient discusses the sexual function with the cancer specialist nurse and undergoes penile rehabilitation if needed. The sooner the repair is started, the better. The different penile rehabilitation programs include the following:\n\n【19】1. **Phosphodiesterase (PDE-5 inhibitors):**\n\n【20】Phosphodiesterase(PDE-5 inhibitors) are used as first-line therapy except when the patient is under nitrate medication for angina or other conditions. This is because PDE-5 inhibitors can suddenly drop blood pressure.\n\n【21】2\\. **Vacuum Erection Devices:**\n\n【22】Vacuum Erection Devices are used for penile rehabilitation along with PDE inhibitors. They are in the form of an external cylinder and are placed at the bottom of the penis after applying lubricant to prevent damage to the penile tissue. They are used for achieving and maintaining an erection.\n\n【23】Blood flow to the penis is enhanced on the placement of the device due to creating a vacuum within the cylinder. On removal of the pump, the penis becomes flaccid. The pump is used twice daily for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n【24】For sexual use, the device is used to increase blood flow to the penis. Once the required erection to attain penetration is reached, a constriction band is used to maintain the erection. The benefits of using a vacuum erection device include the following:\n\n【25】*   Penile length maintenance.\n*   Facilitate early return of natural erection.\n*   Early partner sexual satisfaction.\n\n【26】**3.Intracavernosal Injections:**\n\n【27】Intracavernosal Injections(ICI) are used as first-line therapy in patients who have undergone non-nerve-sparing prostatectomy. They are also used in cases where the patient does not respond to PDE inhibitors and where PDE inhibitors are contraindicated.\n\n【28】This injection causes smooth muscle relaxation and dilatation of arteries, increasing oxygen-rich blood flow to the penile region. This causes blood trapping within the corpus cavernosa, resulting in an erection.\n\n【29】The cancer specialist nurse will provide the dosage and instructions on using the injection. The usual dose is to be administered thrice weekly, the erection lasts 45 minutes, and the penis returns to normal in two hours.\n\n【30】The complications associated with ICI include the following:\n\n【31】*   Scar tissue development.\n*   Priapism - A long-lasting painful erection lasting more than two hours without sexual stimulation.\n\n【32】If a painful erection lasts more than three hours (priapism), immediate medical attention is required.\n\n【33】**4\\. Penile Prosthesis:**\n\n【34】Penile prosthesis or implants are expensive and considered only in cases where the first and second-line therapy have failed, that too only after a notice period of at least one year after surgery. This is because implants can cause permanent damage to penile tissue, so if they turn unsuitable or become a failure, it is impossible to regain normal erectile function.\n\n【35】The different types of implants used are:\n\n【36】*   **Malleable Implant:**\n\n【37】Malleable implants consist of rods inserted into corpora cavernosa, resulting in a permanent erection. They are bent forward during sexual use and bent away when not needed.\n\n【38】*   **Inflatable Implant:**\n\n【39】An inflatable Implant consists of rods that are inserted into corpora cavernosa. It also includes a reservoir and a pump that are inserted into the scrotum. The pump inflates the rod, and a release mechanism drains the fluid.\n\n【40】**5\\. Pelvic Floor Exercises:**\n\n【41】The medical team will give the instructions for doing pelvic floor exercises, and the patient is advised to start exercising as soon as possible. These exercises increase the tone of pelvic floor muscles and blood flow to the region, thus contributing to faster healing.\n\n【42】**6\\. Intraurethral Alprostadil :**\n\n【43】Intraurethral Alprostadil is applied to the urethra. The medication dissolves and gets absorbed locally and benefits in achieving an erection that is sufficient to produce penetrative intercourse.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Following prostatectomy, the main problem faced is erectile dysfunction. Two months post-surgery penile rehabilitation programs are started for correcting erectile dysfunction. The earlier it is started, the better. The patient is provided with personalized programs under the guidance of the physician and specialist nurse. PDE inhibitors are given as first-line therapy, and vacuum erection devices as second-line therapy. Penile implants are used only in cases where all other treatments fail.\n\n【46】Article Resources\n\n【47】*   Urology Department Erectile Dysfunction Rehabilitation -Prostatectomy  \n    https://www.westernhealth.org.au/Services/Cancer\\_Services/Documents/Penile%20Erectile%20Dysfunction.pdf\n*   Penile Rehabilitation and Treatment Options for Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2021.636974/full\n*   Penile Rehabilitation After Radical Prostatectomy: Important Therapy or Wishful Thinking?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1751036/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "85e984f7-907e-4083-a84d-9683c983234b", "title": "Nitrate Poisoning and Its Impacts", "text": "【0】Nitrate Poisoning and Its Impacts\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】When nitrates or nitrites are consumed in large quantities, it can lead to nitrate poisoning in humans. Consuming nitrate contaminated food or water, as well as coming into contact with industrial chemicals and agricultural fertilizers, can all result in nitrate poisoning. In certain situations, this illness can be life-threatening and cause serious health problems.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Nitrate Poisoning in Humans?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Natural substances known as nitrates and nitrites are found in the environment, including in soil, water, and air. When chemicals enter the body, exposure occurs. Nitrate and nitrite exposure can happen in a number of ways:\n\n【4】**1\\. Drinking Water**\n\n【5】*   Water is the primary source of nitrates and nitrogen-based fertilizers that leak into shallow drinking water wells, which are typically found in rural areas.\n    \n*   Other nitrate sources include animal waste and malfunctioning sewage systems. Nitrate poisoning can occur in infants who are bottle-fed when nitrate-contaminated drinking water is used to dilute formula.\n    \n\n【6】**2\\. Diet**\n\n【7】*   Nitrates in the diet are only allowed in certain amounts each day.\n    \n*   Sources of nitrate exposure include meats and sausages cured with nitrates and nitrites.\n    \n*   Fruits and vegetables both play a significant role in a healthy diet, and veggies account for the majority of the nitrates consumed.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Volatile Substance Toxicity - Diagnosis and Management\n    \n    Role of Methylene Blue in Treating Cyanide Poisoning\n    \n    Ricin Exposure - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   The quantity of nitrates in vegetables varies depending on the kind, storage method, and method of preparation for meals.\n    \n*   Natural sources of nitrates include broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, collard greens, and root vegetables.\n    \n*   Nitrate-rich foods used in homemade baby meals and soups have had a major negative impact on newborn health.\n    \n\n【8】**3\\. Preservatives**\n\n【9】*   They are frequently employed as preservatives in the food sector to stop bacterial development. Bacteria in the body convert nitrates to nitrites, and too much nitrite in the body can be hazardous.\n    \n\n【10】**4\\. Other Drugs**\n\n【11】*   Such as creams used to treat burns, are another cause of nitrate exposure.\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Potential Hazards Caused by Nitrates?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Nitrates come in a variety of forms, and they all react differently in the body. It is sometimes forgotten that the inorganic nitrates present in contaminated well water are a source of nitrate exposure that can have major negative consequences on health.\n\n【14】**Common Symptoms Include**\n\n【15】*   Bluish skin from a lack of oxygen (often initially detected around mouth/lips) is one sign of nitrate/nitrite poisoning.\n    \n*   Breathing difficulties; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; dehydration (caused by a loss of body fluids);\n    \n*   A quick heartbeat, lightheadedness, weakness, coma, and convulsions.\n    \n\n【16】Usually, nitrates that are consumed or drunk enter the body do no harm. However, occasionally, illnesses like diarrhea and dehydration (a body's lack of fluid) can result nitrates to convert into nitrites in higher quantities.\n\n【17】**Other Adverse Effects Include**\n\n【18】*   **Formation of Methemoglobin**: These nitrites in the blood alter hemoglobin, or the molecules that assist in transporting oxygen throughout the body. Because of nitrates, the body may have less oxygen available for effective operation. This condition is referred to as methemoglobinemia\n    \n    *   **Methemoglobinemia Levels of 30 % to 40 %:** Early symptoms of toxicosis include a rapid, weak heartbeat with a lowered body temperature, muscle tremors, weakness, and ataxia.\n        \n    *   **Methemoglobinemia Levels of 60 %:** Lethargy, convulsions, and coma are caused by hemoglobin levels of 60% or more.\n        \n    *   **Methemoglobin Levels above 70%:** These are often considered fatal, can lead to coma, convulsions, and death, while certain cases of survival have been documented at levels as high as 94%.\n        \n*   **Blue Baby Syndrome:** Infants are more at risk for methemoglobinemia brought on by nitrate poisoning because of the increased percentage of fetal hemoglobin in their blood, which is more easily oxidized. The disease known as \"blue baby syndrome,\" which causes the skin to become blue owing to the presence of methemoglobin in the blood, can affect infants.\n    \n*   **Effects on Reproduction and Development:** Environmental nitrates and nitrites may raise the risk of problems during pregnancy for mothers.\n    \n    *   Preeclampsia, threatened abortion, or anemia\n        \n    *   Recent epidemiological studies have revealed a connection between maternal consumption of nitrate from drinking water, such as intrauterine growth limitation, spontaneous abortions, and a variety of birth abnormalities.\n        \n\n【19】How Is the Diagnosis of Nitrate Poisoning Done?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【20】*   Usually, a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory testing are used to diagnose nitrate toxicity.\n    \n*   A screening test which assesses the color of a few drops of blood deposited on white filter paper and other tests can assess how nitrates impair the body's ability to carry oxygen to the areas that need it most.\n    \n*   This supports therapeutic strategies for further management.\n    \n*   Blood tests may be run by the physician to check for nitrite and methemoglobin concentrations that are abnormally high.\n    \n*   Nitrate levels may also be checked via a urine test. In certain circumstances, a liver or kidney biopsy may be necessary to gauge the level of nitrate poisoning-related damage.\n    \n\n【21】What Is the Treatment for Nitrate Poisoning?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【22】*   Treatment of nitrate poisoning typically involves removing the source of exposure and providing supportive care to manage symptoms.\n    \n*   In cases of mild exposure, symptoms may resolve on their own without medical intervention. However, hospitalization may be required in extreme circumstances to provide oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and medication to reduce methemoglobin levels.\n    \n*   For individuals with severe methemoglobinemia, the first-line antidote treatment recommended is methylene blue. It is suggested that patients receive methylene blue at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight intravenously over a period of five minutes if they have methemoglobin levels >30 %. After a single dosage, methemoglobin concentration typically falls dramatically within 1-2 hours; further doses could be required. In dire circumstances, a blood transfusion is necessary to replace damaged red blood cells.\n    \n\n【23】How to Avoid Prevention of Nitrate Poisoning?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】*   Avoiding exposure to polluted food, water, and industrial chemicals is essential for preventing nitrate poisoning.\n    \n*   By making sure that their water supply is free of toxins, staying away from fruits and vegetables that have been exposed to agricultural fertilizers, and avoiding processed meats that contain nitrites, people may lessen their chance of exposure.\n    \n*   Young children, babies, and pregnant women are more susceptible to nitrate poisoning and should be regularly watched for methemoglobinemia symptoms.\n    \n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】Human nitrate poisoning is a hazardous disorder that can cause major health problems, including death. This illness is brought on by consuming high levels of nitrates and nitrites, either from drinking tainted water or food or through exposure to chemical fertilizers and industrial chemicals. Treatment for nitrate poisoning mainly entails eliminating the exposure source and providing supportive care to manage symptoms. Nitrate poisoning symptoms might vary based on exposure level and individual sensitivity. People should take efforts to lower their risk of exposure in order to prevent exposure to contaminated food, water, and industrial chemicals, which causes nitrate poisoning.\n\n【27】Article Resources\n\n【28】*   Nitrates/Nitrites Poisoning  \n    https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/nitrate\\_2013/docs/nitrate\\_patient-education.pdf\n*   Nitrate Poisoning  \n    https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/livestock/beef/nitrate-poisoning.html\n*   Nitrate and Nitrite Poisoning  \n    https://www.poison.org/articles/causes-and-symptoms-of-nitrate-nitrite-poisoning-174", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "bfebbef5-cb11-45aa-89b9-08ac7ef99b44", "title": "Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome - A Hereditary Enzyme Deficiency Dwarfism", "text": "【0】Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome - A Hereditary Enzyme Deficiency Dwarfism\nWhat Is Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n--------------------------------\n\n【1】Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), also known as an arylsulfatase-B deficiency or poly-diastrophic dwarfism, is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary genetic disorder that occurs due to a mutation in the ARSB gene that encodes the enzyme arylsulfatase B. The enzyme is involved in the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans molecules, the lack of which results in the accumulation of the molecules in the lysosomes, followed by cell and tissue injury, ultimately resulting in severe multi-organ failure.\n\n【2】Who Is Susceptible to Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】MPS-VI has shown a prevalence of 1 in 65,000 births with no gender predilection, but a broader estimate marks the condition prevalence at 1 in 250,000 to 600,000 individuals. The incidence of MPS-VI is quite variable, with 0.0132 and 7.85 cases per 100,000 births in Poland and Saudi Arabia, respectively. In some small regions where consanguinity and endogamy are accepted norms, the prevalence is as high as 20 per 100,000 live births. Out of all MPS variants, MPS-VI is the most prevalent variant in Saudi Arabia, with 46 percent of all MPS cases, and Malaysia, with 40 percent of all MPS cases. MPS-VI has the lowest prevalence of all MPS variants in Poland and South Korea, with 1 percent and 1.4 percent of all MPS cases, respectively.\n\n【4】What Causes Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】MPS-VI shows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance; hence the condition requires the accumulation of mutant ARSB gene from both parents. A pair of altered ARSB alleles leads to the reduction or complete elimination of the lysosomal enzyme-arylsulfatase B (also known as N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase). This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of the molecules-glycosaminoglycans, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin 4-sulfate. The deficiency or lack thereof of the enzyme leads to abnormal accumulation of the said large molecules in the lysosomes and extracellular matrix that consecutively lead to large-scale cell and tissue damage. Left unchecked, this accumulation can lead to multi-system organ failure and ultimately prove fatal.\n\n【6】What Is the Pathophysiology of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】ARSB gene is present on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q13-14) that contains 8 exons consisting of 4852 base pairs of nucleotides encoding the 533 amino acids of the mature arylsulfatase-B enzyme. More than 220 different types of mutations have been recognized in the ARSB gene accounting for the varying severity of the condition in patients. Due to various mutations in the ARSB gene, there is a deficiency or complete absence of the arylsulfatase-B enzyme. Due to the abnormality, glycosaminoglycans (a large sugar molecule- mucopolysaccharides) accumulate in the cell and extracellular matrix, especially in the lysosomes, which increases the size of the cells resulting in enlarged tissues and organs. Accumulated glycosaminoglycans levels are believed to be toxic to cells and may provoke the loss of function of various proteins within the lysosomes triggering inflammation and cell death. This leads to the atrophy of tissues, ultimately involving multiple organs and organ systems.\n\n【8】What Is the Histopathology of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】A histological study of peripheral blood smear reveals vacuolated lymphocytes and evident lysosomal engorgement in tissue biopsy.\n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n\n【11】**1\\.

Cardiac Manifestations:**\n\n【22】*   Valvular insufficiency (failure of one or more of the heart valves).\n    \n*   Valvular stenosis (narrowing of the heart valves).\n    \n*   Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery).\n    \n*   Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscles).\n    \n*   Fibroelastosis (thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers).\n    \n*   Cardiac conduction disorders (problems with the electrical system of the heart).\n    \n*   Heart failures.\n    \n\n【23】**7\\. Pulmonary Manifestations:**\n\n【24】*   Recurrent airway infections.\n    \n*   Upper and lower airway obstruction.\n    \n*   Sleep disorders.\n    \n\n【25】**8\\. Other Manifestations:**\n\n【26】*   Coarse facial features (abnormal proportions of facial features).\n    \n*   Hepatosplenomegaly (increased size of liver and spleen).\n    \n*   Umbilical hernia (intestine bulges into the abdominal muscles near the navel).\n    \n*   Inguinal hernia (intestine bulges into the inguinal canal).\n    \n*   Delayed puberty.\n    \n*   Hirsutism (male pattern hair growth in females).\n    \n\n【27】How to Diagnose Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Diagnosis of MPS-VI begins with recognizing specific clinical signs suggestive of a metabolic disorder that should be further investigated for specific etiology.\n\n【29】Laboratory studies can be ordered for urine glycosaminoglycan analysis using various qualitative or quantitative methods. Urinalysis may indicate the presence of mucopolysaccharide metabolic disorder (enzyme deficiency causing problems with the metabolism of long-chain carbohydrates), but enzymatic testing should be ordered to detect the MPS-VI variant.\n\n【30】A quantitative enzyme analysis by DMB-based assay, demonstrating an increase of total urinary glycosaminoglycans, or a qualitative analysis revealing an increase of dermatan sulfate is performed. This should be followed by an enzymatic assay evaluating enzymatic activity on leucocytes or fibroblasts.\n\n【31】Independent confirmation of MPS VI diagnosis is obtained by molecular genetic testing of ARSB, which may detect the mutation's level, type, and severity.\n\n【32】Skeletal survey studies reveal dysostosis multiplex.\n\n【33】*   Macrocephaly with an enlarged j-shaped sella.\n    \n*   Thickened, short metacarpal bones with proximal pointing and thin cortices.\n    \n*   Paddle-shaped widened ribs.\n    \n*   Short, thick, irregular clavicles.\n    \n*   Femoral head dysplasia.\n    \n*   Severe hip dysplasia.\n    \n*   Ovoid deformities of the vertebrae.\n    \n*   Anterior hypoplasia lumbar vertebral bodies.\n    \n*   Kyphoscoliosis.\n    \n\n【34】Echocardiography to detect cardiac abnormalities, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spine may demonstrate neurological manifestations, flexion-extension radiographs of the C-spine to detect atlantoaxial instability, and subluxation, and CT (computed tomography) can be ordered in case of poor radiographic interpretation.\n\n【35】Other tests include audiological evaluation, ophthalmologic examination, pulmonary function tests, and abdominal ultrasounds to detect hernias.\n\n【36】How to Treat or Manage Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【37】**1\\. Medical Care:**\n\n【38】The treatment of MPS-VI is symptomatic and tailored specifically to each patient. In the case of neonatal diagnosis, pediatric care with a standard immunization regimen is followed. An enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase (naglazyme) is implemented, which has shown a marked decline of glycosaminoglycans in urine output.\n\n【39】**2\\. Pharmacotherapy and Oxygen Therapy:**\n\n【40】Antibiotic therapy with cardiologist consultation is required to prevent bacterial endocarditis, especially prior to dental appointments. Patients with pulmonary manifestations may benefit from oxygen or positive pressure therapy or bilevel positive airway pressure, especially when asleep if they have sleep apnea. A physical therapy protocol can be included in cases of skeletal deformity, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness. The use of anti-inflammatory medications like Infliximab and Pentosan polysulfate is indicated to reduce inflammation.\n\n【41】**3\\. Surgical Care:**\n\n【42】*   Valvular replacement surgeries in patients with valvular heart disease.\n    \n*   Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in patients with repeated airway obstruction may also require tracheostomy in situations like severe airway obstruction and hypoventilation.\n    \n*   Corneal transplants may be required in case of corneal clouding.\n    \n*   Surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel to preserve median nerve function.\n    \n*   Ventriculoperitoneal decompression shunts may be required against hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure.\n    \n*   Decompression of the spinal cord or stabilization of the atlantoaxial junction may be required.\n    \n*   Hip replacement surgeries are indicated in patients with hip dysplasia.\n    \n\n【43】**4\\. Other Treatment Options:**\n\n【44】*   **Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) and Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT):** Transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood of a healthy donor\n    \n*   **Intra-Articular Enzyme Replacement Therapy:** Intra-articular injection of the enzyme directly into the joint.\n    \n*   **Gene Therapy:** ARSB gene transfer by retroviral vectors.\n    \n*   **Substrate Reduction Therapy:** Reduce GAG accumulation by interfering with their biosynthetic pathway by oral administration of Odiparcil.\n    \n*   **Pharmacological Stop Codon Read-through:** Gentamicin and PTC124 are used to suppress the effect of premature stop codon termination and restore the production of the full-length protein.\n    \n\n【45】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】*   Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II).\n    \n*   Sly syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type VII).\n    \n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII.\n    \n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.\n    \n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type IH.\n    \n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type IS.\n    \n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV.\n    \n*   Multiple sulfatase deficiency (enzyme deficiency causing some sugar metabolism problems).\n    \n\n【47】**What Is the Prognosis of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?**\n\n【48】MPS-VI is a progressive disorder with early fatality and significant morbidity. So, the prognosis of the condition is dependent on the severity of symptoms as dictated by the degree and variation of mutation in the gene.\n\n【49】What Are the Complications of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】*   Blindness.\n    \n*   Deafness.\n    \n*   Carpal tunnel syndrome.\n    \n*   Respiratory failure.\n    \n*   Cardiac failure.\n    \n*   Valvular failure.\n    \n*   Paralysis.\n    \n\n【51】**Conclusion**\n\n【52】Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome is a complex disease that needs continuous multi-disciplinary care to be managed efficiently. Although significant improvement has been observed in newer treatment therapies like enzyme replacement and bone marrow transplant, the availability of such treatment is in a nascent stage. Extensive research in the field is required to make the diagnosis and treatment options available to the general public in an affordable and easily accessible way.\n\n【53】Article Resources\n\n【54】*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI - About the Disease  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7095/mucopolysaccharidosis-type-vi/\n*   Maroteaux Lamy Syndrome - NORD  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/maroteaux-lamy-syndrome/\n*   Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome - EyeWiki  \n    https://eyewiki.aao.org/Maroteaux-Lamy\\_Syndrome\n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI: MedlinePlus Genetics  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/mucopolysaccharidosis-type-vi/\n*   Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI, an Updated Overview of the Disease - PMC  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8707598/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Likewise, the white blood cell of our body plays a significant role in protecting us from various infections. T-cell or T-lymphocyte produced by the bone marrow is one of the white blood cells considered essential components of the immune system. This article describes the T-cell neoplasm (cancer), its causes, characteristics, management, and prognosis.\n\n【2】What Is Adult T-Cell Lymphoma or Leukemia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia (ATLL) is a rare and fast-growing neoplasm of the T-cells found in the blood, lymph nodes, skin, and other areas of the body. Its prevalence is high in regions like China, Japan, south and central America, and west Africa.\n\n【4】What Causes Adult T-Cell Lymphoma?\n----------------------------------\n\n【5】The occurrence of ATLL is highly linked with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type -1 (HTLV-1) infection. Studies show that HTLV-1 may affect about 10 million individuals around the globe. Of these, 1 to 5 % may develop adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. It can occur in any age group and is more commonly found in men than women.\n\n【6】The virus may be transmitted through blood transfusion and sexual interaction. In addition, a child may acquire the disease from the affected mother through breastfeeding.\n\n【7】What Are the Clinical Features of Adult T-Cell Lymphoma?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】It is essential to know the types of adult T-cell lymphoma to differentiate its characteristic features; which include:\n\n【9】**1) Acute -** The acute form of ATLL constitutes more than 50 % of all cases. Its typical features are:\n\n【10】*   Hypercalcemia.\n    \n*   Lymphadenopathy in the neck, underarm, and groin.\n    \n*   Organ infiltration.\n    \n*   Skin rash.\n    \n*   Fatigue.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Hematological Disorders - Types, Causes, Signs, and Symptoms\n    \n    Why do I have fatigue, breathlessness, and slightly abnormal blood test reports?\n    \n    Cutaneous Manifestations of Hematological Disorders: A Detailed Glossary\n    \n*   High serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.\n    \n\n【11】**2) Chronic -** The chronic form affects the skin, lungs, and liver; the calcium and LDH levels remain normal. It consists of two subtypes, namely favorable and unfavorable. The features of the unfavorable subtype involve decreased albumin, elevated LDH, and raised BUN (blood urea nitrogen). These features explain the reason for its poor prognosis.\n\n【12】*   Lymphomatous - It is a fast-growing type of ATLL. It constitutes:\n    \n\n【13】*   Organomegaly.\n    \n*   Lymphadenopathy.\n    \n*   Hypercalcemia.\n    \n*   A striking increase in LDH levels.\n    \n\n【14】*   Smoldering - This form is mild and slow-growing. There is mild or no increase in the LDH levels, average lymphocyte count, and mild skin and lung involvement.\n    \n\n【15】The above-mentioned types suppress the individual’s immunity, thus predisposing them to various fungal, viral, and bacterial infections. The aggressive forms may also affect the central nervous system.\n\n【16】What Are the Diagnostic Methods for Adult T-Cell Lymphoma?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The factors that necessitate the suspects for ATLL are :\n\n【18】*   Individuals from endemic areas like South America, Africa, etc.\n    \n*   History of blood transfusion or exposure to contaminated products.\n    \n\n【19】**1) Laboratory Investigation -** The laboratory examination includes complete blood count, LDH levels, calcium, potassium, and creatinine levels. These levels are increased in the aggressive types of adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma.\n\n【20】**2) Cytological Examination -** The diagnosis is made by determining the CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 cell count. It also aids in evaluating the disease severity and monitoring the treatment.\n\n【21】**3) Biopsy -** A tissue or cell sample is collected to be examined under the microscope. Samples from lymph nodes, skin, or the gastrointestinal tract may aid in diagnosing ATLL. Especially the biopsy of bone marrow aid in the staging of ATLL.\n\n【22】**4) Computed Tomography (CT) -** The CT scan helps detect the typical features of ATLL, such as lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and other bone involvement. Even the positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan also helps detect various organ infiltration.\n\n【23】**5) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** The doctor may order an MRI of the brain and a lumbar puncture to evaluate any central nervous system involvement by an aggressive form of ATLL. The lumbar puncture is a procedure that involves the use of a fine needle to aspirate a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the space between two lumbar bones. The collected sample is then sent to a laboratory to detect the presence of cancerous T-cells or other infectious agents.\n\n【24】Can I Live Long With Adult T-Cell Lymphoma?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The prognosis of adult T-cell lymphoma is poor. Even after treatment, the overall- 4-year survival rate is estimated to be:\n\n【26】*   Acute - 11 %.\n    \n*   Lymphomatous - 16 %.\n    \n*   Chronic - 36 %.\n    \n*   Smoldering - 52 %.\n    \n\n【27】Also, studies show that the following factors determine the prognosis of ATLL:\n\n【28】*   Age over 40 years old.\n    \n*   High lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n    \n*   Presence of more than three lesions.\n    \n*   Hypercalcemia.\n    \n\n【29】What Is the Differential Diagnosis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【30】The other types of lymphoma may possess similar characteristics to ATLL.\n\n【31】*   Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is a type of T-cell lymphoma affecting the skin, lymph nodes, and other body organs. A biopsy is required to differentiate it from different subtypes of T-cell lymphoma.\n    \n\n【32】Is Adult T-Cell Lymphoma Curable?\n---------------------------------\n\n【33】The aggressive types, like acute, lymphomatous, and unfavorable subtypes of chronic forms, are treated with antiviral therapy. In contrast, milder forms like smoldering are managed by careful monitoring and antiviral treatment.\n\n【34】**1) Antiviral Medication -** Zidovudine and Interferon may be helpful in patients with T-cell leukemia.\n\n【35】**2) Chemotherapy -** The following agents showed improvement in individuals with adult T-cell lymphoma:\n\n【36】*   VCAP-AMP-VCEP: Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Prednisone, Ranimustine, Vindesine, Etoposide, and Carboplatin.\n    \n*   Modified EPOCH: Etoposide, Prednisolone, Vincristine, Carboplatin, and Doxorubicin.\n    \n*   CVAD: Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Doxorubicin, and Dexamethasone.\n    \n*   CHOP: Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone. It is recommended for elderly patients who cannot tolerate aggressive treatment.\n    \n\n【37】**3) Stem Cell Transplant -** These procedures are ineffective in treating ATLL; moreover, studies show poor outcomes after stem cell transplant.\n\n【38】**4) Monoclonal Antibody Treatment -** Antibodies to fight against cancerous cells are made in the laboratory known, as monoclonal antibodies are infused into the patients.\n\n【39】It includes:\n\n【40】*   Brentuximab Vedotin.\n    \n*   Mogamulizumab.\n    \n*   Alemtuzumab.\n    \n*   Daclizumab.\n    \n\n【41】What Are the Complications of Adult T-Cell Lymphoma?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia decreases the patient’s immunity; therefore, the chances of acquiring opportunistic infections are high. Thus it is necessary to provide immunization and medication against such diseases. Another severe complication of ATLL is tumor lysis syndrome, which releases cancer cell contents into the blood.\n\n【43】**Conclusion:**\n\n【44】Adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia is a rare neoplasm, and the prognosis of its aggressive type is inferior. In addition, the risk of acquiring ATLL is high in patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). Such patients should avoid prolonged breastfeeding and practice precautions during sexual interactions. To conclude, chemotherapeutic and antiviral agents are available and can improve the patient’s survival rate.\n\n【45】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【46】* * *\n\n【47】#### **1.**\n\n【48】#### **Is T-Cell Lymphoma and Leukemia the Same?**\n\n【49】Lymphoma and leukemia are both blood cancers that affect the body differently. Lymphomas are cancers that affect the lymphatic system and start in lymphocytes. Leukemia is a cancer of blood-forming tissue, which includes bone marrow and the lymphatic system.\n\n【50】#### **2.**\n\n【51】#### **What Is the Average Life Expectancy for T-Cell Lymphoma?**\n\n【52】The overall non-Hodgkin lymphoma T-cell survival rate was 63.1 percent. According to the findings, on an average, those with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically outlive those who do not have the disease by five or more years.\n\n【53】#### **3.**\n\n【54】#### **Does a Blood Test Detect T-Cell Lymphoma?**\n\n【55】The total blood count and other blood tests may be done to understand the situation better. Blood tests can occasionally reveal cancer cells, especially in cases with Sezary syndrome. A skin biopsy is typically required in cutaneous biopsies to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【56】#### **4.**\n\n【57】#### **How Is the Prognosis of T-Cell Leukemia?**\n\n【58】An individual with T-ALL usually has a positive outlook. Although it is fewer than 50% for adults, the five-year survival rate for children is greater than 85% overall. Children may be better able to tolerate high doses of chemotherapy than adults, which may be one explanation for this.\n\n【59】#### **5.**\n\n【60】#### **How to Identify T-cell Lymphoma?**\n\n【61】The following symptoms can identify T-cell lymphoma:  \n\\- T-cell lymphoma symptoms and indicators include itchy, round areas of skin that may be elevated or scaly.   \n\\- Skin spots that stand out from the surrounding area in color.  \n\\- Lumpy areas of the skin that could become infected.  \n\\- Enlarged lymph nodes.\n\n【62】#### **6.**\n\n【63】#### **Does T-cell Lymphoma Spread?**\n\n【64】If left untreated, this aggressive lymphoma can spread quickly. However, cancer cells may spread to other organs and lymph nodes and cause life-threatening medical complications.\n\n【65】#### **7.**\n\n【66】#### **What Is the Growth Rate of T-cell Lymphoma?**\n\n【67】It is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma often progresses slowly. It takes many years to develop. The Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides are the two most prevalent subtypes of this malignancy.\n\n【68】#### **8.**\n\n【69】#### **Is T-cell lymphoma Showing Remission?**\n\n【70】T-cell lymphoma is not curable. Multidisciplinary care and advanced treatment are used to treat T-cell lymphoma. However, the total remission rate can be very high, and many individuals can be treated with rigorous treatment.\n\n【71】#### **9.**\n\n【72】#### **Does T-cell Lymphoma Cause Itching?**\n\n【73】Itching or pruritus is a common symptom of T-cell lymphoma. In addition, round patches of itchy, inflamed, or scaly skin may be seen as symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. T-cell lymphoma-associated itching is thus more frequent and severe.\n\n【74】#### **10.**\n\n【75】#### **What Is the Treatment of T-cell Leukemia Adults?**\n\n【76】If AITL is in the acute or chronic phase, Zidovudine (Retrovir) and recombinant interferon alpha may be used as treatments. The treatment aims to combat the human T-cell leukemia virus and boost immunological function (HTLV).\n\n【77】#### **11.**\n\n【78】#### **What Are the Stages of T-cell Leukemia?**\n\n【79】Staging generally describes the location of cancer, whether or not it has spread, and whether it is impacting other regions of the body. There are different stages, such as LGLL (large granular lymphocytic leukemia), T-PLL (T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia), AITL (angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma), or Sezary syndrome.\n\n【80】#### **12.**\n\n【81】#### **How Does T-cell Lymphoma look?**\n\n【82】A rash-like skin redness, slightly raised or scaly round patches of skin, and occasionally skin tumors are symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. There are various varieties of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides are the most typical kind. A less frequent type of skin redness that affects the entire body is called Sezary syndrome.\n\n【83】Article Resources\n\n【84】*   Adult T Cell Leukemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558968/\n*   Adult T-cell lymphoma  \n    https://www.leukaemia.org.au/blood-cancer-information/types-of-blood-cancer/lymphoma/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/adult-t-cell-lymphoma/\n*   Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma  \n    https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jop.2017.021907", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "23858bfb-2d2e-44b7-85ef-f9aa5172e65a", "title": "Choledochal Cyst - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Choledochal Cyst - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Bile is a yellow-green liquid produced and secreted by the liver. It comprises bile salts, phospholipids, conjugated bilirubin, cholesterol, electrolytes, and water. Bile is produced by the liver cells called hepatocytes and transported to the bile ducts present inside the liver. Then bile travels to the gallbladder through a larger duct called the common bile duct present outside the liver. The gallbladder stores the bile juice until required. The main functions of bile are to help in the absorption and digestion of fats and to remove waste products from the body. When the body needs bile for digestion, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile into the cystic duct, which then opens into the common bile duct and reaches the duodenum of the small intestine. The hormone cholecystokinin stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder during digestion. The total volume of bile produced per day is 600 ml.\n\n【2】What Is a Choledochal Cyst?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】A choledochal cyst is a congenital and rare anomaly of the bile duct that connects the liver to the gallbladder and the duodenum and transports bile. There are cystic (sac-like pockets of tissue filled with fluid, pus, or air) enlargements or dilations in the bile ducts outside and inside the liver. The cystic swelling prevents bile flow from the liver to the small intestine, causing the backflow of bile into the liver. This results in liver problems. It also blocks the bile transportation from the pancreas to the small intestine leading to inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis. Choledochal cysts are more common in females than males and occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies. Babies with choledochal cysts are at a higher risk of developing bile duct cancer during adulthood.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Choledochal Cysts?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are several theories of the etiology of choledochal cysts, a few of which are:\n\n【6】*   **Anomalous Pancreaticobiliary Junction**: It is a condition of the abnormal junction of bile and pancreatic ducts.\n    \n*   **Congenital**: Some studies suggest that the cyst formation is simply congenital with no specific reason.\n    \n*   **Duplication Cysts**: Some theories suggest that biliary duplication cysts are related to type Ⅱ cysts and biliary or duodenal duplication cysts are related to type Ⅲ cysts.\n    \n*   **Ductal Plate Malformation**: Type Ⅴ cyst formation is linked to the abnormal remodeling of the ductal plates.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Choledochal Cysts?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Although choledochal cysts are present from birth, they may be diagnosed later. This is because the symptoms also start later from infancy or early childhood.\n\n【9】*   Only 30% of patients with choledochal cysts exhibit a classical triad of symptoms that includes:\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Bilirubin - Production and Metabolism\n    \n    Biliary Bypass Procedures: Detour Ahead\n    \n    Hepatic Cystadenoma Imaging and Diagnosis\n    \n    *   Palpable abdominal mass in the upper right region of the belly.\n        \n    *   Intermittent abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant.\n        \n    *   Jaundice (yellowish coloration of skin and eyes).\n        \n*   Other symptoms include:\n    \n    *   Nausea and vomiting.\n        \n    *   Fever.\n        \n    *   Cholangitis-inflammation of the bile duct.\n        \n    *   Pancreatitis-inflammation of the pancreas.\n        \n    *   Pale or clay-colored stools.\n        \n\n【10】What Are the Types of Choledochal Cysts?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】The location of the choledochal cyst can be either intrahepatic or extrahepatic. There are many classification systems for choledochal cysts. But the Todani classification done in 1977 is the most commonly and widely used classification by doctors. According to the Todani classification, there are five types of choledochal cysts which are listed below.\n\n【12】*   **Type Ⅰ** - This type accounts for 50% to 80% of all cysts occurring in the common bile duct.\n    \n*   **Type Ⅱ** - About 2% of cases are of this type, where diverticular dilation develops anywhere throughout the extrahepatic duct. Diverticular dilation is a small sac-like bulge formed on the outer wall of the duct.\n    \n*   **Type Ⅲ** - It represents 1.4% to 4.5% of cysts, knowns as choledochocele. They are cystic dilation of the distal common bile duct inside the duodenum (first part of the small intestine).\n    \n*   **Type Ⅳ** \\- This type accounted for 15% to 35% of all cysts present as multiple dilations and decided into two subtypes type ⅣA which involves cysts of both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, and type ⅣB, which means cysts only extrahepatic ducts have cystic swellings.\n    \n*   **Type Ⅴ** - This comprises 20% of cysts, which are cystic dilations of only the intrahepatic biliary ducts. This type is called Caroli’s disease.\n    \n\n【13】How Is a Choledochal Cyst Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are no specific laboratory tests for choledochal cysts. The major diagnostic methods include:\n\n【15】*   **Computerized Tomography Scan:** The CT scan can identify cysts in the liver, pancreatic duct, and distal common bile duct more accurately than an ultrasound scan. It also helps in planning surgery such as segmental lobectomy.\n    \n*   **Ultrasonography:** Some choledochal cysts can be identified during a prenatal ultrasound. But it can also be found during the postnatal ultrasound. So it is usually the initial imaging method.\n    \n*   **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography:** This is a combination of endoscopy and fluoroscopy used to both diagnose and treat bile duct and pancreatic duct cysts. But it is invasive, uses ionizing radiation, and leads to other complications. It can be used to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy.\n    \n*   **Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography:** It is the gold standard method of diagnosis with the highest sensitivity rate of 90% to 100%. It has the advantages of being noninvasive, not using ionizing radiation, and not causing any associated complications. In addition, it can detect conditions like cholangiocarcinoma and choledocholithiasis (gallstones).\n    \n*   **Technetium-99 Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scan:** This imaging procedure uses a radioactive tracer material that is injected into the bloodstream to identify how bile travels from the liver to the intestine and the associated structural abnormalities on its way. It has a high sensitivity rate while diagnosing type Ⅰ choledochal cyst. It can also detect the rupture of a cyst and its leakage.\n    \n\n【16】What Is the Treatment of Choledochal Cysts?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The treatment of choledochal cysts depends on the type of cyst and its extent. Each cyst type has variations in treatment approaches. But as a thumb rule, all cysts are removed, and normal bile flow is restored.\n\n【18】*   **Early Surgical Excision:** The cysts are removed in neonates to help early recovery and restoration of liver functions to avoid complications in later years.\n    \n*   **Roux-en-Y Hepaticojejunostomy or Hepaticoduodenostomy:** It is a surgical procedure performed to bypass the bile duct and directly connect the liver to the jejunum or duodenum.\n    \n*   **Diverticulectomy:** Type Ⅱ and Ⅲ cysts are treated by simple surgical removal of the cyst or the diverticulitis and blocking the diverticular attachment.\n    \n*   **Liver Surgery:** Liver resection or liver transplantation is the treatment for type Ⅴ cysts.\n    \n\n【19】What Are the Complications of Choledochal Cysts?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】*   Malignancy.\n    \n*   Ascending cholangitis.\n    \n*   Portal hypertension.\n    \n*   Stricture formation.\n    \n*   Pancreatitis.\n    \n*   Cystolithiasis.\n    \n*   Infection.\n    \n*   Liver cirrhosis.\n    \n*   Gastrointestinal obstruction.\n    \n*   Stone and sludge formation.\n    \n\n【21】**Conclusion**\n\n【22】A choledochal cyst is a precancerous lesion. It should be diagnosed early in life to lower the risk of cancer, and appropriate treatment with a proper investigation should be delivered. The prognosis of this cyst is excellent with complete cyst excision and poor with cancer development. Therefore, it is vital for an interprofessional approach of pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, pediatric surgeons, pathologists, radiologists, and oncologists to treat the condition successfully.\n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Physiology, Bile Secretion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470209/\n*   Choledochal Cyst  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557762/\n*   What is a choledochal cyst?  \n    https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/choledochal-cysts\n*   Choledochal Cysts and other Biliary Malformations  \n    https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/choledochal-cysts", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Around 38.5 million people worldwide are suffering from aids. It is considered the world's most serious public health problem and an epidemic (widespread condition of an infectious disease). AIDS causes damage to the body's immune system, disrupting the body's normal defense mechanism. This is associated with a spectrum of conditions caused by secondary infection and tissue changes. In this condition, normal bone marrow and blood cell functioning are also impaired, along with other tissues. That is why understanding the hematological manifestations is important for diagnosis purposes.\n\n【2】What Is HIV?\n------------\n\n【3】Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are types of retrovirus. They enter the human body as single-stranded RNA ( Ribonucleic acid) viruses. After entering the target cells, they change into double-stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) with the help of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. There are two types of HIV viruses one is HIV-1 which is highly virulent and infectious, and another one is HIV-2, less infectious and mainly seen in West Africa.\n\n【4】*   **Transmission of HIV:** The main mood of transmission of HIV is:\n    \n    *   Through unprotected sexual contact. The virus can transmit through vaginal fluids, semen, and secretions of the genital organs.\n        \n    *   During a blood transfusion, if the donor receives the blood of the infected person.\n        \n    *   Needle prick, during a blood transfusion or surgical process, a used needle from an infected person can transmit the infection to the uninfected person.\n        \n    *   It can transmit the child from the mother during pregnancy.\n        \n    *   This infection is not transmitted through touch, kissing, or saliva.\n        \n        Related Topics\n        \n        * * *\n        \n        Bortezomib - Uses, Dosages, Side Effects, and Mechanism of Action\n        \n        HIV Nephropathy - Causes, Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n        \n        HIV and AIDS - Myths and Facts\n        \n\n【5】*   **Pathophysiology of HIV:** The envelope of the HIV viruses fused with the cell membranes of macrophages and CD4+T lymphocytes by adsorptions of glycoproteins. They can also infect dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells) transmitted through the sexual route. After this, ribonucleic acid and various enzymes are injected into the cells. Here synthesis of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). These infected CD4+ T cells are destroyed by CD8+ T cells. As a result, the number of CD4+ cells dropped dramatically. In the chronic phase, the drop in CD4+ T lymphocyte cells causes secondary infection. Infection also affects various cells like macrophages, monocytes, and microglia cells of the nervous system.\n    \n*   **Clinical Manifestations of HIV:** The clinical symptoms include repeated fever, cough, cold, and rapid weight loss. On examination, several pathological entities can be observed. These are:\n    \n    *   Multiple enlarged lymph nodes.\n        \n    *   **Fungal Infections:** Candidiasis can be observed.\n        \n    *   **Viral Infections:** Herpes simplex (a virus causing contagious sores around the mouth and body), herpes zoster (a virus causing rash) infection.\n        \n    *   **Bacterial Infections**: Tuberculosis (a bacterial infection causing weight loss and dry cough), pneumonia infections (lung infection).\n        \n    *   **Parasite Infection:** Toxoplasmosis infection.\n        \n    *   **Cancers Associated With AIDS Are:**\n        \n        *   Kaposi’s Sarcoma (a rare cancer of blood and lymph nodes).\n            \n        *   Hodgkin lymphoma.\n            \n\n【6】What Are the Blood Manifestations?\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】The general finding of the blood count of AIDS patients show:\n\n【8】*   **Anemia:** This is the most common condition associated with HIV patients. The presence of few numbers of red blood cells in the blood characterizes this. This is also associated with low hemoglobin percentage. The cause of anemia is multifactorial; these are:\n    \n    *   **Antibody-Mediated Hemolysis:** In this type of anemia, the destruction of red blood cells occurs due to an immune mechanism. Though this is mainly extravascular (outside the blood vessels), sometimes complement-mediated intravascular (inside the blood vessels) destruction of the red blood cells can also be seen.\n        \n    *   **Nutritional Deficiency:** Nutritional deficiency of the affected person is also responsible for low levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin percentage.\n        \n    *   **HIV-Associated Nephropathy:** HIV-associated nephropathy is associated with large kidneys, increased protein excretion through urine, and renal failure. As a result, the endogenous production of erythropoietin (a hormone responsible for stimulating red blood cells) is deceased. This causes a decreased number of red blood cells.\n        \n    *   **Bone Marrow Suppression:** The proliferation of pro-inflammatory like IL-6 (interleukin 6), and TNF (tumor necrosis factor) due to the presence of HIV proteins (surface envelope glycoproteins) is responsible for bone marrow suppression. Also, drugs used in AIDS treatment, like Zidovudine, are responsible for increased red cell destruction.\n        \n\n【9】*   **Neutropenia:** A decreased number of neutrophils in the blood characterizes neutropenia. It is often associated with pancytopenia (decreased count of all blood cells) or decreased CD4+ T lymphocyte count. The causes of neutropenia are:\n    \n    *   Most of the time, it is associated with the amount of viral load. The cytotoxicity of HIV is responsible for the impaired functioning of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or early myeloid progenitors, which are responsible for decreased neutrophil production.\n        \n    *   Drugs like Amphotericin B and chemotherapeutic drugs such as Flucytosine, Foscarnet, and Ganciclovir are associated with bone marrow suppression and decreased production of neutrophils.\n        \n    *   Along with this, the neutrophils in the blood are associated with reduced bactericidal capacity, defective degranulation process, impaired chemotaxis, defective surface adhesion mechanism, and impaired phagocytosis.\n        \n\n【10】*   **Thrombocytopenia:** The platelets count decreased in AIDS patients. The causative factors are:\n    \n    *   Medications are the most common for thrombocytopenia. Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs like Flucytosine, Ganciclovir, Heparin, Quinidine/Quinine, Thiazides, and Valganciclovir are associated with it.\n        \n    *   Cross-reactivity between HIV envelope glycoproteins 160/120 and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is responsible for the auto-immune destruction of platelets. Also, patients with advanced AIDS often have increased levels of C-reactive protein. This protein causes IgG-mediated platelet destruction.\n        \n\n【11】*   **Coagulation Disorders In HIV:** HIV-associated inflation and infection release inflammatory factors in the blood vessels. The local activation of tissue factors leads to the formation of microthrombi in the blood vessels. The risk factors are:\n    \n    *   Antiviral toxicity and HIV replication.\n        \n    *   Presence of other pathogens.\n        \n    *   Host factors like smoking.\n        \n    *   Venous damage caused by intravenous drugs.\n        \n\n【12】What Are the Cancer Diseases?\n-----------------------------\n\n【13】AIDS patients often suffer from several blood cancers. These are:\n\n【14】*   **Hodgkin Lymphoma:** This type of cancer originates from specific white blood cells. The presence of characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells (abnormal lymphocytes) is seen in these conditions. Enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, and liver are the main clinical features associated with this condition.\n    \n*   **Burkitt Lymphoma:** This is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with cytomegalovirus infection. This is associated with the infection of B-lymphocytes and usually affects children. This rare condition is associated with swollen lymph nodes and bellies and abnormal and prolonged abdominal pain.\n    \n\n【15】**Conclusion:**\n\n【16】AIDS is a serious and life-threatening condition. Several organs are affected by the immunocompromised conditions associated with it. These conditions also affect the form and functionality of the blood cells. Proper diagnosis of the blood cell count and its functionality can be helpful for the diagnosis of HIV. Hematological pictures can also determine disease prognosis and the effect of the anti-retroviral therapy.\n\n【17】Article Resources\n\n【18】*   HIV-related thrombocytopenia  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11914001/\n*   Chronic HIV Disease and Activation of the Coagulation System  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197841/\n*   Haematological manifestations of human immune deficiency virus infection  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26452169/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "59db3c9d-4761-451e-b885-26f3df7e63a8", "title": "Ear Irrigation - Contraindications, Risks, and Complications", "text": "【0】Ear Irrigation - Contraindications, Risks, and Complications\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Ear wax or cerumen is a naturally occurring substance produced in the external auditory canal (EAC). This region consists of pilosebaceous glands, hair follicles, and ceruminous and sebaceous glands. The ear wax is formed by the combination of dead cells and oily secretions of sebaceous glands and modified sweat from ceruminous glands. This modified sweat produced by the ceruminous gland has bactericidal and fungicidal properties, which help in lubrication and cleaning the external auditory canal. Therefore, ear wax is a protective barrier that traps foreign particles and prevents infections.\n\n【2】The ear wax usually gets removed with jaw movement during eating or other activities, but in some cases, the wax gets build-up and gets impacted, which troubles the patient. The ear wax impaction usually occurs when its extrusion is prevented due to hearing aids or continuous use of earplugs or earbuds for noise reduction or listening to music. According to various studies, approximately 5 percent of healthy adults, 10 percent of children, 57 percent of older adults, and 33 percent of people with mental retardation suffer from ear wax impaction. Therefore, various techniques are used to clean the ear canal or remove the ear wax build-up, one of which is ear irrigation.\n\n【3】What Is Ear Irrigation?\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Ear irrigation is also known as ear lavage. In this procedure, excess ear wax that gets built up in the ear canal is removed by using liquid. The ear wax can be flushed out using the liquid or can be softened with ear drops so that it can be removed with the instrument. This procedure has to be done by a medical professional otherwise, the eardrum may get damaged. Before performing this procedure, the ear canal is thoroughly examined using an otoscope to check whether there is any perforation in the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and to assess the anatomic abnormalities in the ear.\n\n【5】Why Is Ear Irrigation Performed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】The human ear is designed to be self-cleaning by pushing the wax out with the movement of the jaw. However, in some people, the wax builds up and can block the ear canal, causing pain and discomfort. This is usually found in people who wear earplugs or earbuds, people with narrow ear canals, and older adults. Excessive ear wax may lead to the following symptoms which include -\n\n【7】*   Coughing.\n    \n*   Discharge from the ear.\n    \n*   Dizziness (feeling light-headed or faint).\n    \n*   Hearing loss.\n    \n*   Itching.\n    \n*   Ear pain or otalgia.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Cerumen Impaction Removal- All You Need to Know\n    \n    Working of Human Ear\n    \n    Why do I have severe ear pain after getting my ears irrigated to remove wax buildup?\n    \n*   Fullness in the ear.\n    \n*   Tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\n    \n\n【8】Therefore, ear irrigation is usually performed in case of ear wax impaction if the patient shows the following symptoms. Removing the impacted wax can help in immediate relief from these symptoms, and this procedure has to be done by professional medical personnel.\n\n【9】What Are the Contraindications of Ear Irrigation?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Ear irrigation includes a few contraindications, such as a lack of patient consent, and other contraindications include -\n\n【11】*   The inability of the patient to sit upright.\n    \n*   The patient is unwilling to sit still.\n    \n*   Presence of foreign body in the ear canal.\n    \n*   Perforated eardrum or tympanic membrane.\n    \n*   Patient with a history of middle ear infection.\n    \n*   History of ear surgery.\n    \n*   Patient with inner ear problems such as vertigo (sensation spinning).\n    \n\n【12】What Equipments Are Used in Ear Irrigation?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The first step of ear irrigation is to assess the canal using an otoscope. For irrigation, water is used, which should be warm before use. The equipment required for irrigation includes -\n\n【14】*   Irrigating solution is warmed to 98.6 F before use.\n    \n*   Irrigation set including container and irrigating, or bulb syringe.\n    \n*   A shallow basin.\n    \n*   Cotton-tipped applicator.\n    \n*   Cotton balls.\n    \n*   Waterproof pad.\n    \n\n【15】For irrigation 60 mm syringe with a 16 to 18-gauge intravenous (IV) catheter can be used, or a pulsating water device. When the ear canal is flushed with the liquid, the ear irrigation basin will be needed to collect the debris as it leaves the ear. Syringes and IV catheters are easily available compared to pulsating water devices, therefore, they are most commonly used.\n\n【16】How Is Ear Irrigation Performed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【17】The following are some of the steps involved in the procedure of ear irrigation -\n\n【18】*   Before starting the procedure, it is important to ensure whether any associated contraindications can harm the patient.\n    \n*   After that, the procedure is explained to the patient, and the necessary equipment is gathered.\n    \n*   The patient is instructed to either sit up or lie down with their head tilted, and the patient is told to hold the emesis basin (shallow basin with a kidney-shaped base) under the ear to collect the solution.\n    \n*   The outer ear is cleaned with normal saline or irrigating solution.\n    \n*   The bulb syringe is then filled with the solution, and the ear canal is straightened by pulling the outer ear or pinna in directions down and back for an infant and up and back in the case of adults.\n    \n*   After that, the solution is injected into the ear canal with a steady and slow stream, and the solution coming out is collected in the basin.\n    \n*   After that, the cotton ball is placed in the canal, and the patient is asked to lie down on the side of the affected ear and clean the ear using a towel or pad.\n    \n\n【19】At last, the provider will check the canal with an otoscope to see whether all the wax is removed. If the wax is still there after ear irrigation, it can be removed using an instrument called a curette.\n\n【20】What Are the Risks and Possible Complications of Ear Irrigation?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Earwax irrigation is a simple and easy procedure that does not cause complications. However, with any procedure, some complications or risk factors are involved, and the same is in the case of ear irrigation, which includes -\n\n【22】*   Bleeding.\n    \n*   Dizziness.\n    \n*   Perforated eardrum.\n    \n*   Pain.\n    \n*   Tinnitus or ringing in the ears.\n    \n*   Swimmer’s ear (outer ear canal infection, which runs from the eardrum to the outside of the head).\n    \n*   Temporary hearing loss.\n    \n*   Water in the ear canal.\n    \n\n【23】**Conclusion:**\n\n【24】Ear irrigation can be useful in case of wax build-up in the ear. As wax impaction may cause pain, fullness, itching, or imbalance sensation, all these symptoms can be easily resolved by this procedure. Ear irrigation is a simple and safe procedure and rarely involves any side effects.\n\n【25】Article Resources\n\n【26】*   Ear Irrigation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459335/\n*   Ear Irrigation – What You Need To Know  \n    https://lambtonroadmedical.nhs.uk/practice-information/ear-irrigation-what-you-need-to-know/\n*   Ear Irrigation  \n    https://www.clearwax.co.uk/ear-irrigation/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These unwanted hair are due to hormonal imbalance and heredity, which are difficult to correct. It can also be due to drugs, medical conditions, or frequent and temporary hair removal methods. In such a case, electrolysis is the best choice for removing hair in undesired areas.\n\n【2】What Device Is Used During Electrolysis?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The device used for electrolysis is called the epilator. It uses electric current to directly destroy hair growth centers, thereby stopping hair growth in unwanted areas.\n\n【4】**What Happens During Electrolysis?**\n\n【5】The specialist uses a thin needle which is thinner than hair. This needle is inserted into the opening of the hair follicle. Then an electric current is passed through it, which destroys the growth of hair cells. The individual may feel a hot or pinching during the needle insertion.\n\n【6】What Are the Areas Electrolysis Can Be Done?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Electrolysis can be done in the following areas.\n\n【8】*   Face, including the chin, eyebrows, and lips.\n    \n*   Fingers and toes.\n    \n*   Underarms.\n    \n*   Bikini line.\n    \n*   Thighs.\n    \n*   Lower legs.\n    \n*   Back.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Usage of LASER in Dermatology and Skin Care\n    \n    I am having underarm darkness and blackheads for many years. Please advice.\n    \n    Is there any surgery to eradicate hirsutism?\n    \n*   Breasts.\n    \n*   Abdomen.\n    \n\n【9】How to Choose an Electrologist?\n-------------------------------\n\n【10】Electrologists are specialists who are trained to perform electrolysis safely. The following criteria should be checked.\n\n【11】*   **Qualification:** Check whether the electrologist is licensed and certified. And check whether they are from an accredited electrology school.\n    \n*   **Ask Suggestions:** Ask friends, family, and your family doctor to recommend a specialist who provides the best services.\n    \n*   **Get a Consultation:** During your consultation, get to know the questions you have from the specialist.\n    \n*   **Uses Right Technique:** A technique of electrolysis using needles is the right method. Check that your specialist does not use an electronic tweezer or photo epilator since they are not permanent hair removal devices.\n    \n*   **Hygiene Maintenance:** Check whether the area and the person who treats it are clean. Look whether the instruments are sterilized.\n    \n\n【12】What Should You Know Before Getting the Treatment?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The individual planning to get electrolysis should know the answers to the following questions from the specialist.\n\n【14】*   How does the procedure feel?\n    \n*   How long would the procedure take?\n    \n*   How many visits will you need?\n    \n*   Will it fulfill the expectations?\n    \n\n【15】What Are Tips to Be Followed After the Procedure?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   Avoid applying makeup for 24 hours after the procedure.\n    \n*   Avoid activities that cause excessive sweating and tanning.\n    \n*   Avoid staying out in the sun.\n    \n\n【17】Who Needs Electrolysis?\n-----------------------\n\n【18】*   Individuals with unwanted hair growth.\n    \n*   Individuals with hirsutism.\n    \n*   Individuals who are undergoing gender transition.\n    \n\n【19】What Are Not Eligible for the Procedure?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【20】Individuals with the following conditions are not eligible for electrolysis.\n\n【21】*   Blood disorders like AIDS, hepatitis, etc., can lead to cross-infection; treatment is not recommended.\n    \n*   Cardiovascular diseases and anticoagulant drugs interfere with the effectiveness of the treatment.\n    \n*   Diabetic individuals are contraindicated as their healing rate is poor.\n    \n*   Patients with an artificial pacemaker should not undergo electrolysis, as using an electric current can be fatal.\n    \n*   Pregnancy.\n    \n*   Skin conditions like dermatitis, sunburns, wounds, and edema in the particular area.\n    \n*   Electrolysis can scar individuals with a history of keloid formation.\n    \n\n【22】How Many Visits Will You Need?\n------------------------------\n\n【23】The number of visits an individual should have for permanent hair removal varies from person to person. It also depends on the area where hair has to be removed. Most of them visit for the treatment once a week, whereas, for some, it may be required once in two weeks. The appointments will last for up to a year. But permanent hair removal can be guaranteed only if the individual attends his appointments regularly and gets treated. Each treatment will last for around 15 minutes to 1 hour, based on the amount of hair growth.\n\n【24】**Why Are So Many Appointments Required?**\n\n【25】The hair growth cycle has three phases: growth, rest, and replacement. And each hair has its hair growth cycle. Repeated treatments will help catch each hair at a particular point to destroy them.\n\n【26】**What Are the Advantages of Electrolysis?**\n\n【27】*   After a series of treatments, hair is removed safely and permanently.\n    \n*   It is the only FDA-approved permanent hair removal treatment.\n    \n*   It works on all hair and skin types.\n    \n*   It works well on sensitive areas such as the face and bikini line.\n    \n*   There is no growing back of hair after electrolysis.\n    \n\n【28】**What Are the Risks and Complications of Electrolysis?**\n\n【29】*   There is an increased risk of infection if an unsterile needle is used.\n    \n*   The skin shows slight redness during and after the treatment.\n    \n*   Dark spots appear in individuals with a dark complexion. These dark spots usually fade after some time, so using bleaching cream is not recommended.\n    \n*   Scarring can occur in some cases, but usually, it is rare.\n    \n\n【30】**How Can You Use an Electrolysis Machine at Home?**\n\n【31】Electrical electrolysis devices are available in the market for home use. But getting done by an electrologist is recommended for better results. They use sterile equipment, and the treatment is of high quality. Especially for permanent body hair removal, it is good to visit a specialist to get the procedure done, as they are trained to perform it without pain.\n\n【32】**What Are the Myths About Electrolysis?**\n\n【33】*   **Electrolysis is Painful:** This method usually does not cause pain, but the individual can feel a slight discomfort. The discomfort can be relieved by using an anesthetic cream.\n    \n*   **Electric Tweezer Removes Hair Permanently:** Electrolysis is the only FDA- approved method for permanent hair removal. An electric tweezer is just for the temporary removal of hair.\n    \n*   **Temporary Hair Removal Methods are Better:** Chemical depilatories are used to remove body hair. But these products contain harsh chemicals that may cause allergic reactions. Bleaches cause skin discoloration as they contain harsh chemicals. The waxing method is also a temporary solution, and it is found to be a painful procedure. Electrolysis will also be painful if you are not trained, but when getting electrolysis done by a specialist, no pain is experienced.\n    \n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Getting electrolysis is the permanent solution for unwanted hair removal recently. The success of the treatment can be reached only when you regularly reach the specialist during your appointments. It is a method recommended by dermatologists as it is safe for use; however, the duration of the treatment is extensive. So check your eligibility for the treatment and book an appointment with a well-trained electrologist.\n\n【36】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【37】* * *\n\n【38】#### **1.**\n\n【39】#### **Is It Possible to Remove Hair Permanently by Electrolysis?**\n\n【40】Electrolysis is a safe, effective, and permanent procedure for removing hair of all skin tones.

Therefore, the process is manageable. However, laser hair removal is less painful than electrolysis hair removal. \n\n【50】#### **5.**\n\n【51】#### **Is Shaving Necessary Before Electrolysis?**\n\n【52】During the electrolysis procedure, for easy access of the needle to the hair follicle and removal, at least one-eighth of the hair must be above the skin surface. Therefore, shaving is not recommended for three to five days before the procedure. \n\n【53】#### **6.**\n\n【54】#### **Why Is Electrolysis Not Familiar?**\n\n【55】Electrolysis hair removal is unfamiliar because of its cost and number of sessions. However, laser hair removal being an expensive procedure, it is comparatively lesser than electrolysis as it requires only a few sessions. \n\n【56】#### **7.**\n\n【57】#### **Is Laser or Electrolysis Effective for Hair Removal?**\n\n【58】Electrolysis and laser hair removal are procedures having long-lasting effects compared to conventional hair removal methods like shaving. The results are permanent in both. However, electrolysis has significant drawbacks when compared to laser hair removal. \n\n【59】#### **8.**\n\n【60】#### **Does Hair Grow Back After Electrolysis?**\n\n【61】Electrolysis hair removal has less chance of growing hair again. However, it can happen if the patient is not regular in appointments. Each follicle's hair growth cycle is different and may take several days, months, or even years for permanent removal. \n\n【62】#### **9.**\n\n【63】#### **Which Age Is Best for Electrolysis Hair Removal?**\n\n【64】Electrolysis hair removal is best for any group, from newborns to older adults. There are no specific reasons for use in any age group other than it is safe and effective. In addition, the age at which an individual undergoes the procedure is their choice. \n\n【65】#### **10.**\n\n【66】#### **How Long Does It Take To Recover From Electrolysis?**\n\n【67】The recovery after an electrolysis hair removal procedure is 7 to 21 days. However, recovery duration depends on the skin type and treated region. In addition, the patient's hygiene practices are essential for fast recovery. \n\n【68】Article Resources\n\n【69】*   AN EXPERT’S GUIDE TO ELECTROLYSIS HAIR REMOVAL  \n    https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/salon-services/electrolysis-hair-removal\n*   Electrolysis  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/8306-electrolysis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These fears are extreme and persistent. Fear can be of an animal, object, person, activity, environment, or situation. The fear is uncontrolled and can present little or no real danger. People with phobias are generally aware of their fears but find it difficult to overcome them.\n\n【2】What Is Achluophobia?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Achluophobia is fear of the dark. 'Achluo' in Greek means darkness, and 'phobia' explains fear. The most common type of phobia usually affects most children and very few adults.\n\n【4】Achluophobia is common and is not due to the dark itself, but it is commonly due to the imagined dangers of the darkness. Fear of the dark is commonly encountered in children below the age of 2 years, but only when the degree of phobia is severe enough to be treated pathologically is it termed achluophobia.To some extent, the fear of the dark is natural, urging the stages of child development.\n\n【5】Therefore every time a person fears darkness is not achluophobia. But when the fear is uncontrolled or cannot be overcome with age, it is important to visit a therapist or seek help. The reason or the initiation cause of the phobia is unknown, but some researchers suggest that fear of darkness manifests as a separation anxiety disorder. Some children fear imaginary objects in the dark, like monsters or nightmares that terrify them. The fear is so intense that even the thought of being in the darkness scares them.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Achluophobia?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】The symptoms of Achluophobia range from mild to severe, and these symptoms can be similar to those presented by other phobias like claustrophobia (fear of closed spaces). These symptoms are the physical reactions to the darkness.\n\n【8】Some of the common physical symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   Dry mouth.\n    \n*   Muscle tension.\n    \n*   Shortness of breath.\n    \n*   Breathlessness.\n    \n*   Tremors.\n    \n*   Hyperventilating.\n    \n*   Tachycardia.\n    \n*   Feeling trapped and unable to escape.\n    \n*   Crying.\n    \n*   Acting clingy.\n    \n*   Tantrums or mood swings.\n    \n*   Dizziness.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Sweating.\n    \n\n【10】Other symptoms include:\n\n【11】*   Avoiding going in the dark or being in complete darkness.\n    \n*   Fear even at the thought of darkness.\n    \n*   Guilt or shame about being afraid of the dark.\n    \n*   Panic at being in the dark or even thinking about the darkness.\n    \n*   Desperation to get out of the dark.\n    \n*   Difficulty sleeping alone in a dark room.\n    \n*   Avoid going to the washroom alone at night.\n    \n\n【12】The above mentioned symptoms can be annoying, but the fear of the dark can be overcome early.\n\n【13】What Causes Achluophobia?\n-------------------------\n\n【14】The cause of achluophobia, just like other phobias, is unclear. It is considered that phobias develop probably due to genetic and environmental factors that enhance the fear and its effects. Some people associate their fear of the dark with a specific negative experience or some story they are told. In such cases, an area of the brain termed the amygdala plays a role and stores it in the brain memory. Fear involves the amygdala area of the brain. This tiny region records reactions to experiences, bringing back the scariness when you experience a similar situation. Due to this process of memory and repeated episodes, it becomes difficult to determine if the etiology is learned or inherited.\n\n【15】How Is Achluophobia Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【16】Achluophobia is self-diagnosed in most cases, as a person realizes the fear of darkness is severe and difficult to overcome. Severe cases might require routine appointments with the doctor as the diagnosis is never made in the first appointment. In self-diagnosed cases, the patient seeks medical help for further confirmation, evaluation, and treatment to overcome the phobia. The physician eliminates all the physical and environmental factors of fear.\n\n【17】How Is Achluophobia Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【18】Phobias are disorders that last for a very long duration since their onset; these disorders are often left untreated and cured as the person develops an understanding to overcome their fears. But chronic and severe cases require medical help and attention as these people are prone to mental health disorders like anxiety and depression as they withdraw from social interactions due to guilt about their anxiety. Such cases are prone to substance abuse and can sometimes land in life-threatening situations like shock, which can even cause the death of a person.\n\n【19】Treatment in cases with achluophobia aims to motivate and educate the subjects by eradicating their imaginary thoughts. Some of the commonly used treatment methods include methods of psychotherapy.\n\n【20】These treatments are advised and recommended only when the fear of the dark affects an individual's daily life and normal social functioning.\n\n【21】*   **CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy):** Cognitive behavior therapy is a behavior management therapy where an individual is trained and motivated to convert unhealthy or negative thoughts into productive and positive ones. A therapist uses different modes of communication to alter the thought process and overcome the fear.\n    \n*   **Exposure Therapy:** Exposure therapy is used and considered the most effective treatment method. This therapy is a method where a person is repeatedly exposed to fearful environments under a therapist's guidance until they are confident enough to be in the dark on their own.\n    \n\n【22】What Are the Complications of Achluophobia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Any fear or phobia can lead to severe physical or life-threatening complications like:\n\n【24】*   Shock.\n    \n*   Tachycardia.\n    \n*   Anxiety.\n    \n*   Depression.\n    \n*   Loneliness.\n    \n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】Achluophobia is used to describe the fear of the dark. The cause of the phobia remains unknown and is commonly encountered in children but can also be seen in adults. The condition is self-diagnosed and can be treated.\n\n【27】Article Resources\n\n【28】*   Achluophobia  \n    https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=8&Issue=9&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=30\n*   Achluophobia in High School Students  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330614988\\_Achluophobia\\_in\\_High\\_School\\_Students\\_Guntur\\_Andhra\\_Pradesh\\_India", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It was first described by Johanson and Blizzard in 1971, and the defective gene was identified in 2006 by Zenker et al. The signs and symptoms and the severity of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome vary among affected individuals. However, the characteristic features of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome include pancreatic insufficiency (abnormal development of pancreas) causing malabsorption, failure to thrive and grow at the expected rate during the first years of life causing short stature, abnormalities of permanent teeth, abnormalities of the skull and facial region such as small beak-shaped nose, and intellectual disability. Most of the symptoms are present since birth (congenital) or early childhood. This syndrome is believed to be caused by changes in the UBR1 gene. Johanson-Blizzard syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. As it is a rare disorder, the incidence is estimated to be one in 250000 births.\n\n【2】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The specific signs and symptoms found in almost all the patients of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome are:\n\n【4】*   Pancreatic insufficiency.\n    \n*   Abnormalities of the tooth.\n    \n*   A characteristic shape of the nose.\n    \n\n【5】Other signs and symptoms in infants include the following:\n\n【6】*   Unusually small nose appearing beak-shaped due to absence of or under development of nasal wings.\n    \n*   Underdeveloped small upper jaw.\n    \n*   A small pointed chin.\n    \n*   Narrow long upper lip.\n    \n*   The circumference of a child’s head is smaller than expected for that age and gender.\n    \n*   Some of the affected children may not have small openings in the inner corners of the eyelids from where the tears drain normally or an abnormal passage that drains tears directly to the surface of the skin from the inner corner of the eyelids.\n    \n*   Severe facial clefting, including cleft lip and palate and lateral facial clefts extending to the lower eyelid from the nasal region.\n    \n*   Low birth weight with hypotonia (generalized poor muscle tone).\n    \n*   Developmental delays and intellectual disability.\n    \n*   Hearing loss or deafness.\n    \n*   Growth deficiency due to malabsorption and pancreatic insufficiency.\n    \n*   Tooth abnormalities like abnormally small, cone-shaped, widely spaced teeth with short, irregular, malformed roots. Most permanent teeth are absent in children.\n    \n*   Affected individuals show abnormally decreased thyroid gland activity and hypothyroidism (underproduction of thyroid hormones).\n    \n*   Abnormalities include the persistence of the anal membrane resulting in full or partial closure of the anus, preventing the normal passage of the bowel contents.\n    \n*   In males, abnormal placement of the urinary opening on the underside of the penis can be seen.\n    \n*   Small, underdeveloped nipples in infants and children.\n    \n*   Abnormally high susceptibility to repeated infections.\n    \n*   Congenital heart defects include a hole in the septum separating the upper or lower chambers of the heart.\n    \n*   Deficiency of growth hormone.\n    \n*   The juvenile onset of diabetes.\n    \n\n【7】What Is the Cause of Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is caused by changes in the UBR1 (ubiquitin E3 ligase) gene. It is an autosomal recessive syndrome. The UBR1 gene encodes a protein called the UBR1 protein. Changes in this gene cause deficient levels of functional UBR1 protein. This protein is necessary for various chemical processes in the body. It is usually found in high levels in the exocrine cells of the pancreas, but it is also found in other tissues as well. Deficient levels of this protein ultimately lead to the findings and physical features of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome. But how it happens is not known to the researchers.\n\n【9】How to Diagnose Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The diagnosis of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is made on the basis of the identification of the characteristic symptoms, patient history, and a thorough physical evaluation. The diagnosis of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome can be confirmed through molecular genetic testing that can identify the characteristic changes or mutations of the UBR1 gene that is responsible for causing this syndrome.\n\n【11】Other tests may be recommended to evaluate the severity of the Johanson-Blizzard syndrome. These tests include hearing tests to check the presence and degree of hearing loss or computed tomography (CT) scan that is helpful in determining the extent of fatty filtration of the pancreas. The affected infants and children should be screened for the development of complications such as hypopituitarism, congenital heart defects, hypothyroidism, and juvenile-onset diabetes.\n\n【12】What Are the Treatment Options for Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   The treatment plan for Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms that are specified in each individual. The treatment may need the coordinated efforts and comprehensive treatment plan of a team of specialists, including pediatricians, dental surgeons, surgeons, speech pathologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, and other medical healthcare professionals.\n    \n*   The treatment therapies for Johanson-Blizzard syndrome are supportive and symptomatic. Individuals who suffer from this syndrome generally require lifelong pancreatic enzyme supplements like oral pancreatin to promote adequate absorption of fats and other nutrients. In most cases, vitamin supplements are prescribed to prevent or treat vitamin deficiencies resulting from malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\n    \n*   A special diet with high protein supplements that can be easily absorbed is also prescribed to make sure that an affected individual’s nutritional demands are met.\n    \n*   People with hypothyroidism need immediate thyroxine hormone replacement therapy. Especially in infants, it is mandatory that hypothyroidism be diagnosed early and managed immediately.\n    \n*   Other abnormalities associated with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome can be corrected surgically. These include certain craniofacial, cardiac, genitourinary, and other malformations associated with this syndrome. Depending on the severity of the anal abnormalities, surgery may be performed to correct or reconstruct the anus or create an opening between the large intestine and the surface of the body to allow passage of bowel contents. The surgical procedure will depend on the anatomical abnormalities' severity and location and associated symptoms.\n    \n*   The dental abnormalities associated with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome can be treated through bonding agents, dentures, and other supportive techniques.\n    \n*   Hearing loss is treated with hearing aids.\n    \n\n【14】**Conclusion:**\n\n【15】Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that affects many organ systems with a wide range of congenital abnormalities. The spectrum of potential physical findings and features associated with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is varied and wide and differs dramatically from person to person. Early intervention is necessary to ensure children with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome reach their potential. Genetic counseling has proven to be beneficial for affected individuals and their families.\n\n【16】Article Resources\n\n【17】*   Johanson-Blizzard syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3208372/\n*   Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/johanson-blizzard-syndrome/\n*   JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME; JBS  \n    https://www.omim.org/entry/243800", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a6dd3158-25a6-4979-b2e8-e8ae2f230f65", "title": "Maternal Hematologic Disorders - An Overview", "text": "【0】Maternal Hematologic Disorders - An Overview\n**Introduction**\\-\n\n【1】These disorders can arise before pregnancy or may be newly diagnosed during pregnancy. Pregnancy complications can exert a considerable influence on the well-being of both the expectant mother and the growing fetus, potentially resulting in adverse health outcomes. such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor, and fetal growth restriction. Diagnosis and management of maternal hematologic disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and require close collaboration between obstetricians and hematologists. Treatment options may include blood transfusions, medication to increase red blood cell or platelet counts, anticoagulation therapy, or specialized obstetrical care during delivery.\n\n【2】This article will explore the various types of maternal hematologic disorders, their impact on pregnancy and fetal outcomes, and current strategies for diagnosis and management.\n\n【3】What Are the Common Types of Maternal Hematologic Disorders and What Are Their Causes?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】There are several types of maternal hematologic disorders that can affect pregnant women, each with its own causes and characteristics-\n\n【5】1.  **Anemia:** This is a common hematologic disorder in pregnant women, and can be caused by iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or sickle cell disease. Iron deficiency anemia is the commonest type of anemia in pregnancy, and can be caused by inadequate iron intake or poor iron absorption.\n    \n2.  **Thrombocytopenia:** This disorder is characterized by a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy and delivery. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy can be caused by immune-mediated destruction of platelets, impaired platelet production, or underlying medical conditions such as lupus.\n    \n3.  **Thrombophilia:** This is a tendency toward abnormal blood clotting, which can increase the risk of blood clots in the veins and lungs. Thrombophilia can be caused by genetic mutations such as Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation, or acquired conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome.\n    \n4.  **Bleeding Disorders:** Women with bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia may be at increased risk of abnormal bleeding during pregnancy and delivery.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Hemophilia C - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n    \n    Pediatric Pathology\n    \n    Infant of a Diabetic Mother - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n    \n5.  **Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn:** This is a condition in which maternal antibodies attack fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia and potentially severe complications. Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn can occur when the mother has Rh-negative blood and the fetus has Rh-positive blood or in other blood group incompatibilities.\n    \n\n【6】The causes of maternal hematologic disorders can vary depending on the specific condition. Some hematologic disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia, may be caused by inadequate nutrient intake or absorption. Others, such as thrombophilia, may have a genetic component. In some cases, hematologic disorders may be diagnosed during pregnancy due to changes in blood volume and circulation. It is important for pregnant women to receive appropriate medical care and monitoring to manage these disorders and ensure the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby.\n\n【7】How Do Maternal Hematologic Disorders Impact Fetal Development and Pregnancy Outcomes?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Maternal hematologic disorders can have a significant impact on fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. The effects can vary depending on the specific disorder and its severity, but some common impacts include:\n\n【9】1.  **Fetal Growth Restriction:** Maternal hematologic disorders such as anemia or thrombophilia can reduce the quantity of oxygen and nutrients that reach the developing fetus, leading to poor fetal growth and development.\n    \n2.  **Preterm Labor:** Women with maternal hematologic disorders may be at increased risk of preterm labor and delivery, which can have long-term health consequences for the baby.\n    \n3.  **Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn:** This is a condition in which maternal antibodies attack fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia and potentially severe complications such as brain damage, stillbirth, or neonatal death.\n    \n4.  **Fetal and Neonatal Bleeding:** Maternal hematologic disorders such as bleeding disorders can increase the risk of fetal or neonatal bleeding during delivery or in the postpartum period.\n    \n5.  **Stillbirth:** Maternal hematologic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome or thrombophilia can increase the risk of stillbirth.\n    \n6.  **Neonatal Thrombosis:** Some maternal hematologic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome or thrombophilia can increase the risk of blood clots in the fetus or newborn, leading to complications such as stroke or organ damage.\n    \n7.  **Maternal Hemorrhage:** Women with bleeding disorders or thrombocytopenia may be at higher risk of bleeding complications during delivery or in the postpartum period.\n    \n\n【10】The impact of maternal hematologic disorders on fetal development and pregnancy outcomes can be mitigated with appropriate medical care and monitoring. Expectant mothers who have hematologic disorders should collaborate closely with their healthcare professionals to control their ailment and ensure the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby.\n\n【11】What Are the Challenges in Diagnosing and Managing Maternal Hematologic Disorders During Pregnancy?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Diagnosing and managing maternal hematologic disorders during pregnancy can be challenging due to a number of factors:\n\n【13】1.  **Lack of Symptoms:** Many hematologic disorders, such as thrombophilia, may not cause symptoms in the mother and can only be detected through blood tests. This can make it difficult to identify these disorders in pregnant women who may not have been screened previously.\n    \n2.  **Physiological Changes During Pregnancy:** Pregnancy can cause changes in blood volume, coagulation, and other factors that can complicate the diagnosis and management of hematologic disorders. For example, iron levels may decrease during pregnancy even in women without pre-existing anemia, making it difficult to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.\n    \n3.  **Risk of Fetal Harm:** Some treatments for maternal hematologic disorders may pose a risk to the developing fetus, such as anticoagulants that can increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus or neonate. Balancing the risks and benefits of these treatments can be challenging.\n    \n4.  **Complex Treatment Regimens:** Managing hematologic disorders during pregnancy may require complex treatment regimens that need to be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. For example, women with thrombophilia may require anticoagulation therapy, which must be closely monitored to ensure appropriate dosing and minimize the risk of bleeding complications.\n    \n5.  **Limited Research:** Due to ethical concerns, pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, which can limit the availability of data on the safety and effectiveness of treatments for hematologic disorders during pregnancy.\n    \n\n【14】Despite these challenges, with appropriate medical care and monitoring, most women with maternal hematologic disorders can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies. It is important for pregnant women with hematologic disorders to receive regular prenatal care and It is advisable for pregnant women who have hematologic disorders to closely cooperate with their healthcare providers in order to effectively handle their condition and maximize positive results for both themselves and their infants.\n\n【15】What Treatment Options Are Available for Maternal Hematologic Disorders During Pregnancy and How Effective Are They?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The management of maternal hematologic disorders while pregnant is contingent upon the type and gravity of the particular disorder. Here are some commonly used treatment options:\n\n【17】1.  **Iron Supplementation:** For women with iron deficiency anemia, iron supplementation is usually the first-line treatment. Iron supplementation can help increase hemoglobin levels and improve maternal and fetal outcomes.\n    \n2.  **Blood Transfusions:** If anemia becomes severe, it may be essential to administer blood transfusions to enhance the blood's ability to transport oxygen.\n    \n3.  **Anticoagulation Therapy:** For women with thrombophilia or other clotting disorders, anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent blood clots. Nevertheless, the usage of anticoagulants can elevate the likelihood of bleeding complications, so careful monitoring is required.\n    \n4.  **Plasma Exchange:** For women with autoimmune disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome, plasma exchange may be used to remove harmful antibodies from the blood.\n    \n5.  **Immunosuppressive Therapy:** For women with autoimmune disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppressive therapy may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent disease flares.\n    \n6.  **Delivery:** In some cases, delivery may be the best option for managing maternal hematologic disorders, particularly if the disorder poses a significant risk to the mother or baby.\n    \n\n【18】The efficacy of these therapies is contingent upon the particular hematologic disorder, the severity of the condition, and other factors such as maternal age, gestational age, and underlying health conditions. With appropriate medical care and monitoring, most women with maternal hematologic disorders can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies. However, close monitoring is important to detect and manage any complications that may arise.\n\n【19】**Conclusion-**\n\n【20】Maternal hematologic disorders can pose significant challenges during pregnancy, requiring careful management and monitoring to ensure the best outcomes for the mother and baby. With appropriate medical care and treatment, most women with these conditions can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies.\n\n【21】Article Resources\n\n【22】*   Hematologic Complications of Pregnancy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748382/\n*   Hematologic Disease and Pregnancy  \n    https://www1.cgmh.org.tw/intr/intr5/c6700/OBGYN/f/web/Hematologic%20disease%20and%20Pregnancy/index.htm", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is usually described as an eczematous (scaly, crusted, or hardened) condition in which the skin on the head (scalp) contains thick, adherent, and yellow or silver scales. These scales can extend onto the hair’s shaft and bind together to form a heavy bunch-like structure. These tight scales can appear on the scalp, defeating an individual's confidence due to the patchy appearance anywhere across the scalp. This condition is usually seen as localized, but in rare instances, cases have been reported affecting the entire scalp.\n\n【2】Pityriasis amiantacea is the other name for tinea amiantacea. It commonly affects people between 25 to 50 years of age. Females are less likely to be affected by this condition than males. Tinea amiantacea belongs to psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis group. It commonly occurs as an exaggerated inflammatory response to the disease of the scalp. Few reports have suggested that it could also manifest due to lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, pyogenic infection, or superficial fungal infection. However, it is not caused by fungus and is an inflammatory disease. Therefore, treating tinea amiantacea is important. This scalp disorder can have serious consequences, like temporary alopecia, scarring alopecia, and permanent hair loss due to repeated hair removal from the scalp.\n\n【3】What Is the Cause of Tinea Amiantacea?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【4】Tinea amiantacea often happens as a reactive condition rather than a diagnosis. It’s normally associated with conditions such as:\n\n【5】*   Seborrhoeic dermatitis (eczema skin condition affecting the scalp).\n    \n*   Scalp psoriasis (excessive flaking of the scalp with constant irritation).\n    \n*   Atopic dermatitis (a skin condition causing dryness, itchiness, and scalp inflammation).\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    How to stop tinea barbae from spreading?\n    \n    I have tinea cruris. Will it get cured completely?\n    \n    I have tinea corporis, and I feel discomfort. How can I cure it?\n    \n*   Tinea capitis (fungal infection of the scalp).\n    \n*   Lichen simplex (skin condition causing single or multiple plaques on the scalp leading to chronic itching and scratching).\n    \n*   Contact dermatitis (an allergic reaction of the scalp occurring due to response to a foreign substance).\n    \n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Tinea Amiantacea?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Tinea amiantacea is generally seen in children and young adults. Females are less likely to be affected by this condition than males. The main characteristic feature of tinea amiantacea is thick scales binding down the tufts and wrapping around the hair. Depending on the duration and underlying condition, the scales can appear localized or generalized. Secondary infections like staphylococcal infections can complicate this infection due to sticky, oozy, and crusty scalp conditions. The most common symptoms of tinea amiantacea are:\n\n【8】*   Yellow or silvery-white scales. The scales are found to be arranged like shingles on a roof and appear as asbestos flakes. The scales are more pronounced at the hair ends where the follicles are found.\n    \n*   Redness of the scalp.\n    \n*   Bumpiness on the scalp due to the presence of scales.\n    \n*   Inflammation of the scalp.\n    \n*   Burning sensation of the scalp.\n    \n*   Dandruff-like flaking.\n    \n*   Dryness of the scalp.\n    \n*   Hair loss.\n    \n\n【9】The scalp under the scales commonly appears normal, but in some cases, it also appears reddish and scaly. Hair loss may be noted in the areas affected by tinea amiantacea. However, hair will regrow after extensive and continuous treatment. Individuals affected with tinea amiantacea can face difficulty combining and separating the hair strands from each other as they are clumped together with the scales.\n\n【10】How Is Tinea Amiantacea Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【11】Tinea amiantacea is diagnosed based on the physical examination and medical history. Dermoscopy (examining skin lesions with a dermatoscope) will help diagnose tinea amiantacea. The dermoscopic features will include comma hairs, elbow-shaped hairs, interrupted (morse code-like) hairs, zigzag hairs, corkscrew hairs, and question mark hairs with diffuse white or yellowish scaling. The compact scales are thick, silver, and attached to tufts of hair.\n\n【12】To rule out tinea capitis, mycological cultures done on conventional Sabouraud’s dextrose agar medium are required. Scraping from the scalp and small hair follicles extracts are sent to a laboratory for further clinical investigation. Histopathology is not necessary.\n\n【13】In scalp biopsy, nonspecific features are seen, like diffuse parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, and follicular keratosis. A distinguishing feature of tinea amiantacea is a sheath of horns surrounding the hair shaft, distinguishing it from other inflammatory hair disorders like seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen simplex, etc.\n\n【14】What Is the Treatment for Tinea Amiantacea?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Tinea amiantacea is a troublesome and irritating condition. Therefore, immediate treatment is needed. However, the treatment is short-term and does not include any difficult procedure. While treating tinea amiantacea, the trichologist removes the scales on the scalp with the help of medicines (anti-inflammatory and keratolytic agents). The dosage and application time of medicine depends on the degree of the infection. In severe cases, medicine needs to stay on the scalp for an extended period, which helps in better penetration of the medicine into the skin of the scalp.\n\n【16】In cases of fungal infection, antifungal medications are used over the affected area. The bacteria Staphylococcus is present in most cases. When these bacteria are found, treatment with systemic antibiotics and coal tar shampoo will help to cure the condition completely. Vegetable and mineral oils are also used in some instances under the supervision of specialists. Steroids and lotions may help to get rid of inflammation and itching. These scales on the scalp are very stubborn and, thus, difficult to remove. On removal of these scales, a yellow sticky discharge oozes out. So utmost care and caution are needed during the procedure. Peeling such scales is not advisable without specialist supervision as it could cause permanent scarring and alopecia. Some preventive measures should be taken for patients with tinea amiantacea to avoid worsening the condition.\n\n【17】*   Avoid strenuous physical activities, which can affect body temperature and worsen itching.\n    \n*   Avoid hot showers or baths, as they can also worsen itching. Oatmeal baths help in soothing the itching.\n    \n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Tinea amiantacea is an eczematous scalp with thick, adherent, and yellow or silver scale deposits on the scalp. It is an irritating and troublesome condition, causing mental stress to the affected individuals. This can be caused due to aggravation or reaction to presenting illness. Treatment can cure the condition, but long-term treatment is required. Consult a trichology as early as possible for effective and beneficial treatment.\n\n【20】Article Resources\n\n【21】*   Pityriasis amiantacea  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/pityriasis-amiantacea\n*   Pityriasis amiantacea  \n    https://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/pityriasis-amientacia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In other words, it can be called inflamed pimples. Baby acne is a commonly occurring lesion developing on the face or body of the baby and is a temporary condition. It causes small red or white bumps or pimples. Most of the cases recover on their own without any specific treatment. It is also called neonatal acne, and the prevalence is about 20 percent of newborns.\n\n【2】### Baby Acne and Infantile Acne:\n\n【3】There is a difference between baby acne and infantile acne. Infantile acne consists of open comedones or blackheads, which is usually not seen in baby acne. There can be the presence of cysts or nodules also. There can be the presence of scars in rare cases. Another difference is that baby acne occurs in the first few months of life of the baby, whereas infantile acne can be there until 2 years of age of the child. Infantile acne's frequency is less common than baby acne.\n\n【4】How Is It Caused?\n-----------------\n\n【5】The cause has not yet been confirmed, but studies and research show that it can be related to maternal or infant hormones.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【7】1\\. The appearance of baby acne is similar to adolescent or adult acne; that is, it is commonly seen as red bumps or pimples. There can be white pustules or whiteheads along with reddish skin around the pimples.\n\n【8】2\\. The site involved can be anywhere on the face, but the frequency is more on cheeks. Sometimes, the upper back or neck may be involved in the babies.\n\n【9】3\\. If the baby is crying or irritated, it may be more prominent, and even rough fabrics can aggravate the acne.\n\n【10】There can be an occasional occurrence of these acnes at birth, but most commonly, this develops within two to four weeks post-birth.

So, the term cardiomyopathy describes a disease of the muscles of the heart. In this condition, there is difficulty in the heart’s chambers to pump blood effectively to all the body’s tissues. This difficulty might result in cardiac failure or cardiac arrhythmia in the long run. Also, valvular dysfunctions can occur as a result of cardiomyopathy. It can be either genetic or acquired. The muscles of the heart become thick and rigid and show enlargement in most cases. However, in a few, scar tissue replaces the diseased heart muscles.\n\n【2】How Prevalent Is Cardiomyopathy?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Cardiomyopathy is prevalent in about one in every 500 individuals, and it can occur in anyone. However, few types have some gender predisposition with arrhythmic and dilated cardiomyopathy common in males.\n\n【4】What Increases the Risk of Cardiomyopathy?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】• Obesity.\n\n【6】• Increased alcohol consumption.\n\n【7】• Family history of heart diseases like cardiac arrest or cardiomyopathy.\n\n【8】• Previous cardiac problems like endocarditis, coronary artery disease, and heart attack.\n\n【9】• Drug abuse.\n\n【10】• A prolonged rise in blood pressure.\n\n【11】• Cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【12】• Amyloidosis.\n\n【13】• Sarcoidosis.\n\n【14】• Diabetes.\n\n【15】• Thyroid disorders.\n\n【16】• Hemochromatosis.\n\n【17】What Are the Types of Cardiomyopathy?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】Depending on how and which heart muscle is affected, there are a few types.\n\n【19】**1\\. Hypertrophic:** In this type, the heart muscles thicken, which results in ineffective functioning of the heart. The left ventricle, a critical chamber for pumping, is commonly affected. Also, it has been attributed that this type of cardiomyopathy has a genetic predisposition.\n\n【20】**2\\. Dilated:** The muscles get thin and stretched out in this type, causing the chamber to get enlarged. The left ventricle is the most commonly affected chamber. It is common in middle-aged males and can also be due to genetic defects.\n\n【21】**3\\. Restrictive:** The heart muscles become stiff and rigid, making it hard to expand and fill in blood. This type of cardiomyopathy is common in older adults, and it usually is idiopathic in nature. However, amyloidosis can also cause its occurence.\n\n【22】Related Topics\n\n【23】* * *\n\n【24】Facts About Cardiomyopathy in Adults\n\n【25】Do you see any abnormality in the attached EEG report?\n\n【26】How to diagnose alcoholic cardiomyopathy?\n\n【27】**4\\. Arrhythmogenic:** The muscles of the right ventricle are replaced by scar tissue which results in arrhythmic conditions. Genetic mutations are an important cause of this type of cardiomyopathy.\n\n【28】**5\\. Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy:** Left ventricle shows an abnormal build-up of proteins.\n\n【29】**6\\. Unclassified:** This includes peripartum cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, and chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\n【30】What Are the Causes of Cardiomyopathy?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【31】It may be caused due to varying reasons.\n\n【32】• Inheriting it from parents.\n\n【33】• Prolonged hypertension.\n\n【34】• Tissue damage after a heart attack.\n\n【35】• Prolonged tachycardia.\n\n【36】• Heart valve defects.\n\n【37】• Infections that affect the heart muscle.\n\n【38】• Metabolic disorders like thyroid dysfunction and diabetes.\n\n【39】• Tissue diseases such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, lupus, vasculitis, etc.\n\n【40】• Vitamin deficiency, in particular, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine).\n\n【41】• Obesity.\n\n【42】• Smoking.\n\n【43】• Hemochromatosis or the building up of iron in the heart.\n\n【44】• Drug abuse.\n\n【45】• Connective tissue disorders.\n\n【46】• Overconsumption of alcohol over a long time.\n\n【47】• Chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【48】• Sometimes as a complication of pregnancy.\n\n【49】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cardiomyopathy in Adults?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Initially, cardiomyopathy does not produce any symptoms, but as the disease progresses, it shows signs and symptoms. These symptoms worsen over time if left untreated. The person may experience one or many of the following.\n\n【51】1\\. Shortness of breath.\n\n【52】2\\. Lightheadedness and dizziness.\n\n【53】3\\. Extreme fatigue.\n\n【54】4\\. Chest pain.\n\n【55】5\\. Fainting.\n\n【56】6\\. Abdominal bloating.\n\n【57】7\\. Persistent cough while lying down.\n\n【58】8\\. Lying in a flat position becomes difficult.\n\n【59】9\\. Swelling of legs, feet, and ankle (edema).\n\n【60】10\\. Difficulty with focus and concentration.\n\n【61】11\\. Palpitations.\n\n【62】12\\. High blood pressure.\n\n【63】How Is Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【64】Few tests help with the diagnosis and classification into which type of cardiomyopathy it is.\n\n【65】**1\\. Physical Examination-** Physical examination along with complete family and medical history is done.\n\n【66】**2\\. Blood Tests-** Blood tests are done to determine iron levels and the function of the liver, kidney, and thyroid. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a protein that increases after heart failure. Therefore, a blood test to measure the level of BNP is helpful in determining heart failures.\n\n【67】**3\\. Echocardiogram-** It helps in identifying the cause of the symptoms. In this test, the image of the heart shows the motion and size of the heart while beating.\n\n【68】**4\\. Chest X-Ray-** It helps in diagnosing if the heart is enlarged or not.\n\n【69】**5\\. Cardiac CT Scan-** In a CT scan, a rotating X-ray tube takes pictures of your chest and heart to help in determining the heart size, valves, and functions of the heart.\n\n【70】**6\\. Cardiac MRI-** In a cardiac MRI, the image of your heart is obtained with the help of radio waves and magnetic waves. It is recommended in cases where an echocardiogram is not helpful in diagnosing cardiomyopathy.\n\n【71】**7\\. Electrocardiogram-** The electrocardiogram uses electrical signals to detect the areas of injuries in the heart and also to detect abnormal rhythms. It is a non-invasive test in which electrodes are placed on the skin of the chest to detect electric signals.\n\n【72】**8\\. Radionuclide Ventriculogram-** In this test, a radioactive substance is injected intravenously to measure the amount and blood flow of the heart while it is beating. It assesses the function of the heart.\n\n【73】**9\\. Treadmill Stress Test-** It is done to determine the exercise capacity and also to check for the presence of abnormal rhythms while exercising.\n\n【74】**10\\. Cardiac Catheterization -** During this test, the pressure within the heart vessels is determined with the help of a catheter which is inserted through the blood vessel to gain entry into the heart. It is also helpful in determining the blocks on the heart. In terms of the coronary angiogram, a dye is injected for better visualization with X-rays.\n\n【75】**11\\. Genetic Testing-** As cardiomyopathy runs in families, genetic testing for first-degree relatives might be advised in some.\n\n【76】What Is the Treatment of Cardiomyopathy?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【77】It is essentially not treatable but controlled with the following.\n\n【78】• Lifestyle Changes.\n\n【79】**• Medications-** These help in improving the effective pumping of heart muscles, decrease blood pressure, prevent the formation of blood clots, enhance the blood flow, slow down heart rate, and also remove the extra fluid present in the body.\n\n【80】**• Cardioversion or Ablation-** It is of two types, namely radiofrequency ablation and septal ablation. In the radiofrequency ablation, electrodes are placed at the tip of catheters, which transmits energy and destroys the abnormal tissue causing the abnormal rhythm. In the case of septal ablation, alcohol is injected through the catheter to destroy the thickened heart muscle.\n\n【81】• Pacemakers, Ventricular Assist Device, and Implantable-Cardioverter Defibrillators- These are devices that are surgically implanted into the heart to aid in the functional improvement and also to relieve the symptoms caused.\n\n【82】• Surgery:\n\n【83】◦ Heart Transplant\\- When no other treatments and medications work, leading to end-stage heart failure, heart transplantation is recommended.\n\n【84】◦ Septal Myectomy- It is an open heart surgical procedure in which a part of the thickened heart muscle is removed to improve the function of the heart.\n\n【85】What Are the Complications of Cardiomyopathy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【86】• Cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n【87】• Heart failure.\n\n【88】• Formation of blood clots.\n\n【89】• Heart valve diseases.\n\n【90】How Can We Prevent Cardiomyopathy?\n----------------------------------\n\n【91】Make lifestyle changes as advised to prevent the disease from progressing.\n\n【92】1\\. Stop smoking.\n\n【93】2\\. Getting into the ideal weight range.\n\n【94】3\\. Quit using alcohol.\n\n【95】4\\. Avoid stress.\n\n【96】5\\. Eat healthily.\n\n【97】6\\.

It is also called Yersinia. This infection can be seen to occur worldwide, but it is more common as a sporadic disease, especially in northern Europe and Asia. It is primarily seen to affect rabbits and other mammals and birds. This infection can be transmitted from asymptomatically infected domestic pork, cattle, sheep, deer, and rabbits, dogs, birds, and reptiles and can be transmitted by cross-contamination happening during the preparation of food.\n\n【2】Reports show that many outbreaks of this type of infection have occurred in zoos, laboratory facilities, and animal-holding areas. Y. pseudotuberculosis is a relatively rare pathogen in humans. The Public health data provided by Russia reports this infection since 1988, and children are twelve times more likely to get infected than adults.\n\n【3】The most commonly occurring syndromes related to this bacteria are self-limited enterocolitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis (pseudoappendicitis), but immunocompromised hosts may have septicemia, which may lead to metastatic infection. Commonly seen metastatic sites are liver, spleen, lungs, and joints or bone, especially in individuals who have cirrhosis, diabetes, and hemochromatosis. There is a special form of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection known as Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), which has been reported in association with specific strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis, and it is seen in Russia and Japan. It demonstrates mitogen A, which plays the role of a superantigen. In Japan, FESLF is called Izumi fever.\n\n【4】How Is It Caused?\n-----------------\n\n【5】It is caused due to the pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, which is most commonly known to cause foodborne illnesses like enterocolitis or mesenteric lymphadenitis (pseudoappendicitis) in children. It can also be associated with complications after the infection like erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis. Reports show that strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis which is found in Asia, can produce a superantigen-associated toxic erythema illness which is suggestive of scarlet fever.\n\n【6】It was first isolated in 1883 and is a gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Yersinia in the Enterobacteriaceae family. It can cause gastrointestinal infection in many wild and domestic animals when combined with Yersinia enterocolitica. Y. pseudotuberculosis is cold-tolerant, which leads to the transmission through contaminated cold-stored foods, handling infected animal tissues, and cross-contamination during the preparation of food.\n\n【7】### Epidemiology:\n\n【8】*   Mortality/Morbidity - Most of the infections are self-limited and have a low case-fatality rate. The mortality rate can be increased in the septicemic variant more commonly occurring in immunocompromised patients.\n    \n*   Race - There is no specific racial or ethnic predilection of this infection.\n    \n*   Sex - This infection can be more commonly seen in men than in women. However, women are more prone to develop post infections.\n    \n*   Age - Most commonly, it affects children between 5-15 years old.\n    \n\n【9】What Are The Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【10】Symptoms of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are as follows:\n\n【11】Related Topics\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis- Causes, Symptoms, and Management\n\n【14】Strep A Test - An Overview\n\n【15】Bacterial Infections on Soft Contact Lenses\n\n【16】*   Pain in the abdomen, which is common on the lower right side and may mimic appendicitis\n    \n*   Fever\n    \n*   Diarrhea occasionally.\n    \n*   Rashes and pain in the joints, which can be seen to appear after 1-3 weeks of the onset of the infection. The joint pain can even last up to 6 months after the infection.\n    \n*   People with a weak immune system may develop sepsis which means the spread of infection in the blood.\n    \n\n【17】The symptoms of its other variant can differ between younger children and older children and adults. The symptoms for children under 5 years of age are as follows:\n\n【18】*   Diarrhea\n    \n*   Fever\n    \n*   Vomiting\n    \n*   Abdominal pain in some cases.\n    \n\n【19】Abdominal pain is a prominent symptom in older children and adults. Bacteremia and sepsis are known to occur in patients with a weak immune system.\n\n【20】When To Consult A Doctor?\n-------------------------\n\n【21】Pseudotuberculosis is not usually serious, and the recovery is very quick in most people. Anyone who is having prolonged or severe diarrhea or with any of the symptoms mentioned above should visit a doctor. Also, children having diarrhea, vomiting, or refusing to consume fluids should consult a physician.\n\n【22】Are There Any Complications?\n----------------------------\n\n【23】This infection can lead to a certain complication, especially in immunocompromised individuals, which are as follows:\n\n【24】· Erythema nodosum\n\n【25】· Reactive arthritis\n\n【26】· Bacteremia\n\n【27】· Septicemia\n\n【28】How Can It Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------\n\n【29】When you visit your doctor, you will be first asked about various symptoms that you are facing and your diet history. After that, a physical examination will be done, and various lab tests will be conducted. Blood culture and stool culture can be done. Even serological studies can be done to identify the organism.\n\n【30】How Can It Be Treated?\n----------------------\n\n【31】This infection can be treated using various antibiotics, which are as follows:\n\n【32】1\\. Fluoroquinolones: These are the drugs of choice for this infection. Studies show that they are very effective in treating pseudotuberculosis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and aminoglycosides can also be preferred in treating it.\n\n【33】2\\. B-lactams can be used, but they are questionable. Hence, your physician will decide the treatment regimen depending on the patient and the bacterial strain isolated using various tests.\n\n【34】3\\. Consumption of more fluids in case of loose motions or diarrhea, or vomiting.\n\n【35】How Can It Be Prevented?\n------------------------\n\n【36】Certain precautions and measures can be taken to prevent this infection which has been mentioned below:\n\n【37】1\\. Washing fresh fruits and vegetables before consuming them.\n\n【38】2\\. Avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked meat.\n\n【39】3\\. It is advisable to consume only pasteurized milk or milk products.\n\n【40】4\\.

However, the use of beta-lactam antibiotics still needs to be clarified.\n\n【61】#### **3.**\n\n【62】#### **What Can Be Done to Prevent Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis?**\n\n【63】Some steps to prevent the spread of the infection are as follows:  \na) After using the restroom, changing a baby's diaper, and before handling or consuming any food, wash your hands.  \nb) To lessen the chance of infection transmission, ensure people with diarrhea, especially kids, wash their hands thoroughly and regularly with soap.  \nc) After handling farm animals, domestic animals, pets, animal waste, or animal habitats, always wash your hands.  \nd) Cook raw meat and poultry completely to get rid of the bacteria.  \ne) Cook meat, chicken, pig, and hamburgers until the center are no longer pink.\n\n【64】#### **4.**\n\n【65】#### **What Is the Most Common Clinical Form of Pseudotuberculosis?**\n\n【66】Self-limited enterocolitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis, which mimics appendicitis, are the two most typical clinical Y pseudotuberculosis syndromes. Still, immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to septicemia, which can lead to metastatic infection. The symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n【67】#### **5.**\n\n【68】#### **What Are the Modes of Pseudotuberculosis Transmission?**\n\n【69】It spreads between animals through the fecal-oral pathway. Humans become sick when they consume fresh fruit contaminated with animal excrement, diseased meats, particularly pork, and unpasteurized milk or polluted water. These can be avoided by following the preventive steps that are mentioned above.\n\n【70】#### **6.**\n\n【71】#### **What Illness Is Caused by Corynebacterium Pseudotuberculosis?**\n\n【72】The infection Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is well known to affect farm animals, primarily sheep and goats. Infection in humans happens infrequently. However, it results in ulcerative lymphangitis (inflammation of lymph vessels), abscesses in horses, and caseous lymphadenitis in sheep and goats. Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is a chronic infectious illness that causes economic damage in sheep and goat production around the world. Since there is no effective cure for CLA, immunization is the most significant preventive measure.\n\n【73】#### **7.**\n\n【74】#### **What Examinations Would You Carry Out to Verify the Diagnosis of Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis?**\n\n【75】 - Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection is typically diagnosed by isolating the organism from stool, tissue, blood, or joint fluid.  \n - A trustworthy serologic test for diagnosing Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection is sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n\n【76】#### **8.**\n\n【77】#### **How Can You Naturally Treat Yersinia Enterocolitica?**\n\n【78】Herbs that are used to cure Yersinia include:  \n - Oregano leaf or oil.  \n - The abundant phenol oil in cloves, known as clove-eugenol, has demonstrated potent antibacterial properties against Yersinia in vitro.  \n - Cinnamon.  \n - Husk from pomegranate.  \n - The guava leaf.  \n - Plants that contain berberine.\n\n【79】#### **9.**\n\n【80】#### **Does Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis Need Reporting?**\n\n【81】Y. pseudotuberculosis was diagnosed initially in the United States in 1938 and has been infrequent since then. No epidemics have been reported; from 1938 to 1973, there were only 14 instances reported. Yersiniosis is a notifiable disease in all Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) sites, even though it is not reportable nationally.\n\n【82】#### **10.**\n\n【83】#### **Does Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis Induce Infective Endocarditis?**\n\n【84】Yersinia pseudotuberculosis rarely causes infective endocarditis in some patients. However, due to a lack of experience, managing these infections might take a lot of work. Clinical symptoms included fever, sepsis, and embolic events, followed by cardiac failure. The three antimicrobials that were most frequently utilized were:  \n - Aminoglycosides.  \n - Cephalosporins.  \n - Quinolones.\n\n【85】#### **11.**\n\n【86】#### **Is Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis Capable of Fermenting Lactose?**\n\n【87】Gram-negative bacilli called Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are non-spore-forming, pleomorphic, non-lactose-fermenting organisms that can grow in aerobic and anaerobic environments. But the bacteria has the ability to ferment glucose.\n\n【88】#### **12.**\n\n【89】#### **What Is the Yersinia Incubation Period?**\n\n【90】Symptoms usually appear 4 to 7 days after exposure and can persist for up to 3 weeks. Rare complications can include skin rash, joint pain, or bacteria entering the bloodstream.\n\n【91】#### **13.**\n\n【92】#### **Is It Possible for Yersinia to Grow On Macconkey Agar?**\n\n【93】The yersinia grew best on MacConkey agar and next on SS agar. On MacConkey, SS, EMB, Hektoen, and XLD media, the strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis formed only one type of colony. On the differential media, strains of both Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis grew better at 35 degrees C than at 22 degrees C, but Y. pseudotuberculosis grew much more slowly than the other species.\n\n【94】Article Resources\n\n【95】*   https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/infectious-diseases/yersinia-pseudotuberculosis/  \n    https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/infectious-diseases/yersinia-pseudotuberculosis/\n*   http://www.familydiagnosis.com/diseases/yersinia-pseudotuberculosis.html  \n    http://www.familydiagnosis.com/diseases/yersinia-pseudotuberculosis.html\n*   https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/yersiniosis  \n    https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/yersiniosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0d8e6355-8746-4da8-a6e4-b1bfac67bbb4", "title": "Pulseless Electrical Activity - Diagnosis and Treatment", "text": "【0】Pulseless Electrical Activity - Diagnosis and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Pulseless electrical activity, otherwise called electromechanical dissociation, is a medical emergency condition where the pulse is absent or non-palpable but the electrical activity of the heart remains intact. This is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention and management.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes for Pulseless Electrical Activity?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Prompt identification of the causative factor is highly essential for managing this condition. Causes for pulseless electrical activity include:\n\n【4】*   **Hypovolemia**: This is a condition where there is a significant loss of blood volume, leading to low blood pressure and decreased oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. Hypovolemia can be caused by severe bleeding, dehydration, or fluid loss due to burns.\n    \n*   **Hypoxia**: This is a condition where the body's tissues do not receive enough oxygen due to inadequate ventilation or respiratory failure. Hypoxia can be caused by respiratory distress, drowning, choking, or pulmonary embolism.\n    \n*   **Acidosis**: This is a condition where the body's pH balance is disrupted due to an excess of acid or a lack of bicarbonate ions. Acidosis can be caused by conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or renal failure.\n    \n*   **Hypokalemia**: This is a condition where there is a deficiency of potassium in the blood, which can lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Hypokalemia can be caused by conditions such as severe vomiting or diarrhea, diuretic use, or kidney disease.\n    \n*   **Hyperkalemia****:** This is a condition where there is an excess of potassium in the blood, which can lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Hyperkalemia can be caused by conditions such as kidney failure, acidosis, or certain medications.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Calcium Channel Blocker Poisoning - Causes, Effects, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n    \n    Heart Rate and Women\n    \n*   **Cardiac Tamponade**: This is a condition where there is a buildup of fluid around the heart, leading to compression of the heart and decreased cardiac output. Cardiac tamponade can be caused by conditions such as pericarditis, trauma, or cancer.\n    \n*   **Tension Pneumothorax****:** This is a condition where there is a buildup of air in the pleural space, leading to compression of the lung and decreased oxygen delivery to the body. Tension pneumothorax can be caused by trauma or medical procedures.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Embolism****:** This is a condition where there is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to the body. Pulmonary embolism can be caused by conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or surgery.\n    \n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Pulseless Electrical Activity?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The following are some signs and symptoms of pulseless electrical activity:\n\n【7】*   **Absence of Pulse:** The most obvious sign is the absence of a palpable pulse in any of the major arteries of the body, such as the carotid artery or femoral artery.\n    \n*   **Loss of Consciousness**: Pulseless electrical activity can lead to loss of consciousness in the patient due to insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain.\n    \n*   **Respiratory Distress**: The patient may experience shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or shallow breathing due to decreased oxygen delivery to the body.\n    \n*   **Cyanosis:** Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to decreased oxygen levels in the blood. The patient may exhibit cyanosis in their lips, tongue, or fingertips.\n    \n*   **Altered Mental Status**: The patient may be confused, disoriented, or unresponsive due to decreased oxygen delivery to the brain.\n    \n*   **Chest Pain:** The patient may experience chest pain or discomfort due to decreased oxygen delivery to the heart muscle.\n    \n*   **Nausea and Vomiting**: Pulseless electrical activity can cause nausea and vomiting, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.\n    \n\n【8】It is important to note that these signs and symptoms can be nonspecific and can also be present in other medical conditions. Therefore, healthcare providers should perform a thorough evaluation and assessment of the patient to determine the underlying cause of pulseless electrical activity.\n\n【9】How Is Pulseless Electrical Activity Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Pulseless electrical activity is diagnosed with the help of an electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows the presence of electrical activity without any detectable pulse. The diagnosis is made from a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and investigations. The following are some diagnostic tests and procedures that can be used to evaluate a patient with pulseless electrical activity:\n\n【11】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: An ECG is used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. In this condition, the ECG may show organized electrical activity in the absence of a pulse.\n    \n*   **Blood Tests:** Blood tests can be performed to evaluate the patient's electrolyte levels, blood glucose, and other metabolic parameters.\n    \n*   **Chest X-Ray:** A chest X-ray can be used to evaluate for signs of cardiopulmonary disease.\n    \n*   **Ultrasound:** An ultrasound can be used to evaluate for cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax.\n    \n*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** A CT scan can be used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, a potential cause of pulseless electrical activity.\n    \n*   **Echocardiography:** Echocardiography is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to produce images of the heart. It can be used to evaluate for structural abnormalities or pericardial effusion.\n    \n\n【12】How Is Pulseless Electrical Activity Treated?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The treatment is focused on identifying and treating the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest while simultaneously providing resuscitative measures to support vital organ function. The following are some of the key treatment options:\n\n【14】1.  **Basic Life Support:** The initial treatment for PEA involves basic life support measures, such as airway management, assisted ventilation, and chest compressions. These measures aim to restore blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs.\n    \n2.  **Advanced Cardiac Life Support**: Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be initiated as soon as possible in patients with pulseless electrical activity. ACLS involves the administration of medications, such as epinephrine and vasopressin, to increase the heart rate and blood pressure. ACLS also involves the use of advanced airway management techniques, such as endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway devices, to improve oxygenation and ventilation.\n    \n3.  **Identification and Treatment of Underlying Causes**: The underlying cause of PEA should be identified and treated promptly. Treatment may involve the administration of fluids, blood products, or medications, depending on the underlying cause.\n    \n4.  **Percutaneous Interventions:** In some cases, percutaneous interventions may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of pulseless electrical activity. For example, a pericardiocentesis may be performed to relieve cardiac tamponade or a pulmonary artery catheter may be inserted to monitor hemodynamics and guide management.\n    \n5.  **Extracorporeal Life Support:** In some cases, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) may be necessary to support the patient's vital organs. ECLS involves the use of a mechanical circulatory support system to temporarily replace the function of the heart and lungs.\n    \n\n【15】**Conclusion**\n\n【16】Pulseless electrical activity is a medical emergency that requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Early intervention and prompt resuscitative measures can improve patient outcomes and increase the chances of survival.\n\n【17】Article Resources\n\n【18】*   Pulseless Electrical Activity  \n    https://www.newhealthadvisor.org/Pulseless-Electrical-Activity.html\n*   Pulseless Electrical Activity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513349/\n*   Pulseless electrical activity in in-hospital cardiac arrest  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35490937/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8c4d7b79-19bd-4fad-b5a6-61e9b10b95a4", "title": "Keratectasia - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Keratectasia - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Keratectasia is an eye disorder that can lead to vision impairment. The condition is characterized by progressive thinning of the cornea. The cornea controls the light entry and focuses that light into the retina. This helps in watching things. The condition can occur due to eye surgery complications such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Other factors that can lead to conditions such as genetic factors, corneal disease, and trauma to the eye. Keratectasia is also known as corneal ectasia. The conditions affect millions of people worldwide. Keratectasia begins in early adulthood. Daily check-ups can help the patient in relieving visual issues. The article discusses keratectasia, its types, causes, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Keratectasia?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Several types of keratectasia are as follows:\n\n【4】*   **Keratoconus:** The commonest form of keratectasia. The cornea gets thinner and bulges out into a cone-like shape. The condition starts in the early childhood stage and progresses slowly with time.\n    \n*   **Post-LASIK Ectasia**: It is a rare complication of LASIK surgery. The cornea bulges out and weakens, leading to distorted or blurred vision.\n    \n*   **Pellucid Marginal Degeneration:** The rare condition in which the cornea is in the band-shaped pattern leading to bulging of the cornea a the edge of the eye.\n    \n*   **Terrien Marginal Degeneration:** The condition in which progressive cornea is thinning at the edge of the eye, leading to distorted or blurred vision.\n    \n*   **Keratoglobus**: The entire eye bulges and thins out, causing a spherical or globular shape. This can lead to vision problems which require a corneal transplant.\n    \n*   **Iatrogenic Keratectasia**: This condition occurs due to certain eye surgeries such as LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    I have blurred vision. Is it due to glaucoma?\n    \n    I have blurred vision and dizziness on exertion. Is it due to hypoxia caused by asthma?\n    \n    Is my blurred vision related to the dose of Metoprolol?\n    \n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Keratectasia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【6】The eye surgeries such as LASIK remove too much tissue from the cornea leading to the formation of refractive errors such as astigmatism (curvature of the cornea is irregular). The cornea becomes thin and weak and does not hold normal eye pressure. The cornea bulges out. The most common form is keratoconus, in which the collagen fibers weaken, leading to irregular shape and structure. The inflammatory changes make the eye cone-like shape. It can lead to visual impairment. Contact lenses can lead to keratectasia. If the contact lens is placed incorrectly or if they are too soft or rigid can lead to the development of the condition. It can affect the shape of the eye and further vision problems. Corneal trauma is another possible cause of keratectasia.\n\n【7】What Are the Risk Factors of Keratectasia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Keratectasia threat factors are as under:\n\n【9】*   **Age and Gender:** The condition is more common in middle-aged men.\n    \n*   **Genetics:** The condition can be transferred from the parents to the children.\n    \n*   **Eye Rubbing:** Frequent eye rubbing due to an allergic reaction or dry eye can cause trauma to the eye.\n    \n*   **Corneal Surgery:** Certain types of eye surgery, such as LASIK, can weaken the cornea and increase the risk of the condition.\n    \n*   **Connective Tissue Disorder:** The disorders such as Marfan syndrome (a genetic disorder that affects the joints, skin, and blood vessels) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a genetic disorder) increase the risk of keratectasia.\n    \n*   **Chronic Eye Inflammation:** This is seen in autoimmune disorders that weaken the cornea with time.\n    \n*   **Hormonal Changes:** Changes in hormones during pregnancy, puberty, or menopause may increase the risk of the condition.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Keratectasia?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The symptoms appear in people between the ages of 20 and 30. People with signs and symptoms are as under:\n\n【12】*   Progressive vision loss or blurred vision.\n    \n*   Increased sensitivity to light or glare.\n    \n*   The shape of the cornea gets irregular, leading to distorted or double vision. The condition is known as astigmatism.\n    \n*   Eye pain and discomfort.\n    \n*   Headaches after reading or doing other tasks that need visual aids.\n    \n*   Changes in contact lenses.\n    \n*   Reduced corneal thickness.\n    \n*   Watery eyes.\n    \n\n【13】How Can Keratectasia Be Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】A comprehensive eye examination and diagnostic tests can diagnose keratectasia. The eye doctor may ask for the onset of the symptoms or if a patient has any preexisting eyesight problems.\n\n【15】*   **Comprehensive Eye Examination:** The healthcare provider may measure the eye pressure, check eye vision, and examine the front and back of the eye.\n    \n*   **Corneal Topography:** The test may detect any abnormalities or irregularities. It also measures the shape of the cornea.\n    \n*   **Pachymetry:** The test evaluates corneal thickness and identifies any indications of thinning or bulging of the cornea.\n    \n*   **Refraction Test:** The test measures farsightedness, nearsightedness, and astigmatism.\n    \n*   **Slit-Lamp Examination:** Bright light is used to see the cornea and eye lens.\n    \n\n【16】How Can Keratectasia Be Managed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【17】The treatment of keratectasia depends on the severity of the condition. The possible treatment options are as follows:\n\n【18】*   **Corneal Cross-Linking:** The minimally invasive procedure uses ultraviolet light and vitamin B2 drops to slow down the progression of the condition. It also strengthens the cornea. The surgeon may expose the cornea to ultraviolet light, remove the corneal epithelium, and apply Riboflavin drops. The procedure is effective and improves visual acuity.\n    \n*   **Intacs**: These are small and crescent-shaped plastics that are inserted and implanted into the cornea. It helps in reshaping the cornea and reducing distortion. The procedure helps in reducing astigmatism in patients with the condition.\n    \n*   **Contact Lenses:** Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses are provided to improve visual acuity. The contact lenses help reduce distortion and provide better vision to the patient.\n    \n*   **Corneal Transplantation:** The doctor may provide corneal transplantation in a severe case of keratectasia. The procedure involves the replacement of the diseased cornea with a healthy cornea.\n    \n\n【19】**Conclusion**\n\n【20】Keratectasia is an eye condition with bulging and cornea thinning leading to decreased visual acuity. The disease can be caused due to LASIK surgery, an eye disorder, or any trauma to the eye. The eye doctor may diagnose the condition by comprehensive eye examinations and various diagnostic tests. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent the further progression of the disease and decrease visual acuity. An individual may prevent the condition by wearing protective eyewear to avoid eye injury. Regular eye checks can prevent the progression of the condition. People should consult a family doctor or online doctor for regular eye check-ups.\n\n【21】Article Resources\n\n【22】*   Keratectasia after laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy for myopia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895349/\n*   Treatment of Keratectasia After LASIK With Riboflavin/UV Light Cross–Linking  \n    https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2391180\n*   Keratectasia Induced by Laser in situ Keratomileusis in Keratoconus  \n    https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=160a3ab370b2bcf3808967a2d40185b7ec1d67db", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Neutrophils are white blood cells in the bloodstream synthesis that mature in the bone marrow and fight against inflammation, infection, or neoplasm. Neutrophilia can also be caused due to some underlying disease that eventually increases the count of neutrophils. Increased neutrophils of more than 7700 cells/microliter are known as leukocytosis.\n\n【2】What Are Neutrophils?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Neutrophils are white blood cells (leukocytes), also known as polymorphs, and have tiny granules in the cytoplasm.\n\n【4】*   Neutrophils come under the classification of granulocytes. They can take both acidic and basic stains depending on the staining properties of the granules.\n    \n*   These are colorless, irregular in shape with a nucleus, and have a diameter of 10 to 12 m. The count of neutrophils in an average adult is 4,000 to 11,000/cu mm; in infants, it is about 20,000/cu mm, and in children, it is about 10,000 to 15000/cu mm.\n    \n*   The neutrophils' lifespan is ten days, of which two to three days in the peripheral tissues and fewer than 24 hours in the circulating bloodstream.\n    \n*   The count of neutrophils is slightly more in males than in females.\n    \n*   The cytokines regulate the production, proliferation, differentiation, and circulation of neutrophils in the blood, and the transcription and growth factors control it.\n    \n*   The count of neutrophils is calculated in percentages by deriving the absolute neutrophil count (ANC).\n    \n*   The absolute neutrophil count is calculated by multiplying the total number of white blood cells by the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells and immature neutrophil cells.\n    \n*   Neutrophils are the body's first-line defense system; they accumulate at the site of the infection and fight against the microorganisms.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Acute Acquired Neutrophilia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    My 9 month old son is suffering from low platelet count. Please help.\n    \n    I was diagnosed with IBS many years back. How to get rid of its symptoms?\n    \n\n【5】What Is the Pathophysiology of Neutrophilia?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The increased concentration of neutrophils in the blood is due to inflammatory cytokines released from the area of inflammation within the body. The production of neutrophils is done within the bone marrow, which has a storage pool of mature neutrophils and neutrophil precursors or band cell neutrophils. In addition, blood vessels have free-flowing neutrophils called circulating neutrophils. These neutrophils have cell adhesion molecules that either adhere to the endothelial cells or migrate into the tissues. When the neutrophils adhere to the margins of the endothelial cells, they are called marginal neutrophils.\n\n【7】If there is an inflammation within the tissues and this inflammation is releasing inflammatory cytokines, which indicates the bone marrow releases the storage pool of matured neutrophils. Still, if the inflammation is high, the bone marrow releases neutrophil precursors, band cells, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes. During the inflammation, the marginal neutrophils shift into the circulating pool, and they transit at the site of the inflammation to fight against it; this shift is called the left shift.\n\n【8】In chronic inflammatory reactions and a persistent release of cytokines to the bone marrow for the release of neutrophils, the bone marrow undergoes neutrophilic hyperplasia. These are the mechanisms that induce the increased production of neutrophils.\n\n【9】What Are the Causes of Neutrophilia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【10】Neutrophilia causes can be classified into the followings:\n\n【11】**A. Factitious Neutrophilia:**\n\n【12】1.  Factitious neutrophilia refers to the false elevation of the neutrophil level in the blood. It can happen at the time of sample collection; the anticoagulant in a test tube, either heparin or EDTA, causes clumping of the platelets in the cell counter system.\n    \n2.  There is one more possibility of getting factitious neutrophilia by the precipitation of the cryoglobulin particles in the blood samples causing elevation of the neutrophils in the blood.\n    \n\n【13】**B. Primary Neutrophilia:**\n\n【14】1.  Primary neutrophilia can be genetically transmitted. It can be because of gene mutations resulting in the deficiency of the leukocyte adhesion factor. The deficiency of the leukocyte adhesion factor leads to deformity in the leukocyte's adhesion molecule, causing leukocytosis.\n    \n2.  Chronic idiopathic leukocytosis leads to the elevation of neutrophils, though the individual is asymptomatic and has no underlying disorder. The elevation of neutrophils can also be genetically regulated.\n    \n3.  Myeloproliferative neoplasm is a disorder related to the excessive production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n    \n4.  Chronic myeloid leukemia is a blood disorder associated with the excessive production of white blood cells.\n    \n5.  Essential thrombocythemia elevated neutrophils are seen with the excessive production of red blood cells and platelets.\n    \n6.  Polycythemia vera is a blood disorder with increased production of red blood cells.\n    \n7.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a malignant blood disorder that mainly affects children causing excessive production of white blood cells, and they remain immature.\n    \n8.  Leukemoid reaction is a non-malignant blood disorder that involves the excessive production of neutrophils of more than 50,000 cells/cu mm.\n    \n\n【15】**C. Secondary Neutrophilia:**\n\n【16】1.  Infection and inflammation in the body can cause secondary neutrophilia; in response to the condition, the bone marrow produces more white blood cells.\n    \n2.  Viral Infections can also cause neutrophilia.\n    \n3.  Tumor or malignancies.\n    \n4.  Neutrophilia can be seen in ongoing medication treatments and therapy.\n    \n5.  Medications like Glucocorticoids and Lithium can induce the production of neutrophils.\n    \n6.  Allergic reactions.\n    \n7.  Secondary neutrophilia can also be seen in cigarette smokers, obesity, hyposplenism, generalized bone marrow stimulation, physical and emotional stress, and intense exercise.\n    \n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Neutrophilia?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【18】In the condition of neutrophilia, the following symptoms can be seen:\n\n【19】1.  High-grade fever with high elevation of the neutrophils.\n    \n2.  Fatigue.\n    \n3.  Recurrent infections.\n    \n4.  Pain in joints and bone.\n    \n5.  Dizziness.\n    \n6.  Some other underlying acute inflammation causes are leukemia, pneumonia, bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and many more.\n    \n\n【20】What Are the Investigations for the Diagnosis of Neutrophilia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】For the diagnosis of neutrophilia, some routine blood tests can be advised. A complete blood count (CBC) test can help to calculate absolute neutrophil count (ANC). It may also help diagnose some underlying conditions due to an elevation in the neutrophils.\n\n【22】What Is the Treatment of Neutrophilia?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【23】Neutrophilia is a curable disorder. It will be recovered if some other underlying disease causes it according to the prognosis of the particular illness. Elevation of neutrophils can be related to day-to-day activities like exercise, smoking, or emotional stress.\n\n【24】**Conclusion:**\n\n【25】Neutrophilia can be defined as the increased concentration of white blood cells in the blood with the increased production and storage of neutrophils in the bone marrow. Elevation of the neutrophils can be because of other disorders and can be cured as the condition is treated. This elevation also helps in the diagnosis of the disease. A healthy lifestyle, stress management, and boosting immunity can facilitate the elevation of neutrophils.\n\n【26】Article Resources\n\n【27】*   Neutrophilia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570571/\n*   Neutrophilia  \n    https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Neutrophilia.pdf\n*   Neutrophilia and NETopathy as Key Pathologic Drivers of Progressive Lung Impairment in Patients With COVID-19  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00870/full", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "86b00067-df06-49aa-8c0c-8430ef085f0e", "title": "Fibrolamellar Carcinoma - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Fibrolamellar Carcinoma - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a slow-growing tumor in the liver. The causes of FLC are unclear. It affects young adults between 15 to 40 years of age. This cancer does not cause any symptoms initially, but as the tumor grows in size, it causes symptoms like abdominal pain, weight loss, and general weakness.\n\n【2】What Is Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Fibrolamellar carcinoma gets its name from its appearance on a microscopic level. It appears as a fibrous band of tissues (tissue comprises a bundle of fibers) arranged in fine, alternately arranged layers of different materials called the lamellar pattern. This cancer is rare, and unlike other types of cancers that occur in a liver with an underlying disease like cirrhosis, this FLC appears in a healthy liver.\n\n【4】What Causes Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】The causes of fibrolamellar carcinoma are unclear as to why it happens in a healthy liver.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The fibrolamellar carcinoma shows no symptoms in the initial phase. As the tumor size increases, it pressurizes the organ, and some symptoms occur.\n\n【8】*   Abdominal pain (pain in the stomach region).\n    \n*   Weight loss.\n    \n*   General weakness.\n    \n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Fever due to hepatic abscess (pus-filled sac in the liver).\n    \n*   Obstructive jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes due to narrowing or a block in the bile duct) due to compression of the biliary tree (a vessel system that transports secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder to the duodenum. Duodenum is the first part of the small intestine).\n    \n*   Gynaecomastia (a condition in which a boy or a male’s chest enlarges and appears like breasts).\n    \n\n【9】How Is Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   **Physical Examination:** A physical examination is performed by the doctor to check for enlarged liver and jaundice.\n    \n*   **Liver Function Tests (LFT):** A group of blood tests that involve screening of liver enzymes like alanine aspartate (ASP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alanine transaminase (ALT), and proteins like albumin, globulin, and alpha-fetoprotein in the blood. An increased level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) suggests liver cancer.\n    \n*   **Tumor Marker Tests:** Tumor marker is a type of protein that is present in blood, urine, and body tissues. The increase in the levels of these tumor markers indicates cancer.\n    \n*   **Ultrasound Abdomen:** Ultrasound is an imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to capture images of the internal organs or structures to detect any abnormality.\n    \n*   **CT Scan:** Computerized tomography is an imaging technique that contains cross-sectional X-ray images of the internal organs at different angles with the help of a computer. It gives a detailed view of the targeted structure to view any abnormality.\n    \n*   **MRI Scan:** This imaging technique uses a combination of magnetic field and radio waves from a computer to capture the internal structure and tissues of the body. It gives a very detailed view of the organ or structure.\n    \n*   **PET Scan:** Positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive drug to detect both normal and abnormal metabolic activity. A radioactive substance (a nuclear medicine procedure to treat and find out specific diseases) called radiotracer is injected and shows changes in the metabolism, blood flow, regional chemical components, and absorption. Different markers are used for different imaging purposes.\n    \n*   **Liver Biopsy:** A small portion of the liver tissue is removed and visualized under a microscope to check for pathological changes. This is a confirmatory test, and the results reveal the type of cancer.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Treatment for Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   **Surgery:** Surgical excision of the tumor is the prime treatment.\n    \n*   **Resection:** A thin layer of the liver is removed along with the tumor in surgical resection.\n    \n*   **Chemotherapy:** Chemotherapy involves administering anti-cancer medications that target and kill cancer cells.\n    \n*   **Embolization Therapy:** The blood supply to the tumor is cut off by placing a small gelatin sponge or bead on the vessel that supplies blood to the tumor.\n    \n*   **Liver Transplant:** In some cases, the tumor along with the liver is removed, and a whole, healthy liver or a part of the healthy liver is transplanted. Since the liver has a regenerative property (forming new tissues), the liver grows back. A liver transplant will not be recommended if cancer has spread to other organs.\n    \n\n【13】Is Fibrolamellar Carcinoma a Common Liver Cancer?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Fibrolamellar carcinoma is rare. It makes up about one to five percent of other liver cancers.\n\n【15】Does Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Recur?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Recurrence is common in liver resection surgery cases. A second surgery will be performed if the tumor recurs.\n\n【17】Are Any Other Cancer Types Similar to Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer of the liver cells).\n    \n*   Hepatic hemangiomas (a non-cancerous lesion that consists of blood vessels).\n    \n*   Hepatocellular adenoma (a non-cancerous liver tumor that is common in females who take birth control pills for a long time).\n    \n\n【19】The confirmatory tests like CT scan, MRI, and liver biopsy help confirm cancer.\n\n【20】Are Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Same?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】No. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in patients with an underlying liver disease like cirrhosis (scarring of liver tissues), whereas fibrolamellar carcinoma occurs in young adults with healthy livers without any underlying liver disease.\n\n【22】Can a Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Patient Survive?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】In patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma, if cancer has spread to other organs and resection is not possible, the patient will survive for about 14 months.\n\n【24】What Is the Prognosis of Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The prognosis depends on the location of the tumor if it has spread to other organs and complete or incomplete removal of the tumor during the surgery. However, 44 % to 68 % of patients who undergo surgery survive for five years, and two to seven percent of patients who receive chemotherapy or other treatment methods survive for five years.\n\n【26】Can Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Be Prevented?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【27】Fibrolamellar carcinoma cannot be prevented, but the risk can be reduced by following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining the ideal body weight, and avoiding hepatitis B or C infection.\n\n【28】Is Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Hereditary?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare type of cancer and occurs in a few people. The hereditary (runs in the family) connection with the diseased patient is unclear.\n\n【30】**Conclusion:**\n\n【31】Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare, slow-growing cancer seen in young adults. The cause of this cancer is unknown as it occurs in individuals with a healthy liver. These tumors were initially mistaken for a unique type of hepatocellular carcinoma. But later studies revealed that this is a different type of cancer occurring in healthy young adults without underlying liver disease. The diagnosis of this cancer is usually made at a delayed time, as the symptoms appear late. Many patients visit the doctor when cancer has spread to other parts. This makes the treatment a little complex. Though this is a serious condition, visiting a doctor if any relevant symptom appears and getting appropriate treatment, and following a healthy lifestyle can prolong the lifespan of the patient.\n\n【32】Article Resources\n\n【33】*   Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC/FLHCC)  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-digestive-system-tumors/fibrolamellar-hepatocellular-carcinoma#:~:text=Fibrolamellar%20carcinoma%2C%20or%20FLC%2C%20is,people%20who%20have%20healthy%20livers\n*   Fibrolamellar Carcinoma  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/fibrolamellar-carcinoma/\n*   What is Fibrolamellar Carcinoma?  \n    https://fibrofoundation.org/about-fibro/what-is-fibrolamellar-carcinoma/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The advent of new commercial artificial milk formulas as nutritional substitutes for infants gained momentum during the 20th century. In recent years, breastfed milk is reemerging as the ideal and essential source for infant nutrition, and more women are now choosing to breastfeed their babies. Even, adoptive parents prefer breastfeeding through induced lactation. However, there exists a wide gap between community knowledge of breastfeeding and the actual scientific approach. This article explores various therapies that are in day-to-day clinical use to ensure adequate lactation and improve breastfeeding.\n\n【2】What Are the Benefits of Breastfeeding?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Breastfeeding is beneficial for both the baby and the mother. Breast milk supplies the baby with essential nutrition and greatly helps in the growth and development of the baby. Breastfeeding also protects the baby and the mother from various illnesses and disorders. Some of the benefits of breastfeeding are as follows -\n\n【4】*   Breast milk is considered the best and complete source of nutrition for newborns and infants.\n    \n*   The supply and the composition of the mother’s milk vary to meet the growing needs of the baby as development progresses.\n    \n*   Breastfeeding provides antibodies from the mother which protects the babies from various illnesses during the initial stages since their immune system is immature.\n    \n*   The presence of the mother’s antibodies in the baby also helps in developing a strong immune system in the baby.\n    \n*   Babies who have been breastfed are at a lower risk of developing certain disorders such as asthma, type 1 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and obesity.\n    \n*   The development of ear infections is less likely in breastfed babies and their natural microbial flora of the gut is well established. So, they do not develop gut infections.\n    \n*   Antibodies from the mother are transferred to the baby through breastfeeding.\n    \n*   These shared antibodies help the baby to develop its own immune system and also ensure protection from illnesses till the maturation of the baby’s immune system.\n    \n*   Mothers could immediately breastfeed their babies without any delay. Whereas, feeding formula foods requires time for preparing the bottles.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Breastfeeding Beyond 12 Months - Benefits, Challenges, and Drawbacks\n    \n    Breastfeeding Techniques - Recommendations, Techniques, and Advantages.\n    \n    Impacts on Pregnancy and Lactation After a Bariatric Surgery\n    \n*   Breastfeeding is also a convenient way for feeding babies without disrupting their normal routine during traveling.\n    \n*   Breastfeeding favors the mother’s health by reducing the risk of developing breast or ovarian cancers, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.\n    \n\n【5】What Is Meant by Healthy Lactation?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【6】Lactation refers to the process of making and secreting milk from the mammary glands that are present within the breasts. It usually occurs in all female mammals after giving birth to the young ones. Active lactation is initiated from the first suckling of the baby till the weaning period. Healthy lactation refers to a sufficient supply of milk to meet the growing demands of the baby without affecting maternal well-being. Some of the factors contributing to healthy lactation are as follows -\n\n【7】*   **The Suckling Reflex** \\- Is initiated by the newborn. The lips and cheeks of the baby form a seal with the nipple and surrounding areola of the mother’s underlying breast tissue creating a proper latch-on for suckling. This initiates active production and secretion of milk.\n    \n*   **Lactating Hormones** - Prolactin and oxytocin are the major lactating hormones that regulate the formation and production of mother’s milk.\n    \n*   **Feeding Frequency** - The supply of milk from the mother depends on the baby’s demand and removal of formed milk. Feeding frequently according to the hunger cues of the baby ensures a good supply of milk.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Problems Faced during Breastfeeding?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Insufficient milk production or incomplete removal of formed milk are the reasons frequently associated with starting nutritional supplementation and premature cessation of breastfeeding. Many women eventually express their concern over the inability to produce the required quantity of milk. In reality, this is not true. Lack of scientific knowledge about the mechanics of breastfeeding and poor evaluation of lactating outputs are reasons for unsuccessful breastfeeding. Some of the problems faced during lactation and breastfeeding are -\n\n【10】*   Incorrect breastfeeding techniques where proper seal between baby’s mouth and mother’s nipple is not established.\n    \n*   Early discharge (within 24 hours) of the mother and the newborn before the establishment of proper lactation followed by the hasty follow-up (within two to three days).\n    \n*   Engorgement of the breasts due to blockage in milk ducts.\n    \n*   Sore or cracked nipple due to dryness, mechanical trauma, or infection.\n    \n*   Mastitis is the development of infection in engorged breasts.\n    \n*   Presence of abscess or lesions.\n    \n*   Yeast infections of the breast.\n    \n*   Premature or preterm infants.\n    \n*   Poor suckling of the baby due to the presence of oral abnormality.\n    \n*   Infants having neurological issues.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Therapies Followed to Improve Lactation and Breastfeeding?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Many women express concern about their ability to produce enough milk, and insufficient milk is frequently cited as the reason for supplementation and early termination of breastfeeding. Several therapies are developed to enhance proper lactation and encourage breastfeeding in mothers. Some of the clinically practiced methods are as follows -\n\n【13】**Oral Galactagogues**\n\n【14】These are substances that stimulate the production of milk. They are of two types namely pharmacological and non‐pharmacological (natural) therapeutic agents. Oral galactagogues are effective in induced lactation.\n\n【15】**Pharmacological Therapies**\n\n【16】*   Oral galactagogues are enhancers of milk production and facilitate lactation.\n    \n*   Metoclopramide is a potent stimulator that causes prolactin release and is used in the treatment of lactation insufficiency.\n    \n*   An initial oral dosage of 10 mg three to four times daily increases milk production. Its use is limited to 10 to 14 days followed by gradual tapering to avoid side effects.\n    \n*   Domperidone, sulpiride, and thyrotropin‐releasing hormones are some of the galactagogues used to increase milk volume.\n    \n*   However, the use of these drugs is not approved by the FDA because of their side effects. They are prescribed as off-label drugs.\n    \n\n【17】**Non‐Pharmacological Agents**\n\n【18】*   These include herbal galactagogues that are frequently influenced by familiarities or local cultures and customs.\n    \n*   Fennel seeds, fenugreek, banana flower, ginger, moringa, palm dates, and certain natural mixtures are some of the commonly used herbal galactagogues.\n    \n*   Fenugreek is a herb (used in Indian cooking) and is a well-tolerated galactagogue used by most women. It is taken in the form of herbal tea (two to three cups per day) or as capsules (2 capsules of 500 mg three times daily). Milk production evidently increases within 48 to 72 hours.\n    \n*   Herbal remedies where fennel seeds are brewed as tea are also preferred.\n    \n\n【19】**Physical Therapies in Lactation**\n\n【20】Physical therapies are considered safe and effective to promote lactation, especially in conditions such as breast or nipple pain, blocked or plugged ducts, engorgement, and mastitis. Some of the physical therapies to facilitate breastfeeding are as follows -\n\n【21】*   Kinesiology Taping - is a physical procedure where an elastic cotton strip along with an acrylic adhesive isapplied over the breasts to improve milk outflow.\n    \n*   Assisted lactation through kinesiology taping application is widely used in conditions such as breast engorgement during early postpartum stages. It is found to relieve pain in such conditions.\n    \n*   **Neural Mobilization** \\- Neural mobilization also called neurodynamics is a technique that is based on a movement-based therapeutic intervention that aims at restoring milk homeostasis (regulated milk flow) through nerve stimulation.\n    \n*   **Therapeutic Ultrasound** - It is widely used in blocked ducts where sound waves are used to penetrate deeply into the mammary glands and warm up the blocked milk ducts to ease the milk flow and relieve the discomforts in lactating mothers.\n    \n*   **Standard Care** \\- This includes manual pumping, device-assisted lactation, cold compress, gentle massage of the breasts, ibuprofen for relieving pain, and shoulder girdle and breathing exercises to facilitate breastfeeding.\n    \n\n【22】**Kangaroo Mothering**\n\n【23】*   Kangaroo mother care establishes skin-to-skin contact between mother and child, and it is especially followed in the nursing of preterm or premature newborns.\n    \n*   It is safe and effective for low birth weight babies and favors only exclusive breastfeeding.\n    \n\n【24】**Relaxation Therapies**\n\n【25】*   Proper milk ejection is disrupted in increased psychological distress which commonly occurs during the postpartum phase.\n    \n*   Through relaxation therapies and proper lactation counseling milk ejection is considerably improved during breastfeeding.\n    \n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】Growing awareness about lactation and the importance of breastfeeding is encouraging more and more parents to breastfeed their babies. Newer scientific therapies and techniques are being developed to reduce the problems faced during breastfeeding. Proper consultation with the pediatrician and professional assistance from lactation counselors would enhance the efficacy of lactation and breastfeeding.\n\n【28】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【29】* * *\n\n【30】#### **1.**\n\n【31】#### **What Are the Five Phases of Lactation?**\n\n【32】\\- Lactogenesis 1: The mammary glands prepare to start producing milk during pregnancy. The elevated progesterone and estrogen levels lead to the formation of small sacs called alveoli.  \n\\- Lactogenesis 2: This phase starts before the child's delivery and continues up to some days after the delivery. A decrease in progesterone levels causes the prolactin release. This hormone helps in milk production.  \n\\- Lactogenesis 3: During this phase, the milk is released to the nipple. The child suckle and drink the milk. The hormone oxytocin increases the flow of the milk.  \n\\- Galactopoiesis: The prolactin hormone helps in the maintenance of milk production.   \n\\- Involution: During this phase, when the child stops breastfeeding, the prolactin hormone decreases and reduces milk production.\n\n【33】#### **2.**\n\n【34】#### **What Is the Procedure of Lactation?**\n\n【35】The process of lactation is as under:  \n\\- Mammary gland development.  \n\\- Lactogenesis 1.  \n\\- Lactogenesis 2.  \n\\- Lactogenesis 3.  \n\\- Galactopoiesis.  \n\\- Involution.\n\n【36】#### **3.**\n\n【37】#### **How Long Should Women Have Milk in the Breast?**\n\n【38】The lactation period depends on the child's breastfeeding. According to the world health organization (WHO), the mother should breastfeed the child for up to six months. Some mothers breastfeed their child for a few months of the child's life, and some feed for a longer duration.\n\n【39】#### **4.**\n\n【40】#### **Which Hormone Can Cause Lactation?**\n\n【41】The hormones responsible for lactation are:  \n\\- Prolactin: The hormone helps in increasing milk - production. The elevation of progesterone and estrogen levels during pregnancy helps prepare breast milk. After the delivery of the child, the progesterone drops and delivers prolactin.   \n\\- Oxytocin: The hormone plays a role in the stoppage of milk in the breasts. \n\n【42】#### **5.**\n\n【43】#### **What Foods Help in Increasing Milk in the Breasts?**\n\n【44】The food that increases the milk production in the breasts are:  \n\\- Oats.  \n\\- Fenugreek seeds.  \n\\- Fennel seeds.  \n\\- Salmon.  \n\\- Green leafy vegetables.  \n\\- Legumes.  \n\\- Seeds and nuts.  \n\\- Water.\n\n【45】#### **6.**\n\n【46】#### **When to End Breastfeeding?**\n\n【47】The decision to end breastfeeding depends on the mother's choice and the baby's needs. According to the world health organization (WHO), the child should breastfeed for the first six months. The mother should consider some factors while ending breastfeeding.  \n\\- Baby nutritional needs.  \n\\- Lifestyle factors, such as working mothers try to stop breastfeeding early.  \n\\- If breastfeeding causes physical discomfort or negatively impacts the mother's health, then breastfeeding weaning is the choice.\n\n【48】#### **7.**\n\n【49】#### **Can a Woman Breastfeed Once a Day?**\n\n【50】A woman can feed the baby once a day. It isn't easy during the first six months of the child's life. It is possible only when the baby is more than six years. Suppose the mother or woman wants or tries to stop breastfeeding. It is also possible when the child is above two years old, and the mother wants to reduce breastfeeding time. Some mothers give formula milk to their infants and want to continue breastfeeding. Breastfeeding once a day is possible. \n\n【51】#### **8.**\n\n【52】#### **Will a Woman Lose Weight After the End of Breastfeeding?**\n\n【53】A mother can lose weight after the end of breastfeeding. This is because when the baby is breastfeeding, the mother requires more energy for milk production. After the stoppage of breastfeeding, the mother does not require the same energy, which can lead to weight loss. \n\n【54】#### **9.**\n\n【55】#### **Is Breastfeeding Painful?**\n\n【56】Breastfeeding does not cause any pain. Some females may feel discomfort in the starting stages of breastfeeding. This can be when an infant cannot suck the milk properly. Breast pain occurs when the breast is full of milk. Other causes are infection or trauma to the nipple.\n\n【57】#### **10.**\n\n【58】#### **Why Is Breast Milk Transparent?**\n\n【59】The color of the milk is watery white. The color of breast milk depends on the water level, the diet of the mother, and the lactation phase. The milk is thick and yellow in the starting. It is called colostrum. The milk produced after colostrum is white to blue. \n\n【60】#### **11.**\n\n【61】#### **What Are the Breastfeeding Problems?**\n\n【62】The breastfeeding problems are as follows:  \n\\- Nipple pain.  \n\\- Latching problem.  \n\\- When the breasts are full of milk.  \n\\- Decrease in milk supply.  \n\\- Blocked milk duct.\n\n【63】#### **12.**\n\n【64】#### **Does Breastfeeding at Night Elevate the Milk Supply?**\n\n【65】Breastfeeding at night does not elevate the milk supply. Some babies feed more often at night, producing more milk. The prolactin hormone levels are more elevated at night time, which helps in milk production. If the baby does not breastfeed at night or is missed, milk accumulates in the breasts, supporting the milk supply.\n\n【66】#### **13.**\n\n【67】#### **What Color of Breast Milk Is Unhealthy?**\n\n【68】Breast milk is healthy. The color describing the unhealthy breast are:  \n\\- Greenish color: This can be due to when a mother drinks or eats food containing green or blue pigments.   \n\\- Blood-Tinged Milk: The blood in the milk is due to an infection or damaged nipples.   \n\\- Black Color: This may indicate a disorder where sugar is present in the milk. \n\n【69】#### **14.**\n\n【70】#### **How Can Breast Milk Be Naturally Thickened?**\n\n【71】The breast milk can be naturally thickened by:  \n\\- Pumping the breast milk frequently.  \n\\- Proper baby latch by taking the areola and nipple.  \n\\- Feed the baby through both breasts.\n\n【72】#### **15.**\n\n【73】#### **Why Is Milk in Liquid Form?**\n\n【74】The watery milk is due to the following reasons:-   \n\\- The milk that started to come out at the starting phase is thinner in appearance.  \n\\- The gap between the feeds leads to a watery milk appearance.  \n\\- The milk consistency changes throughout the day. Firstly, in the early stages of childbirth, the milk is in more water form.\n\n【75】Article Resources\n\n【76】*   Oral galactagogues (natural therapies or drugs) for increasing breast milk production in mothers of non?hospitalised term infants  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7388198/\n*   A Review of Herbal and Pharmaceutical Galactagogues for Breast-Feeding  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5158159/\n*   The effectiveness of interventions using relaxation therapy to improve breastfeeding outcomes: A systematic review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29105966/\n*   The Effect of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) on Breast Feeding at the Time of NICU Discharge  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785903/\n*   Physical Therapy Techniques in Lactation  \n    https://lactationmatters.org/2020/11/13/physical-therapy-techniques-in-lactation/\n*   Influence of Kinesiology Taping Application on Severity of Signs and Symptoms in Breast Engorgement.  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03985579\n*   Complementary and alternative methods of increasing breast milk supply for lactating mothers of infants in the NICU  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20630837/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The other illnesses are asthma which is triggered due to heat and humidity, chicken pox, conjunctivitis, flu, food poisoning, measles, and mumps.\n\n【72】#### **2.**\n\n【73】#### **Can One Get Sick in the Summer Season?**\n\n【74】Yes, one can get sick in the summer. While the summer season is often associated with warm weather and outdoor activities, it is also a time when certain illnesses and diseases can be more common. For example, the summer months can increase the incidence of certain types of infections like the common cold. In addition, heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and dehydration are common in summer, particularly during heat waves. Sunburn and skin cancer can occur during summer.\n\n【75】#### **3.**\n\n【76】#### **Is It Normal to Get Sick During the Summer Season?**\n\n【77】It is not necessarily normal to get sick during summer, but certain illnesses and infections may be more common. For example, the risk of certain viral infections, such as the flu, may be lower during the summer months. However, other illnesses, such as food poisoning and heat stroke, are more common during the summer. Therefore, taking precautions, such as practicing good hygiene, staying hydrated, and reducing the risk of becoming ill during the summer, is important.\n\n【78】#### **4.**\n\n【79】#### **What Are the Dangers That Occur in the Summer Season?**\n\n【80】There are many potential dangers during the summer season. Some possible hazards include heat stroke and dehydration from high temperatures, sunburn, skin cancer from prolonged exposure to the sun, and drowning from swimming or boating accidents.\n\n【81】#### **5.**\n\n【82】#### **What Are the Negative Effects That Occur During the Summer Season?**\n\n【83】Some negative effects of the summer season can include heat stroke, dehydration, and sunburn. Increased air pollution and smog can also be a problem during summer. Additionally, summer thunderstorms and hurricanes can cause property damage and disrupt power supplies.\n\n【84】#### **6.**\n\n【85】#### **What Is Summer Flu?**\n\n【86】Summer flu is not a specific medical condition or virus. The term summer flu is often used colloquially to refer to a milder case of influenza that occurs during the summer months. However, this is not a medical term or a scientifically recognized phenomenon. The influenza virus, which causes the flu, can infect people at any time of the year and is most commonly associated with the winter months. However, it is possible to contract the flu in the summer.\n\n【87】#### **7.**\n\n【88】#### **How Long Do the Symptoms of the Common Cold Last?**\n\n【89】The common cold, which can occur at any time of the year, usually lasts about one to two weeks. Symptoms may include a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and a sore throat. Some people may also have a mild fever and a general feeling of malaise. The symptoms of a cold typically peak within a few days and then gradually subside over the following week or two.\n\n【90】#### **8.**\n\n【91】#### **What Are the Causes of the Cold in the Summer Season?**\n\n【92】The common cold is developed by a viral infection, typically from one of the rhinoviruses. These viruses are most active in the fall and spring but can also cause infections in the summer. Cold weather does not cause colds, but being indoors near others during the colder months may increase the chance of catching a cold from someone who is already infected. The mucus membrane of the nose dries out and can develop a cold.\n\n【93】#### **9.**\n\n【94】#### **Why Is It Called a Summer Cold?**\n\n【95】A summer cold is still called a cold; it is not given a different name. The upper respiratory system is affected by the viral infection. Common cold symptoms are a runny nose, congestion, and sore throat. Colds can occur any time of the year, not just during the summer.\n\n【96】#### **10.**\n\n【97】#### **What Should Be Avoided During the Summer Season?**\n\n【98】During the summer, avoiding prolonged exposure to direct sunlight is important, as this can increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer. It is essential to stay hydrated by taking plenty of water and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. In addition, it is crucial to avoid heat stroke, which can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. It is necessary to avoid strenuous physical activity in hot conditions and to wear loose, lightweight clothing to stay cool.\n\n【99】#### **11.**\n\n【100】#### **What Is the Treatment for Summer Sickness?**\n\n【101】Summer sickness, also known as heat exhaustion, is treated by cooling the body and replenishing fluids. This can be done by moving to a cooler location, drinking water or sports drinks, and taking a cool shower or bath. In severe cases, medical attention may be necessary to treat dehydration or other complications. Therefore, staying hydrated and taking frequent breaks when working is important to prevent heat exhaustion.\n\n【102】#### **12.**\n\n【103】#### **Will Hot Weather Cause a Sore Throat?**\n\n【104】   \nHot weather alone typically does not cause a sore throat. However, exposure to dry or hot air can lead to dehydration, which can cause dryness and irritation in the throat. Additionally, inhaling air pollution or other irritants that are more common in hot weather, such as dust or smoke, can also cause soreness in the throat.\n\n【105】#### **13.**\n\n【106】#### **Can Bronchitis Occur During the Summer Season?**\n\n【107】Bronchitis can occur during any season, but it is more common during winter when respiratory infections are more prevalent. However, bronchitis can also be caused by other factors, such as exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke or pollution. It's also important to note that there are two types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.\n\n【108】#### **14.**\n\n【109】#### **How to Clean the Body During the Summer Season?**\n\n【110】During the summer, it is necessary to remain hydrated by consuming plenty of water and fluids enriched with electrolytes. Intake of fruits and vegetables high in water content can help keep the body hydrated. Additionally, it is important to shower or bathe regularly to remove sweat and bacteria from the skin and to wear light, breathable clothing to help keep the body cool. Protecting your skin from the sun is also important by applying sunscreen and wearing protective clothing.\n\n【111】Article Resources\n\n【112】*   Tips for a Healthy Summer  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/healthy-summer.htm\n*   Foodborne disease outbreaks  \n    https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/foodborne\\_disease/outbreak\\_guidelines.pdf", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "389f34f5-3405-4536-9889-d814cb7356b4", "title": "Marasmus - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Marasmus - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Marasmus is a type of malnutrition that occurs when the intake of nutrients is lower than what the body requires. This leads to muscle wasting. Malnutrition occurs when the diet does not contain the vitamins and nutrients the body needs. To maintain the typical physiological body requirements, it is imperative that the body receives adequate amounts of macro and micronutrients. Insufficient intake is called undernutrition, and excessive intake is called overnutrition.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Marasmus?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Marasmus is due to nutrient deficiency due to incomplete nourishment. The factors that can lead to it are:\n\n【4】*   Poverty and scarcity of food. Marasmus is more frequently found in developing countries that have high poverty and, thereby, lack food. These areas may be subjected to famine and natural disasters leading to a decreased food supply. The children in these areas are more prone to developing marasmus.\n    \n*   Infections lead to diarrhea, which prevents food from being properly absorbed by the body.\n    \n*   Wasting disorders such as AIDS.\n    \n*   Eating disorders such as anorexia.\n    \n*   Poor diet: If the diet lacks essential nutrients that are necessary for the growth of a child, they may develop marasmus.\n    \n\n【5】In children, it may be due to the following:\n\n【6】1.  Inadequate breastfeeding or early weaning. Mother’s milk is rich in nutrients that the growing infant needs. If the mother is malnourished or the infants do not receive enough milk, it can result in marasmus.\n    \n2.  Child neglect in underdeveloped countries, if there is not enough gap between children, the mother might not be able to tend to her older children properly; this results in insufficient feeding and incomplete nutrition of the children.\n    \n\n【7】In adults, it may be due to the following:\n\n【8】1.  Neglect of elderly patients.\n    \n2.  Dementia.\n    \n\n【9】How Does it Occur?\n------------------\n\n【10】**In Children**:\n\n【11】*   There may be multiple underlying socio-cultural causes that can lead to marasmus. In underdeveloped countries, civil instability, wars, and natural disasters can lead to poverty in low-income households. This directly affects children; Malabsorption may be due to the procurement ability of the family.\n    \n*   The lack of education and decreased childcare may result in incomplete care from mothers, unhygienic surroundings, and higher risks of infections. Infections can lead to diarrhea which results in improper absorption of food. Mothers with a primary level of education have been shown to have lower rates of infant malnutrition.\n    \n*   Children with infections such as HIV/AIDS have poor nutrition intake and uptake. Affected mothers have lesser nutrient reserves than unaffected mothers.\n    \n\n【12】**In Adults:**\n\n【13】*   In some cases, it affects adults. There is a reduced rate of intake of food with age. This is known as anorexia of aging.\n    \n*   It can be due to reduced satisfaction with food that may arise due to depletion in olfactory receptors and taste sensitivity.\n    \n*   Reduced gastric emptying, leading to the sensation of being full.\n    \n*   Marasmus commonly causes pancreatic insufficiency or digestive disorders and may also cause malnutrition.\n    \n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【15】The clinical features depend significantly on the severity and duration of a calorie deficiency, the age of the patient, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies- they contribute to different presentations.\n\n【16】Symptoms include:\n\n【17】*   Marasmus patients are usually underweight due to excessive weight loss.\n    \n*   Dry skin and eyes.\n    \n*   Stunted growth.\n    \n*   Brittle hair.\n    \n*   Reduced immunity.\n    \n*   Lactose intolerance and stomach infection.\n    \n*   Respiratory infections.\n    \n*   Vitamin D and calcium deficiency lead to rickets.\n    \n*   Iron deficiency causes anemia.\n    \n*   Low blood pressure.\n    \n*   Low body temperature.\n    \n*   Impaired brain function.\n    \n*   Reduced heart rate.\n    \n*   Loss of muscle mass or wasting away.\n    \n*   Electrolyte imbalance.\n    \n*   Children with marasmus have low energy and enthusiasm; they appear to be tired and bored. They may also be irritable, short-tempered, and seem uninterested. This is because improper food can affect not only the body but also the mind.\n    \n\n【18】What Are the Systemic Complications?\n------------------------------------\n\n【19】**Susceptibility to Infection:**\n\n【20】Prolonged periods of calorie deprivation may lead to immunodeficiency, which may lead to infections. Urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections are common. The patients may also show an impaired response to vaccines. Cellular immune deficiency may be due to the wasting of thymus glands, tonsils, and lymph nodes. There is also T Cell and neutrophil dysfunction.\n\n【21】**Total Body Water:**\n\n【22】Body water is increased compared to body weight. It is observed that the more the degree of wasting or weight loss, the more the total body water.\n\n【23】**Oxidative Stress:**\n\n【24】Reduced intake of antioxidants such as vitamin E can cause oxidative stress.\n\n【25】**Electrolyte Changes:**\n\n【26】The potassium levels of the body decrease by 10% to 33%. There is also a reduction in minerals such as sodium, calcium, and phosphorus. Calcium deficiency leads to rickets.\n\n【27】**Gastrointestinal System:**\n\n【28】Wasting away of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to decreased absorption through gastric mucosa, reduced gastric acid secretion, and may lead to bacterial overgrowth.\n\n【29】**Central Nervous System:**\n\n【30】Developmental impairment, altered brain function, and behavioral changes may occur with severe cases of malnutrition.\n\n【31】**Endocrine Function:**\n\n【32】Wasting of the pituitary and adrenal gland can occur. This may lead to a rise in cortisol levels in the blood. Insulin secretion may be impaired, which can return to normal after three to six weeks of treatment.\n\n【33】**Cardiovascular System:**\n\n【34】The contractile ability of cardiac muscles may be affected, leading to arrhythmias reduction in cardiac output.\n\n【35】**Refeeding Syndrome:**\n\n【36】Refeeding syndrome may arise if there is uncoordinated treatment. In children suffering from marasmus, there are a decrease in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon secretion. Phosphate, magnesium, and potassium may shift from cells to extracellular spaces in an attempt to maintain serum levels of electrolytes. As a result, in the initial stages of refeeding, the amount of glucose increases while insulin secretion becomes faulty.\n\n【37】How To Diagnose Marasmus?\n-------------------------\n\n【38】*   Diagnosis is on the basis of a scoring system of body measurements.\n    \n*   Upper arm circumference and height-to-weight ratio help in rating the severity of undernutrition. Height to-age ratio helps define growth delays.\n    \n*   It can also be done using blood tests to identify the secondary implications of marasmus. This includes specific vitamin, mineral, electrolyte, and enzyme deficiencies. This will also help in refeeding. A complete blood count helps to identify the presence of any infections.\n    \n\n【39】How Is It Treated?\n------------------\n\n【40】Marasmus results in death due to infection, electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, and dehydration. There is also the possibility of the onset of refeeding syndrome. Therefore careful steps have to be taken to ensure positive results. The management can be done in three phases:\n\n【41】**Resuscitation and Stabilization:**\n\n【42】*   Infection and dehydration are the main causes of death; the infection should be prevented from progressing into sepsis. This phase lasts for about one week.\n    \n*   Dehydration is treated by the intravenous supply of isotonic solution. The child should be in a warm room as they are susceptible to hypothermia.\n    \n*   If suspected, sepsis should be treated with antibiotics according to the blood culture results.\n    \n*   To prevent complications from refeeding syndrome, the nutrition should be delivered slowly and should be monitored. The caloric intake should be between 60-80% of the calorie requirement for the age. Hypoglycemia may be avoided by continuous nasogastric feeding or small meals at nighttime.\n    \n*   Patients should be monitored to prevent refeeding syndrome as it may lead to arrhythmia, weakness, confusion, or sudden death. Therefore electrolyte abnormalities should be prevented from developing. Thiamine and oral phosphate must be given to prevent a decline in phosphate levels in the blood, which may occur in refeeding.\n    \n*   Fluid overload may cause edema and heart failure.\n    \n\n【43】**Nutritional Rehabilitation:**\n\n【44】Once the emergency phase is overcome, appetite and electrolyte balance will be restored. Nutritional rehabilitation can be started at this point, which includes:\n\n【45】*   Increase in caloric intake: It may be necessary to have a caloric intake of 120 % to 140 % for the growth to be maintained at a similar rate to that of their peers.\n    \n*   Vaccination.\n    \n*   Increased motor activity.\n    \n\n【46】This phase lasts about two to six weeks.\n\n【47】**Follow-up and Prevention of Recurrence:**\n\n【48】Due to the possibility of recurrence, proper follow-up is required. Proper awareness and education are to be provided to mothers and caregivers regarding breastfeeding and supplemental feeding. The supply of food and drinking water may help to reduce the incidence of marasmus.\n\n【49】What Is the Difference Between Kwashiorkor and Marasmus?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】*   Both diseases are severe protein-energy malnutrition.\n    \n*   Marasmus is the deficiency of all macronutrients, while kwashiorkor is the protein deficiency.\n    \n*   Kwashiorkor may arise even if a person has access to carbohydrates but lacks protein in the diet.\n    \n*   Kwashiorkor is known to cause edema, while marasmus has a shriveled appearance.\n    \n*   Marasmus has a better prognosis than kwashiorkor.\n    \n\n【51】**Conclusion**:\n\n【52】In underdeveloped countries, the deprivation of basic amenities and access to provide sufficient dietary nutrients has led to malnutrition disorders such as marasmus. Marasmus may be challenging to diagnose, but once diagnosed can be treated if the proper precautions are taken. Awareness and education are crucial in preventing it from occurring. Adequate food and water supply can also pave the way to eradicating such malnourishment.\n\n【53】Article Resources\n\n【54】*   Kwashiorkor  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kwashiorkor/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b9d25688-6fa2-43f3-b384-ae5b3e83c434", "title": "Pimavanserin- Uses, Warnings, and Pharmacology", "text": "【0】Pimavanserin- Uses, Warnings, and Pharmacology\n**Overview:** Pimavanserin is a typical antipsychotic used for hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) cases. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the drug in 2016. This is the first-ever drug the FDA approved for Parkinson's disease psychosis. Due to the actions of Pimavanserin on serotonin receptors and its inability to affect dopamine, it treats the symptoms of hallucinations and delusions without causing extrapyramidal symptoms. The drug is still under approval for treating dementia-related psychosis.\n\n【1】Uses of Pimavanserin:\n---------------------\n\n【2】The drug is used to treat certain mental and mood disorder symptoms related to Parkinson's disease. It helps to reduce the symptoms like hallucinations where the person sees and hears things that are not even there and delusions which are false beliefs. Although Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic drug, it works differently from other drugs of the same class.\n\n【3】**Precautions for Pimavanserin:**\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】*   The drug should be avoided in cases of allergies as it may contain some ingredients which may lead to allergy.\n    \n*   The drug should be taken wisely in cases of kidney diseases.\n    \n*   The drug Pimavanserin can affect the heart rhythm by affecting the QT prolongation. QT prolongation is rarely fatal and may cause increased or irregular heartbeats. The chances of QT prolongation increase if the patient suffers from certain medical conditions or is under some drug that can lead to QT prolongation.\n    \n*   Old patients are more susceptible to QT prolongation in cases of Pimavanserin administration.\n    \n*   During pregnancy, the drug is recommended only if needed and with proper discussion with the doctor.\n    \n\n【5】What Is Parkinson’s Disease?\n----------------------------\n\n【6】It is a progressive nervous disorder that affects the movements of an individual. The disease symptoms generally start with a barely noticeable tremor in the hands. The tremors get more common and may lead to stiffness or slowing of the body's muscles. In the early days of the disease, the face of the patient may show little or no expression. The arms will not swing when the patient walks, and the speech may become slurred and soft. The causes of Parkinson’s disease include the breaking down of certain nerve cells in the brain. Most symptoms are due to the loss of neurons which produces a chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine. When dopamine increases in the brain, it causes abnormal activity and impaired movements.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include;\n\n【9】*   **Tremor:** The shaking usually starts in the limbs, hands, and fingers. The patient may rub the thumb and forefinger back and forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor.\n    \n*   **Rigid Muscles:** Patients with Parkinson’s disease may have muscle stiffness which can be painful and can limit the range of motion of body parts.\n    \n*   **Bradykinesia (Slowed Movements):** Gradually, with time, the patients with Parkinson’s disease have slow body movements, making it difficult even to perform small activities. The steps might become shorter while walking and even harder to drag feet.\n    \n*   **Impaired Posture and Balance:** The posture might become stooped, and there is a problem balancing the body.\n    \n*   **Speech Changes:** The patient may speak softly, quickly, or hesitate before talking to others.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Is it safe to take Risperidone for hallucination for a long time?\n    \n    What can be the reason for lack of libido after discontinuing Risperdal?\n    \n    Why is there no improvement even after taking psychiatric treatment?\n    \n*   Difficulty in writing and reading.\n    \n\n【10】The treatment of the disease is to control the symptoms with the help of medications. The medications will help to increase the levels of dopamine to help to substitute it. The medications help to manage the walking, movements, and tremor. The speech-language therapist advises the patient on lifestyle changes, including ongoing aerobic exercises, physical therapy, and speech corrections.\n\n【11】For the patients:\n-----------------\n\n【12】Before Taking Pimavanserin:\n---------------------------\n\n【13】Some important points should be considered and brought to the doctor's notice before starting Pimavanserin. Such conditions include;\n\n【14】*   **Allergy:** Any drug allergy or allergy from any other chemicals should be informed to the doctor as the drug may contain some ingredients which may lead to allergy.\n    \n*   **Kidney Diseases:** Drug metabolism and excretion depend on the kidney functioning, and it gets altered if there are any kidney diseases. So it is important to inform the doctor about any kidney issues.\n    \n*   **Heart-Related Conditions:** Pimavanserin is observed to increase the QT prolongation in some patients, which may not be fatal or serious but should always be kept at the doctor's notice. Patients with heart issues should inform the doctor before starting the drug. Even if the patient has a family history of any heart disease, they should be informed by the doctor. Low levels of magnesium and potassium in the body may also increase the chances of QT prolongation, this risk increases when drugs such as diuretics or water pills are taken.\n    \n*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be informed to the patient before starting the drug.\n    \n\n【15】How to Take Pimavanserin?\n-------------------------\n\n【16】The drug should be taken orally with or without the food as instructed by the doctor. If there is a problem swallowing the capsule, it can be opened, and all the content should be mixed in a tablespoon full of yogurt, applesauce, pudding, or a liquid nutritional supplement. The mixture should be consumed immediately without chewing it and not be saved for future use.\n\n【17】The drug should be taken regularly as per the doctor’s advice for most of its benefits and at the same time every day. The dosage of the drug depends on the symptoms and other medications used by the patients.\n\n【18】**Dosage of Pimavanserin:**\n---------------------------\n\n【19】The drug should be taken at a maximum of 34 mg. According to the doctor, it should be administered as two 17 mg orally with or without food.\n\n【20】Side Effects of Pimavanserin:\n-----------------------------\n\n【21】These drugs are always given by the doctor because the doctor knows that the drug's benefits are more than the side effects caused by them. Some side effects caused by Pimavanserin are;\n\n【22】*   **Mild Side Effects:** The normal or mild side effects caused by Pimavanserin include swelling in the ankles, hands, and feet with confusion and nausea. If any of these side effects last longer, they should be informed to the doctor.\n    \n*   Serious Side Effects include fast or irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness, and fainting. The doctor should be informed immediately about any of these symptoms.\n    \n*   Allergic reactions due to Pimavanserin are rare but can lead to symptoms such as swelling of the face, rashes, itching, dizziness, and trouble breathing.\n    \n\n【23】What if a Dose of Pimavanserin Is Missed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【24】If a dose of Pimavanserin is missed and there is still a long time for the next dose (say more than 12 hours), the patient can take the dose, but if the time is almost for the next dose, it is advised to take only the next dose and not two doses at a time.\n\n【25】What if There Is an Overdose of Pimavanserin?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【26】In cases of overdose of the Pimavanserin, the patient may feel exhausted and faint. It is advised to contact the doctor in such cases immediately.\n\n【27】**Storage of Pimavanserin:**\n----------------------------\n\n【28】The drug should be stored at room temperature away from light and moisture. The drug should also be kept away from children and pets. The disposal of expired drugs should be done according to doctor or pharmacists' advice.\n\n【29】For Doctors:\n------------\n\n【30】**Indication:**\n---------------\n\n【31】Pimavanserin is indicated for treating hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that are not actual) and delusions (feeling and seeing imaginary things) related to Parkinson’s associated psychosis.\n\n【32】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n---------------------\n\n【33】The unique action of Pimavanserin on serotonin receptors improves the signs and symptoms of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. Pimavanserin does not worsen the motor functioning of patients with Parkinson’s disease. In clinical studies, it was reported that about 80.5 % of cases treated with Pimavanserin showed improvement in their symptoms.\n\n【34】**Mechanism of Action:**\n------------------------\n\n【35】Parkinson’s disease psychosis is an imbalance of serotonin and dopamine due to disruption in the normal balance of serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors and the neurotransmitters in the brain. The mechanism of Pimavanserin for treating hallucinations and delusions is not completely established. It can be possible that Pimavanserin acts by inverse agonist and antagonist activities at serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) with minimal effects on serotonin 5- HT2C receptors. Pimavanserin is an antagonist and reverses agonist of serotonin 5- HT2A receptors with high binding affinity and low binding affinity towards 5- HT2C receptors. Pimavanserin cannot bind to dopaminergic, muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors, which helps to prevent the undesirable effects due to typical antipsychotics.\n\n【36】**Absorption of Pimavanserin:**\n-------------------------------\n\n【37】In critical studies, the median Tmax for Pimavanserin was six hours, irrespective of the dose. The bioavailability of an oral tablet and the solution of Pimavanserin is almost the same. The major active circulating N- demethylated metabolite, AC-279, is the one that has a median Tmax of six hours.\n\n【38】**The Volume of Distribution:**\n-------------------------------\n\n【39】In clinical studies, after a single dose of 34 mg of Pimavanserin, the apparent volume of distribution was 2173 L.\n\n【40】**Protein Binding Affinity:**\n-----------------------------\n\n【41】Pimavanserin has a very high protein binding affinity to the human body; it binds almost 95 % human plasma protein.\n\n【42】**Metabolism:**\n---------------\n\n【43】The metabolism of Pimavanserin is generally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 hepatic cytochrome enzymes and to some extent by CYP2J2, CYP2D6, and some other cytochromes and flavin-containing monooxygenase enzymes. CYP3A4 is known to metabolize Pimavanserin into its active major metabolite AC- 279.\n\n【44】**Elimination:**\n----------------\n\n【45】The drug Pimavanserin is eliminated both in the urine and the feces. About 0.54 % of the 34 mg of the drug is excreted unchanged from the urine, and the feces eliminates approximately 1.53 % in about ten days. In clinical studies, less than one percent of the dose was eliminated and its metabolites were recovered in the urine.\n\n【46】**Half-Life of Pimavanserin:**\n------------------------------\n\n【47】The average plasma half-life for Pimavanserin is 57 hours, and that of its active metabolite AC- 279 is 200 hours.\n\n【48】**Toxicity:**\n-------------\n\n【49】Pimavanserin is not known to cause serious toxicity in overdose cases. The mild symptoms may include nausea and vomiting. However, cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately after the overdose with continuous ECG monitoring of the patient. There are no antidotes present for the overdose of Pimavanserin. In cases of overdose, the plasma half-life of 57 hours of Pimavanserin should be considered with a possibility of multiple drug involvement.\n\n【50】**Drug Interactions of Pimavanserin:**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【51】Some commonly used drugs that can interact with Pimavanserin are:\n\n【52】*   **Acetaminophen:** The metabolism of Pimavanserin is noticed to increase when it is mixed with Acetaminophen.\n    \n*   **Albendazole:** The metabolism of Pimavanserin decreases when it is mixed with Albendazole.\n    \n*   **Azithromycin:** Pimavanserin's metabolism decreases when combined with Azithromycin.\n    \n*   **Cyclobenzaprine:** The drug is known to increase the neurotoxic activities of Pimavanserin.\n    \n*   **Dronedarone:** The metabolism of Pimavanserin can be increased when mixed with Dronedarone.\n    \n*   **Fluconazole:** The metabolism of Pimavanserin increases in combination with Fluconazole.\n    \n\n【53】**Food Interaction of Dupilumab:**\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】*   **Grapefruit Products:** These act as CYP3A4 inhibitors, and thus, the dose of Pimavanserin has to be adjusted if grapefruit or its products are consumed.\n*   **St. John’s Wort:** It can induce the CYP3A4 metabolism of Pimavanserin, which further reduces the drug's efficacy.\n*   The drug can be consumed with or without food. There is no specific condition for that until instructed by the doctor.\n\n【55】**Clinical Trials of Pimavanserin:**\n------------------------------------\n\n【56】*   Study for approval of Pimavanserin in treatment of hallucination and delusion due to Parkinson’s disease: the study was demonstrated for six weeks, a randomized, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group phase III study done by Cummings et al.\n    \n*   The study randomized 199 patients with an average age of 72 years suffering from Parkinson’s associated psychosis. They received either Pimavanserin 34 mg or a placebo daily. The study's outcome was assessed by a Parkinson’s disease adapted scale to evaluate positive symptoms (SAPS-PD). The group of patients who received Pimavanserin showed significantly improved SAPS-PD score in the sixth week compared to the group which received a placebo.\n    \n\n【57】Relapse prevention study for Pimavanserin in dementia associated psychosis:\n\n【58】*   **Purpose:** The motive behind the surgery is the evaluation of the efficacy of the drug Pimavanserin compared to the placebo for preventing the relapse of the psychotic symptoms in subjects with dementia-related psychosis in cases who responded to 12 weeks of open-label Pimavanserin.\n    \n*   **Number of Participants:** 392.\n    \n*   **Allocation:** Randomization.\n\n【59】**Primary Purpose of the Study:** Treatment of the cases.\n\n【60】A study about the safety and efficacy of Pimavanserin in patients with Alzheimer’s disease psychosis:\n\n【61】**Purpose of Study:** To see the efficacy of Pimavanserin in patients who have psychosis related to Alzheimer’s.\n\n【62】**The Number of Participants:** 181.\n\n【63】**Allocation:** Randomized.\n\n【64】**Results:** There was an improvement in the symptoms of the patients.\n\n【65】**Pimavanserin and Pregnancy:**\n-------------------------------\n\n【66】The drug is generally advised to be avoided in pregnancy until it is imperative to take it. Studies have not proposed any adverse effect on the fetus or mother from the drug Pimavanserin yet.\n\n【67】**Pimavanserin and Breastfeeding:**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【68】There are no established studies about the passing of the drug into breast milk. However, it is recommended to take the drug only on strict advice and instructions from the doctor.\n\n【69】**Pimavanserin in Geriatric Patients:**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【70】Pimavanserin in geriatric patients with Parkinson’s increases hospitalization and mortality risk. Thus the drug should be taken only if it is essential and under proper guidance.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**\n\n【74】#### **What Is the Use of the Drug Pimavanserin?**\n\n【75】Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic drug that is used for treating hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson-associated psychosis.

Skin changes due to drug abuse may be distinctive and easily recognizable. These changes are often drastic and can happen rather quickly. Long-term drug addiction can leave its mark on a drug addict's skin. Abusing drugs over a long period destroys vital nutrients that can cause numerous infections, sores, or inflammation on the skin. Knowledge of the skin manifestations of drug abuse allows for earlier diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】What Can Drug Abuse Do to the Skin?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Many illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, morphine, and Amphetamines, are injected intravenously. The most common sites for injecting these drugs are the antecubital fossae, arms, and neck.\n\n【4】Drugs may have the following effects on the skin if misused for a long time:\n\n【5】**Skin Ulceration**\n\n【6】*   Drug users can develop ulcerations, mainly due to intravenous administration.\n    \n*   The drugs may cause an effect on the skin directly through an irritant or due to repeated trauma or injury and skin edema that may impede wound healing, leading to skin ulcers.\n    \n\n【7】**Pruritus**\n\n【8】*   Pruritus may happen in drug abusers, particularly those with cocaine and methamphetamine use.\n    \n*   People with pruritus may have the sensation of arthropods crawling on the skin, prompting them to scratch their skin repeatedly, leaving nodules on their extremities.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    I have some skin problem on my stomach for past two months. What is it?\n    \n    Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): Causes, Prevention, Symptoms and Treatments\n    \n    Is it safe to use honey on a diabetic foot ulcer?\n    \n*   Pruritus is also mainly seen in opioids. Opioids cause histamine release, inducing pruritus, which starts immediately after opioid use and can last up to 24 hours.\n    \n*   Long-term methamphetamine users may appear much older than their actual age, have poor dental health, and have acne-like blemishes due to skin pricking referred to as \"meth mites.\"\n    \n\n【9】**Skin Infections**\n\n【10】*   Skin infections, such as cellulitis, abscesses, and impetigo, are common among drug abusers.\n    \n*   The cause of skin infections is multifactorial. They can occur due to unsterile injection of drugs, contamination of drugs with pathogenic organisms, and poor hygiene.\n    \n*   The most common organisms causing skin infections are Staphylococcus aureus, including community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, and other streptococci.\n    \n*   Necrotizing fasciitis, a rare infection of the subcutaneous tissues, may also be seen in intravenous drug users. It occurs after a subcutaneous infection, resulting in skin necrosis. It clinically manifests as blisters, fever, fatigue, and pain.\n    \n\n【11】**Hypersensitivity Reactions**\n\n【12】*   Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is also associated with injection with opioids.\n    \n*   Urticaria has also been reported in some drug addicts.\n    \n*   Other rare skin reactions include angioedema, a serum-sickness-like reaction due to amphetamine abuse, and fixed drug eruption with heroin use.\n    \n\n【13】**Other Skin Infections**\n\n【14】*   Skin infections like septic thrombosis, bacteremia, and endocarditis can also occur in drug abusers.\n    \n*   The endocarditis may present with cutaneous lesions, including Janeway lesions (painless, small, hemorrhagic spots on the palms or soles) or Osler nodes (painful, red, raised lesions on hands and feet).\n    \n*   Intravenous drug users are also at particular risk of having hepatitis B, C, D, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2, and other bloodborne pathogens due to sharing needles.\n    \n*   Drug addicts are also at greater risk for sexually transmitted diseases because drug substances alter judgment, leading to high-risk sexual behavior.\n    \n*   Abuse of other drugs, including marijuana, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increases the risk of bloodborne infections because of diminished sexual inhibition and high-risk sexual behavior.\n    \n\n【15】**Rapid Aging**\n\n【16】*   Drugs like methamphetamine can make a drug abuser's face leathery and old.\n    \n*   Long-term use of this drug negatively impacts the body's blood flow and damages blood vessels, preventing the skin from getting proper blood circulation to stay youthful and healthy.\n    \n*   Without proper circulation, the skin begins to break down at a cellular level and can look yellow, gray, brown, or even black, giving the skin a dull, petrified look.\n    \n*   Many people who use methamphetamines for an extended period can look twenty years older than they are. They will have deep wrinkles and lines on their face because the drug does the bodywork over time and breaks down collagen.\n    \n\n【17】**Oral Changes**\n\n【18】*   Drug abuse may also affect oral health. For example, prolonged abuse of methamphetamine causes severe tooth decay, a condition called \"meth mouth.\"\n    \n*   People abusing drugs can also experience xerostomia (dry mouth), bruxism (excessive teeth-grinding), and muscle trismus (reduced opening of the jaws).\n    \n*   Dental caries also develop cocaine and narcotic abusers, but the pattern of caries is different from that of methamphetamine.\n    \n\n【19】How to Avoid Skin Problems With Drugs?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【20】Drug abuse inhibits the ability of drug abusers to make good choices. But, it is possible to make an effort.\n\n【21】Certain useful steps may avoid skin problems with drugs: These include:\n\n【22】*   The first step to reverse or lessen the impact of drugs on the skin is to avoid abusing them.\n    \n*   Cosmetic support may result in minor changes.\n    \n*   Rehabilitation services will help drug abusers quit drugs for good, allowing them to make fundamental changes.\n    \n*   Seeking the advice of a dermatologist is beneficial. The dermatologist may prescribe medications to help with rehabilitation.\n    \n*   Drugs have various effects on drug abusers' skin, but some of these effects can naturally fade once they become sober.\n    \n*   A consistent skincare routine is required to see results but may not reverse the effects in some situations.\n    \n*   To help relieve \"meth mouth,\" drinking plenty of water and avoiding caffeine, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages can help as water flushes toxins from the body and reduces the chances of bacterial infections.\n    \n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】Drug abuse is associated with many skin manifestations, such as skin ulcerations, pruritis, infections, and rapid aging. In addition, long-term drug abuse marks the abuser's skin and affects mental and emotional well-being. Thus, it is essential to be aware of skin problems due to drug abuse for earlier intervention and treatment. While it is nearly impossible to reverse these skin changes, there are a few ways to take care of the skin and prevent further damage. A consistent skin routine can show substantial results over time. But, the best way to prevent drug-related skin problems is not to use drugs.\n\n【25】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】#### **1.**\n\n【28】#### **What Drugs Are Known to Cause Skin Issues?**\n\n【29】Any drug has the potential to cause a rash, but some are known to be more prone to doing so. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti seizure medications, and antibiotics (particularly penicillins and sulfa drugs). An allergic reaction to the drug brings on most drug rashes, but some are not.\n\n【30】#### **2.**\n\n【31】#### **What Are the Effects of Drug Abuse?**\n\n【32】People who struggle with addiction frequently experience one or more coexisting medical conditions, such as lung or heart disease, cancer, stroke, or mental health issues. Blood tests, chest X-rays, and imaging scans can all reveal the detrimental effects of chronic drug use throughout the body. Among the behavioral effects of drugs are paranoia, aggression, hallucinations, addiction, impaired judgment, impulsivity, and loss of self-control.\n\n【33】#### **3.**\n\n【34】#### **What Drugs Cause Pigmentation on the Skin?**\n\n【35】   \nDrug-induced pigmentation is a complex issue for patients who take certain medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Amiodarone, cytotoxic drugs, antimalarials, heavy metals, Tetracyclines, and psychotropic drugs are the main substances linked to the development of skin pigmentation. Once the offending drug has been stopped, the pigmentation usually starts to fade. The pigmentation, however, might persist for a very long time or turn permanent.\n\n【36】#### **4.**\n\n【37】#### **Can Drugs Cause Acne?**\n\n【38】Corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, lithium, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), androgenic steroids, and drugs containing bromides or iodides are some of the medications that can result in true acne or acne-like eruptions. Acne or acneiform eruptions disappear once the offending drug is discontinued.\n\n【39】#### **5.**\n\n【40】#### **How Does a Drug Rash Appear?**\n\n【41】The severity of drug rashes ranges from mild redness with small bumps over a small area to complete skin peeling. A drug rash can appear immediately after a new medication or may take hours, days, or even weeks to develop. Discoloration brought on by rashes may be red, purple, blue, or gray.\n\n【42】#### **6.**\n\n【43】#### **Can Drugs Cause Ulceration of the Skin?**\n\n【44】Abusing a wide variety of drugs over time can result in several infections, inflammation, sores, or even skin rot. Drug users may experience ulcerations, mostly as a result of intravenous administration. In addition, the drugs may directly affect the skin by acting as an irritant or indirectly through repeated trauma or injury, resulting in skin edema, which can impede wound healing and result in skin ulcers.\n\n【45】#### **7.**\n\n【46】#### **What Is the Other Name For Skin Ulcers?**\n\n【47】Skin ulcers are mainly formed due to stress in the blood circulation and are often known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores. These skin ulcers are usually pus filled due to infection, as they are open sores. Therefore, they require a good flow of blood in the area for proper wound healing.\n\n【48】#### **8.**\n\n【49】#### **What Is the Treatment For Ulcerated Skin?**\n\n【50】Ulcerated skin can be treated and protected with dressing to keep the wound clean, prevent infection, and promote skin healing at the site. In addition, antibiotics (ointments or oral medicines) can be given to a person with infected ulcers. Also, if the sore develops a larger size, a skin graft is advised by the doctor only in cases of infected ulcers.\n\n【51】#### **9.**\n\n【52】#### **What Are the Various Types of Ulcers?**\n\n【53】 - Venous Ulcers - They develop due to poor blood flow in the lower limbs and are also called leg ulcers.  \n - Arterial Ulcers - These ulcers develop in the affected area where the blood supply is inadequate, and can be acute, chronic, or recurrent.  \n - Genital Ulcers - These ulcers usually develop in genital areas or anal regions, and can be painless or painful.  \n - Mouth Ulcers - These ulcers develop in the lining of the soft tissues of the mouth, such as the inner cheek, gums, palate, tongue, and lips.\n\n【54】Article Resources\n\n【55】*   The effect of alcohol and drug abuse on the skin  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620755/\n*   The effect of drug abuse on your skin and complexion  \n    https://dualdiagnosis.org/drug-addiction/how-drug-abuse-destroys-your-skin-and-complexion/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3641a1b1-462a-4bfa-a218-e3eef464bec4", "title": "Rotavirus Infection - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Rotavirus Infection - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Rotaviruses are among the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in young children worldwide. In 2004, it was estimated that rotavirus infections caused the death of approximately 475,000-580,000 people, primarily in developing countries. Even though viral strains vary greatly, five serotypes are responsible for most human rotavirus diseases. Rotaviruses, primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, affect most children worldwide before the age of three and in most developing countries before the first birthday.\n\n【2】In 2006, two new live, oral, attenuated rotavirus vaccines were approved. Both vaccines demonstrated good safety and efficacy in large clinical trials in Western industrialized countries and Latin America. In addition, careful monitoring has revealed no increased risk of intussusception in the groups vaccinated with either of the vaccines. Therefore the new rotavirus vaccines are routinely used in several developed and developing countries.\n\n【3】What Is Rotavirus?\n------------------\n\n【4】The rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu. The virus infects the intestines and stomach. It causes vomiting and diarrhea in babies and young children in particular. Infections are common in childcare centers during the winter and spring months. Infants need to be immunized against rotavirus. It can aid in the prevention of rotavirus infections.\n\n【5】What Causes Rotavirus Infection?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】Rotavirus germs are found in a person's stool (poop) and can be spread to other surfaces through unwashed hands after using the restroom or changing diapers. Fecal-oral spread occurs when these germs come into contact with someone's mouth.\n\n【7】If the child has rotavirus, it can be found in their poop before symptoms appear and up to 10 days after they have subsided. Rotavirus can spread to the child's hands when they wipe after using the toilet. They risk contaminating anything they touch if they do not wash their hands.\n\n【8】Rotavirus can be transmitted without any symptoms. While the fecal-oral transmission is the most common, rotavirus can also be contracted by contacting the body fluids of someone who has it, such as sneezing on or touching doorknobs or toys touched by a child who has it.\n\n【9】Who Is at Risk of Rotavirus?\n----------------------------\n\n【10】Children in daycare or other programs with many children are typically at greater risk. Children aged three months to three years who are not vaccinated are more likely to contract the most severe disease. In addition, some children can not receive the vaccine due to a history of allergic reactions to the vaccine ingredients or other medical reasons determined by a healthcare provider. Rotavirus can also infect adults. However, they are less prone to illness than young children. Adults who are susceptible to rotavirus include:\n\n【11】*   Older Adults.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Damages to the Pancreas and Biliary Tract Caused by Viruses - Infections, Clinical Findings, and Etiology\n    \n    Bacillus cereus Infection\n    \n    Celiac Disease - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   People who take care of rotavirus-infected children.\n    \n*   With weakened immune systems (such as having HIV\\- human immunodeficiency virus).\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Rotavirus?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】Rotavirus symptoms are most noticeable in children. Symptoms may appear within two days after being exposed to the rotavirus.\n\n【14】**Rotavirus In Children**\n\n【15】Severe diarrhea is the most common rotavirus symptom. Children can also encounter:\n\n【16】*   Vomiting.\n    \n*   Severe fatigue.\n    \n*   High fever.\n    \n*   Irritability.\n    \n*   Dehydration.\n    \n*   Abdominal pain.\n    \n\n【17】In children, dehydration is the most serious concern. As they have lower body weights, this age group is more vulnerable to fluid and electrolyte loss from vomiting and diarrhea. The signs of dehydration include:\n\n【18】*   Dry mouth.\n    \n*   Cool skin.\n    \n*   Lack of tears when crying.\n    \n*   Decreased frequency of urination (or fewer wet diapers in infants).\n    \n*   Sunken eyes.\n    \n\n【19】**Rotavirus In Adults**\n\n【20】Adults may also experience some rotavirus symptoms, such as:\n\n【21】*   Vomiting.\n    \n*   Severe fatigue.\n    \n*   High fever.\n    \n*   Irritability.\n    \n*   Dehydration.\n    \n*   Abdominal pain.\n    \n\n【22】However, many healthy individuals experience symptoms to a lesser extent. In addition, some adults with rotavirus may not show any signs.\n\n【23】How Is Rotavirus Diagnosed?\n---------------------------\n\n【24】Doctors can usually diagnose if someone has stomach flu by their symptoms. Typically, no tests are required. However, if a child is extremely ill or has blood or mucus in their poop, a stool (poop) test may be advised to check for rotavirus and other germs that cause diarrhea. To rule out dehydration, the doctor may also order a urine (pee) test or a blood test.\n\n【25】How Is Rotavirus Treated?\n-------------------------\n\n【26】There is currently no medication or treatment that can cure the rotavirus. The infection can be managed by a healthy diet and being well-hydrated. Drinking plenty of water, and electrolyte-containing fluids and avoiding foods containing high sugars, juices, and oily foods, as they aggravate diarrhea. Homemade electrolyte solutions are not advised since the combination of ingredients may not be appropriate. If possible, maintain a balanced diet to ensure adequate nutrition throughout the illness.\n\n【27】Can Rotavirus Be Prevented?\n---------------------------\n\n【28】Washing hands thoroughly and frequently, especially after using the washroom and before preparing or consuming food, is the most effective way to avoid rotavirus infection. In addition, children who have rotavirus should stay home from childcare until the diarrhea has subsided.\n\n【29】The rotavirus vaccine can aid in the prevention of rotavirus. Approximately 70 percent of vaccinated children do not get infected by rotavirus. Those who are still infected experience much milder symptoms. Around 90 percent of vaccinated children are protected against severe rotavirus. It is a liquid given to babies between 2 and 4 months, then again at six months, depending on the vaccine brand. The Rotavirus vaccine is administered in three doses; at two, four, and six months or two doses at two and four months.\n\n【30】Both vaccines are administered orally, which means they are taken by mouth rather than through an injection. There is no vaccine for older children or adults. This is why doctors recommend getting the rotavirus vaccine for the child as soon as possible.\n\n【31】Babies with severe combined immunodeficiency or intussusception and those already critically ill should not receive the vaccine.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Rotavirus is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestine). It can affect anyone, but it occurs most frequently in children. A health care provider must be contacted if the child has diarrhea and fever, common rotavirus symptoms. The doctor advises drinking plenty of fluids, resting, and fever-reducing medication. If the child is at risk of dehydration, the provider may recommend hospitalization for intravenous fluids. A majority of children recover from rotavirus with no long-term health consequences. Rotavirus vaccines are known to be safe and effective and can protect children and families.\n\n【34】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【35】* * *\n\n【36】#### **1.**\n\n【37】#### **What Is the Duration of Rotavirus Infection?**\n\n【38】The time frame of rotavirus infection is normally between 3 and 8 days. However, the exact amount of time can differ from person to person.\n\n【39】#### **2.**\n\n【40】#### **What Is Rotavirus Treatment?**\n\n【41】Although rotavirus infections cannot be treated with a specific medication, the doctor may suggest one to manage the symptoms. The main objectives of the treatment are to control the symptoms and avoid dehydration. This includes ensuring the patient has access to enough fluids through IV fluids or oral rehydration solutions (ORS). Doctors may occasionally prescribe antiemetic drugs to treat vomiting.\n\n【42】#### **3.**\n\n【43】#### **Is Rotavirus a Dangerous Condition?**\n\n【44】Particularly in newborns and young children, rotavirus can be a serious illness. In newborns and young children, rotavirus frequently causes severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting. Children may experience dehydration, require hospitalization, or possibly pass away. Rotavirus vaccination can safeguard your kid's health. But with the right medical attention, most patients quickly recover from rotavirus infection.\n\n【45】#### **4.**\n\n【46】#### **Is There a Home Remedy for Rotavirus?**\n\n【47】For rotavirus, there is no specific at-home treatment. In severe circumstances, seeking medical assistance and adhering to recommended remedies is crucial. The primary goals of home care are to ensure adequate rest and water.\n\n【48】#### **5.**\n\n【49】#### **What Foods Should Be Consumed if One Has Rotavirus?**\n\n【50】One should consume bland foods free of added sugar, such as whole-grain crackers, lean meat, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, many liquids are necessary, including an oral rehydration solution. Avoid foods that can worsen diarrhea, such as drinks, apple juice, dairy products other than yogurt, and sweet snacks.\n\n【51】#### **6.**\n\n【52】#### **Who Is Most Susceptible to Rotavirus?**\n\n【53】The riskiest age group for rotavirus infection is children. Most severely affected by rotavirus sickness are unvaccinated infants and toddlers between three months and three years old.  \nThe risk of contracting rotavirus is also higher in adults, particularly those who:   \n\\- Are older.  \n\\- Care for kids suffering from rotavirus sickness.  \n\\- Having weakened immune systems. \n\n【54】#### **7.**\n\n【55】#### **Does Quarantine Apply to Rotavirus?**\n\n【56】Most childcare facilities and schools offer instructions on how long to leave the kid at home to stop the rotavirus from spreading to other children. Before returning to school, a kid with rotavirus infection must be symptom-free for at least 24 hours.\n\n【57】#### **8.**\n\n【58】#### **How Is the Rotavirus Found?**\n\n【59】Stool samples are tested in a lab for the presence of rotavirus infection. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test is the most popular method of detection and searches for the existence of rotavirus antigens in the stool.\n\n【60】#### **9.**\n\n【61】#### **What Happens if an Infant Has Rotavirus?**\n\n【62】Young children and infants are more vulnerable to the rotavirus. In addition to vomiting, fever, and severe watery diarrhea, the virus can cause stomach pain. Children who contract the rotavirus illness may become dehydrated and require hospitalization. To guard against rotavirus sickness, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) advises newborns to receive rotavirus vaccination.\n\n【63】#### **10.**\n\n【64】#### **When Does Rotavirus First Appear?**\n\n【65】The virus typically affects kids between the ages of 3 and 35 months. The cooler months of the year, which begin in the fall and last in the spring, are when infections are more prevalent. At this time, children are more at risk. Any youngster exposed to a rotavirus-infected child is in danger.\n\n【66】#### **11.**\n\n【67】#### **Can Rotavirus Be Cured?**\n\n【68】Most rotavirus infections are resolved without the need for special care. When given supportive care, such as rest and hydration, the body's immune system usually successfully fights off the illness. However, medical intervention can be required in extreme circumstances or people with compromised immune systems.\n\n【69】#### **12.**\n\n【70】#### **How Much Time Does the Rotavirus Remain in Stools?**\n\n【71】Large amounts of virus are excreted in the stool of infected people, beginning two days before the onset of diarrhea and continuing for a few days after the symptoms appear. For more than 30 days following infection, rotavirus can still be found in the feces of immunocompromised people.\n\n【72】#### **13.**\n\n【73】#### **Does Milk Help With Rotavirus?**\n\n【74】Milk is typically tolerated well when rotavirus is present. Unless otherwise recommended by a healthcare expert, breastfeeding or formula feeding can continue as usual. Infection from rotavirus is prevented by breast milk. In addition, rotavirus infected breastfed infants exhibit lesser symptoms.\n\n【75】#### **14.**\n\n【76】#### **Is Rotavirus Detectable by Blood Tests?**\n\n【77】Rotavirus detection does not frequently involve blood tests. The primary technique for detecting rotavirus antigens is through stool samples. \n\n【78】#### **15.**\n\n【79】#### **What Distinguishes Rotavirus From Gastrointestinal Illness?**\n\n【80】While rotavirus is a specific virus that can cause gastroenteritis, the term \"gastroenteritis\" refers to inflammation of the stomach and intestines brought on by different diseases. One of the many possible causes of gastroenteritis is the rotavirus, although other viruses, bacteria, and parasites can also result in the illness.\n\n【81】Article Resources\n\n【82】*   Rotavirus  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/rotavirus/index.html\n*   Rotavirus  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/rotavirus.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It generally results from damage to the developing brain before, during, or immediately after birth. In a few cases, the sense of sight, smell, and hearing can also get affected. Cerebral means the brain, and palsy means weakness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is the primary cause of motor disabilities in children, affecting approximately 1.5 to 4 in every 1,000 children worldwide.\n\n【2】The signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy, such as limb and trunk rigidity, abnormal reflexes, improper posture, wobbling gait, and involuntary movements, appear during infancy. In addition, such kids have problems with swallowing, their eyes do not focus on an object, and they have a reduced range of motion in the joints because of muscle stiffness. The degree of symptoms varies, as some can even walk and have almost normal intellectual, while others might need assistance and have intellectual disabilities. Severe cases might result in epilepsy, hearing loss, and blindness.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Cerebral Palsy?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】The types of cerebral palsy include:\n\n【5】**1\\. Spastic Cerebral Palsy** \\- It is the most common type and affects about 80 % of patients with cerebral palsy. Here, the patients have increased muscle tone, making their muscles stiff. Depending on the body parts affected, this type is classified into:\n\n【6】*   **Spastic Diplegia** - In this type, muscle stiffness is mainly seen in the legs, and the arms are less affected or unaffected. Patient with this type has difficulty walking.\n    \n*   **Spastic Hemiplegia** - In this type, only one side of the body is affected. Usually, arms are more affected than legs.\n    \n*   **Spastic Quadriplegia** - It is the most severe form, as it affects the entire body. Patients with this spastic quadriplegia cannot walk and face other developmental conditions like seizures, intellectual disability, and problems with vision, speech, or hearing.\n    \n\n【7】**2\\. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy** - In this condition, patients find it difficult to control the movement of the hands and feet, making it challenging to walk or sit.\n\n【8】**3\\. Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy** - This condition reduces muscle tone, resulting in floppy and overly relaxed muscles.\n\n【9】**4\\. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy** - Patients with this condition have balance and coordination problems.\n\n【10】**5\\. Mixed Cerebral Palsy** \\- These patients have symptoms of more than one type of CP.\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cerebral Palsy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The signs and symptoms can vary. The common movement and coordination problems associated with cerebral palsy are:\n\n【13】*   Rigidity (the muscles are stiff, but the reflexes are normal).\n    \n*   Spasticity (the muscles are stiff with exaggerated or brisk reflexes).\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Can cold and sinus problem aggravate my peptic ulcer symptoms?\n    \n    Is Sildenafil a safe drug and what should the dosage be?\n    \n    My 6 weeks old baby has ankle clonus. Should I take him to a neurologist?\n    \n*   Ataxia (problems with balance and muscle coordination).\n    \n*   Tremors.\n    \n*   Slow and squirming movements.\n    \n*   The child will favor one side of their body. For example, dragging a leg while crawling.\n    \n*   Delayed motor skills development like crawling, rolling over, and pushing up on arms.\n    \n*   The child will have difficulty walking. They might walk tip-toed, have a wobbly gait, a crouched gait, or a scissors-like gait.\n    \n*   Problems in sucking or eating.\n    \n*   The child may drool excessively or have problems swallowing.\n    \n*   Learning disabilities.\n    \n*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Speech development may be delayed, or the child might find it difficult to speak.\n    \n\n【14】This condition can affect the entire body or just one side or limb. The symptoms do not worsen with age as the brain issues that cause CP does not get altered with age. But with age, some symptoms may get less or more noticeable. The following are the brain abnormalities associated with cerebral palsy:\n\n【15】*   Vision problems.\n    \n*   Hearing disabilities.\n    \n*   Intellectual disabilities.\n    \n*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Psychological conditions.\n    \n*   Abnormal perceptions of pain.\n    \n*   Urinary incontinence.\n    \n*   Diseases of the mouth or oral cavity.\n    \n\n【16】What Causes Cerebral Palsy?\n---------------------------\n\n【17】Problems in brain development or brain injury before, during, or immediately after birth are the leading causes of cerebral palsy. The affected body part and symptoms depend on the damaged part of the brain. This damage can also occur during delivery or in the first few years of life. The following are the possible causes of cerebral palsy:\n\n【18】*   Gene mutations.\n    \n*   Lack of oxygen to the brain during birth (asphyxia neonatorum).\n    \n*   Infant jaundice.\n    \n*   If a pregnant woman gets infected with German measles or herpes.\n    \n*   Brain bleed or intracranial hemorrhage.\n    \n*   Road traffic accidents or child abuse that results in head injuries.\n    \n*   Brain infections like meningitis or encephalitis.\n    \n\n【19】What Are the Risk Factors of Cerebral Palsy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The following factors increase the risk of cerebral palsy:\n\n【21】*   Low birth weight.\n    \n*   Premature birth.\n    \n*   Multiple pregnancies.\n    \n*   Breech birth (baby’s buttocks or feet come out first instead of head).\n    \n*   Babies with a low Apgar score (it is used to check the baby’s physical health).\n    \n*   Exposure to toxins such as methylmercury (found in fish skin) during pregnancy.\n    \n*   Rh incompatibility (blood of mother and baby is Rh type incompatible).\n    \n\n【22】How Is Cerebral Palsy Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】The doctor will take a complete medical history, perform a physical examination, conduct a neurological examination, and evaluate the symptoms. If needed, the patient might suggest getting some of the following tests to diagnose CP:\n\n【24】*   **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** - To check the electrical activity of the brain.\n    \n*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scan** - Strong radio waves and magnets are used to produce detailed images of the brain, which are checked for brain injury.\n    \n*   **CT (Computed Tomography) Scan** - Cross-sectional or three-dimensional images of the brain are produced, which can help identify brain damage.\n    \n*   **Cranial Ultrasound** - High-frequency sound waves are used to get brain images.\n    \n*   **Blood Tests** - These are done to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\n    \n\n【25】If a person gets diagnosed with CP, the neurologist will perform other tests to detect vision impairment, deafness, speech problems, intellectual disabilities, and movement disorders.\n\n【26】What Are the Treatment Options for Cerebral Palsy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Children with cerebral palsy need prolonged care and treatment. Parents might need to work with healthcare professionals to help their kids. The treatment options include the following:\n\n【28】**I. Medicines:**\n\n【29】*   **Injections to the Muscle or Nerve** - Botox or other agents are injected into a specific muscle to tighten it. These injections might be needed every three months.\n    \n*   **Muscle Relaxants** - Diazepam, Baclofen, and Dantrolene, are used to relax the muscles. Baclofen is sometimes delivered into the spinal cord.\n    \n\n【30】**II. Therapies:**\n\n【31】*   **Physical Therapy** - Various exercises and muscle training can help with muscle strength, flexibility, and balance. Braces or splints might be needed to improve walking and stretch stiff muscles.\n    \n\n【32】*   **Occupational Therapy** - Occupational therapy will help the child adjust to their disabilities and teach them ways to conduct their day-to-day activities. It includes teaching the child to use walkers, canes, or electric wheelchairs.\n    \n\n【33】**Conclusion:**\n\n【34】Currently, there is no cure for cerebral palsy, but various medicines and therapies can manage the condition effectively. Moreover, the treatment varies from person to person, and some patients might need long-term care for their symptoms.\n\n【35】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【36】* * *\n\n【37】#### **1.**\n\n【38】#### **What Can Be the Cause of Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【39】Cerebral palsy is caused due to abnormal brain development before birth or damage to the brain after birth.\n\n【40】#### **2.**\n\n【41】#### **How Long Can a Person Live With Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【42】There is no study done regarding life expectancy for cerebral palsy; it usually depends on its severity and symptoms. Most children with cerebral palsy can live from 30 to 70 years of age. When the disease's severity increases, the lifespan decreases.\n\n【43】#### **3.**\n\n【44】#### **Does Cerebral Palsy Worsen With Age?**\n\n【45】Cerebral palsy does not become worse with age because it is nonprogressive. But there may be a change in the symptoms with age. The brain damage that occurs in cerebral palsy remains the same throughout their life and does not worsen.\n\n【46】#### **4.**\n\n【47】#### **What Is the Epidemiology of Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【48】Cerebral palsy affects two to six children in every 1000 newborns. They seem to be higher in males than in females.\n\n【49】#### **5.**\n\n【50】#### **Can a Child With Cerebral Palsy Experience Pain?**\n\n【51】A child with mild cerebral palsy can have minimal pain, but the pain could be intolerable in severe form. The pain can occur due to spasticity, musculoskeletal deformities, and sitting for several hours in the same place. When the pain is managed, the child can engage in several activities.\n\n【52】#### **6.**\n\n【53】#### **Can a Cerebral Palsy Patient Walk Properly?**\n\n【54】Patients with cerebral palsy cannot walk due to some issues with muscle control. Mobility is one of the most common problems with cerebral palsy. Either an arm or one side of the body gets affected, and the patient usually has difficulty walking.\n\n【55】#### **7.**\n\n【56】#### **What are the Types of Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【57】There are four types of cerebral palsy:  \n\\- Spastic.  \n\\- Athetoid.  \n\\- Ataxic.  \n\\- Mixed.\n\n【58】#### **8.**\n\n【59】#### **How does Cerebral Palsy Affect Family Members?**\n\n【60】In the family of a child with cerebral palsy, the most affected persons will be the parents. They would have fear for the future of their child. The child with mild symptoms can be independent, but the child with severe symptoms is wholly dependent on someone to care for them. The parents should take care of the child lifelong. Siblings of the affected child could also be affected. These family members may undergo depression, financial problems, and relationship challenges. In these ways, the family members can be affected.\n\n【61】#### **9.**\n\n【62】#### **Can a Baby Be Born With Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【63】Yes, a baby can be born with cerebral palsy. This type of cerebral palsy is called congenital cerebral palsy. Here, the brain grows abnormally, or the damage occurs before birth.\n\n【64】#### **10.**\n\n【65】#### **How to Breastfeed a Baby With Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【66】A baby with cerebral palsy can breastfeed normally. It is essential to give the child head and body support while feeding because such babies have difficulties in swallowing, and they may aspirate the milk into the lungs, which may lead to complications like aspiration pneumonia.\n\n【67】#### **11.**\n\n【68】#### **Why Do Children With Cerebral Palsy Cry a Lot?**\n\n【69】Children who have cerebral palsy often cry grievously without a cause, known as a neurogenic cry. Babies with stiffness issues might also cry out of pain.\n\n【70】#### **12.**\n\n【71】#### **Can a Mild Cerebral Palsy Outgrow in Children?**\n\n【72】Children with mild cerebral palsy cannot outgrow, but the symptoms may change with age.\n\n【73】#### **13.**\n\n【74】#### **Can Speech Be Affected in People With Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【75】Speech problem is more common in people with cerebral palsy in both children and adults. The part of the brain which controls speech can be affected. The children may have difficulty in forming sentences and using correct words to express themselves.\n\n【76】#### **14.**\n\n【77】#### **At What Age do Children usually Get Diagnosed For Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【78】Cerebral palsy can be diagnosed between 18 months to 5 years of age. The delay in a child's development is the first sign of cerebral palsy.\n\n【79】#### **15.**\n\n【80】#### **How To Confirm If Your Child Has Cerebral Palsy?**\n\n【81】The most significant sign to confirm that your child has cerebral palsy is when the baby fails to do what most babies usually do at that age, like milestones.\n\n【82】#### **16.**\n\n【83】#### **Can Cerebral Palsy Decrease the Lifespan of a Person?**\n\n【84】The lifespan of cerebral palsy usually depends on the symptoms and severity of the disease. When the severity of the disease increases, the lifespan decreases.\n\n【85】Article Resources\n\n【86】*   Cerebral Palsy: Hope Through Research  \n    https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Cerebral-Palsy-Hope-Through-Research\n*   Cerebral Palsy (CP)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html\n*   Cerebral palsy  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cerebral-palsy/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "75e3500a-52a8-4e5c-a448-3c8ba2dea198", "title": "Pseudodementia Versus Dementia", "text": "【0】**Introduction**\n\n【1】Dementia is not a disease. Rather it is a condition that affects memory, thinking, and other social abilities that can interfere with day-to-today activities and affect the quality of life. Even though dementia causes memory loss, it is not the only cause. Multiple other reasons can result in memory loss. Dementia can typically occur when there is damage to the connections of the nerve cells to the brain or when there is loss or death of nerve cells. This happens due to head injuries, brain tumors, stroke, and other causes. In 1961, the term pseudodementia (PDEM) was introduced by Kiloh to explain cases that closely imitated the picture of dementia. The term has been used to explain the cognitive profile of various psychiatric conditions, especially depression in old age, which present with cognitive decline in dementia. Clinically, PDEM has become interchangeable with cognitive deficit patients with major depressive illness. As the term suggests, the clinical condition presents with the picture of full-blown dementia but is a different entity.\n\n【2】What Is Dementia?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Dementia is considered a major neurocognitive condition, which means there is decreased mental function due to medical diseases other than psychiatric illness. It is characterized by a decline in multiple cognitive abilities, such as learning, thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making capability, which is acquired rather than developmental. Dementia is most commonly observed in elderly individuals. Therefore, age progression is a risk factor for dementia. In addition, comorbidity can further lead to the condition.\n\n【4】What Is Pseudodementia?\n-----------------------\n\n【5】Pseudodementia is a group of symptoms that mimic those of dementia. However, it typically has other underlying reasons, such as depression. Therefore, the symptoms require a complete evaluation to diagnose and treat them appropriately. Treating any underlying issues leading to pseudodementia may also reduce the symptoms. In addition, long-term treatment and lifestyle modifications may give a person the best results. Pseudodementia is a condition that seems similar to dementia but does not have its origin in neurological degeneration. Some people call the condition depressive pseudodementia, as the symptoms often arise from mood-related illnesses such as depression.\n\n【6】The symptoms of pseudodementia are mentioned below:\n\n【7】*   Low mood and sadness, which is persistent and permeates all other mood states.\n    \n*   Loss of interest in earlier activities of interest.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Dementia and Eye Health - Causes, Diagnosis, and Precautions\n    \n    How to get treatment for my memory and concentration problem?\n    \n    Would taking Risperidone long-term affect memory and concentration?\n    \n*   Easy fatigability, loss of energy, and persistent tiredness.\n    \n*   A decreased attention span, loss of concentration, and inability to focus on daily tasks.\n    \n*   A lowering of confidence and self-esteem.\n    \n*   Having thoughts that the coming future is dark and bleak.\n    \n*   Feeling worthless and loss of all hope.\n    \n*   Having guilt-ridden thoughts.\n    \n*   Having thoughts regarding dying and killing oneself.\n    \n*   Disturbance in the sleep cycle, such as falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or getting up a few hours before the normal waking time.\n    \n*   Loss of emotional reactivity as per social requirements.\n    \n*   Rapid decrease or increase in weight.\n    \n*   Loss of sexual desires.\n    \n*   Worsening of symptoms in the morning.\n    \n*   Decreased activity levels.\n    \n\n【8】Pseudodementia Versus Dementia\n------------------------------\n\n【9】The importance of differentiating primary dementing processes from functional illnesses has been emphasized multiple times since Kiloh coined this term in 1961. In his words, such patients \"may be in danger of therapeutic neglect and perhaps unnecessary neurosurgical examinations.\" However, he also mentioned that this term has no nosological significance and only describes a condition. We know that this situation is far more essential for establishing a diagnosis. The timely diagnosis and treatment of depression in the elderly are thus essential to prevent the patient from the effects of progressing depression. It also prevents them from unnecessary evaluations for dementia. The difficulty in diagnosing PDEM and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) is particularly evident in elderly patients compared to young adults because of the additional mess created by age-related cognitive deficits. No surprise there has been information on high rates of false-positive and false-negative errors in the diagnosis of dementia. This points to the necessity of enhanced clinical diagnostic techniques. Along with this normal age-related cognitive drop, multiple health problems and the everyday use of several different medicines are often the additional factors obfuscating appropriate diagnosis of depression in older people.\n\n【10】Elderly patients are at a greater risk of developing disorders and other medical comorbidities that add to cognitive and mood-related changes. It is challenging to differentiate and diagnose these two disorders. The following are the different ways used to distinguish between the two.\n\n【11】*   Determining a patient's baseline ability to function and perform activities of daily living (ADLs) like bathing, walking, using a chair, dressing up, eating, using a toilet, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) like managing finances, grocery shopping, cooking food, using a telephone. This baseline will help the physician notice any changes and act upon them.\n    \n*   Observing the patient very carefully and enquiring about the patient from his friend, family, or staff from assisted facilities where the patient resides will help in telling us about their cognitive and functional behavior, which might otherwise be missed.\n    \n*   Patients suffering from depression are more likely to bring their problems to their doctor's attention, whereas patients with dementia might be unaware of them. In addition, certain patients should be screened for pseudodementia, where patients suffer cognitive impairment along with depression.\n    \n*   Early stages of dementia can easily be neglected as they correspond to the signs of aging. Still, clinical signs to diagnose dementia a doctor would be missed appointments, inability to follow given instructions, poor hygiene, and grooming.\n    \n*   Depression and pseudodementia can be diagnosed as a more chronic low-mood state with or without cognitive impairment.\n    \n*   The onset duration for depression is weeks to months, whereas, for dementia, it is months to years.\n    \n*   The patient's mood is always low in depression and fluctuates in dementia.\n    \n*   Depression is chronic and responds to treatment, but dementia is chronic and deteriorates over time.\n    \n\n【12】**Conclusion**\n\n【13】Various studies show that depression is more commonly seen in patients with dementia than in those who do not have this condition. Depressive states adversely affect cognitive functions, especially in old-age or geriatric depression. The differentiation between depression and the early stages of dementia seems to be important. Properly designed studies are needed to generalize these conclusions.\n\n【14】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】#### **1.**\n\n【17】#### **What Are the Early Signs of Dementia?**\n\n【18】The early signs of dementia are:  \n - Mood swings.  \n - Difficulty in concentrating.  \n - Confusion about place and time.  \n - Difficulty in carrying out routine daily activities.  \n - Difficulty in following a conversation.\n\n【19】#### **2.**\n\n【20】#### **How Long Can One Live With Dementia?**\n\n【21】The average life expectancy for the common types of dementia is:  \n - Alzheimer's disease- the life expectancy is mostly around eight to ten years, but in some cases may extend to fifteen or even twenty years.  \n - Dementia with Lewy bodies- the life expectancy is mostly around six years.  \n - Frontotemporal dementia- the life expectancy is around six to eight years.  \n - Vascular dementia - the life expectancy is around five years.\n\n【22】#### **3.**\n\n【23】#### **How Many Stages of Dementia Are There?**\n\n【24】There are different types of dementia, but all are progressive, which means the symptoms and the condition worsen with time. This progressing form of dementia is categorized as early, middle, and late. It is also referred to as mild, moderate, and severe, depending on the severity of symptoms.\n\n【25】#### **4.**\n\n【26】#### **What Is Sundowning in Dementia?**\n\n【27】Early evenings and late afternoons are challenging times for those affected with Alzheimer's disease. The patient experiences restlessness, irritability, agitation, or confusion during that time, referred to as sundowning.\n\n【28】#### **5.**\n\n【29】#### **How Long Does the Aggressive Stage of Dementia Last?**\n\n【30】Dementia is a highly unpredictable and progressive condition. An exact standard on the duration of a single episode of aggression cannot be determined. It is a limiting condition; the symptoms and severity vary from person to person, and not all affected may show aggression.\n\n【31】#### **6.**\n\n【32】#### **What Are Some Natural Ways to Prevent Dementia?**\n\n【33】Some natural ways to reduce the risk of dementia are:  \n1\\. A healthy balanced diet that includes:  \n - More fruits and vegetables.  \n - Limited dietary sugar.  \n - Reduced salt content.  \n - Less red meat.  \n - Vegetable and plant oils.  \n   a) Avoid smoking.  \n   b) Avoid alcohol.  \n   c) Remain mentally and socially active.  \n   d) Regular physical activity.\n\n【34】#### **7.**\n\n【35】#### **What Is Frontotemporal Dementia?**\n\n【36】Frontotemporal dementia is a rare type of dementia characterized by behavioral and language problems. The frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are impacted by it. It tends to occur at a younger age, and symptoms include:  \n - Memory problems.  \n - Language issues.  \n - Personality changes.  \n - Easily distracted.\n\n【37】#### **8.**\n\n【38】#### **How Is Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosed?**\n\n【39】Lewy body dementia is the commonest type of dementia. Diagnosis is made based on the following:  \n - Assessment of typical symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia.  \n - Assessment of mental ability.  \n - Tests to rule out other similar conditions.  \n - Brain scans to detect signs of dementia.\n\n【40】#### **9.**\n\n【41】#### **What Is Depression Pseudodementia?**\n\n【42】   \nDepression pseudodementia is a functional psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive impairment in a person with an underlying psychiatric illness. In this condition, at times, the typical depressive symptoms may be absent.\n\n【43】#### **10.**\n\n【44】#### **How Is Pseudodementia Treated?**\n\n【45】Treatment options for pseudodementia overlap with depression treatment options. In most cases, the affected individual's mood lifts after depression is managed. The treatment options include medications like antidepressants and behavioral therapies like cognitive behavioral and interpersonal therapy.\n\n【46】#### **11.**\n\n【47】#### **How Common Is Pseudo Dementia?**\n\n【48】Studies suggest that pseudodementia patients are found consistently in a clinical population. A population-based study on patients in primary care practices suggested that depression pseudodementia is found in 0.6 percent of people above 65.\n\n【49】#### **12.**\n\n【50】#### **Is Pseudo Dementia a Diagnosis?**\n\n【51】   \nPsuedodementia is characterized by an array of symptoms that mimics dementia. It is not an official diagnosis but a term used to describe cognitive impairment that occurs along with an underlying psychiatric condition, primarily depression. It mimics dementia but is linked to an underlying psychiatric illness.\n\n【52】#### **13.**\n\n【53】#### **What Is the Condition Known as Pseudo Dementia?**\n\n【54】Pseudodementia is a type of cognitive impairment that occurs along with some underlying psychiatric conditions, primarily associated with depression. It mimics dementia but can be reversed mainly by treating the underlying psychiatric condition.\n\n【55】#### **14.**\n\n【56】#### **What Are the Risk Factors for Pseudodementia?**\n\n【57】The primary risk factor for pseudodementia is a history of psychiatric illness or depression. Other risk factors are:  \n - Females.  \n - Old aged (above 65 years).  \n - Individuals with substance use disorders. \n\n【58】Article Resources\n\n【59】*   Distinguishing Depressive Pseudodementia from Alzheimer Disease: A Comparative Study of Hippocampal Volumetry and Cognitive Tests  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5566711/\n*   Pseudo-dementia: A neuropsychological review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4090838/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It invariably affects everyone because of the sedentary lifestyle changes people have adopted nowadays. It has turned itself into a public health menace affecting over 650 million adults worldwide. It will still keep on increasing because of the increasing consumption of unhealthy food and sophisticated lifestyle. Less physical activity is also a primary cause since work-from-home culture has gradually increased and has made people lazier.\n\n【2】Only 1 % of the population who are obese were ready to prefer surgical treatment over other weight loss methods due to the risks it poses. Since there are a lot of complications involved in traditional bariatric (treatments related to obesity) surgeries, introducing new surgical techniques which would involve fewer complications would be a boon to obese patients. Endoscopic surgeries contain fewer risks, are more cost-effective and less invasive (use of instrumentation in surgery), and will help many patients reach good results by providing effective weight loss in a short time.\n\n【3】This procedure was first introduced by Abu Dayyeh et al. in 2013. In this procedure, the doctor will insert a full-thickness endoscopic suturing device down the throat and into the stomach.\n\n【4】Permanent sutures are added endoscopically to reduce the size of the stomach. This procedure is done if the individual has tried reducing his/her weight but could not succeed. It applies to an individual who is overweight with a body mass index of 30 or more. Since it is a cosmetic procedure, insurance is not covered by most insurance companies.\n\n【5】Why Is This Procedure Needed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】The procedure is needed because:\n\n【7】*   This procedure helps in reducing a lot of ill effects caused due to being overweight by reducing weight.\n    \n*   Like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n    \n*   This procedure is also very useful for individuals who have tried other weight loss methods like diet, exercise, and medicines.\n    \n*   It works by limiting the amount of food consumed and also delays the process of gastric emptying.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Types of Equipment Needed for This Procedure?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Things needed include:\n\n【10】*   Endoscope.\n    \n*   A flexible tube with a camera attached to it.\n    \n*   Endoscopic suturing device.\n    \n\n【11】How Is This Procedure Performed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Before the start of the procedure, some instructions on eating habits will be given.\n    \n*   The patient will be advised to take lab tests to check the general parameters of blood pressure, blood sugar level, etc.\n    \n*   A screening test will help doctors to see if the procedure is beneficial for the patients.\n    \n*   It is performed in a hospital using general anesthesia.\n    \n*   The patient will be placed in a supine position (lying flat facing upwards).\n    \n*   The doctor uses a tiny camera to visualize the inside of the abdomen without making an incision on the outside.\n    \n*   In a flexible endoscopic suturing system with a needle driver, a suturing anchor is inserted down your throat inside the stomach.\n    \n*   The doctor would place 12 sutures using a full-thickness endoscopic suturing device like overstitch, approximately in the stomach, stitching the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach, making it in the shape of a tube, without making an incision on the stomach.\n    \n*   This will reduce the size of the stomach, and it would automatically have an impact on the amount of food the patient consumes. A Z-shaped suturing pattern is used for suturing.\n    \n*   The procedure would take approximately 90 minutes to complete, and the patients mostly get discharged on the same day.\n    \n*   Some patients might be kept at the hospital for a day or two after the completion of the procedure for observation.\n    \n*   All the patients will be scheduled for follow-ups in one, three, six, and twelve months of follow-up visits.\n    \n*   The main advantage of this procedure is that there will be no scars or incisions since there will be no removal of any part of the stomach.\n    \n*   Following the completion of the procedure, the individual must follow a healthy diet, and regular maintenance of the body must also be followed by regular exercise.\n    \n\n【13】How Will the Recovery Be?\n-------------------------\n\n【14】Since it is minimally invasive, the recovery will be faster compared to normal surgery.\n\n【15】After the completion of the procedure, the healthcare team will shift the patient to a room for recovery from the operation theater to monitor the vital signs. The doctor will not allow the patient to eat or drink anything a few hours after the surgery. Then a normal liquid diet can be followed. This will continue for at least two weeks. Then gradually, the diet plan has a mix of semisolid and liquid food. After a month, the patient will be allowed to consume solid food.\n\n【16】With the help of lifestyle modification changes, this procedure results in about 15 - 20 % weight loss within one to two years.\n\n【17】What Are the Contraindications for This Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   People not ready to make the necessary lifestyle changes are not eligible for this procedure.\n    \n*   People more prone to gastrointestinal bleeding are also not eligible for this procedure.\n    \n*   People who suffer from ulcers or gastritis are also not a good fit for this procedure.\n    \n*   People who have hiatal hernia (it occurs when the upper part of the stomach bulges into the chest cavity through the diaphragm) cannot do this procedure.\n    \n*   Patients suffering from psychiatric disorders and other eating disorders are also contraindicated.\n    \n\n【19】**Conclusion:**\n\n【20】Although traditional methods are available to reduce the size of the stomach, this method uses fewer instruments, is cost-effective, involves less risk, and, at the same time, provides good healing, making it a more patient-friendly procedure. This procedure helps to improve the confidence level of the individual by giving them the results they need, provided they follow a healthy balanced diet and a proper exercise schedule after the surgery. This procedure is a sort-out one since the benefits outweigh the traditional surgery benefits.\n\n【21】Article Resources\n\n【22】*   The Efficacy and Safety of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty as an Alternative to Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7939770/\n*   Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty  \n    https://www.wakemed.org/care-and-services/weight-loss/non-surgical-procedures/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The treatment of androgen or testosterone deficiency syndrome (male hypogonadism) is not easy because of the following reasons:\n\n【2】*   No adequate data or study suggests the time for initiating the treatment in men or the best treatment option available for a particular patient.\n    \n*   Sometimes, the general practitioners may also not be familiar with all the treatment options available.\n    \n*   Presently, the treatment options available in the market are expensive and must be administered in different doses to obtain the desired result.\n    \n\n【3】What Is Testosterone?\n---------------------\n\n【4】Testosterone is a hormone chiefly produced by the testicles in males. The function of this hormone is to maintain the following:\n\n【5】*   Facial and body hair.\n    \n*   Sex drive.\n    \n*   Sperm production.\n    \n*   Bone density.\n    \n*   Red blood cell production.\n    \n*   Fat distribution.\n    \n*   Muscle strength and mass.\n    \n\n【6】What Effect Does Aging Have on Testosterone Levels?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Testosterone levels reach the highest during early adulthood. Testosterone levels decline steadily with age. The rate of decline is around one percent every year after 30 or 40 years. It is essential to diagnose if testosterone levels are low due to normal aging or hypogonadism.\n\n【8】Hypogonadism changes the ability to produce normal amounts of testosterone due to some problem in the testicles or the pituitary gland.\n\n【9】Testosterone replacement therapy helps to improve the symptoms of low testosterone in these men. Testosterone replacement therapy is available in the form of:\n\n【10】*   Injections.\n    \n*   Pellets.\n    \n*   Patches.\n    \n*   Gels.\n    \n\n【11】**Effect of Declining Testosterone Level on Symptoms of Aging:**\n\n【12】Men can have many signs and symptoms as they age. The declining testosterone levels do not usually affect the symptoms of aging in men. However, the following symptoms might occur as a result of lower testosterone levels:\n\n【13】1\\. **Physical Changes:** Certain physical changes have been noticed that including:\n\n【14】*   Increased body fat.\n    \n*   Reduced muscle bulk and strength.\n    \n*   Decreased bone density.\n    \n*   Gynecomastia (swollen or tender breasts).\n    \n*   Body hair loss.\n    \n*   Less energy.\n    \n\n【15】2\\. **Emotional Changes:** Low testosterone levels can lead to:\n\n【16】*   Decrease in motivation and self-confidence.\n    \n*   Sadness or depression.\n    \n*   Reduced concentration.\n    \n*   Forgetfulness.\n    \n\n【17】3\\. **Changes in Sexual Function:** This includes:\n\n【18】*   Reduced sexual desire.\n    \n*   Fewer spontaneous erections (during sleep).\n    \n*   Infertility.\n    \n\n【19】A blood test can be performed to diagnose a low testosterone level. Some of these symptoms might result from other factors like medication side effects, diabetes, thyroid problems, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression. However, sometimes these conditions might lead to low testosterone levels. Hence, treatment can increase testosterone levels.\n\n【20】What Are the Risks Associated With Testosterone Replacement for Normal Aging?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Testosterone replacement therapy includes the following risks:\n\n【22】*   Certain skin reactions or acne formation.\n    \n*   Benign prostatic hyperplasia or noncancerous prostate growth and existing prostate cancer growth.\n    \n*   Reduced sperm production or shrinkage of the testicles.\n    \n*   Worsening sleep apnea.\n    \n*   Enlargement of breasts.\n    \n*   Increased red blood cell production can lead to the formation of a blood clot.\n    \n*   Increased risk of heart disease.\n    \n\n【23】When to Consult the Doctor About Testosterone Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The doctor must be consulted about the risk and benefits of Testosterone therapy. The doctor usually measures the testosterone levels before recommending Testosterone therapy.\n\n【25】Treatment of normal aging with Testosterone therapy is not recommended. Suppose the patient does not have a medical condition that is the reason behind the low testosterone levels. In that case, the doctor may suggest natural ways to boost testosterone, like increasing muscle mass through exercise and losing weight.\n\n【26】Can Testosterone Therapy Help Increase Youth?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Studies have demonstrated that Testosterone therapy can cause a reversal in hypogonadism (a condition where the body produces a decreased amount of the masculine growth and development hormone, testosterone) effects. However, the benefits of this therapy in otherwise healthy men are still unclear.\n\n【28】In some cases, it has been reported that men feel more active and younger after taking Testosterone medications.\n\n【29】The American College of Physicians guidelines reports that Testosterone therapy can increase sexual function in some cases. However, not much evidence proves functions like vitality and energy can be increased.\n\n【30】**Warnings:**\n\n【31】*   Certain precautions must be taken to ensure that others do not come into contact with Testosterone gel applied to the patient. After the Testosterone gel or solution is used, the medication should be allowed to dry for a few minutes. Then clothing must be placed that covers the area so no one can touch the bare skin. After applying the medication, hands must be washed with soap and water to remove the medication and clean the hands properly.\n    \n*   Testosterone topical products can harm individuals who touch the area where the gel or solution is applied. For example, if a pregnant woman, or one who is breastfeeding, touches skin covered with topical Testosterone products, it might harm the child.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Can the use of antibiotics lead to tiredness and exhaustion?\n    \n    Is it true that varicocele correction improves low testosterone?\n    \n    What are the causes for depression, low mood, foggy brain, and lack of ejaculation in males?\n    \n*   The patient must inform others around him to be careful while handling the clothing, bed linens, or other items that may have Testosterone gel or solution.\n    \n*   If women or children touch skin treated with Testosterone gel, they may develop specific symptoms like:\n    \n*   Growth of hair in different body regions.\n    \n*   Acne.\n    \n\n【32】The doctor must be informed immediately about this.\n\n【33】*   If a child comes into contact with Testosterone gel, the following symptoms might develop:\n    \n*   Enlarged genitals.\n    \n*   Growth of pubic hair.\n    \n*   Increased erections.\n    \n*   Increased sexual desire.\n    \n*   Aggressive behavior.\n    \n\n【34】In most cases, these symptoms disappear once exposure to testosterone is stopped. However, sometimes, the genitals remain enlarged.\n\n【35】*   Topical Testosterone can also cause the bones to mature rapidly in children. This might lead to shorter-than-expected adult height as the child stops growing sooner. Even after exposure to Testosterone gel is arrested, the bones of these children remain more mature than expected.\n    \n\n【36】**For Patients:**\n\n【37】**Indications:**\n\n【38】Testosterone is FDA-approved as replacement therapy in the following men:\n\n【39】*   Men with decreased testosterone levels or hypogonadism.\n    \n*   Congenital or acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n    \n*   In case of a pituitary-hypothalamic injury, gonadotropin deficiency, or LHRH deficiency resulting from tumors, radiation, or trauma.\n    \n\n【40】**Rate of Occurrence of Hypogonadism:**\n\n【41】*   **Men in Their Sixties:** 19 %.\n    \n*   **Men in Their Seventies:** 28 %.\n    \n*   **Men in Their Eighties:** 49 %.\n    \n\n【42】How Should This Medicine Be Used?\n---------------------------------\n\n【43】*   Topical Testosterone comes in the form of a gel and solution that has to be applied to the skin.\n    \n*   It is usually applied once daily, and it is recommended to use Testosterone gel or solution in the morning.\n    \n*   Testosterone topical is available in single-use packets or tubes and a multiple-use pump. The pump releases a certain amount of testosterone every time it is pressed. The doctor or pharmacist prescribes the number of times the pump has to be pressed for each dose and the number of doses the pump contains. The pump must be disposed of after the given number of doses, even if it is not entirely consumed.\n    \n*   It should be applied at around the same time daily to avoid missing the dose.\n    \n*   The directions on the prescription label must be followed carefully.\n    \n*   The topical Testosterone must be used exactly as directed by the doctor. It must not be applied more or less and more frequently than prescribed by the doctor.\n    \n*   Various topical Testosterone products are manufactured differently and have to be used differently. Hence, the patient should know the brand and how and where it must be used.\n    \n*   The manufacturer's patient guide with the topical Testosterone product should be read carefully.\n    \n*   The morning bath or shower must be taken before applying topical Testosterone products.\n    \n*   Testosterone topical products should not be applied to the penis, scrotum, or skin with cuts, sores, or irritation.\n    \n*   Testosterone gel and solution are combustible and may catch fire. It should be kept away from open flames. Men must never smoke while applying topical Testosterone until the gel or solution has completely dried.\n    \n*   The doctor can adjust the dose of Testosterone depending on the amount of testosterone present in the blood during treatment.\n    \n\n【44】Testosterone topical is used to control the symptoms, but it does not cure the condition completely. Therefore, topical Testosterone must be continued even after the patient feels well and must not be stopped without the doctor's advice. If topical Testosterone is discontinued abruptly, the symptoms might return.\n\n【45】**What Special Precautions Should Be Followed Before Using Testosterone Gel?**\n\n【46】Before using Testosterone gel,\n\n【47】**Allergies:** The doctor should be informed about a known allergy to Testosterone or other medication. The patient should ask for the list of ingredients in the drug that they might be allergic to.\n\n【48】**Drug History:** The patients must inform the doctor about any prescribed or nonprescribed medications. Further, the doctor should be aware of the patient's vitamins or supplements (nutritional or herbal).\n\n【49】The patients should mention if they are taking the following drugs:\n\n【50】*   Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as Warfarin.\n    \n*   Insulin.\n    \n*   Oral steroids such as Dexamethasone.\n    \n*   Methylprednisolone.\n    \n*   Prednisone.\n    \n\n【51】**Medical History:** The patient should tell the doctor about any other illness in the past, or any comorbidities present like:\n\n【52】*   Sleep apnea (breathing stops during sleep for a short duration).\n    \n*   Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).\n    \n*   An enlarged prostate.\n    \n*   High blood levels of calcium.\n    \n*   Diabetes.\n    \n*   Heart, kidney, liver, or lung disease.\n    \n\n【53】*   The doctor must be informed of any history of breast or prostate cancer. The doctor will not advise the use of topical Testosterone in such cases.\n    \n\n【54】*   Patients 65 years or older must know about the risks and benefits of using topical Testosterone. Older men are usually not advised to use topical Testosterone unless they have hypogonadism.\n    \n\n【55】**What Should Special Dietary Instructions Be Followed?**\n\n【56】A normal diet must be followed unless the doctor recommends changes.\n\n【57】**What Should Be Done in Case of a Missed Dose?**\n\n【58】The missed dose should be applied once the patient remembers about it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, the dose should be skipped, and a regular dosing schedule should be followed. For example, a double dose should not be taken to compensate for a missed one.\n\n【59】**Side Effects:**\n\n【60】Serious side effects have been documented in people who use high doses of Testosterone and other male sex hormone products without the doctor's advice. These side effects include:\n\n【61】*   Heart attack.\n    \n*   Heart failure.\n    \n*   Other heart problems (stroke and mini-stroke).\n    \n*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Mental health changes such as depression, mania (abnormally excited mood), aggressive or unfriendly behavior, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), or delusions (having strange thoughts or beliefs that have no basis in reality).\n    \n*   Liver disease.\n    \n*   Difficulty urinating.\n    \n*   Lower leg pain, swelling, or redness.\n    \n*   Shortness of breath.\n    \n*   Swelling of the hands, ankles, or lower legs.\n    \n*   Nausea or vomiting.\n    \n*   Difficult speech.\n    \n*   Dizziness or faintness.\n    \n*   Weakness or numbness of an arm or leg.\n    \n*   Chest pain.\n    \n*   Yellowing of the skin or eyes.\n    \n\n【62】People with higher doses of Testosterone than recommended by a doctor may lead to the following withdrawal symptoms if the application is suddenly stopped:\n\n【63】*   Depression.\n    \n*   Extreme tiredness.\n    \n*   Restlessness.\n    \n*   Loss of appetite.\n    \n*   Decreased sex drive.\n    \n*   Craving.\n    \n*   Irritability.\n    \n*   Inability to fall asleep or stay asleep.\n    \n\n【64】The common side effects of topical Testosterone include:\n\n【65】*   Decreased sexual desire.\n    \n*   Acne.\n    \n*   Depression.\n    \n*   Dry or itchy skin.\n    \n*   Diarrhea.\n    \n*   Mood changes.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n*   Teary eyes.\n    \n*   Skin redness or irritation.\n    \n\n【66】Testosterone topical may cause a decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced, especially if it is used at high doses.\n\n【67】How to Store and Dispose of This Medicine?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【68】*   The container of Testosterone should be tightly closed and kept out of reach of children.\n    \n*   Testosterone gel should be stored at room temperature and not exposed to excessive moisture and heat.\n    \n*   If Testosterone gel is no longer required, it should be disposed of properly so that pets and children do not consume the medications by mistake.\n    \n\n【69】**Other information:**\n\n【70】*   The patient should not advise others to take this medication without consulting a doctor.\n    \n*   The patient can ask the pharmacist any questions about refilling the prescription.\n    \n*   Maintaining a written list of all the prescribed and non-prescribed (over-the-counter) drugs that are being taken by the patient, including other supplements like vitamins or minerals. The patient should carry this list for every visit to a doctor or a hospital. It is extremely important in case of emergencies.\n    \n*   The gel should not be used by anyone else as Testosterone gel is a controlled substance.\n    \n\n【71】**For Doctors:**\n\n【72】**Indications:**\n\n【73】Testosterone is FDA-approved as replacement therapy in the following men:\n\n【74】*   Men with low testosterone levels and symptoms of hypogonadism.\n    \n*   Congenital or acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n    \n*   In case of a pituitary-hypothalamic injury, gonadotropin deficiency, or LHRH deficiency resulting from tumors, radiation, or trauma.\n    \n\n【75】Establishing the difference between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonadism is important.\n\n【76】Symptoms that highly suggest hypogonadism include:\n\n【77】*   Decreased spontaneous erections.\n    \n*   Decreased libido.\n    \n*   Decreased beard growth.\n    \n*   Decreased nocturnal penile tumescence.\n    \n*   Shrinking testicles.\n    \n\n【78】In males, the normal range for testosterone:\n\n【79】*   300 ng/dL to 1000 ng/dL (early morning).\n    \n\n【80】In hypogonadism, serum testosterone level:\n\n【81】*   Less than 300 ng/dL (early morning).\n    \n\n【82】However, accurate clinical judgment is essential to diagnose hypogonadism in patients with persistent testosterone deficiency symptoms with testosterone levels in the normal range.\n\n【83】Testosterone levels:\n\n【84】*   **Senior Men:** 500 and 800 ng/dL.\n    \n*   **Young Adults:** 600 and 900 ng/dL.\n    \n\n【85】In cases of testosterone levels lower than normal, along with clinical symptoms, further testing is necessary to detect free or bioavailable testosterone. The following tests should be performed to calculate the bioavailable testosterone:\n\n【86】*   Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).\n    \n*   Albumin.\n    \n\n【87】Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin can be affected by the following:\n\n【88】*   Obesity.\n    \n*   Hypothyroidism.\n    \n*   Type 2 diabetes.\n    \n*   Liver disease.\n    \n\n【89】The following tests can be performed to rule out the suspicion of a secondary cause:\n\n【90】*   Semen analysis.\n    \n*   Pituitary MRI.\n    \n*   Testicular ultrasound.\n    \n*   Genetic studies.\n    \n*   Biopsy.\n    \n\n【91】The FDA does not recommend Testosterone therapy to treat women with low libido.\n\n【92】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【93】Testosterone shows various biologic effects because it acts as three hormones:\n\n【94】*   It can act directly on the androgen receptor.\n    \n*   It acts on the tissues by converting to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase.\n    \n*   It acts as an estrogen after conversion to estradiol by aromatase.\n    \n\n【95】The three actions are essential to understand the indications and adverse effects of androgen replacement therapy.\n\n【96】1.  In most tissues, the activity of testosterone depends upon its reduction to DHT.\n    \n2.  DHT then binds to cytosol receptor proteins.\n    \n3.  After being transported to the nucleus, the steroid-receptor complex starts transcription and cellular changes.\n    \n\n【97】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【98】**Half-Life:**\n\n【99】*   Directly proportional to the free testosterone concentration in plasma.\n    \n*   Testosterone Cypionate (IM): Eight days (approximately).\n    \n\n【100】**Excretion:**\n\n【101】*   Around 90 % of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic or sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone.\n    \n*   It is converted into an inactive form by the liver.\n    \n\n【102】**Administration:**\n\n【103】**Monitoring:**\n\n【104】Various laboratory tests must be performed before starting the Testosterone therapy, including:\n\n【105】*   Hemoglobin (Hgb).\n    \n*   Hematocrit (Hct).\n    \n*   Liver Functional Tests (LFTs).\n    \n*   Lipid profile.\n    \n*   Two-morning testosterone levels.\n    \n*   DEXA scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan).\n    \n\n【106】**Monitoring Over a Period of Time:**\n\n【107】One month after treatment:\n\n【108】*   Morning testosterone level.\n    \n\n【109】Three to six months after treatment within one year:\n\n【110】*   Morning testosterone level.\n    \n*   Lipid profile.\n    \n*   Liver function test.\n    \n*   Estradiol.\n    \n*   Blood pressure.\n    \n*   Hematocrit.\n    \n*   Hemoglobin.\n    \n\n【111】Annually after one year:\n\n【112】*   Morning testosterone level.\n    \n*   Liver function tests.\n    \n*   Lipid profile.\n    \n*   Estradiol.\n    \n*   Hematocrit.\n    \n*   Hemoglobin.\n    \n*   Blood pressure.\n    \n\n【113】**Adverse Effects:**\n\n【114】It is essential to monitor different adverse effects at every visit:\n\n【115】*   Patients on Testosterone replacement therapy must be evaluated at an interval of three months for prostate cancer and one year after initiating the treatment.\n    \n*   Patients are advised to put a cloth over the application site and wash their hands or skin before having skin-to-skin contact to avoid transfer to a woman or child who comes in contact with the gel.\n    \n*   Testosterone patches can lead to skin reactions, and injections can cause mood, energy, and libido fluctuations.\n    \n*   Testosterone use can be related to erythrocytosis associated with hematocrit, further developing the risk of venous thromboembolism.\n    \n*   No significant effects of testosterone on lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The doctors or physicians must carefully address Testosterone therapy's risks and benefits before starting the treatment.\n    \n*   In 2015, the FDA (food and drug administration) reported an increased cardiovascular risk associated with Testosterone use.\n    \n\n【116】**Contraindications:**\n\n【117】Testosterone replacement therapy is contraindicated in the following conditions:\n\n【118】*   Uncontrolled heart failure.\n    \n*   Myocardial infarction.\n    \n*   History of breast cancer.\n    \n*   Prostate cancer.\n    \n*   Cerebrovascular accident within the past six months.\n    \n*   A palpable undiagnosed prostate nodule.\n    \n*   Untreated obstructive sleep apnea.\n    \n*   Hematocrit above 48 %.\n    \n*   Men planning fertility.\n    \n*   An elevated PSA (prostate-specific antigen) above 4 ng/ml.\n    \n*   An increased PSA level above three ng/mL in high-risk patients.\n    \n\n【119】**Toxicity:**\n\n【120】No cases of acute overdosage with Testosterone therapy have been reported.\n\n【121】**Improving Healthcare Team Outcomes:**\n\n【122】*   The interprofessional team, including physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, must know the risks, benefits, and contraindications associated with Testosterone replacement therapy.\n    \n*   Clinicians can prescribe androgen replacement therapy by using a risk-benefit assessment of the patient's needs and considering the risk of adverse reactions.\n    \n*   Low testosterone levels are related to an increased risk of coronary artery disease. In 2017, a study documented that Testosterone replacement was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular issues.\n    \n*   The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) issued a guideline that there is no significant evidence that Testosterone therapy increases cardiovascular risk. However, testosterone deficiency is related to sarcopenia, osteopenia, frailty, and osteoporosis.\n    \n*   Pharmacists should provide thorough counseling before administration, depending on the formulation. Nurses can also counsel patients on administration and dosing and assess the effectiveness of the treatment.\n    \n*   Both pharmacists and nurses must inform the doctor about concerns they encounter to establish a proper communication channel between team members. Desired outcomes can be achieved with interprofessional patient monitoring with the least adverse effects.\n    \n\n【123】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【124】* * *\n\n【125】#### **1.**\n\n【126】#### **What Is the Use of Testosterone Gel?**\n\n【127】Males with hypogonadism, or insufficient natural testosterone production in the body, are treated with testosterone topical gel. This medication helps the body regain normal testosterone levels by entering the bloodstream through skin absorption. The male hormone testosterone is responsible for maintaining secondary sex traits and the growth and development of the male sexual organs.\n\n【128】#### **2.**\n\n【129】#### **How Well Do Testosterone Gels Work?**\n\n【130】The effects of testosterone gels on sexual function and mood are just as effective as those of patches and injectable forms. Additionally, the cream provides a slightly better rise in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which improves erectile function and overall sexual health. It makes sense that trans-scrotal cream is superior to intramuscular injections because DHT is essential to a man's libido.\n\n【131】#### **3.**\n\n【132】#### **How Does One Feel After Using Testosterone Gel?**\n\n【133】Men who received testosterone during the testosterone trials reported better sexual function than those who received a placebo. This included increased erectile function, increased sexual activity, and enhanced sexual desire.\n\n【134】#### **4.**\n\n【135】#### **Does Testosterone Gel Help With Size?**\n\n【136】Studies show that treatment for low testosterone men can reduce fat mass and increase muscle size and strength. Topical testosterone led to an average increase in penile length and girth of 52.9 % and 60 %, respectively. Testosterone gel improved mood and sexual function, increased lean mass and muscle strength (especially in the legs), and reduced fat mass in hypogonadal men.\n\n【137】#### **5.**\n\n【138】#### **Is Testosterone Gel a Steroid?**\n\n【139】Testosterone gel is an anabolic steroid. Synthetic (man-made) testosterone sold under the brand names may be used to treat low testosterone levels. It is used primarily in men with hypogonadism and has shown increased erectile function, sexual activity, and enhanced sexual desire.\n\n【140】#### **6.**\n\n【141】#### **Where Should Testosterone Gel Be Applied?**\n\n【142】The gel must be gently applied to clean, dry, healthy, and intact skin as a thin layer on the arms, shoulders, or stomach unless the doctor tells to use it on other body parts. The contents of the sachet should be completely removed after it has been opened, and the skin should be treated immediately. Before dressing, let the gel dry for at least three to five minutes.\n\n【143】#### **7.**\n\n【144】#### **How Long Does It Take for Testosterone Gel to Be Effective?**\n\n【145】Effects on sexual interest show effectiveness after three weeks and plateau at six weeks, with no further increases anticipated. Ejaculatory or erection changes could take up to six months. The effects on life quality show after three to four weeks, but it takes longer to see the full benefits.\n\n【146】#### **8.**\n\n【147】#### **When Should Testosterone Gel Be Applied During the Day?**\n\n【148】Topical testosterone is available as a solution or gel to apply topically. Typically, it is applied once a day. Applying testosterone gel or solution is best done in the morning. Apply the testosterone topical at roughly the same time each day to help one remember to do so.\n\n【149】#### **9.**\n\n【150】#### **Are Testosterone Gel and Injections Equally Effective?**\n\n【151】Under the direction of a physician with a progressive outlook, the results of the creams and injections are very similar, aside from a few key distinctions. With either approach, one will eventually experience the same physiological advantages, such as increased muscle mass, improved cognition, more energy, and endurance. Additionally, the cream provides a marginally better rise in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which improves erectile function and overall sexual health. \n\n【152】#### **10.**\n\n【153】#### **What Happens When You Take Testosterone?**\n\n【154】The body will start to redistribute the weight. The fat in the hips and thighs will gradually lose some volume. The arms and legs will get more defined in their muscles, have more visible veins, and look rougher as the fat layer below the skin gets thinner.\n\n【155】#### **11.**\n\n【156】#### **Does Testosterone Gel Cause Liver Damage?**\n\n【157】The risks of liver damage associated with other forms of testosterone are not present with testosterone gel. Some alterations might include facial hair growth, a deeper voice, or a marked rise in acne. The doctor will determine the risk because it could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n\n【158】#### **12.**\n\n【159】#### **Can Testosterone Gel Cause Blood Clots?**\n\n【160】This medication may lead to issues with blood clotting. Testosterone therapy increases the production of platelets and red blood cells, raising the risk of developing blood clots. An increased red blood cell count causes the blood to become thicker and slows venous return to the legs. When there is an injury, platelets start the clotting process and stop the bleeding.\n\n【161】Article Resources\n\n【162】*   NIH- Transdermal testosterone replacement therapy in men  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891651/\n*   Medline Plus- Testosterone Topical  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605020.html\n*   Accessdata- AndroGel (testosterone) gel label  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2013/021015s036lbl.pdf\n*   NIH - Safety and efficacy of testosterone gel in the treatment of male hypogonadism  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785864/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The blood vessels in the brain relax and contract according to the concentration of carbon dioxide, called cerebral vasomotor tone. Carbon dioxide controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels based on its concentration in the blood. Lower levels of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia) cause contraction of cerebral blood vessels, and higher levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) cause relaxation of blood vessels in the brain. Hyperventilation reduces intracranial pressure and relaxes a tense brain to make it small and soft. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is that hyperventilation causes a drop in levels of carbon dioxide, which causes vasoconstriction, resulting in reduced cerebral blood flow and blood volume. As a result, intracranial pressure is reduced. But prolonged and forced hyperventilation is dangerous. So, treating neurological patients with hyperventilation comes with both advantages and disadvantages.\n\n【2】What Is the Effect of Hyperventilation on the Normal Brain?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The brain is relaxed, and there is a reduction in intracranial pressure when the patient is under hyperventilation. Intracranial pressure is measured within a closed cranium and is exerted by all of the contents inside the skull. Relaxation of the brain is related to the firmness and size of the brain according to the volume of the cranium, which is examined by the surgeon when a craniotomy is performed. Hyperventilation brings about hypocapnia, which produces cerebral vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood volume, decreasing the pressure within the cranium.\n\n【4】What Are Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebral Blood Volume?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Two parameters to know that are used in hyperventilation: Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Cerebral blood volume is the volume of blood in the brain, which is a static concept. But cerebral blood flow is a dynamic concept defined as the blood volume penetrating the brain per unit of time. In healthy people, during hyperventilation, there is approximately a 30 percent decrease in cerebral blood flow and a seven percent decrease in blood volume when carbon dioxide levels are decreased from a normal concentration to a lesser concentration. And in neurological patients like those with traumatic brain injury, there is approximately a 34 percent decrease in cerebral blood flow and a nine percent decrease in cerebral blood volume when the concentration of carbon dioxide is reduced from normal during hyperventilation.\n\n【6】Related Topics\n\n【7】* * *\n\n【8】Epilepsy and Exercise - Relationship, Adverse Effects, and Safety Guidelines\n\n【9】Protriptyline - Uses, Indications, Contraindications, and Adverse Effects\n\n【10】What Causes Vertigo?\n\n【11】What Are the Effects of Hyperventilation on Metabolic Activity in the Brain?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Hyperventilation causes hypocapnia, which in turn increases cerebral metabolic activity. There is an increase in neurons' excitability and seizure activity duration during hypocapnia. This results in an increase in the consumption of oxygen and glucose and an increase in the production of amino acids. Because of all these changes, the metabolism changes to an anaerobic type. Also, there is a shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, resulting in a decreased concentration of oxygen in tissue and a decrease in oxygen due to reduced cerebral blood flow. These changes disrupt the balance between demand and supply, and thus there is increased demand than supply of oxygen. Hyperventilation has different effects on a healthy brain and a brain with an acute injury. Although hyperventilation has the same effects on the normal and injured brains as a reduction in cerebral blood flow, the reduction is stronger in the normal brain. This happens because cerebral blood flow is redistributed from normal to injured brain cells. The fact that an acutely injured brain has increased blood flow supports the above statement. Hyperventilation reduces cerebral blood flow, which leads to decreased oxygen supply to the brain, and reduces cerebral blood volume, which relaxes the brain and decreases intracranial pressure. The effects of hyperventilation on the metabolic activity of the brain need to be studied further.\n\n【13】What Is the Effect of Hyperventilation on Traumatic Brain Injury?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   According to research, prolonged hyperventilation has a negative impact on patients with traumatic brain injury.\n    \n*   It is not recommended to use prophylactic hyperventilation to create a partial pressure of fewer than 25 millimeters of mercury or carbon dioxide during the first 24 hours after the brain injury when there is a very low level of cerebral blood flow.\n    \n*   Thus, hyperventilation is only a temporary remedy for reducing intracranial pressure. When used, there should be continuous monitoring of jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the brain to determine the amount of oxygen saturation and the blood perfusion in brain tissue.\n    \n\n【15】What Is the Effect of Hyperventilation During Intracranial Hemorrhage?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   Patients with intracranial hemorrhage will often result in mortality or permanent disabilities like motor and sensory paralysis.\n    \n*   Hyperventilation is used as a temporary treatment to reduce the raised intracranial pressure and stop further damage to the brain.\n    \n\n【17】But studies show that hyperventilation has both good and bad effects, so it is unclear whether it should be used during an intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【18】What Is the Effect of Hyperventilation During a Craniotomy?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   A craniotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making a hole in the skull to visualize the brain, either for tumor removal or to take a sample of brain tissue for a biopsy.\n    \n*   Hyperventilation is used for a craniotomy to make the brain small and soft. This will make the brain more relaxed and thus improve the surgical condition. But the question is whether normal brain tissue will experience less tissue perfusion simultaneously.\n    \n*   To conclude, a balance between the operating condition and tissue perfusion in the brain should be maintained while hyperventilating.\n    \n*   Hyperventilation is commonly used to relax the brain while performing craniotomies, but supporting evidence on their beneficial effects on the prognosis after craniotomies is still lacking.\n    \n\n【20】**Conclusion:**\n\n【21】Hyperventilation is beneficial to neurological patients in that it helps relax a tense brain and elevated intracranial pressure. But it is crucial to make a precise decision to balance hyperventilation's good and bad outcomes. Hyperventilation, in particular, has been helpful during craniotomies, but its consequences during traumatic brain injury and intracranial bleeding are still unknown. Further research and investigation are needed to make hyperventilation the primary choice of management for all neurological patients, irrespective of how long and at what potency it is used.\n\n【22】Article Resources\n\n【23】*   Hyperventilation in neurological patients: from physiology to outcome evidence  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735527/\n*   Hyperventilation in Adult TBI Patients: How to Approach It?  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.580859/full\n*   Hyperventilation and Cerebral Blood Flow  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.str.3.5.566\n*   Elevated ICP: Hyperventilation  \n    https://www.openanesthesia.org/elevated\\_icp\\_hyperventilation/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "559f7704-aeee-40e9-a68c-bfdaed252dbe", "title": "Understanding the Port-Wine Stain", "text": "【0】Understanding the Port-Wine Stain\nWhat Are Port-Wine Stains?\n--------------------------\n\n【1】Port wine stains are permanent birthmarks. They can be described or appear as the smooth, flat, pink, reddish, or purple mark on the skin of a newborn that can get darker, raised, or bumpy as the child grows. A port wine stain mostly appears on the face but can also affect other body parts.\n\n【2】This condition is named port-wine stains because it appears like someone spilled or splashed dark red wine on the skin. It is also known as nevus flammeus. It is believed that about 3 out of every 1,000 children are born with this port-wine mark.\n\n【3】Generally, port-wine stains are seen on faces. These dark marks are not harmful and usually do not show signs and symptoms of any major health problem. The biggest worry is whether a port-wine birthmark will upset a child or hamper their self-confidence, especially when a child is a teenager. However, port wine stains mostly get darker and thicker over the period. They also may become more flat and smooth.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Port-Wine Stains?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Port-wine stains are mainly caused by an issue in small blood vessels, known as capillaries. Generally, capillaries are small and narrow. But port-wine stains are overly dilated, allowing blood to collect in them. This accumulation of blood gives port wine stains a distinctive color. Port-wine stains may become bigger or change their shape when capillaries become larger or bigger.\n\n【6】Port-wine stains on the scalp, forehead, or around the eyes may be a symptom of Sturge-Weber syndrome. This condition occurs when there are unusual blood vessels in the skin and the brain's surface, affecting blood flow to the brain.\n\n【7】When port-wine stains are present on the arms or legs, they may also be a symptom of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. In this condition, they usually appear on just one limb.\n\n【8】Related Topics\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】Can I cover up my birthmark with a tattoo?\n\n【11】Stork Bite - What You Need to Know in Newborn Babies and Infants!!\n\n【12】My son has growing red birth mark below his nose. Can it be removed by surgery?\n\n【13】Klippel-Trenaunay is a rare genetic condition that causes changes in the blood vessels of the affected leg or arm. These changes can cause the bone or muscle of that limb to grow longer or wider than usual.\n\n【14】What Does a Port-Wine Stain Look Like?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【15】A port wine stain is a red-purplish stain on the skin. It has clear borders around the birthmark.\n\n【16】Port-wine birthmarks can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly on the:\n\n【17】*   Face.\n    \n*   Neck.\n    \n*   Scalp.\n    \n\n【18】In children, port wine stains are smooth. The birthmark grows as a child grows, but it stays in proportion. Port wine stains may get thicker and darker over time and feel like pebbles beneath the skin. They also may look more like a blood clot or a bruise that is formed after an injury, which can be difficult to control.\n\n【19】How to Diagnose Port-Wine Stains?\n---------------------------------\n\n【20】By looking at a child's skin, doctors can sometimes tell if it is a port-wine stain. Port-wine stains are harmless birthmarks and do not cause problems or pain. Rarely does it show any sign of other medical-related problems.\n\n【21】For example, the port-wine stains on or near the eye or forehead will be examined by the doctor. They may be associated with a rare neurological disorder called Sturge-Weber syndrome, leading to problems like delay in development, seizures, and learning disabilities. Stains on the eyelids can also result in glaucoma, which means increased pressure inside the eye that can affect vision and cause blindness.\n\n【22】Doctors may indicate some tests such as eye or imaging tests like an X-ray, computed tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging to rule out another associated problem. For example, if a kid develops a port wine stain anywhere on the body, a specialist must examine it and plan the treatment accordingly.\n\n【23】Is Port-Wine Stain Harmful?\n---------------------------\n\n【24】Port wine stains are harmless and do not lead to any medical problems or pain. Birthmarks can be embarrassing for many children and teenagers, especially when they are large, dark, and located on the face. This can affect self-esteem and socialization.\n\n【25】It is observed that port wine stains occur in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome or people born with one of these syndromes have abnormally developed blood vessels in other body parts and should be evaluated for serious complications.\n\n【26】If a port wine stain becomes larger, darker, and raised over the period of life, it can be a sign of other medical-related issues. For example, the stain can bleed more easily than other skin area when it gets injured. Also, some patients with port wine stains around their eyes may have a higher risk for glaucoma.\n\n【27】How Port-Wine Stains Are Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【28】Some port-wine stains are tiny and difficult to find. But some can be upsetting for kids, especially if they are large, dark, or on the face. And any birthmark affects a child's self-confidence, no matter how small or light the stain might be.\n\n【29】Lasers can make many port-wine stains much lighter, especially when the birthmark is on the head or neck, and can be considered the best treatment option. Doctors like dermatologists or plastic surgeons usually give several treatments with a \"pulsed-dye\" laser. The laser is highly concentrated light energy that targets the pigmentation in the stain and fades it. Multiple treatments can make the birthmark quite lighter. The longer a patient has had the stain, it becomes really difficult to treat it successfully.\n\n【30】Laser treatment can be uncomfortable. Patients usually get anesthetics such as an injection shot, spray, or ointment during the treatment. For young children and infants, general anesthesia is indicated to help them sleep or relax during the procedure. These treatments are very simple and short and take less than ten minutes. After treatment, the area may get irritated and inflamed and feel like a bad sunburn. However, it will get back to normal in a week. If needed, multiple treatments can be done as often as every six to eight weeks.\n\n【31】Doctors sometimes use another type of laser or surgery for port-wine stains when they get bumpy, thick, or raised. Port-wine stains can sometimes also develop grape-like growth of small blood capillaries called vascular blebs. Generally, these do not cause concern, but they often bleed and may need removal.\n\n【32】Some people previously chose other treatments, like freezing, tattooing, and even radiation. But these are not as effective or safe as laser therapy. Laser surgery is the only recommended treatment that works on port-wine stains with less risk of damaging or scarring the skin. Laser treatments may sometimes make the pigmentation darker than normal, but this is usually just temporary.\n\n【33】It is important to note that laser treatments may not eliminate the birthmark completely. However, the birthmark may come back and need to be retreated.\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】The doctor can check the birthmark regularly and inform the patient of any problems. A port-wine stain, especially when it's large or on the face, might affect a kid's self-confidence. Ask the doctor about the treatment modalities. Laser treatments may help make port-wine stains smaller and lighter.\n\n【36】Article Resources\n\n【37】*   Port-Wine Stains  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/port-wine-stains.html\n*   Port wine stains  \n    https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact\\_sheets/Port\\_wine\\_stains/\n*   NCBI - The Pathogenesis of Port Wine Stain and Sturge Weber Syndrome: Complex Interactions between Genetic Alterations and Aberrant MAPK and PI3K Activation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6539103/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "84e1d1ce-434e-4c43-965a-bafd4cc3d057", "title": "Cracking Knuckles: Causes and Side Effects", "text": "【0】Cracking Knuckles: Causes and Side Effects\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The cause of the joint's popping or cracking sound when pulled is still a question. Several individuals believed for a very long time that the noise was caused by nitrogen bubbles developing or dissolving in the joint fluid. Others hypothesized that the movement of the ligaments surrounding the knuckle was to blame. When someone pulls on the knuckles, one may hear a \"cracking\" sound that results from the synovial fluid bubbles bursting under the increased pressure or the pulling apart of the bones. It is this synovial fluid that lubricates the joints. Knuckle cracking will not injure the joints, according to a few studies. However, there is no solid proof that cracking the knuckles enlarges the joints or lessens the power of the grasp.\n\n【2】What Is Crackling?\n------------------\n\n【3】*   What occurs when joints break, crack, and pop is the noise of cracking or popping in the joints. It is the result of bubbles bursting in the synovial fluid.\n    \n*   The synovial fluid reduces friction and protects the cartilage by lubricating the joints like the oil in an automobile engine.\n    \n*   It typically takes 20 minutes for the bubbles in the synovial fluid to reform in the joints before they can fracture again.\n    \n*   The 20 minute pause, during which gas bubbles are re-forming in the synovial fluid, may be a draw of knuckle cracking.\n    \n*   During that time, people could feel more relaxed, as if the joints were no longer under pressure. However, the majority of the enjoyment is psychological. A psychological phenomenon is the feeling of satisfaction following knuckle cracking.\n    \n\n【4】Why Do People Break Their Knuckles?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【5】Most people commonly crack their knuckles, which can be brought on by a variety of factors, according to studies. People love hearing these pops and cracks for a variety of reasons, some of them are as follows:\n\n【6】1.  **Sound-** Some individuals like listening to the sound of knuckles cracking.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Arthrocentesis: Indications and Procedure\n    \n    A spot appeared on my hand recently. Does it look like a melanoma?\n    \n    Am I stuck with my curled fingers?\n    \n2.  **The Sensation-** Some individuals believe that cracking their knuckles releases stress and improves mobility by creating more space in the joint. Although it can seem like there is more space, there is no proof that this is the case.\n    \n3.  **Anxiety-** When someone is anxious, cracking the knuckles could help to busy the hands, like shaking them or twisting the hair.\n    \n4.  **Stress-** Some stressed-out people need to express their emotions about something. Knuckle cracking could provide distraction and release without really doing any harm.\n    \n5.  **Habit-** It is simple to continue cracking the knuckles till it occurs without even realizing it once they start doing so for any of these causes. However, it becomes a habit when they often crack their knuckles without realizing it. Those who crack their knuckles five times a day or more are referred to as habitual crackers.\n    \n\n【7】How Does It Impact The Joints?\n------------------------------\n\n【8】*   Although consistently cracking the knuckles might be relatively harmless, it can hurt them if done incorrectly or too frequently.\n    \n*   Incorrect knuckle pulling or cracking can injure ligaments and even induce finger dislocation.\n    \n*   After cracking the knuckles, if one experiences immediate pain or swelling, one may have injured the joint, so be sure to visit a doctor immediately.\n    \n*   Consistently cracking the knuckles can also erode the cartilage in the joints over time, generating swelling that causes discomfort.\n    \n\n【9】Can Knuckle Cracking Induce Arthritis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   Although cracking the knuckles may irritate others around them, it is unlikely to increase the chance of developing arthritis. Various research examined the prevalence of hand arthritis in frequent knuckle-cracking users versus non-knuckle-cracking individuals.\n    \n*   A cracked knuckle makes a \"pop\" sound as bubbles in the fluid lubricate joints, synovial fluid, and rupture.\n    \n*   Extending or bending the fingers backward and exerting negative pressure may draw the bones apart and cause the bubbles to burst.\n    \n*   There are compelling reasons to stop knuckle cracking, even if it does not lead to arthritis.\n    \n*   A reduction in grip strength may result from persistent knuckle cracking. Moreover, at least two accounts of injuries sustained while knuckle-cracking have been documented.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Adverse Effects of Knuckle Cracking?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】1.  Everyone can acquire the habit of knuckle cracking. Even though one could appreciate the sensation it gives, it might make those around them insane and have unfavorable side effects in the future.\n    \n2.  Although cracking the knuckles does not cause arthritis (as is commonly stated), one researcher discovered that it might create other issues, including joint swelling and a loss of hand strength, or depending on the degree and duration of the behavior, it could even be an indication of more serious nerve illnesses.\n    \n3.  The knuckles, or metacarpophalangeal joints, connect the fingers to the rest of the hand.\n    \n4.  Although these joints are extremely secure, they can become dislocated if enough external pressure is applied. Ligaments are tissues that link the bones together where a joint is located.\n    \n\n【13】What Are the Methods to Stop Cracking the Knuckles?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Be aware of behavioral treatment. Behavioral therapy approaches are the way to go if they want to stop, no matter how often they crack their knuckles.\n    \n*   So, since knuckle-cracking is a habit, it is feasible to modify the behavior using behavioral strategies.\n    \n*   Positive and negative behavioral therapies are the two primary types of behavioral treatment, to oversimplify a little.\n    \n    *   Techniques used in positive behavioral treatment include incentive schemes: Set objectives and reward oneself (or a loved one) when achieved.\n        \n    *   Negative methods include using small penalties or other reminders to draw attention to the behavior and encourage the person to stop.\n        \n*   Take additional preventive measures like\n    \n    *   Embark on a new interest. For example, engaging in a pastime that keeps the hands (and mind) occupied, such as writing, sketching, or doing crafts.\n        \n    *   Always have a little bottle of hand cream in the pocket or bag.\n        \n    *   Tape the \"knocking knuckles\" with the help of a friend, or tape the fingers to the palm to form a fist.\n        \n    *   Apply the rubber band technique. The oldest behavioral technique is to secure the wrist with a rubber band.\n        \n    *   Pull the rubber band back and release it as soon as they realize they will break the knuckles so that it will snap back into the flesh.\n        \n    *   One might be able to quit the behavior through the minor sting they experience since they might ultimately start to equate the knuckle cracking with discomfort.\n        \n\n【15】**Conclusion:**\n\n【16】Since there is no danger of cracking the knuckles, there should be no discomfort, swelling, or alteration of the joint's form. These are indicators that something is wrong and should be examined by the doctor. It is not hazardous to crack the knuckles, according to research. It does not grow the knuckles bigger or give anyone arthritis, but it can be noisy or disturbing to those around them. It might be challenging to stop a habit like knuckle cracking, but it is possible. One may break the behavior by being conscious of the times they are doing it and by seeking alternative stress relief methods.\n\n【17】Article Resources\n\n【18】*   “Knuckle Cracking”: Can Blinded Observers Detect Changes with Physical Examination and Sonography?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5339152/\n*   Adaptation of movement decoupling for compulsive joint cracking: A case report  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36454151/\n*   Why You Shouldn’t Crack Your Knuckles  \n    https://www.nih.org/nihd-news/2021/january/why-you-shouldn-t-crack-your-knuckles/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This can range from mild to moderate, and sometimes, it can block the passage of food completely. Sometimes individuals are unable to swallow food due to coughing, choking while eating or drinking, or bringing back food up occasionally through the nose. Individuals with certain systemic conditions also face dysphagia. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy helps in all the above conditions to provide adequate nutrition to the required individual.\n\n【2】What Is Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG)?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is a type of enteral feeding in cases of difficulty swallowing and conditions where the individual fails to receive nutrition through the mouth and needs enteral nutrition. In this state, surgery is performed to place a feeding tube. These feeding tubes (PEG tubes or G tubes) allow the absorption of nutrition from the stomach. This medical procedure is called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.\n\n【4】Who Is Often in Need of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Individuals who are suffering from dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) or conditions that lead to dysphagia need percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Conditions like:\n\n【6】*   Stroke.\n    \n*   Head and neck injury.\n    \n*   Brain injury.\n    \n*   Chronic appetite loss due to severe illness like cancer.\n    \n*   Individuals also get benefits in conditions of cystic fibrosis or dialysis in kidney failure.\n    \n*   Individuals in the condition of coma may receive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy to receive nutrition and be alive.\n    \n\n【7】What Is Done Prior to Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Before the procedure starts, your health care provider will consult with you regarding your medical conditions related to the heart, medical allergies, or bleeding disorders. Depending on your medical history and underlying conditions, some medical adjustment is required. The changes and restrictions are made like insulin dosage, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like Aspirin, and blood thinners like Warfarin. Avoid eating or drinking at least eight hours before the procedure.\n\n【9】What Is the Procedure Done for Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Percutaneous endoscopic procedures are placed using a small incision. A long flexible instrument, an endoscope, is used. Before the procedure, IV (intravenous) anesthesia and antibiotics (to prevent infection) are administered, which will make the individual numb during the procedure. Along with it, you may also receive local anesthesia.\n\n【11】After that, a small incision is made in the upper abdomen. Placing the tube through the incision is done, connecting the tube to the stomach. Occasionally contrast is injected via the PEG to determine the position, called a PEGogram. This entire procedure takes around 30 to 20 minutes. Usually, the patient can return home the same day or the next morning.\n\n【12】Related Topics\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Can you predict the survival of my father who is having spontaneous brain stem bleeding?\n\n【15】I have chest pain despite lipid profile and echo being normal. Why?\n\n【16】I have severe anxiety issues with eating and drinking. Can you help me?\n\n【17】What Happens After the Procedure of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Pain persists after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. This pain may be a result of the incision made for the tube placement or cramps due to the gas build-up in the digestive tract. This pain may subside within 24 to 48 hours. Some drainage around the site of incision is noticed till 48 hours. A bandage is placed over the site of the incision. The health care provider will instruct you regarding the removal of the bandage, which may probably be within two days.\n\n【19】You will have a session with the dietician, who will guide you on using the PEG tube and how to get started on internal nutrition.\n\n【20】How Long Does Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Last?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy lasts for months or years. In cases of any breakdown or clogging over extended periods of time, the tubes need to be replaced, and health care providers may remove and replace the tube without sedation, but in rare cases, sedation is required. The provider may remove the tube using firm traction and insert a new tube. In cases of new tube replacement, the opening closes on its own. The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site closes quickly on its own, so immediate attention is required in cases of accidental dislodgement.\n\n【22】What Are the Indications of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is indicated in conditions in which normal nasogastric feeding is not possible. Conditions like stroke, cleft lip, palate, and tumors of the head and neck.\n    \n*   In advanced dementia (a condition affecting memory thinking capacity that severely interferes with daily life activities), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy does not result in prolonged life. Instead, oral assisted feeding is preferred. In patients with malignant bowel obstruction, venting PEG is used and is placed to prevent nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Gastrostomy can be used to treat the volvulus of the stomach when the stomach twists along one of its axes.\n    \n\n【24】What Are the Contraindications of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Care must be taken while the placement of the PEG tubes. The contraindications of the usage of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy are:\n\n【26】**Absolute Contraindications:**\n\n【27】*   Peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum- inner abdominal wall).\n    \n*   Uncorrected coagulopathy.\n    \n*   Untreatable massive ascites.\n    \n*   Inability to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n    \n*   Bowel obstruction.\n    \n\n【28】**Relative Contraindications:**\n\n【29】*   Gastric wall neoplasm.\n    \n*   Massive ascites.\n    \n*   Infection of the abdominal wall.\n    \n*   Gastric mucosal abnormalities, large gastric varices.\n    \n*   Portal hypertensive gastropathy.\n    \n*   Previous abdominal surgery along with partial gastrectomy.\n    \n*   Morbid obesity.\n    \n*   Intra-abdominal malignancy with peritoneal involvement.\n    \n\n【30】What Are the Complications of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The complications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy are:\n\n【32】*   Hemorrhage.\n    \n*   A gastric ulcer on the site or on the opposite wall of the stomach is also known as a kissing ulcer.\n    \n*   Perforation of the bowel leads to peritonitis.\n    \n*   Infection at the site of surgery around the gastrostomy site. Intravenous antibiotics can reduce infection around the gastrostomy site.\n    \n*   A puncture on the left lobe of the liver leads to liver capsule pain.\n    \n*   Gastric separation.\n    \n*   The gastric part of the tube migrates into the gastric wall- buried bumper syndrome (caused due to overgrowth of gastric mucosa over the inner bumper of gastrostomy tubes).\n    \n*   Gastrocolic fistula (rare presentation of malignant and benign gastric conditions).\n    \n\n【33】How to Take Care of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Site?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Drainage sound at the site of the PEG tube is common in the initial one or two days. The area around heals in two to three weeks.\n\n【35】*   You need to clean the skin around the tube one to three times a day. Use mild soap or saline water along with a cotton swab or gauze.\n    \n*   Gently remove any drainage or crusting over the skin and tubes. Do not pull the tube on your own and prevent it from being pulled.\n    \n*   Dry the skin with a clean towel or gauze. Avoid bulky dressings, and do not put the gauze under the disc.\n    \n*   Do not use any kind of ointments, sprays, or powders around the tubes. Consult your provider and ask whether it is okay to shower or to take a bath.\n    \n\n【36】When to Contact Your Health Care Provider in Cases of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】You should contact your health care provider if you have the following issues:\n\n【38】*   Redness or irritation on the skin surface around the tube.\n    \n*   Leakage around the tube or system.\n    \n*   If the PEG tube is blocked.\n    \n*   Any signs of bleeding from the tube insertion site.\n    \n*   Diarrhea after feedings.\n    \n*   Worsening pain.\n    \n*   Hard and swollen belly even after one hour after feeding.\n    \n*   Feeling constipated, passing hard and dry stools.\n    \n*   Coughing more than usual or feeling of shortness of breath.\n    \n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy permits fluids, nutrition, and medications directly into the stomach by passing through the mouth and esophagus, which is typically performed on patients who are unable to eat or drink directly or consume nutrition orally. It is necessary to imagine complications associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy soon after insertion or later. Most of the time, complications are associated with displacement, including buried bumper syndrome.\n\n【41】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【42】* * *\n\n【43】#### **1.**\n\n【44】#### **Is Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy a Permanent Procedure?**\n\n【45】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is done in case of severe dysphagia or difficulty swallowing water and food. The tube is inserted for a shorter duration if a person starts eating and drinking on their own. However, in severe conditions, long-term use of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is advised by the doctor if a patient cannot eat or drink due to blockage.\n\n【46】#### **2.**\n\n【47】#### **Is Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Placement Considered a Major Surgery?**\n\n【48】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a simple surgical procedure that does not require significant intervention in the abdominal cavity. Instead, the doctor makes a small incision on the upper abdomen with the help of an endoscopic instrument. A person is given antibiotics and intravenous anesthesia to numb the area during the procedure.\n\n【49】#### **3.**\n\n【50】#### **How Much Time Does Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Take To Heal?**\n\n【51】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy causes pain at the incision site after the procedure is completed. Pain persists due to continuous gas build-up in the abdomen and the cramps due to tube insertion. On average, the pain may last up to 24 to 48 hours, with some drainage around the incision.\n\n【52】#### **4.**\n\n【53】#### **How Long Can a Person Survive With a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube?**\n\n【54】A person with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube can live up to 30 days to one year, depending on the patient’s condition. However, severe dysphagia can lead to health complications and other tube insertion risks. In addition, the nutritional supply of the body is hampered, and thus the mortality risk also increases with prolonged use of PEG tubes.\n\n【55】#### **5.**\n\n【56】#### **Can a Person Remove Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube at Home?**\n\n【57】A person cannot remove a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube at home. The tube is placed inside the stomach by an expert by making an incision and stabilizing the tube in one place. The healthcare provider only guides the person about cleaning the skin around the incision area to avoid infection. The PEG tube is removed by the professional only.\n\n【58】#### **6.**\n\n【59】#### **When Should a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Be Removed?**\n\n【60】A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube is usually removed only if clogging or breakdown occurs over a while. The doctor replaces the tube without any anesthesia or sedation, but in some rare cases, a person may need sedation. The tube only needs replacement in rare conditions but usually lasts for a few months to years.\n\n【61】#### **7.**\n\n【62】#### **How Painful Is a PEG Tube?**\n\n【63】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is painful initially due to incision. A person may feel abdominal discomfort due to swelling caused by the incision made during the procedure. However, the pain usually goes away within seven to ten days.\n\n【64】#### **8.**\n\n【65】#### **What Is the Most Common Complication Associated With Tube Feeding?**\n\n【66】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube can cause inflammation of the inner abdominal wall (peritonitis), puncture of the left lobe of the liver, bleeding, benign or malignant gastric problems, and gastric ulcers on the incision site. In addition, PEG also leads to gastric separation and buried-bumper syndrome (tubes get buried into the gastric wall). It can also cause infection at the site of the gastrostomy site.\n\n【67】#### **9.**\n\n【68】#### **What Is the Alternative to Feeding Tubes?**\n\n【69】The doctor can treat difficulty swallowing or obstruction in the digestive system with many options. An alternative to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy includes a nasojejunal feeding tube (NJ) and a nasogastric feeding tube (NG). All these feeding tubes are used to feed the person depending on their condition and to supply nutrition as per their needs.\n\n【70】#### **10.**\n\n【71】#### **What Happens if a Person’s Body Rejects a PEG Tube?**\n\n【72】When a person cannot eat or drink due to severe obstruction in the digestive tract, feeding tubes are inserted by the doctor. In case the body of a person does not respond to feeding tubes, the nutrition cannot be supplied to the patient. Therefore, this condition can slow down the person’s body, and their survival chances also decrease due to lack of nutrition.\n\n【73】#### **11.**\n\n【74】#### **Is There a Ballon Attached to the PEG Tube?**\n\n【75】Some of the PEG tubes have a balloon at the end to keep them stable and avoid the dislodgement of the tube. The balloon is blown up after being inserted in the stomach, and the end of the tube gets inflated, which holds the tube in place. However, this balloon is not present in all PEG or G-tubes.\n\n【76】#### **12.**\n\n【77】#### **Is There a Similarity Between a G-Tube and PEG Tube?**\n\n【78】A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube is often called a PEG tube or G-tube. They are used for feeding an individual directly through the abdomen if they have dysphagia or severe obstruction in swallowing food and water. G-tube stands for the gastrostomy tube, and the PEG tube is called a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.\n\n【79】#### **13.**\n\n【80】#### **How Frequently Should a Person Change the Gastrostomy Button?**\n\n【81】The gastrostomy button is held in its place by a water-filled balloon on either side. The button needs to be replaced for various reasons, such as leakage in the balloon. However, it is recommended to change the button every three to four months, and the water inside the balloon should be replaced every week with the help of a syringe.\n\n【82】Article Resources\n\n【83】*   Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy\n*   Understanding Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG)  \n    https://www.asge.org/home/for-patients/patient-information/understanding-peg#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20PEG%3F,bypassing%20the%20mouth%20and%20esophagus", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ddc9218a-2315-4537-ac8c-5ae90db7fe93", "title": "Calcium Antagonists Toxicity: Symptoms, and Management", "text": "【0】Calcium Antagonists Toxicity: Symptoms, and Management\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) toxicity are commonly prescribed for treating cardiovascular diseases and have been demonstrated to be effective in managing hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and angina. However, toxicity associated with an overdose may produce severe, life-threatening complications, including bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and shock. 10,513 cases of calcium channel antagonist (CCA) toxicity were reported in the United States in 2004, resulting in 62 deaths of the affected people.\n\n【2】The conventional approach to managing calcium channel antagonist (CCA) overdose consists of intravenous fluid resuscitation, administration of calcium, gut decontamination, glucagon, and atropine, and supportive care. In severe cases, the patient may suffer from bradycardia, and hypotension may require the placement of a temporary pacemaker and the administration of vasopressors and inotropes.\n\n【3】What Are Calcium Channel Blockers?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) belong to a class of medications used to treat problems related to blood pressure (hypertension). Calcium channel blockers block some of the calcium that enters and gets to the heart and arteries.\n\n【5】It is believed that calcium is a critical nutrient for the bones, but it also plays a vital role in the effective functioning of the heart. Calcium moves into the cells of the heart every time it beats, allowing a strong and even squeeze of the muscles to happen. If an individual has a problem with high blood pressure, the force of blood flowing through the arteries is higher than usual. Administrating the calcium channel blockers (CCBs) helps in reducing the flow of calcium into the heart and arteries, which helps to:\n\n【6】*   Lower blood pressure.\n    \n*   Open narrow blood vessels.\n    \n*   Reduce heart rate.\n    \n\n【7】Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are also sometimes called calcium antagonists. They are considered as effective as ACE inhibitors in regulating blood pressure.\n\n【8】Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are available in many forms. It can be indicated orally, ranging from short-acting dissolving tablets to extended-release capsules. The dosage will depend on the affected person's overall health and medical history.\n\n【9】What Is the Mechanism of Calcium Channel Blockers?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Calcium is an essential mineral primarily associated with healthy bones and teeth and also plays a vital role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract, and regulating normal heart rhythms and nerve functions. It is an electrolyte, which means it has a positive charge when it is dissolved in water. The body uses ions (atoms with an electrical charge) in electrolytes to transport things into and out of the cells. The body constantly regulates and balances all the ions, which means when calcium ions enter a cell, sodium ions exit, and vice versa.\n\n【11】Those ions enter and exit the cells using channels, which act just like doorways to the inside of the cells. Those channels also have a type of selective membrane feature, which only allows ions that have the right type of charge (either positive or negative) and the right size to enter and leave. Calcium channel blockers have the advantage of the fact that certain types of calcium channels tend to exist only in certain parts of the body. This allows the targeting of medications depending on which channels they affect.\n\n【12】Related Topics\n\n【13】* * *\n\n【14】Vasodilators - Allowing the Heart to Work Effortlessly\n\n【15】Do beta blockers cause hair thinning?\n\n【16】Candesartan Cilexetil - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n\n【17】What Is Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【18】Calcium channel blockers are classified into two main categories based on their physiological effects - Dihydropyridines (for example, Amlodipine, Nifedipine, Felodipine, Nicardipine) and Non-Dihydropyridines (for example, Verapamil and Diltiazem).\n\n【19】Dihydropyridines have an affinity for peripheral vascular smooth muscle cells, while non-dihydropyridines have an affinity for cardiomyocytes. Calcium channel blockers show pharmacological effects by stopping the alpha-1 subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in the prevention of calcium influx intracellularly needed for myocardial, vascular, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction.\n\n【20】Meanwhile, in turn, it assists in the vascular smooth muscles relaxation resulting in vasodilation and hypotension, myocardial depression caused by excessive negative inotropy, bradycardia resulting from negative chronotropic, and atrioventricular node blockade due to negative dromotropy.\n\n【21】In addition, calcium channel blockers also block the L‐type calcium channels in pancreas Islet cells, causing a reduction in insulin secretion, hyperglycemia, and reduced cardiac glucose utilization. The drop in blood pressure due to calcium channel blockers toxicity is a result of a fusion of negative myocardial inotropy and chronotropy, as well as peripheral vasodilation.\n\n【22】At therapeutic doses, calcium channel blockers have a selectivity towards certain tissues. However, at toxic or higher doses, calcium channel blockers lose their ability to select which results in potentially life-threatening conditions like bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), hyperglycemia (increase in blood sugar level), and renal insufficiency.\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of Calcium Antagonist Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The following are the symptoms seen in patients with calcium antagonist toxicity -\n\n【25】*   Agitation (hyperactivity).\n    \n*   Delirium (confused thinking and possible hallucinations).\n    \n*   Breathing difficulty.\n    \n*   Confusion.\n    \n*   Constipation.\n    \n*   Lightheadedness.\n    \n*   Dizziness.\n    \n*   Drowsiness.\n    \n*   Increased blood sugar.\n    \n*   Irregular heartbeat.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Vomiting.\n    \n*   Rapid heartbeat.\n    \n*   Slow heartbeat.\n    \n*   Slurred speech.\n    \n*   Shock.\n    \n*   Low blood pressure.\n    \n*   Weakness.\n    \n\n【26】What Are the Investigations Performed for Diagnosing Calcium Antagonist Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The following are the investing done to detect the toxicity -\n\n【28】*   **Electrocardiogram -** It is a bedside investigation done to detect bradycardia, accelerated AV node conduction, second and third-degree heart block, sinus arrest with nodal escape, and asystole in the affected patient with toxicity.\n    \n*   **Blood Sugar -** If the patient is hyperglycemic, then it is considered a serious condition.\n    \n*   **Detection of Gas Concentration in Blood -** In patients with toxicity, hyperkalemia (high level of plasma potassium), metabolic acidosis, and impaired oxygen delivery are reported.\n    \n*   **Creatinine Test -** It is done to detect organ dysfunction due to shock.\n    \n*   **Chest X-rays -** Pulmonary edema is observed.\n    \n*   **Echocardiography -** The finding of impaired contractility is observed.\n    \n\n【29】What Are the Treatment Modalities for Calcium Antagonist Toxicity?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】The following are the treatment options for calcium antagonist toxicity -\n\n【31】*   **Resuscitation -** It requires early intubation and ventilation when life-threatening toxicity is anticipated. Early invasive blood pressure monitoring if evolving hypotension and shock.\n    \n\n【32】*   **Specific Treatment for the Cardiovascular System -** Fluid resuscitation is done to regulate hemodynamics to grain the tissue perfusion and, ultimately, the tissue oxygen delivery. It is given up to 20 milliliters per kilograms (mL/kg) crystalloid. Calcium can be useful for temporizing measures to increase heart rate and blood pressure. Atropine is indicated for maintaining the cardiovascular system.\n    \n\n【33】*   **Gastrointestinal (GI) Decontamination -** Gastrointestinal decontamination as a choice of treatment is rarely done in the emergency department. Gastrointestinal decontamination should be done within the first one to two hours post-ingestion of the calcium channel blocker. The use of this method is not recommended for hemodynamically unstable patients. Gastrointestinal decontamination can be done through whole-bowel irrigation (WBI), orogastric lavage, or indicating the administration of activated charcoal (AC).\n    \n\n【34】*   **High-Dose Insulin Euglycemia Therapy (HIET) -** High-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIET) works by a number of mechanisms in the treatment of calcium channel blocker toxicity. High-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIET) creates positive inotropic effects by improving vascular dilation, raising the cardiac output and regulating blood pressure, and escalating the intracellular transport of glucose into myocardial cells. In addition, high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIET) helps in reducing the infusion requirements of catecholamines and hemodynamic instability as it does not affect the heart rate.\n    \n\n【35】*   **Lipid Emulsions Therapy (LET) -** Lipid emulsions therapy (LET) is used to reduce the toxicity of several lipophilic drugs, including non-dihydropyridine and Verapamil. However, lipid emulsions therapy (LET) should be indicated in patients who do not respond to first-line treatments, patients with refractory shock, and poly-drug toxicity.\n    \n\n【36】*   **Inotropes and Vasopressors -** In patients with calcium channel blocker toxicity, problems like peripheral vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), cardiac depression (decreased heart output), and conduction abnormalities (problems with the electrical system that controls the heart rate) are expected. The use of vasopressors is recommended to maintain hemodynamic stability.\n    \n\n【37】Epinephrine increases heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure through the beta-1 and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors stimulation. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by acting effectively on the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Dobutamine, on the other hand, increases heart rate and contractility through beta-1 receptor stimulation. Epinephrine and Dobutamine are recommended in patients with cardiogenic shock, while norepinephrine is indicated in vasogenic shock. But alone Dopamine or vasopressors are recommended due to poor clinical outcomes for calcium channel blocker toxicity.\n\n【38】*   **Dialysis -** Calcium channel blockers are differentiated by their high protein-binding abilities, which minimizes their potential to dialyze them in cases of severe calcium channel blocker toxicity.\n    \n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】Calcium channel blocker toxicity is a commonly observed medical emergency that requires fast and accurate patient evaluation and assessment. Rapid and comprehensive early diagnosis and management are recommended, with monitoring based on the patient's condition and the severity of signs and symptoms. The first-line therapies include the indication of calcium, high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIET), dialysis, and vasopressors.\n\n【41】Article Resources\n\n【42】*   Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537147/\n*   Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity  \n    https://calpoison.org/news/calcium-channel-blocker-toxicity\n*   Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) & Beta-Blocker (BBl) overdose  \n    https://emcrit.org/ibcc/ccb/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Andersen syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects various parts of the body. It is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, developmental abnormalities, and sensitive periodic paralysis. The characteristic features of this disease were first described by Ellen Andersen in 1971, and Rabi Tawil made significant contributions to this. This article gives insight into the particulars of Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n\n【2】What is Andersen-Tawil Syndrome?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects various parts of the body. It is characterized by a triad of episodic muscle weakness; ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeat originating from lower heart chambers), and prolonged QT interval (measurement on electrocardiogram). It is also associated with developmental anomalies such as low-set ears, widely-spaced eyes, short stature, small mandible, fifth-digit clinodactyly, syndactyly, and scoliosis. It causes disturbances in the electrical function of the heart, characterized by a long QT interval in the electrocardiogram and abnormal heart rhythms. The affected individuals present with cardiac symptoms such as palpitations and syncope or muscle weakness that occurs after prolonged rest or after exertion. Mild permanent weakness, mild learning difficulties, and deficits in executive function and abstract reasoning have also been described.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Andersen-Tawil syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. This gene encodes an ion channel that transports potassium ions out of the cardiac muscle cells. This ion channel is essential for maintaining the normal functions of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. It is usually inherited from a parent in an autosomal dominant manner, but it can also occur due to a new genetic mutation. The mutation in Andersen-Tawil syndrome is of two types:\n\n【6】*   **Type I Syndrome**: It is caused by a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene, and it accounts for about 60 percent of the cases.\n    \n*   **Type II Syndrome**: It accounts for about 40 percent of the cases, and no mutations have been identified.\n    \n\n【7】What Happens in Andersen-Tawil Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【8】Andersen-Tawil syndrome disturbs the electrical signals that coordinate the heart cells and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. The genetic mutations cause a disturbance in the ion channels responsible for the flow of potassium and reduce the rate of repolarization of cardiac muscle cells. This is observed as a prolonged QT interval on the ECG (electrocardiogram). The prolonged QT interval results in arrhythmias. Muscle weakness is due to the depolarization of the resting membrane. The skeletal abnormalities seen in this syndrome are due to the impairment in the function of osteoclasts, cells that regulate bone growth, or disrupt the bone morphogenetic protein signaling cascade.\n\n【9】What Are the Clinical Manifestations of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Andersen-Tawil syndrome is characterized by episodic flaccid muscle weakness, cardiac abnormalities, and distinctive dysmorphic features.\n\n【11】*   **Weakness** \\- Intermittent weakness occurs spontaneously or may be triggered by prolonged rest or rest following exertion. The frequency, severity, and duration of the weakness vary by person. It presents with mild permanent weakness. However, fixed proximal weakness can also develop over a period of time.\n    \n*   **Ventricular Arrhythmias** \\- Arrhythmias, including bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias, may remain asymptomatic or manifest as palpitations. Less common presentations are syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death.\n    \n*   **Dilated Cardiomyopathy** - It was observed in some cases and was reversed by treatment with Flecainide in an individual with a pathological variant of this disease. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of chronic tachycardia rather than a primary phenotypic manifestation.\n    \n*   **Physical Features** - It causes anomalies like low-set ears, widely-spaced eyes, fifth-digit clinodactyly, second and third-toe syndactyly, small mandible, short stature, broad nasal root, and scoliosis. It can also cause dental enamel discoloration. The characteristic facial features include a broad forehead, short palpebral fissures, a small upper jaw, and lower jaw, a thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures, and a triangular face. The dental findings include persistent primary teeth, dental crowding, and multiple missing teeth. Skeletal findings are fifth-digit clinodactyly (curved finger or toe) and second and third-toe syndactyly (fused fingers or toes). Other findings, such as small hands and feet and joint laxity, have also been observed. Renal abnormalities like unilateral hypoplastic kidney and renal tubular defect can also be present.\n    \n*   **Mild Learning Difficulties** - In distinctive neurocognitive phenotype, mild learning difficulties and deficits in executive function and abstract reasoning have been observed. Developmental delay and growth restriction have also been observed.\n    \n*   **Afebrile Seizures** - Some cases of afebrile seizures in infancy have been reported.\n    \n\n【12】How Is Andersen-Tawil Syndrome Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【13】The diagnosis of Andersen-Tawil syndrome is based on the symptoms, the clinical findings, and the results of the electrocardiogram. Clinical diagnostic criteria include the presence of periodic paralysis, ventricular arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval, the presence of developmental anomalies, and a family history of Andersen-Tawil syndrome.\n\n【14】Genetic testing helps to identify the type of mutations in the affected person. Other investigations include ambulatory ECG (electrocardiogram) to assess arrhythmias, measurement of potassium levels during the period of weakness, and thyroid function tests.\n\n【15】How Is Andersen-Tawil Syndrome Treated?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a genetic condition, and it cannot be cured. However, the symptoms of this syndrome can be successfully managed. It includes the following:\n\n【17】*   **General Measures** - Medications that prolong the QT interval, including Sotalol and Amiodarone, should be avoided as they promote abnormal heart rhythms. Drugs that reduce potassium levels in the blood, such as diuretics, should be avoided as they worsen periodic paralysis and arrhythmias.\n    \n*   **Management of Arrhythmias** - Taking beta blockers medications, such as Propranolol, blocks the effects of adrenaline on the heart. Other antiarrhythmic drugs like Flecainide and Verapamil also help in treating arrhythmias. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator is a small device implanted under the skin that detects abnormal arrhythmias and treats the arrhythmias with a small electric shock.\n    \n*   **Periodic Paralysis** - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as Acetazolamide help in the management of periodic paralysis.\n    \n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects various parts of the body. It is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, developmental abnormalities, and sensitive periodic paralysis. Since Andersen-Tawil syndrome is caused by genetic mutations, it cannot be cured. However, the symptoms can be managed, and the worsening of the disease can be prevented. Early diagnosis and management are essential for a good treatment outcome. The affected patients respond well to treatment and show good outcomes.\n\n【20】Article Resources\n\n【21】*   Andersen-Tawil Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1264/\n*   Andersen-Tawil syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/andersen-tawil-syndrome/\n*   Andersen-Tawil Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/andersen-tawil-syndrome/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Data has shown that around 20 percent to 35 percent of HIV-infected patients have an infection with Tinea. Additionally, palms may also be involved. Though this condition is seen in a patient without HIV, also, HIV-positive patients are more prone to this condition.\n    \n*   The athlete’s foot is not an emergency or serious condition. Still, the cure is sometimes a little difficult to attain, like in patients suffering from diabetes or a weak immune system.\n    \n*   The fungi tinea pedis can be found in showers, locker room floors, around swimming pools, etc.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Risk Factors for an Athlete Foot?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【8】It can happen to anyone, but the behavior affects the risk factors. The following are the factors that can put an individual at risk of getting it:\n\n【9】*   Visiting public places in bare feet, like locker rooms, swimming pools, showers, etc.\n    \n*   Sharing food, socks, or towels with an infected person.\n    \n*   Use closed-toe, tight shoes.\n    \n*   Wet feet for a long time.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    What might be the reason for feet numbness while playing football?\n    \n    What causes knee pain in a football player?\n    \n    Superficial Fungal Infections\n    \n\n【10】*   Sweaty feet might increase the risk.\n    \n*   Minor nail or skin injury on the foot.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of an Athlete Foot?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The following constitute symptoms of athlete’s foot:\n\n【13】*   Itchiness, stinging sensation, or burning sensation between toes\n    \n\n【14】and soles of feet.\n\n【15】*   Itching blisters on the feet.\n    \n*   Cracks and peeling of the skin of feet are commonly observed between toes and soles.\n    \n*   Dry or raw skin of feet.\n    \n*   Toenails become discolored and thick.\n    \n*   Toenails pulling away from the nail bed.\n    \n\n【16】How Can It Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------\n\n【17】Initially, the diagnosis is made by observing symptoms. Also, the skin test can be used to diagnose the condition and confirm whether it is fungal in nature or not.\n\n【18】The most commonly used method is the potassium hydroxide examination of the skin lesion. In this, a small area of infected skin is scraped off by a physician and placed in potassium hydroxide. The potassium hydroxide causes the destruction of healthy cells, and fungal cells are unaffected. Hence, these cells are easily identified under the microscope.\n\n【19】What Are the Treatment Options?\n-------------------------------\n\n【20】There are various treatment options available to cure this condition, and the most common over-the-counter (OTC) topical antifungal medications prove to be useful. Some of the commonly used topical antifungal medications include Miconazole, Clotrimazole, Butenafine, Tolnaftate, and Terbinafine. But, it is advisable to use these medications with a physician’s consent.\n\n【21】If OTC does not cure this, the physician prescribes topical or oral antifungal medications. Some of the prescription medications include:\n\n【22】*   Clotrimazole and Miconazole: Indicated for topical application.\n    \n*   Itraconazole, Fluconazole, Terbinafine: Administered orally.\n    \n*   Topical steroids.\n    \n*   Other oral antibiotics can be prescribed, too, if bacterial infections develop due to raw skin and blisters.\n    \n\n【23】**Home Remedies:**\n\n【24】Some home remedies have also proven to be beneficial, though scientific confirmation has yet to be done. The commonly followed home care remedy involves soaking the feet in salt water or diluted vinegar so that the blisters can dry up. Here are a few good remedies for athletes’ feet.\n\n【25】**Tea Tree Oil:**\n\n【26】Tea tree oil has both antifungal and antibacterial properties. This is the reason why tea tree oil is commonly used to treat many fungal infections. This might include infections from candidiasis and roundworm infections. Mix warm coconut oil with tea tree oil for additional benefits. Apply it to the affected area twice a day for more results.\n\n【27】**Hydrogen Peroxide:**\n\n【28】Hydrogen peroxide is known to kill the fungus effectively. The home remedy involves directly pouring hydrogen peroxide onto the affected area. It may hurt a little, especially when a person has open wounds. Do this twice every day till the infection subsides.\n\n【29】**Neem Oil:**\n\n【30】Both neem oil and extracts of neem leaf have antifungal properties. An individual can apply the neem oil or its extract directly to the affected area two times a day by massaging the skin. This is helpful for treating infections that develop under the toenails.\n\n【31】**Garlic:**\n\n【32】Garlic is the best medicine for many infections. Treating an athlete’s foot topically can be effective. To use garlic topically, crush four to five cloves of garlic, smash it, and rub them on the affected area. Repeat this twice daily.\n\n【33】**Rubbing Alcohol:**\n\n【34】Rubbing alcohol on the hand to clean cuts can help kill the fungus on the skin’s surface. Soaking the feet in a footbath having 70 percent rubbing alcohol and 30 percent of water shows better results.\n\n【35】**Sea Salt Baths:**\n\n【36】Sea salt is the best example of antibacterial and antifungal properties. It may actually inhibit the growth and spread of an athlete’s feet. Try dissolving a cup of sea salt into a warm foot bath. Soak the feet for a minimum of 20 minutes. After that, dry the feet thoroughly.\n\n【37】**Talcum Powder:**\n\n【38】Talcum powder works well to treat athletes’ feet. The affected area is dry and clean to prevent further spreading. Apply talcum powder to the affected area. A person should wash their used socks regularly.\n\n【39】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【40】Sometimes, this condition can lead to complications. Some of the mild complications consist of allergic reactions related to the fungus that can ultimately cause blisters on the feet or hands. Recurrence of the condition after treatment has also been noted.\n\n【41】Severe complications may take place if a secondary bacterial infection develops. The symptoms of this condition involve swollen, painful, hot feet. To add on, bacterial infection can also be represented by pus, drainage, and fever.\n\n【42】If this bacterial infection spreads to the lymphatic system, the lymph nodes and the lymphatic system can be affected.\n\n【43】What Are the Preventive Measures?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】The following can be done to prevent athlete’s foot:\n\n【45】*   Washing of the feet and toes with soap and water, followed by drying daily.\n    \n*   Washing socks, bedding, towels, and disinfecting shoes.\n    \n*   An affected individual can use antifungal powder on their feet daily if they are prone to this condition.\n    \n*   A person should avoid sharing their belongings, like socks, towels, shoes, etc., with others.\n    \n*   Wear footwear in public places.\n    \n*   Change socks frequently.\n    \n*   Use shoes made with breathable materials.\n    \n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】An athlete’s foot is a common condition that can be cured easily, but sometimes it can also lead to complications if left untreated. Get your online prescription for this condition. In addition, it can also be prevented by taking all the preventive measures. Also, it is crucial to complete the course of treatment suggested by the doctor to prevent the recurrence of this infection.\n\n【48】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【49】* * *\n\n【50】#### **1.**\n\n【51】#### **How to Get Rid of Athlete's Foot Fast?**\n\n【52】Feet, toes, and between the toes must be washed every morning and in the evening.

It usually happens around the mid-cycle on the 14th day.\n    \n2.  **Menstrual Bleeding** \\- When the released egg is not fertilized by the sperm, it breaks down, resulting in menstruation which is usually moderate to heavy bleeding. It occurs around the 28th day in a regular 28-day cycle.\n    \n3.  **Implantation Bleeding** - If the egg released during ovulation is fertilized by the sperm and is implanted onto the uterine wall, it produces implantation bleeding. It occurs between the 20th and 24th days of a typical 28-day menstrual cycle.\n    \n\n【3】What Is Implantation Bleeding?\n------------------------------\n\n【4】The implantation of the fertilized egg on the uterine wall produces slight vaginal bleeding. It usually occurs around the time of menstruation which people assume to be regular periods. In the case of implantation bleeding, the amount of blood that comes out is very minimal. It actually serves as an indicator of pregnancy. However, not all women experience it, and only one-fourth of women who get pregnant undergo implantation bleeding.\n\n【5】What Causes Implantation Bleeding?\n----------------------------------\n\n【6】Ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary) usually occurs in the mid-cycle. After the egg is released from the ovary, it usually waits for a day or two for fertilization to take place. When the sperm reaches the egg during those days, the egg and sperm fuse together in the process called fertilization. After 10 days to 14 days of fertilization, the fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine wall. As a result, there is a breakage of blood vessels present on the wall of the uterus, which causes implantation bleeding.\n\n【7】Related Topics\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Would having milk or water before swab test alter the DNA?\n\n【10】Had brownish discharge after protected sex. Is it implantation bleeding?\n\n【11】A few days after sex, my fiancee has spotting. Is it implantation bleeding?\n\n【12】What Other Symptoms Accompany Implantation Bleeding?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Of the very few identifiable, early pregnancy symptoms, implantation bleeding is an important one. The accompanying signs may be helpful to differentiate between the actual menstruation and implantation bleeding. Although the signs may be similar to that of premenstrual symptoms, the intensity of the pain is less than a regular period.\n\n【14】The following are the accompanying early pregnancy symptoms:\n\n【15】*   Headaches.\n    \n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Mild abdominal cramps.\n    \n*   Mood swings.\n    \n*   Lower back pain.\n    \n*   Tenderness of breasts.\n    \n\n【16】How Long Will an Implantation Bleeding Be Present?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Implantation bleeding usually lasts only for about two hours to three hours. With some, it can be present for three full days. When you have been sexually active, and your menstrual cycle lasted less than three days with no or minimal abdominal cramps and not much bleeding, there are chances for it to be implantation bleeding. However, suppose you have dark or bright red bleeding like you usually get on menstruation for more than three days. In that case, the chances of it being implantation bleeding are significantly less. The implantation bleeding is less likely to occur in people who have already had an egg attachment. In contrast, women in their first pregnancy have an increased chance of implantation bleeding.\n\n【18】How Is Implantation Bleeding Different From Normal Menstrual Bleeding?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The amount of menstrual bleeding differs for every woman. Despite the difference in the flow of menstrual bleeding, the following are the key differences that help distinguish implantation bleeding from actual menstruation.\n\n【20】**1\\. Clotting:**\n\n【21】In the case of menstrual bleeding, there will be the presence of blood clots, although the amount of blood clots present differs. When it comes to implantation bleeding, there should not be any blood clots.\n\n【22】**2\\. Color of Bleeding:**\n\n【23】Bright to dark red is the color of the menstrual bleeding, while implantation bleeding has a light pink to dark brown color.\n\n【24】**3.Amount:**\n\n【25】The term 'implantation bleeding' is a misnomer because in terms of implantation bleeding, there is only slight spotting. There is no actual bleeding as seen in menstruation. The spotting can either be intermittent or constant but with a light flow.\n\n【26】Why Do Both Implantation and Menstrual Bleeding Occur at the Same Time?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Since both implantation and menstruation occur about 10 days to 14 days after the release of egg or ovulation, the time of implantation bleeding or menstrual bleeding is almost similar. Implantation bleeding is usually expected in the week of the actual menstruation date.\n\n【28】Is Implantation Bleeding a Cause for Concern?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Implantation bleeding is not a cause for concern for the developing fetus and usually results in a healthy pregnancy. However, it is not normal if there is spotting or heavy bleeding for a few days after your missed periods. Immediate medical attention with a gynecologist is a must.\n\n【30】What Should I Do to Check if My Bleeding Is Implantation Bleeding?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】In addition to the above-mentioned key features, implantation bleeding can be confirmed by taking a pregnancy test. When pregnancy occurs, the amount of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increases in the body, which is detected in urine with the help of a urine pregnancy test. Since implantation bleeding is an indicator of pregnancy, taking a home pregnancy test after three to five days of your missed periods helps confirm it.\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】The sight of vaginal bleeding can be upsetting. However, if it turns out to be implantation bleeding, the chances of pregnancy are high. Try taking a home pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy after three to five days of missing your periods. Not planning for pregnancy, then implantation bleeding signals you to reach out to a healthcare provider to find the best possible solution. It is also recommended to seek the consultation of your treating doctor when you experience bleeding days after your missed period to avoid any complications.\n\n【34】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【35】* * *\n\n【36】#### **1.**\n\n【37】#### **What Should I Do to Check if My Bleeding Is Implantation Bleeding?**\n\n【38】Implantation bleeding can be confirmed by taking a pregnancy test.

{"seq_id": "00ab262e-16e4-4d0d-8962-5f267bc46f5c", "title": "Illness Anxiety Disorder (Hypochondriasis) - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Illness Anxiety Disorder (Hypochondriasis) - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is Illness Anxiety Disorder?\n---------------------------------\n\n【1】Illness anxiety disorder (IAD), otherwise called health anxiety, is overwhelming anxiety about a perceived illness lasting for a period of more than six months. People with IAD often rush to their primary care physician, fearing that they have a serious condition. The doctor's reassurance that it is nothing does nothing to calm their nerves. They then switch doctors because they suspect their physician has missed something major. There are also a few who avoid simple check-ups and investigations due to the fear of being diagnosed with a chronic disease.\n\n【2】The person might not show any physical signs or symptoms, or they believe that even a small symptom is a sign of a serious underlying health condition. The thought that something is wrong with them and the anxiety that accompanies can even disrupt the person's life. It is a chronic condition that can either go away or become intense with age. It usually increases during periods of stress. Psychotherapy and medication might help the person feel better.\n\n【3】What Is Hypochondriasis?\n------------------------\n\n【4】IAD was previously referred to as hypochondriasis, but The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) that was published by the American Psychiatric Association does not include hypochondriasis or hypochondria as a diagnosis anymore. The term has now been changed to illness anxiety disorder. In this disorder, the person interprets uncomfortable or unusual physical sensations as a sign of some serious medical condition.\n\n【5】A similar condition called somatic symptom disorder focuses on a particular symptom and its disabling capacity, rather than worrying that the symptom is due to a specific illness.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Illness Anxiety Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】**The symptoms of IAS are:**\n\n【8】*   Being paranoid about a specific disease (e.g., cancer), organ (e.g., brain) or system (e.g., digestive system).\n    \n*   Persistently checking/examining the body for alarming signs.\n    \n*   Rushing to the doctor repeatedly in spite of reassurance.\n    \n*   Avoiding hospital visits due to worry that disease will be diagnosed.\n    \n*   Insisting the doctor for a treatment or prescription when neither is necessary.\n    \n*   Either the symptom mentioned is not present, or even if it is, is only mild.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    How to convince my wife to see a psychiatrist?\n    \n    Stress in a Broad Perspective - More Than Merely a Mental Illness!!\n    \n    I have anxiety disorder and was prescribed with 5mg lorazapam. But this dosage gives poor response. Is it safe to take one more tablet?\n    \n*   In the case of chronic illness, their concern is out of proportion; that is, they feel sicker than they really are.\n    \n*   Reading medical articles and researching extensively about the perceived condition.\n    \n\n【9】What Are the Causes of Illness Anxiety Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Doctors are not sure what exactly causes health anxiety, but the following factors seem to play a role:\n\n【11】*   When people do not properly understand their symptoms and diseases, which makes them believe that their body's sensations are due to a serious disease. This makes people go and look for some evidence that proves their suspicion.\n    \n*   A bad experience dealing with a childhood illness. This makes the person scared of any physical sensations as an adult.\n    \n*   If you or a family member is excessively worried about their or your health.\n    \n\n【12】### Risk Factors:\n\n【13】Some of the factors that increase the risk of IAD are:\n\n【14】1.  People who are in their early or middle adulthood.\n    \n2.  Older adults are more scared of developing memory problems than anything else.\n    \n3.  Severe stress.\n    \n4.  Serious childhood illness.\n    \n5.  A family history of genetic disorders.\n    \n6.  History of abuse or assault.\n    \n7.  Loss of a loved one.\n    \n8.  Excessively searching the net for various illnesses.\n    \n\n【15】How Does a Doctor Diagnose Illness Anxiety Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】IAD usually starts in early adulthood or soon after losing a loved one to the disease.\n\n【17】Their physician suspects IAD when the person's complaints and history do not co-relate to their clinical findings. They are then referred to a mental health specialist, although, more often than not, he/she refuses to consult one. The symptoms may also be reported by a close friend or family member. Other signs to note are visiting multiple doctors without any conclusive findings.\n\n【18】A doctor will diagnose this condition based on the following criteria marked by the American Psychiatric Association:\n\n【19】1.  Obsessed with the thought of having or developing a serious illness.\n    \n2.  Exhibiting no or very mild symptoms.\n    \n3.  Obsessed about an existing medical condition.\n    \n4.  Exhibiting unhealthy and unreasonable behaviors, such as:\n    \n    1.  Checking self again and again for some disease.\n        \n    2.  Looking up symptoms and diseases online.\n        \n    3.  Avoiding diagnosis by refusing to go to a doctor.\n        \n    4.  Thinking about an illness for at least six months or more.\n        \n\n【20】What Are the Treatment Options for Illness Anxiety Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The hardest part of treating hypochondriasis is to get the patient to believe that their problem is more mental than physical. Since the physical symptoms they feel are very realistic, it is difficult for them to accept that there is no ailment. It is thus important for the doctor to deal with it correctly without brushing off the patient's concerns. This disorder is fairly common, and fortunately, physicians know how to provide assurance in a proper way. The most accepted treatment is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).\n\n【22】What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】The person is taught strategies to cope with their anxiety. This includes multiple sessions that are designed to gradually reduce their anxiety by exposing them to their fears as well as replacing their negative thoughts with positive ones. It includes:\n\n【24】*   Exposure and response prevention.\n    \n*   Cognitive restructuring.\n    \n*   Relaxation training.\n    \n\n【25】What Are the Complications of Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAS)?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】If left untreated, IAD can lead to:\n\n【27】1.  Family or relationship problems due to excessive worrying, which can potentially frustrate others.\n    \n2.  Money problems due to frequent hospital visits, which can be very expensive.\n    \n3.

{"seq_id": "ed539cc0-98ec-4876-a17a-15e652174e09", "title": "Bortezomib - Uses, Dosages, Side Effects, and Mechanism of Action", "text": "【0】Bortezomib - Uses, Dosages, Side Effects, and Mechanism of Action\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Bortezomib is used as an injection in the therapy of cases with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is a fast-growing kind of cancer that initiates in the immune system cells. Bortezomib is in a category of medicines known as Antineoplastic agents. It functions by destroying cancer cells.\n\n【2】**Describe Bortezomib**\n\n【3】Bortezomib is used for injection and is an antineoplastic agent delivered for intravenous (IV) usage only. Bortezomib is a revised form of dipeptidyl boronic acid. The outcome is delivered as a mannitol boronic ester which, in reformed form, includes the mannitol ester in equilibrium with its hydrolysis outcome, the monomeric boronic acid. The medication substance lives in its cyclic anhydride structure as a trimeric Boroxine. The molecular weight of Bortezomib is 384.24. The solubility of Bortezomib, in the form of monomeric boronic acid, in water is 3.3 mg per mL to 3.8 mg per mL in a pH (potential of hydrogen) range of two to six and a half.\n\n【4】**Dosage and Administration:**\n\n【5】*   **Dosage in Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma** \\- Bortezomib is taken as a three to five-second bolus IV injection in a mixture with Melphalan and Prednisone orally for six to nine-week therapy cycles. In cycles one to cycle four, Bortezomib is taken two times per week, that is, on days one, four, eight, eleven, twenty-two, twenty-five, twenty-nine, and thirty-two. In cycles five to nine, Bortezomib is taken one time per week, that is, from days one, eight, 22, and 29. At least 72 hours should elapse between successive doses of Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Dose Modification Guidelines for Combination Therapy With Bortezomib, Melphalan, and Prednisone** - Before beginning any cycle of treatment with Bortezomib together with Melphalan and Prednisone: The platelet count must be greater than or equal to 70 x 109 /L, and the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) should be greater than or equal to 1.0 x 109 /L. Non-hematological toxicities could have settled to grade 1 or baseline.\n    \n\n【6】**Toxicity**\n\n【7】*   Hematological toxicity at the time of a cycle, if extended Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding is present in the last cycle, then regard deduction of the Melphalan dosage by 25 % in the following cycle.\n    \n*   If the platelet count is less than or equal to 30 × 109 /L or ANC less than or equal to 0.75 x 109 /L on a Bortezomib dosing day different than day one. In this condition, Bortezomib dosage should be withheld.\n    \n*   If several Bortezomib doses in successive cycles are withheld because of the toxicity, then the Bortezomib dose might be decreased by one dose level, that is, from 1.3 mg/m2 to one mg/m2 or from 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2.\n    \n*   If the grade is greater than or equal to three non-hematological toxicities, then Bortezomib treatment must be withheld until the toxicity symptoms have settled to grade 1 or baseline. Then, Bortezomib may be restarted with one dose level deduction that is from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2 or from 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2. For Bortezomib-associated neuropathic ache or peripheral neuropathy, stop or modify Bortezomib.\n    \n\n【8】*   **Dosage in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma** - Bortezomib in 1.3 mg/m2 per dose is accepted as a three to five-second bolus intravenous injection two times a week for two weeks, then by a ten day rest period. For elongated treatment of more than eight cycles, Bortezomib may be taken on the standard timetable or on a maintenance schedule of one week for four weeks, obeyed by a 13-day rest time.\n    \n*   **Dose Modification Guidelines for Relapsed Multiple Myeloma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma** - The treatment should be withheld at the beginning of any grade 3 non-hematological or grade 4 hematological toxicities except neuropathy. Once the manifestation of the toxicity has settled, Bortezomib treatment may be restarted at a 25 % lesser dose. Cases with preexisting painful neuropathy must be managed with Bortezomib only after a cautious risk-benefit examination.\n    \n*   **Administration Precautions** - The medicine quantity included in one vial is 3.5 mg may increase the normal dose needed. Cautiousness must be utilized in estimating the dose to control overdose. Bortezomib is an antineoplastic. Approaches for appropriate handling and disposal must be regarded.\n    \n*   **Reconstitution/Preparation for Intravenous Administration** - Appropriate aseptic method should be utilized. Reconstitute with 3.5 mL of 0.9 percent of sodium chloride, resulting in a conclusive concentration of 1 mg/mL of Bortezomib. The reconstituted derivative must be a transparent and colorless solution. Parenteral medication products should be examined visually for particulate matter and discoloration before intake whenever solution and receptacle permit. The reconstituted product should not be utilized if any coloration or particulate matter is marked.\n    \n\n【9】Bortezomib possesses no antimicrobial preservative. Reconstituted Bortezomib must be taken within eight hours of preparation. Bortezomib might be reserved at 25ºC when reconstituted as mandated. The reconstituted substance may be held in the original vial and the syringe before administration. The derivative may be reserved for up to eight hours in a syringe; nevertheless, the total storage period for the reconstituted substances must not be more than eight hours when disclosed to regular indoor lighting.\n\n【10】**Dosage Forms and Strengths:**\n\n【11】Each single-use vial possesses 3.5 mg of Bortezomib as a sterile lyophilized powder.\n\n【12】**Contraindications:**\n\n【13】Bortezomib is contraindicated in cases with hypersensitivity to boron or mannitol.\n\n【14】Related Topics\n\n【15】* * *\n\n【16】How to treat a person who has multiple myeloma along with kidney failure?\n\n【17】Mantle Cell Lymphomas - Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【18】Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease - Causes, Clinical Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment\n\n【19】**Warnings and Precautions:**\n\n【20】Bortezomib should be taken under the management of a physician who is an expert in the usage of antineoplastic treatment. Complete blood counts must be observed continually during therapy with Bortezomib.\n\n【21】**Use in Pregnancy**\n\n【22】*   **Pregnancy Category D** - Females of childbearing possibility should evade becoming pregnant at the time of being in therapy with Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Peripheral Neuropathy**: Bortezomib therapy induces a peripheral neuropathy that is primarily sensory. Nevertheless, cases of intense sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Cases with preexisting manifestations like numbness, ache, or a burning sensation in the feet or hands or indications of peripheral neuropathy may experience deteriorating peripheral neuropathy at the time of therapy with Bortezomib. So in these cases, patients should be closely monitored for the manifestations.\n    \n*   **Hypotension**: The incidence of hypotension was 13 %. These circumstances are watched throughout treatment. Cautiousness should be utilized when managing patients with a previous history of syncope, cases receiving medicines known to be connected with hypotension, and cases who are dehydrated. Treatment of orthostatic hypotension or postural hypotension may possess alteration of antihypertensive medicines, hydration, and intake of mineralocorticoids or sympathomimetics.\n    \n*   **Cardiac Disorders:** Acute development or worsening of congestive heart failure and the recent beginning of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction have been notified, involving information in cases with no hazard elements for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Cases with risk elements for or existing heart disorders must be closely observed.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Disorders:** There has been information on the acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorder of unrecognized etiology, like pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in cases taking Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome:** There has been information on reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in patients taking Bortezomib. A brain imaging test, particularly MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), is utilized to verify the diagnosis. In case of developing reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, discontinue Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Gastrointestinal Adverse Events:** Bortezomib therapy can induce nausea, diarrhea or constipation, and vomiting. Fluid and electrolyte replacement should be given to control dehydration.\n    \n*   **Thrombocytopenia or Neutropenia:** Bortezomib is connected with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that has a cyclical pattern with nadirs emerging following the final dosage of each cycle and generally regaining before initiation of the succeeding cycle.\n    \n\n【23】1.  **Tumor Lysis Syndrome:** As Bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can easily destroy malignant cells, complications of tumor lysis syndrome may happen. Cases at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with increased tumor burden before therapy.\n    \n2.  **Hepatic Events:** Acute liver failure has been notified in cases taking multiple concomitant medicines and with severe underlying medical illnesses. Additional documented hepatic circumstances possess boosts in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and hepatitis condition.\n    \n\n【24】**For Patients:**\n-----------------\n\n【25】**What Is Multiple Myeloma?**\n-----------------------------\n\n【26】Multiple myeloma is a cancer that begins in a kind of white blood cell known as a plasma cell. Healthy plasma cells support fighting infections by producing antibodies that identify and attack germs. Cancerous plasma cells collect in the bone marrow and group healthy blood cells in this case. Rather than creating useful antibodies, the cancer cells create abnormal proteins that can generate complications.\n\n【27】**How Should Bortezomib Be Used?**\n----------------------------------\n\n【28】Bortezomib is available as a solution to inject into a vein or subcutaneously under the skin. Bortezomib is provided by a doctor or nurse. The dosing schedule will rely on the condition, the additional medications that are used, and how well the body reacts to therapy.\n\n【29】**What Are the Precautions to Be Followed While Taking Bortezomib?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】**Before Taking Bortezomib:**\n\n【31】*   Inform the doctor and healthcare provider in case of allergy to Bortezomib, Mannitol, other medications, Boron, or any of the components in Bortezomib. Request the healthcare provider for an ingredient list.\n    \n*   Inform the doctor and pharmacist what additional prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, or nutritional supplements they are taking or intend to take. Be certain to say any of the following: Clarithromycin, certain antifungals, medicines to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, specific medicines to manage human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), particular medicines to manage seizures. The doctor may require altering medication doses or observing carefully for adverse effects. Many additional medicines may also interact with Bortezomib, so be certain to inform the doctor about all the medicines that are taken, even those that do not seem on this list.\n    \n*   Inform the doctor if any herbal products are taken, particularly St. John's wort.\n    \n*   Inform the doctor if there is any familial history of heart disease, herpes infection, diabetes, high cholesterol, altered blood pressure, peripheral neuropathy, kidney disease, or liver disease. Also, inform the doctor if there is any habit of smoking or drinking large amounts of alcohol.\n    \n*   Inform the doctor in case of pregnancy or intend to become pregnant. Bortezomib may hurt the fetus. Usage of birth control to avert pregnancy during treatment with Bortezomib and for at least seven months following the final dosage is required.\n    \n*   Do not breastfeed at the time of therapy with Bortezomib and for two months following the final dose.\n    \n*   In case of undergoing any kind of surgery involving dental surgery, inform the doctor or dentist about Bortezomib.\n    \n*   The patient should have knowledge that Bortezomib may cause drowsiness and lightheaded or induce fainting or altered vision.\n    \n\n【32】**What Should Special Dietary Instructions Be Followed While Taking Bortezomib?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Inform the doctor about consuming grapefruit and ingesting grapefruit juice while utilizing this medicine.\n    \n*   Drink an abundance of fluids daily at the time of therapy with Bortezomib, particularly if the patient vomits or has diarrhea.\n    \n\n【34】What Should Be Done in Case of a Forgotten Dose?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】In case of a missed appointment to acquire a dose of Bortezomib, contact the doctor immediately.\n\n【36】**What Are the Side Effects of Bortezomib?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Bortezomib may induce side effects. Inform the doctor if any of these manifestations, or those in the certain precautions section, are intense or do not go away:\n\n【38】*   Weakness.\n    \n*   Fatigue.\n    \n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Diarrhea, constipation, and loss of appetite.\n    \n*   Aches in head and stomach.\n    \n*   Aches, redness, and bleeding at the injection site.\n    \n*   Trouble falling asleep.\n    \n\n【39】Some side effects can be severe. If one undergoes any of these manifestations, contact the doctor instantly:\n\n【40】*   Weakness in the extremities, alterations in the sense of touch, aches, burning, and numbness in the hands, arms, and legs.\n    \n*   Sudden shooting ache, continuous burning ache, or muscle weakness.\n    \n*   The difficulty of breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, pale skin, and tiredness.\n    \n*   Swelling of the feet, ankles, or lower legs.\n    \n*   Hives, skin rash, itching.\n    \n*   Hoarseness, hardship in swallowing or breathing, or swelling.\n    \n*   Fever, chills, cough, or additional manifestations of infection.\n    \n*   Bleeding.\n    \n*   Black-colored stools, red blood in the stools, bloody vomit, coffee ground-like material in the vomitus.\n    \n*   Altered speech or incapability to speak or comprehend speech, confusion, failure of the capability to move a body part, altered vision, coordination loss.\n    \n*   Fainting, dizziness, and nausea.\n    \n*   Chest pressure or ache, rapid heartbeat, inflammation of the ankles or feet, or shortness of breath.\n    \n*   Cough and difficulty breathing.\n    \n*   Headache, seizures, fatigue, or vision alteration.\n    \n*   Purple dots under the skin.\n    \n\n【41】**How Is Bortezomib Stored and Disposed of?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Bortezomib will be stored in the medical hospital or clinic.\n\n【43】**How Is Bortezomib Overdose Managed?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【44】In the matter of overdose, contact the poison control helpline. If the patient has collapsed, had a seizure, has difficulty breathing, or cannot be aroused, instantly call emergency services. Manifestation of overdose may involve the following:\n\n【45】*   Fainting and dizziness.\n    \n*   Altered vision.\n    \n*   Unusual bleeding.\n    \n\n【46】**For Doctors:**\n----------------\n\n【47】**Adverse Reactions:**\n\n【48】*   **Peripheral Neuropathy** \\- The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was increased among cases with mantle cell lymphoma and corresponded to multiple myeloma\n    \n*   **Hypotension Cases -** The incidence of hypotension was comparable in cases with multiple myeloma and those with mantle cell lymphoma.\n    \n*   **Cardiac Disorders -** Angina pectoris, atrial flutter, bradycardia, sinus arrest, amyloidosis, total atrioventricular block, ischemia, myocardial infarction, and pericardial effusion.\n    \n*   **Thrombocytopenia or Neutropenia -** Bortezomib-associated thrombocytopenia was distinguished by a reduction in platelet count at the time of the dosing period and a retrieval toward baseline at the time of the ten-day rest period at each therapy cycle. Neutrophil counts declined during the Bortezomib dosing period and returned toward baseline during the tenth-day rest period during each therapy cycle.\n    \n\n【49】**Drug Interactions:**\n\n【50】*   **Ketoconazole -** Co-administration of Ketoconazole, which is a potent CYP3A inhibitor, improved the exposure of Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Melphalan-Prednisone -** Co-administration of Melphalan-Prednisone raised the exposure of Bortezomib. Nevertheless, this boost is improbable to be clinically relevant.\n    \n*   **Omeprazole -** Co-administration of Omeprazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19, had no impact on the exposure of Bortezomib.\n    \n*   **Cytochrome P450 -** Patients who concomitantly receive Bortezomib and medications that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 should be closely observed for either toxicities or decreased efficacy.\n    \n\n【51】**Use in Specific Populations:**\n\n【52】*   **Pregnancy -** There are no satisfactory and well-controlled investigations on pregnant women. If Bortezomib is utilized during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while acquiring this medication, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n    \n*   **Nursing Mothers** \\- It is unknown whether Bortezomib is secreted in human milk. As many medications are secreted in human milk, and because of the possibility of severe adverse reactions in nursing infants from Bortezomib, a determination should be created whether to stop nursing or to stop the medication, taking into consideration the significance of the medication to the mother.\n    \n*   **Geriatric Use -** Not many differences are noticed, but the increased sensitivity of certain older people cannot be ruled out.\n    \n*   **Patients With Renal Impairment -** The pharmacokinetics of Bortezomib are not affected by the degree of renal impairment. Thus, dosing alteration of Bortezomib is not required for cases with renal insufficiency. Since dialysis may decrease Bortezomib concentrations, the medicine should be taken after the dialysis process.\n    \n*   **Patients With Diabetes -** Patients on oral antidiabetic drugs obtaining Bortezomib therapy may demand close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and alteration of the dose of their antidiabetic drug.\n    \n\n【53】**Clinical Pharmacology**\n\n【54】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【55】Bortezomib has a chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome reversible inhibitor in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a big protein complex that impairs ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential in controlling the intracellular concentration of particular proteins, thereby keeping homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome controls this targeted proteolysis, which can impact multiple signaling cascades in the cell. This disturbance of normal homeostatic mechanisms can guide cell death. Investigations have explained that Bortezomib is cytotoxic to various cancer cell kinds in vitro. Bortezomib induces a delay in tumor development in vivo in nonclinical tumor standards involving multiple myeloma.\n\n【56】**Pharmacodynamics**\n\n【57】After two weeks of administration of one mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, Bortezomib doses in complete blood were checked five minutes following medicine administration. Relative maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was checked between one and 1.3 mg/m2 doses. Maximal inhibition varied from 70 to 84 % and from 73 to 83 % for the one mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose regimens, respectively.\n\n【58】**Nonclinical Toxicology**\n\n【59】*   **Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility** - Carcinogenicity investigations have not been performed with Bortezomib. Bortezomib exhibited clastogenic action in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay utilizing Chinese hamster ovary cells. It was not genotoxic when experimented with in mice in the in vitro mutagenicity assay and in vivo micronucleus assay.\n    \n*   **Animal Toxicology** - Investigations in monkeys demonstrated that administration of dosages around twice the suggested clinical dose induces heart rate elevations, heeded by profound progressive hypotension, bradycardia, and even death 12 to 14 hours post-dose.\n    \n\n【60】Article Resources\n\n【61】*   Bortezomib  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607007.html\n*   Bortezomib in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1936263/\n*   Bortezomib in multiple myeloma: systematic review and clinical considerations  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4117625/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "48d7c61d-297b-4aaf-9cb3-216df7b5369b", "title": "Nongonococcal Urethritis - An Overview", "text": "【0】Nongonococcal Urethritis - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The urethra is a tube through which urine leaves the body. Inflammation of the urethra is called urethritis. When the cause of urethritis is a sexually transmitted infection other than gonorrhea, it is termed nongonococcal urethritis. Nongonococcal urethritis is also called non-specific urethritis when the cause is not known. Nongonococcal urethritis is more common in men than women.\n\n【2】What Is Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Inflammation of the tube urethra that carries urine outside the body is called the urethra. When sexually transmitted infections other than gonorrhea cause urethritis, it is called nongonococcal urethritis. The infection is transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The causes are divided into two categories:\n\n【6】*   **Sexual Causes:** Sexually transmitted infections are the leading cause of nongonococcal urethritis. The bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the causative agents. Around 15 % to 40 % of nongonococcal urethritis cases are caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Mycoplasma genitalium is the second most common, accounting for 15 % to 20 % of the nongonococcal urethritis cases. Lesser common causes include Herpes simplex virus, Epstein Barr virus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Adenovirus. Enteric bacteria rarely cause nongonococcal urethritis in individuals who practice insertive anal intercourse. In 50 % of the nongonococcal urethritis cases, the etiology is unknown.\n    \n*   **Nonsexual Causes:** The nonsexual causes are:\n    \n\n【7】Phimosis is a condition that affects both adults and children who have not undergone circumcision. It involves the foreskin on the head or glans of the penis and can not be retracted or pulled back. The penis appears to have rings on its tip. Phimosis is usually asymptomatic and only presents symptoms in severe cases with an opening the size of a pinhole. Phimosis can be divided into two groups:\n\n【8】**Physiologic:** This type is associated with children and resolves with age.\n\n【9】**Pathologic Type:** This is associated with the condition balanitis xerotica obliterans (scarred and inflamed head of the penis).\n\n【10】Catheterization is one of the non-sexual causes. In this procedure, a tube is inserted into the penis.\n\n【11】Who Are the Population at Risk for Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Men are more prone to acquiring nongonococcal urethritis than women because of the anatomical consideration of the male urethra. The centers for disease control and prevention have stated that rates of chlamydia infection are two times higher in females than males. Adolescents and young adults from fifteen to thirty years of age are commonly affected. Having multiple sexual partners is also prone to acquiring nongonococcal urethritis.\n\n【13】What Are the Symptoms of Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The symptoms involve:\n\n【15】*   Pruritus (uncomfortable, irritating sensation causing an urge to itch).\n    \n*   Dysuria (difficult or painful urination).\n    \n*   Penile burning (burning sensation in the penis).\n    \n*   **Urethral Discharge:** Discharges may be noted in scant or stains in the undergarment.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    How to confirm HIV?\n    \n\n【16】Around 40 % of the cases of nongonococcal urethritis are asymptomatic. Symptoms caused by herpes simplex virus nongonococcal urethritis are:\n\n【17】*   Regional lymphadenopathy.\n    \n*   Constitutional symptoms (headache, fever, anorexia, and myalgia).\n    \n*   Vesicles having urethritis.\n    \n\n【18】Penile discharges of nongonococcal urethritis appear clear or mucoid, whereas gonococcal urethritis has purulent discharge. Symptoms of severe cases include:\n\n【19】*   Testicular pain.\n    \n*   Testicular swelling.\n    \n*   Infertility.\n    \n*   Sore throat.\n    \n*   Rectal pain.\n    \n*   Rectal discharge.\n    \n\n【20】What Are the Complications of Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Complications involve:\n\n【22】*   Epiphydimitis (inflammation of the rope-like structure near the testicles).\n    \n*   Abscess formation.\n    \n*   Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland).\n    \n*   Reactive arthritis (swelling and joint pain caused by infections in other parts of the body).\n    \n*   Skin lesions.\n    \n*   Lymphogranuloma venerum.\n    \n\n【23】Complications are more common in women than men. Complications in women involve:\n\n【24】*   Vaginitis caused due to yeast infection.\n    \n*   Mucopurulent cervicitis (cervix infection) causes unusual bleeding during periods, vaginal discharge, and pain during sexual intercourse.\n    \n\n【25】If left untreated, nongonococcal urethritis will cause infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n【26】Children born to mothers infected with chlamydia urethritis have the following symptoms:\n\n【27】*   Iritis.\n    \n*   Pneumonia.\n    \n*   Conjunctivitis.\n    \n\n【28】How to Evaluate Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】Nongonococcal urethritis is diagnosed based on its discharges:\n\n【30】*   Mucopurulent, purulent, or mucoid discharges.\n    \n*   Urethral secretions in gram staining depict equally to two white blood cells per oil immersion field.\n    \n*   Urine analysis that shows a positive leukocyte esterase test or ten white blood cells per high power field examined from the sediments of spun first void urine.\n    \n\n【31】To diagnose nongonococcal urethritis, gonococcal urethritis should be first ruled out. This can be done by negative gonorrhea tests such as culture and nucleic acid testing. It can also be ruled out by gram stain, which lacks gram-negative diplococci. A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) can be performed for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The nucleic acid amplification test has a high rate of specificity and sensitivity and hence should be recommended over culture tests.\n\n【32】What Is the Treatment for Nongonococcal Urethritis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Empiric treatment for nongonococcal urethritis is started at diagnosis.\n\n【34】**Regimen for Presumptive Treatment for Nongonococcal Urethritis:**\n\n【35】1.  Single-dose oral Azithromycin 1 gram.\n    \n2.  Oral Doxycyclin 100 mg two times a day for seven days.\n    \n\n【36】Azithromycin and Doxycycline are used for the treatment of chlamydial urethritis.\n\n【37】**Regimen for Nongonococcal Urethritis Without a Microscope:**\n\n【38】1.  Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM.\n    \n2.  Single-dose oral Azithromycin 1 gram.\n    \n3.  Oral Doxycyclin 100 mg two times a day for seven days.\n    \n\n【39】Persistent nongonococcal urethritis, even after following a treatment regimen, is quite common. The individual with recurring nongonococcal urethritis may show symptoms such as discharge on examination, leukocyte esterase in urine analysis, and an elevated white blood cell on microscopic examination. The common cause of recurrence is M.genitalium, and treatment should focus on it.\n\n【40】The regimen involves:\n\n【41】1.  Single-dose oral Azithromycin 1 gram, if it was not used priorly.\n    \n2.  Moxifloxacin 400 mg orally for seven days if Azithromycin was used priorly.\n    \n3.

The development of the collateral arteries occurs in cases of congenital heart defects.\n\n【2】What Are Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   The major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, also known as MAPCAs or systemic-to-pulmonary collaterals, are abnormal blood vessels that develop in individuals with certain congenital heart defects.\n    \n*   Normally, the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, picking up oxygen and returning it to the heart to be pumped to the rest of the body. However, in some cases, the pulmonary arteries may be underdeveloped or completely absent. When this happens, blood can not flow to the lungs as it should, and the body compensates by developing alternative routes for blood to reach the lungs.\n    \n*   MAPCAs are those alternative routes. They are arteries originating from the aorta or other systemic arteries and connecting to the pulmonary arteries or lung tissue, allowing blood to bypass the underdeveloped or absent pulmonary arteries and reach the lungs.\n    \n\n【4】In Which Conditions Are the Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries Seen?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】These collaterals provide an alternative route for blood to flow from the systemic circulation (the aorta and its branches) into the lungs, bypassing normal pulmonary circulation.\n\n【6】MAPCAs can occur in a variety of congenital heart defects, including:\n\n【7】*   **Tetralogy of Fallot:** This is a heart defect characterized by a combination of four abnormalities, including a ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. MAPCAs may develop as a compensatory mechanism in response to pulmonary stenosis, restricting lung blood flow.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Atresia With a Ventricular Septal Defect:** In this defect, the pulmonary valve is completely blocked or absent, preventing blood from flowing into the lungs. As a result, MAPCAs may develop to provide an alternative route for blood to reach the lungs.\n    \n*   **Double Outlet Right Ventricle:** This is a defect in the pulmonary artery and the aorta arising from the right ventricle. In some cases, MAPCAs may develop to provide additional blood flow to the lungs.\n    \n*   **Transposition of the Great Arteries:** In this defect, the aorta and pulmonary artery positions are switched so that the left ventricle gives way to the pulmonary artery. In contrast, the right ventricle gives way to the aorta. MAPCAs may develop to provide additional blood flow to the lungs, which is necessary for survival.\n    \n\n【8】Overall, the development of MAPCAs is a complex process involving various signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. The formation of these collaterals can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on circulation, and their management requires careful evaluation and treatment by a team of specialists.\n\n【9】What Are the Types of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) are extra blood vessels that develop in the lungs in some congenital heart defects, particularly in the condition known as pulmonary atresia with the ventricular septal defect. Different types of MAPCAs can vary in origin, course, distribution, and relationship with other blood vessels. Here are some of the main types:\n\n【11】*   **Systemic to Pulmonary Artery Collaterals:** These MAPCAs arise from the systemic arteries (such as the subclavian or bronchial arteries) and supply blood to the pulmonary circulation. They can have a direct or indirect connection to the pulmonary arteries.\n    \n*   **Aortic Arch Collaterals:** These MAPCAs arise from the aortic arch or branches and supply blood to pulmonary circulation. They can include the left subclavian artery, the innominate artery, or the descending thoracic aorta.\n    \n*   **Ductus Arteriosus Collaterals:** These MAPCAs arise from the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel that normally closes shortly after birth. They can supply blood to the pulmonary arteries or systemic circulation.\n    \n*   **Coronary to Pulmonary Artery Collaterals:** These MAPCAs arise from the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. They can have a direct or indirect connection to the pulmonary arteries.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Artery Collaterals:** These MAPCAs arise from the pulmonary arteries themselves and supply blood to other areas of the lungs that are not receiving adequate blood flow.\n    \n\n【12】The anatomy of MAPCAs can be complex and variable, and their identification and management require specialized imaging and treatment techniques.\n\n【13】What Is the Diagnosis of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The diagnosis of MAPCAs is typically made through imaging tests such as echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or cardiac CT. These tests can visualize abnormal blood vessels and show how they are connected to the aorta and pulmonary arteries. The diagnosis may also involve a cardiac catheterization procedure, which allows a more detailed evaluation of the blood vessels and can sometimes be used to treat the condition.\n\n【15】What Is the Treatment of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   These abnormal blood vessels can affect the normal blood flow to the lungs, leading to respiratory distress, heart failure, and other serious complications.\n    \n*   The treatment of MAPCAs depends on the specific type and severity of the heart defect, as well as the age and overall health of the patient. The treatment options for MAPCAs include surgical repair, interventional catheterization, or a combination.\n    \n*   Surgical repair of MAPCAs may involve either complete repair of the underlying heart defect or isolation and ligation of the MAPCAs. In some cases, a combination of both approaches may be necessary. The specific surgical technique will depend on the patient's case.\n    \n*   Interventional catheterization may be used to treat MAPCAs in some cases, particularly in younger patients or unsuitable for surgery. The surgery involves placing a catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the MAPCAs. The MAPCAs are then treated with various techniques, including balloon angioplasty, stent placement, or embolization.\n    \n*   Overall, treating MAPCAs requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of experienced cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and other healthcare professionals. Treatment aims to optimize blood flow to the lungs and prevent complications associated with MAPCAs.\n    \n\n【17】**Conclusion:**\n\n【18】However, MAPCAs can also lead to complications like heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory infections. In some cases, treatment of MAPCAs may involve surgical or catheter-based interventions to address any potential issues. Overall, the presence of MAPCAs requires careful evaluation by a healthcare provider with experience in congenital heart disease management. The treatment approach will depend on the specific case and may involve a combination of medical therapy and interventions to address complications.\n\n【19】Article Resources\n\n【20】*   Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8893210/\n*   Angiographic Anatomy of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries and Association With Early Surgical Outcomes in Tetralogy  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.120.017981\n*   Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries  \n    https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryct.210157", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "85f1e7a9-a302-426c-8f56-bd020f328a4c", "title": "The Effects of Weed on the Brain: Short and Long-Term Consequences", "text": "【0】The Effects of Weed on the Brain: Short and Long-Term Consequences\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Weed is among many colloquial terms for dried, cured flowers from any plant in the cannabis family. This herbal substance is frequently ground, milled, or otherwise broken up before being rolled into cigarettes, cigars, or smoked in various pipes. Weed is one of the most commonly abused drugs in the United States, trailing only more socially acceptable substances like alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.\n\n【2】The most recent threat of weed has come in the form of new legislation and laws in many cities and states worldwide, allowing and regulating the use of weed in the same way alcohol is allowed and regulated. This has increased the availability of marijuana and increased the risk of addiction to unprecedented levels. Retail marijuana stores, also known as 'dispensaries,' appear to be opening on every street in every town in America. Users are offered a wide range of weed varieties with varying effects, flavors, and purposes. Some establishments even sell weed-infused food products known as 'edibles,' which can be dangerous for users who have never tried them before.\n\n【3】How Does Weed Work?\n-------------------\n\n【4】THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, is a highly potent chemical that has an immediate effect. Once in the body, THC binds to and slows communication between cannabinoid receptors, which are primarily found in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These brain regions, which control unconscious muscle movements, coordination, and memory, are also the ones that suffer the most long-term effects.\n\n【5】The system on which marijuana has an effect is known as the endocannabinoid (EC) system. It affects nearly every part of the brain, including the amygdala (emotion regulation), the brain stem (pain sensitivity), and the hypothalamus (hunger and sexual impulses), all of which are responsible for the classic symptoms of a marijuana high.\n\n【6】Can Weed Kill Brain Cells?\n--------------------------\n\n【7】Medicinal and recreational marijuana use is becoming more common in the United States, with more states legalizing the substance each year, raising concerns about the drug's effects on the brain. Prolonged exposure to and abuse of substances such as heroin, meth, and alcohol can cause irreversible brain damage, especially when abuse begins in childhood. There are some pieces of evidence to suggest that marijuana abuse is similar.\n\n【8】The primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC attaches to the brain's cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid receptor type 1 or CB1 receptor) when someone smokes or consumes marijuana, affecting hippocampal neurons, the region of the brain that controls appetite, pain regulation, mood, and memory. As a result, the person using marijuana has a reduced ability to focus and recall important information. In addition, memory and concentration can be impaired depending on how much marijuana is smoked and for how long. Basic motor skills can also deteriorate, making tasks like driving more difficult and potentially dangerous.\n\n【9】Despite the cognitive impairment caused by marijuana use, scientists are divided about the long-term effects of marijuana on the brain. According to some studies, regular marijuana use in adolescence is associated with a lower volume of specific brain regions involved in a wide range of executive functions such as learning, memory, and impulse control compared to non-users. Other studies have found no significant structural differences in the brains of people who use and do not use the drug.\n\n【10】There is a temporary effect on brain cells, as with many substances; some die during consumption, but this is neither a consequential nor a permanent die-off. Almost all of the negative effects of marijuana are caused by smoking. Smoking causes the desired substance to be burned to consume the active compounds and produce several potentially toxic compounds, such as carbon monoxide, tar, and others. Inhaling these compounds and extremely hot smoke depletes oxygen in the blood and brain and kills brain cells.\n\n【11】Related Topics\n\n【12】* * *\n\n【13】Perinatal Substance Exposure - A Run-Through of Side Effects\n\n【14】Cannabis Use: Epidemiology, Pharmacology, Comorbidities, and Adverse Effects\n\n【15】Why am I behaving like a crazy person? Is it due to schizophrenia or Marijuana?\n\n【16】What Are the Effects of Weed on the Brain?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【17】**Effect Of Weed On IQ:**\n\n【18】Marijuana's effect on the brain is influenced by the amount smoked and the user's age. Individuals under the age of 25, whose brains are still developing, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of marijuana on the brain. A study of marijuana's effect on IQ (intelligence quotient) discovered that people who started using marijuana at a young age lost six to eight points by middle age. Furthermore, those who smoked marijuana during adolescence and then stopped did not regain their IQ points. Individuals who started using marijuana in their adulthood, on the other hand, did not experience any IQ loss.\n\n【19】**Effects of Synthetic Marijuana on the Brain:**\n\n【20】Synthetic marijuana, a man-made hallucinogenic substance that is typically sprayed onto plant material, is unsafe for human consumption but has grown in popularity in recent years. It is also known as \"fake weed,\" and it has mind-altering effects that can cause people to act strangely. Synthetic marijuana is illegal and may contain toxic ingredients that cause rapid heartbeat, unexplained bleeding, and vomiting.\n\n【21】Synthetic marijuana, like marijuana, affects the brain by binding to the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), which is found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Synthetic weed binds to CB1 receptors more strongly than THC, making it more potent in the brain. Because CB1 receptors are found in multiple locations throughout the brain, side effects can be severe and harmful.\n\n【22】Synthetic marijuana may cause the following effects on the brain and body:\n\n【23】*   Memory loss.\n    \n*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Psychosis.\n    \n*   Cardiovascular and respiratory issues.\n    \n*   Stroke.\n    \n*   Paranoia.\n    \n*   Hallucinations.\n    \n*   Euphoria or altered perception.\n    \n*   Violent behavior.\n    \n*   Kidney and brain dysfunction.\n    \n\n【24】Synthetic marijuana, in addition to the above symptoms, can be addictive to those who use it. Brain cell activity is likely to decline after prolonged use of synthetic marijuana, along with an increase in negative physiological symptoms such as those listed above.\n\n【25】**Short and Long-Term Effects of Weed on the Brain:**\n\n【26】Marijuana use has the following immediate and short-term effects on the brain:\n\n【27】*   Distance estimation difficulty.\n    \n*   Difficulty remembering.\n    \n*   Fatigue and confusion.\n    \n*   Paranoia.\n    \n*   Anxiety.\n    \n\n【28】Long-term consequences may include, but are not limited to:\n\n【29】*   Some degree of cognitive impairment.\n    \n*   Some memory loss.\n    \n*   Increased tolerance of marijuana.\n    \n*   Marijuana addiction.\n    \n\n【30】**Conclusion:**\n\n【31】Marijuana has calming effects on the individual, but when used excessively or in combination with other substances, it can be extremely harmful. Marijuana withdrawal can be difficult; if an individual is unable to stop or is endangering their life, detox, and treatment may be required. Individuals are removed from the triggers that cause a relapse during treatment. Meanwhile, counseling can assist patients in recovery by learning and understanding what they require the most. There is rehabilitation assistance available. Medications can help reduce marijuana cravings, and detox removes toxins from the body and restores it to health.\n\n【32】Article Resources\n\n【33】*   THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA  \n    https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/the-harmful-effects.html\n*   Does Marijuana Kill Brain Cells?  \n    https://recovered.org/marijuana/does-marijuana-kill-brain-cells\n*   Marijuana and Public Health  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects/brain-health.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Additionally, unemployment has social and economic consequences. The multiplier effect that unemployment has on the community increases the longer a person is unemployed, making them more likely to experience potential negative effects. In this article, we discuss what it means to be unemployed and the health effects of long-term unemployment.\n\n【2】**What Exactly Is Unemployment?**\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Unemployed people are those who do not have a job. This includes not working as an independent contractor, either part-time or full-time. Individuals who do not have a job but are actively seeking employment and are eligible for employment are also regarded as unemployed. Furthermore, those who are on a temporary layoff are considered unemployed, even if they anticipate being rehired for the same employment.\n\n【4】**What Are the Impacts of Being Unemployed?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Those who are unemployed may face several difficulties. These difficulties get more severe the longer a person is out of work. For individuals, common consequences of unemployment include:\n\n【6】*   **Reduced Income:** Reduced income for unemployed people is a direct outcome of their unemployment. Because a job pays earnings, being unemployed deducts these payments, leaving the individual with less accessible money. Individuals who are unemployed and have no other source of income frequently borrow money or use their savings to pay for necessities like food and living bills.\n    \n*   **Health Problems:** The physical health of a person can be significantly impacted by unemployment. Being unemployed is a very stressful condition, hence it could result in health problems. These health difficulties result in increased doctor visits and the usage of medicines to control health disorders. Unemployment might also increase a person's risk of future deterioration in health since they regularly skip health-related appointments to save money.\n    \n*   **Negative Familial Effects:** Family members of unemployed people are equally susceptible to the adverse impacts of unemployment. Compared to employed people, those who are unemployed have lower levels of family and marriage happiness and higher levels of family problems. The stress of unemployment might have a harmful effect on partners' well-being.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Sin Taxes - Taxes and Their Impact\n    \n    Chronic Diseases Handled by a Family Physician\n    \n    Are Dietary Supplements Necessary?\n    \n\n【7】*   **Mental Health Challenges:** According to studies, being unemployed raises one's likelihood of developing depressive symptoms. Anxiety is a common mental health issue for unemployed people. Compared to those who are employed, unemployed persons frequently have worse mental health.\n    \n\n【8】**How Does Unemployment Affect Mental Health?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Unemployment has often been demonstrated to have a negative impact on a variety of health outcomes. There are a number of ways that unemployment could have a negative impact on health:\n\n【10】*   By the stress and lower self-esteem caused by the loss of the routine of the job or the stigma attached to being unemployed.\n    \n*   Financial difficulties, insecurity, and lowered future earning potential cause stress in people that harm their health.\n    \n*   The social security system can harm mental health through the claims procedure, employment capacity tests, and job-seeking conditions.\n    \n\n【11】Long-term unemployment has been demonstrated to have negative effects on both physical and mental health, as well as life satisfaction. Pandemic limits have resulted in extended periods of low income, job loss, or unemployment, and the length of these circumstances is especially concerning. Policymakers' concern about unemployment, particularly among young people, arises in part from the long-term negative impact that unemployment may have on future earnings potential. However, research also indicates that youth unemployment may have long-term negative impacts on one's mental health.\n\n【12】**What Are the Health and Physical Consequences of Unemployment?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】It can be extremely difficult physically and mentally for many people to lose the sense of identity and control that having stable employment frequently gives, especially when it is added to a loss of income. As a result, unemployment has also been linked to the emergence or worsening of a number of health conditions, such as:\n\n【14】*   Diabetes.\n    \n*   High blood pressure.\n    \n*   Back pain.\n    \n*   Anxiety.\n    \n*   Heart disease.\n    \n*   Depression.\n    \n*   Headaches.\n    \n*   Insomnia and other sleep disorders.\n    \n\n【15】**What Are the Effects of Unemployment on Society and Economy?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   **Effects of Unemployment on Society:** Unemployment has an impact on the community and society in which the unemployed person lives. An unemployed person does not usually have a large impact on society. High unemployment rates lead to higher poverty rates and worsen neighborhoods, amplifying the societal impact of unemployment. Communities with high rates of unemployment are more likely to have few job possibilities, poor housing, fewer recreational opportunities, restricted access to public services and transportation, and failing schools.\n    \n*   **Effects of Unemployment on the Economy:** Unemployment has direct implications on the economy as a whole to have an influence on individuals and society. People spend less money while they are unemployed, which eventually results in a lower contribution to the economy in terms of services or goods produced and sold. Unemployed people have less purchasing power, which can lead to employment losses for those who make the products that these people buy.\n    \n\n【17】**What Are the Tips for Unemployed Individuals?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Although being unemployed can be stressful, there are a number of things that can be done to lessen the effects it may have on you and your family. Here are some suggestions to help you cope with unemployment better:\n\n【19】*   **Do Not Deny Your Feelings:** Being unemployed is a difficult condition that can give rise to a wide range of unfavorable feelings. While it may be easy to avoid these feelings through destructive actions, dealing with them full-on is more productive and healthful. Do not punish yourself for the situation, give yourself time to adjust to being jobless, and try to see the bright side whenever you can. Another way to lessen the stress related to unemployment is to speak with a counselor.\n    \n\n【20】*   **Consider Unemployment a Temporary Setback:** Try to view this situation as just a short setback rather than seeing unemployment as a permanent issue. This will give more confidence and motivation to seek a new job faster than if you only look at unemployment negatively.\n    \n*   **Reach Out to Friends and Family:** Unemployed individuals often feel a sense of shame or embarrassment about their situation which often leads to isolation from friends and family. However, staying connected is essential to maintain motivation to find a new job and to promote healthy mental and physical well-being.\n    \n*   **Start Networking:** There are several resources available that provide the chance to network with experts in the industry or area you are interested in. Building connections with industry leaders frequently results in finding out about new employment openings and may even produce a job referral.\n    \n*   **Take Care of Yourself:** Unemployment often causes individuals to lose sight of their emotional, mental, and physical well-being. However, taking care of yourself is essential in both the short and long term and will ensure you are capable of taking a new job when the opportunity arises. Get enough exercise and sleep and eat well to keep the positivity and energy.\n    \n\n【21】**Conclusion:**\n\n【22】As previously stated, unemployment and mental health are a complex combination, as unemployment is an extremely difficult situation for anyone's psychological health. Hence, it is important to keep a positive outlook on the future and stay active with social media networks in addition to your job search. If you notice that this is insufficient and your well-being is deteriorating, it may be time to seek professional assistance.\n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Unemployment and health: a review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8511234/\n*   Unemployment and mental health  \n    https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/unemployment-and-mental-health", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "f78a96cf-457e-4063-a44e-bf1be5121836", "title": "Neuronal Migration Disorders - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Neuronal Migration Disorders - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**What Are Neuronal Migration Disorders?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【1】A group of birth defects known as neuronal migration disorders (NMDs) is caused by aberrant neuronal migration in the developing nervous system and brain. Physiologically, neurons must move from the regions of the growing brain where they are made to the regions where they will establish their correct neural circuits. A complicated network of chemical cues signals neuronal migration, which can start as early as the second month of pregnancy. Neurons do not reach where they should when all these signals are missing or wrong. This can cause the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus to have structurally altered or missing parts. Schizencephaly (clefts in the cerebral hemisphere), porencephaly (development of cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities in the brain), lissencephaly (absence of brain convolutions), agyria (absence of gyri on brain surface), macrogyria (large and fewer gyri on the brain), polymicrogyria (the folds in the brain are extremely tiny and form in an excessive number), pachygyria (presence of broad, flat, and fewer gyri in the brain), microgyria (occurrence of small gyri in the brain), micropolygyria, neuronal heterotopias (brain disorder occurring due to lack of neural migration), corpus callosum agenesis (complete or partial absence of the nerves connecting the left and right side of the brain), and cranial nerves agenesis (complete or partial absence of the cranial nerve) are among the anatomical abnormalities seen in neuronal migration disorders.\n\n【2】What Are the Other Conditions Associated With Neuronal Migration Disorders?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Neuronal migration disorders may also be present in conjunction with other brain development disorders. These conditions may include the following:\n\n【4】*   **Chiari Malformation:** In this condition, the spinal canal is invaded by the brain's bottom portion. Some patients with Chiari malformation are asymptomatic.\n    \n*   **Dandy-Walker Syndrome:** The cerebellum, a region of the brain, does not properly form in people with this disorder.\n    \n*   **Holoprosencephaly:** The brain's two halves do not divide as they should in this condition.\n    \n*   **Hydrocephalus:** The fluid that surrounds the brain accumulates abnormally in this disease. This results in increased cerebral pressure.\n    \n*   **Spina Bifida:** This condition is characterized by improper development of the spine.\n    \n\n【5】What Causes Neuronal Migration Disorders?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【6】According to doctors, neuronal migration diseases are genetic, meaning a defective gene prevents the neural circuits from developing normally. While certain neural migration abnormalities are hereditary or passed down from parents to children, most appear to result from random genetic mutations. Neuronal migration disorders have been linked to mutations in genes related to neural migration, yet it is unclear how these mutations contribute to the onset of these disorders. It has been discovered that abnormal neural migration can cause more than 25 different neural migration disorders.\n\n【7】Related Topics\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Green Tea And Its Health Benefits\n\n【10】Infliximab - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, and Drug Warnings\n\n【11】Developmental Biology - Phenomena and Mechanism\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Neuronal Migration Disorders?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The neuronal migration disorder indications and symptoms vary according to the part of the brain affected and the degree of abnormalities. Neuronal migration disorders may not show signs at birth; instead, they become more visible as the infant fails to develop and grow normally. Common symptoms of neuronal migration disorders are:\n\n【14】*   Failure to achieve developmental milestones and developmental delay in children.\n    \n*   Loss of muscle tone and movement problems.\n    \n*   Failure to thrive.\n    \n*   Learning disabilities.\n    \n*   Poor motor functioning.\n    \n*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Impaired cognitive development.\n    \n*   Inability to feed properly.\n    \n*   Mental retardation.\n    \n*   Swelling in the limbs and extremities.\n    \n*   The smaller size of the head.\n    \n*   The majority of newborns with neuronal migration disorders seem normal; however, some conditions have distinguishing features of the face or skull that a neurologist can spot.\n    \n\n【15】How Are Neuronal Migration Disorders Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Neuronal migration disorders can be diagnosed in the following ways:\n\n【17】*   **Brain Imaging Test:** An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan helps diagnose the majority of neuronal migration abnormalities because it reveals the typical pattern of missing or abnormal brain tissue. The highest image quality is offered by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Therefore, it is the ideal diagnostic tool. Before birth, a diagnosis can be made via fetal MRI as well. Neuronal migration disorders in newborns and children can be diagnosed with CT (computed tomography) scans. Ultrasounds can also be done to diagnose neuronal migration disorders in infants.\n    \n*   **Genetic Testing:** Finding out if a neuronal migration disorder has a genetic etiology may be possible with genetic testing. Genetic testing is also helpful in determining any risk of further complications. A few examples of suggested genetic tests are; chromosomal microassay, brain malformation panel, whole exome sequencing, etc.\n    \n*   **Electroencephalograms:** An electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to determine seizure activity in the brain.\n    \n*   **Electromyogram:** An electromyogram (EMG) is done to measure muscle tone.\n    \n*   **Other Tests:** Different blood and urine tests could be advised. These tests could aid in the investigation of further NMD-related issues. These tests can be done to check for malnutrition as well.\n    \n\n【18】How Are Neuronal Migration Disorders Treated?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Although there is no way to replace damaged or missing brain tissue, many things can be done to alleviate the symptoms of neuronal migration disorder. Professionals, such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech or language therapists, and others, will be required to treat children with neuronal migration disorders.\n\n【20】*   **Medications:** Medications can treat seizures, stiffness, atypical muscular movements, breathing issues, sleep issues, drooling, constipation, hormonal problems, urinary tract infections, etc. These are common problems associated with neuronal migration disorders.\n    \n*   **Surgery:** Individuals with serious symptoms are frequently advised of surgery. Surgery may be helpful in the placement of a feeding tube, excess muscle tightness, hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain), seizures that are unresponsive to medications, scoliosis (sideways curvature of the spine), and hearing and vision problems.\n    \n*   **Physical and Occupational Therapy:** Physical and occupational therapy may be useful in developing motor skills, improving muscle stiffness, and increasing flexibility.\n    \n*   **Speech Therapy:** Speech and swallowing therapy are useful in effective communication and safe eating.\n    \n\n【21】There is no definitive cure for neuronal migration disorders. However, timely and consistent therapy may be extremely helpful in certain cases. Some kids will require regular medication to manage other issues and avoid seizures. A feeding tube will also help certain kids who need more nutrition. A shunt operation might be required to reduce head pressure when hydrocephalus is present.\n\n【22】**Conclusion:**\n\n【23】The prognosis for children with neuronal migration disorders varies greatly depending on the degree of the disorder and the part of the brain that is defective or absent. While some children may just have minor disabilities, others will require more comprehensive support. The presence of neurological signs and symptoms also greatly affects the prognosis. However, more research is still going on to understand these disorders better and prevent the development of neuronal migration disorders. The information obtained from this research lays the groundwork for comprehending abnormal development and offers possibilities for fresh approaches to treating and preventing illnesses associated with improper neural migration.\n\n【24】Article Resources\n\n【25】*   Neuronal Migration Disorders  \n    https://www.childneurologyfoundation.org/disorder/neuronal-migration-disorders/\n*   Neuronal Migration Disorders  \n    https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/neuronal-migration-disorders\n*   Neuronal Migration Disorders  \n    https://www.brainfacts.org/Diseases-and-Disorders/Neurological-Disorders-AZ/Diseases-A-to-Z-from-NINDS/Neuronal-Migration-Disorders", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The amount of potassium required by the body can be obtained from the daily diet itself. Kidneys help in excreting the excessive potassium present in the blood. However, in the presence of any kidney disorders, excess potassium is not eliminated, and it stays in the blood, thereby producing hyperkalemia. Excessively increased potassium is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate medical intervention.\n\n【2】What Is the Normal Level of Potassium in Blood?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The normal level of potassium in the blood for adults: 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L.\n\n【4】Level of potassium in the blood, which indicates hyperkalemia: above 5.5 mmol/L.\n\n【5】Potassium level in the blood that can cause heart problems and need emergency treatment: 6.5 mmol/L.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Hyperkalemia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Kidney Dysfunctions - Removing the excess potassium from the blood and excreting it in the urine is the function of kidneys. A breach occurs in this function if there is some kidney disorder. In cases of mild kidney dysfunction, the potassium level is maintained by the kidneys. But, in severe diseases, the kidneys cannot remove the excess potassium, and it gets stored in the blood resulting in hyperkalemia.\n    \n\n【8】*   Potassium-Rich Diet - Consumption of a diet that is rich in potassium also increases the risk of hyperkalemia. The trouble is much more increased in people who, in addition, have a renal disorder. Beans, bananas, cooked spinach, mushrooms, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, oranges, etc., are high potassium foods.\n    \n\n【9】*   Medications - Certain medications like angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta-blockers hamper the elimination of potassium from the kidney, therefore, increase the potassium level in blood.\n    \n\n【10】*   Burns or Severe Injuries-Excess potassium is released into the blood following severe burns or injuries and results in hyperkalemia.\n    \n\n【11】*   Uncontrolled Diabetes\\-Poorly controlled diabetes directly affects kidney function, so it increases the chances of hyperkalemia.\n    \n\n【12】*   Addison's disease.\n    \n*   Congestive heart failure.\n    \n*   Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n    \n*   Potassium supplements.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Chronic Kidney Disease - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Complications, and Treatment\n    \n    Rhabdomyolysis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment\n    \n    Autopsy Findings in COVID-19 Patients\n    \n*   Hormonal disorders.\n    \n*   Lupus.\n    \n*   Chronic alcoholism.\n    \n*   Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells).\n    \n*   Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscles).\n    \n\n【13】Symptoms of Hyperkalemia:\n-------------------------\n\n【14】Usually, mild hyperkalemia does not manifest any symptoms. However, the symptoms occur intermittently and gradually increase over time. Very high potassium levels cause severe complications, and immediate treatment is needed.\n\n【15】Signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia include:\n\n【16】*   Abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Diarrhea.\n    \n*   Chest pain.\n    \n*   Palpitations.\n    \n*   Irregular heartbeat.\n    \n*   Fatigue and numbness in the muscles of extremities.\n    \n\n【17】*   Breathing difficulties.\n    \n*   Signs of a heart attack like a weak pulse, chest pain, etc.\n    \n*   Severe muscle fatigue.\n    \n*   Severe abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Vomiting.\n    \n\n【18】When Is Emergency Treatment Needed for Hyperkalemia?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Hyperkalemia is diagnosed accidentally in routine blood tests since it does not exhibit any symptoms during the initial phases. Medical history, diet, and medications play an essential role in diagnosis. Therefore it is necessary to inform the doctor about everything, even the over-the-counter drugs, herbal medicines, or any other supplements. Any changes or abnormalities in the heart rhythm can be diagnosed with the help of an electrocardiogram.\n\n【20】**Hyperkalemia and Electrocardiogram (ECG):**\n\n【21】An electrocardiogram may show the following changes:\n\n【22】*   T waves attain the peak.\n    \n*   Short QT intervals.\n    \n*   ST-segment depression.\n    \n*   Widening of QRS complex.\n    \n*   Increase in the PR interval.\n    \n*   A decrease in the amplitude of the P wave.\n    \n\n【23】These are the initial changes that can be reversed with treatment for hyperkalemia. If left untreated, it causes further widening of the QRS complex and the disappearance of the P wave. Ventricular fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid and inadequate heartbeat, usually follows these changes. Though there is typically a correlation between the ECG changes and hyperkalemia, sometimes severe arrhythmias can occur at any stage of hyperkalemia without any distinct ECG changes.\n\n【24】How Can Hyperkalemia Be Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】Depending on the level of potassium in the blood, there are different treatment options which include:\n\n【26】*   **Diuretics:**\n    \n\n【27】As potassium excretion mainly happens through urine, diuretics or water pills help in increasing urine flow, which eventually reduces the potassium level in the blood.\n\n【28】*   **Low-Potassium Diet:**\n    \n\n【29】It is also advisable to follow a low-potassium diet and reduce the consumption of salt substitutes that are high in potassium. A dietitian will help in creating a specialized meal plan to follow in hyperkalemia.\n\n【30】*   **Potassium Binders:**\n    \n\n【31】It is a medication that must be taken daily, which binds with the excess potassium in the bowels and excretes it in feces. It is usually taken in the oral route, but sometimes it can also be administered through the rectum as an enema. For oral administration, these are mixed with water. These are recommended when other treatments do not pave off. Also, caution should be taken not to take the potassium binders within six hours of taking any other drugs, and it is also not recommended in children.\n\n【32】*   **Intravenous Therapy:**\n    \n\n【33】It is the suggested treatment modality in patients who require emergency treatment, during which an intravenous infusion of Calcium is done to protect the heart from further damage. In addition, Insulin is infused, which helps in moving potassium into the blood cells. Also, Albuterol inhalation is needed, which is an asthmatic drug that helps in decreasing potassium levels.\n\n【34】*   **Managing the Medications:**\n    \n\n【35】Drug-induced hyperkalemia can be reversed by withdrawing anti-hypertensive medications and other drugs, which cause a significant rise in the potassium level. It is suggested to consult with the physician and make changes to the medications taken.\n\n【36】*   **Dialysis:**\n    \n\n【37】Suppose the potassium levels continue to rise despite the treatment, or in case of complete renal failure, it is advisable to do dialysis to lower the potassium levels in the blood.\n\n【38】How Can Hyperkalemia Be Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】In hyperkalemic patients or high-risk patients with known renal dysfunctions, the best way to prevent hyperkalemia is to limit potassium intake in food.\n\n【40】How Is the Prognosis in Hyperkalemia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【41】In most cases of hyperkalemia, the prognosis is good with an adequate diet and medications. It does not result in any long-term complications.\n\n【42】Article Resources\n\n【43】*   What is Hyperkalemia?  \n    https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/what-hyperkalemia\n*   Hyperkalemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470284/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "cfc8bfe4-50a1-4cac-b6ff-019647acc392", "title": "Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an inherited disorder that is characterized by high levels of serum calcium and low to moderate levels of calcium in the urine. Patients with this condition are usually asymptomatic and are diagnosed by chance. In some cases, they may present with considerable symptoms which need immediate management. The age of onset at which the symptoms start to appear varies from person to person.\n\n【2】What Is Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant condition caused due to a mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CaSR). This, in turn, decreases the receptor activity resulting in abnormally increased serum calcium levels (hypercalcemia).\n\n【4】**What Is Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Pattern?**\n\n【5】The autosomal dominant inheritance patterniswhen only a single copy of a mutated gene is present in any one of the parents or as a result of a new mutation in the affected individual. The chance of transmitting the disease from one generation to another in each pregnancy is 50 %.\n\n【6】What Is the Epidemiology of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare disorder with a prevalence of one in 78,000 worldwide. There is no suggested gender predilection.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】There are three types of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia based on the type of mutation; it is as follows:\n\n【10】1.  **Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Type 1 -** Mutation in CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor) gene.\n    \n2.  **Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Type 2 -** Mutation in GNA11 gene (Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11).\n    \n3.  **Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Type 3 -** Mutation in AP2S1 gene (adaptor-related protein complex two subunit sigma 1).\n    \n\n【11】What Is the Etiology of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   The primary etiology of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is the loss of function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor genes in 85 % of cases. The CaSR gene is located in the long arm of chromosome three. It shows a benign clinical course in patients with a heterozygous mutation with mild hypercalcemia, whereas in patients with a homozygous mutation, there is a severe increase in serum calcium levels with dominant features of hyperparathyroidism.\n    \n*   The genes responsible for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2 and type 3 genes are located in chromosome 19q13, which is called the Oklahoma variant.\n    \n*   Few percent of cases occur due to autoimmune reactions where autoantibodies are directed against the calcium-sensing receptors, thus affecting the calcium receptors.\n    \n\n【13】**What Are Calcium Sensing Receptors?**\n\n【14】CaSR gene provides instruction for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor. These receptors are mainly expressed in the kidney and the parathyroid glands.The calcium molecules attach to this receptor and control and monitor the calcium levels in the blood. The functions of CaSR include regulating parathyroid hormone secretion and mediating renal tubular calcium reabsorption.\n\n【15】**What Is the Pathophysiology of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?**\n\n【16】Calcium sensing receptors are expressed in the kidneys, parathyroid gland, thyroid C cells, intestine, and bone. It is essential for regulating serum calcium levels. The mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene would reduce the receptor's calcium sensitivity, thereby reducing the receptor stimulation. The parathyroid glands become less sensitive to calcium receptors, thus increasing the serum calcium levels. In the kidneys, it would result in excessive tubular reabsorption of calcium and magnesium. These changes would result in hypercalcemia, hypocalciuria, and hypermagnesemia.\n\n【17】What Is the Pathophysiology of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The majority of cases with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are asymptomatic; the symptoms, if they occur, include:\n\n【19】*   Weakness.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n*   Fatigue.\n    \n*   Constipation.\n    \n*   Polyuria.\n    \n*   Polydipsia.\n    \n*   Renal insufficiency.\n    \n*   Mental disturbances.\n    \n*   Confusion.\n    \n*   Chondrocalcinosis.\n    \n*   Pancreatitis.\n    \n*   Intraductal calcifications.\n    \n\n【20】What Are the Laboratory Signs of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The laboratory signs include the following:\n\n【22】*   Hypercalcemia - Increase in serum calcium levels.\n    \n*   Hypocalciuria - Decreased excretion of calcium in the urine.\n    \n*   Hypermagnesemia - Increased serum magnesium levels.\n    \n*   Hyperparathyroidism - Increased serum parathyroid hormone levels.\n    \n\n【23】How Is Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】**History:**\n\n【25】A thorough medical and family history should be collected from the patient, such as symptoms of the disease, would help in framing the diagnosis of the condition along with the laboratory findings. Family history would serve in identifying the genetic link in families.\n\n【26】**Physical Examination:**\n\n【27】Physical examination of the patient for the vital signs and to confirm the symptomatic history, such as mental disturbances, weakness, etc. would help in further planning.\n\n【28】**Blood Test:**\n\n【29】*   Serum Calcium Levels - This would indicate an increase in serum calcium levels (hypercalcemia).\n    \n*   Serum Magnesium Levels - This would indicate an increase in serum magnesium levels (hypermagnesemia).\n    \n*   Serum Parathyroid Hormone Levels - This would indicate an increase in serum parathyroid hormone levels (hyperparathyroidism)\n    \n*   Vitamin D Levels - Might show decreased vitamin D levels in patients with PTH-dependent hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.\n    \n\n【30】**Urine Test:**\n\n【31】*   Urinary Calcium - Decreased excretion of calcium in the urine (hypocalciuria).\n    \n*   24- Hour Urinary Calcium Excretion - This would reveal the 24- hour urinary excretion values of less than 100 mg/24 hours.\n    \n*   Calcium-Creatinine Clearance Ratio (CCCR) - It would indicate values less than 0. 01 in 80 % of cases with this condition.\n    \n\n【32】**GeneticTest:**\n\n【33】Genetic studies would help in identifying the type of gene mutated in the condition. It also tells us the type of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.\n\n【34】**What Are the Differential Diagnosis of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia?**\n\n【35】*   Adrenal Insufficiency - It occurs as a result of insufficient adrenal hormone secretion, which exhibits similar symptoms as that of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.\n    \n*   Granulomatous Disease - Is characterized by the inability of the white blood cells to exhibit defensive activity.\n    \n*   Osteolytic Metastasis - Is characterized by the breakdown or weakening of the bone.\n    \n*   Primary Hyperparathyroidism - Is characterized by the increased parathyroid hormone in the blood.\n    \n\n【36】How Is Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Managed?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   Patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemiausually do not need any treatment as they do not develop complications from this disorder.\n    \n*   Treatment measures are indicated in patients developing pancreatitis as a result of this condition. In those cases, total parathyroidectomy is advised to reduce further episodes of pancreatitis.\n    \n*   CaSR antagonists, such as calcimimetics and calcilytics are given to improve the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptors.\n    \n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare autosomal dominant condition. It is a benign condition that usually does not develop any complications. The patients and the family members should be properly educated and reassured about the benign nature of the condition as it avoids unnecessary surgical interventions and mental pressure. It should be differentiated from other conditions with similar symptoms and laboratory findings. The prognosis of this condition is reported to be good if the calcium levels are stable.\n\n【40】Article Resources\n\n【41】*   Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459190/\n*   Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and related disorders  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6767927/\n*   Case Report: Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2020.00030/full", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "47d5b34e-da96-48a6-b9cf-5dcc3363186e", "title": "Meigs’ Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Meigs’ Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Meigs’ syndrome is uncommon in women less than 30 years of age. The condition most commonly affects women of postmenopausal age (after 50 years). The incidence is high in women between 60 years to 70 years of age. Joe Vincent Meigs and John W Cass were the first to describe the association of benign ovary tumors with ascites and pleural effusion. The condition was later named Meigs’ syndrome by Rhodes and Terrel.\n\n【2】What Is Meigs Syndrome?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】A syndrome is a collection of different signs and symptoms. The classical indications for Meigs’ syndrome are as follows:\n\n【4】*   **Benign ovary tumor:** A non-cancerous growth on the ovaries such as fibroma, thecoma, and Brenner tumor.\n    \n*   Ascites refer to abnormal fluid build-up in the abdomen, primarily due to underlying liver damage.\n    \n*   **Pleural effusion:** Fluid collection between the lungs and chest cavity is called pleural effusion.\n    \n*   Pericardial effusion is abnormal fluid accumulation in the sac surrounding the heart. It occurs with other signs of Meigs’ syndrome in a few individuals.\n    \n*   The ascites and pleural effusion clear off after removing the ovarian tumor.\n    \n*   It is also known as Demons-Meigs’ syndrome.\n    \n\n【5】What Is Atypical Meigs Syndrome?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】Rarely, in a few women, either pleural effusion or ascites occurs in association with benign ovarian tumors. It is called atypical or incomplete Meigs’ syndrome.\n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【8】The typical symptoms of Meigs syndrome are listed below:\n\n【9】*   **Benign Ovarian Tumor:** It rarely occurs in children and adolescents associated with Gorlin syndrome (a condition that affects various body parts and increases the risk of developing cancer or non-cancerous growth).\n    \n\n【10】1.  The ovarian tumor produces little or no symptoms in women until it starts secreting hormones. If the tumor produces excess androgen hormone, it increases the development of male characteristics (virilization) in women.\n2.  If estrogen is produced in excess, it causes abnormal bleeding, endometrial cancer, and early puberty in children.\n3.  The other features include fatigue, weight loss, swollen feet, the abdomen swells due to an enlarged ovarian tumor, leaking of urine (urinary incontinence), and uterine prolapse (the pelvic muscles weaken and do not provide support to the uterus).\n\n【11】*   **Pleural Effusion:** The fluid usually builds up on the right side of the chest cavity. However, it can occur on the left side or both. It causes dry cough, breathing difficulties, and pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue that separates the lungs from the chest wall).\n    \n*   Ascites cause abdominal swelling.\n    \n\n【12】How Is Meigs Syndrome Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【13】*   **Physical Examination:** It is essential to examine women showing ascites and pleural effusion features. The critical aspects that are evaluated during physical examination are:\n    \n\n【14】1.  Palpable abdominal masses.\n    \n2.  Abnormal breath sounds and changes in the quality of voice are detected using a stethoscope.\n    \n3.  Abdominal swelling.\n    \n4.  Dullness of the chest and bulged neck veins are a few other signs of ascites that the physician evaluates.\n    \n5.  Skin is also examined for any skin cancer, especially in children.\n    \n6.  The ascites and pleural effusion are checked for resolution after removing the ovarian tumor, the hallmark of Meigs’ syndrome.\n    \n\n【15】*   **Laboratory Investigations**: Blood and urine are analyzed to detect any abnormality that indicates liver failure, anemia, heart failure, and excess excretion of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The blood is examined for complete blood count, prothrombin time, cholesterol levels, and pro-BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide). The high levels of pro-BNP are suggestive of heart failure. CA 125 (cancer antigen 125) is a specific protein found to be increased in the serum of women with ovarian cancer.\n*   **Radiographic Investigations:** The various imaging modalities used to diagnose Meigs’ syndrome are:\n    \n\n【16】1.  Ultrasound of the pelvis aids in determining any small lesions in the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tube, etc.\n2.  Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is taken to evaluate any other cause for ascites like cancer, liver disorders, etc.\n3.  Chest X-ray is more commonly used in the diagnosis of pleural effusion. It also helps in determining any cancer spread.\n4.  Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is also essential in differentiating Meigs’ syndrome from other cancers.\n\n【17】*   **Thoracentesis** is a minimally invasive procedure of removing fluid around the lungs and examining it for protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. It also gives temporary relief to the patients as fluid is removed.\n    \n*   **Paracentesis** involves removing fluid in the abdomen, and it is analyzed for protein levels. It helps in determining the cause of ascites.\n    \n*   **Endoscopy:** A thin, long tube with a camera is passed through the mouth to view the digestive tract. It aids in diagnosing any gastrointestinal tumor.\n    \n\n【18】What Are the Related Disorders?\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】The disorders that have to differentiate from Meigs’ syndrome are listed down:\n\n【20】*   **Liver Cirrhosis:** It is severe liver damage that occurs due to scarring of liver tissue. The individual suffers from fatigue, weight loss, jaundice, swelling of legs and feet, and ascites. Laboratory tests and biopsy are used in the diagnosis.\n    \n*   **Pseudo-Meigs’ Syndrome** is characterized by abdominal or pelvic tumors, ascites, pleural effusion, and benign ovarian tumors.\n    \n*   **Ovarian Cancer:** Malignant tumor of the ovaries occurs due to an unknown cause. It leads to weight loss, abdominal swelling, back pain, and an urge to urinate. It is usually treated by surgical removal of ovaries and or uterus.\n    \n\n【21】How Is Meigs Syndrome Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【22】The treatment of Meigs’ syndrome is carried out after the diagnosis is confirmed. It involves:\n\n【23】*   **Paracentesis:** Removing fluid from the abdomen relieves patients from breathing difficulties and abdominal discomfort.\n    \n*   **Thoracentesis:** The fluid around the lungs from the chest cavity is removed at regular intervals to help in managing breathing difficulties.\n    \n*   **Surgery:** The various abdominal surgery carried out in women with Meigs’ syndrome include:\n    \n\n【24】1.  Total hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the whole uterus and ovaries, and fallopian tubes on both sides. It is carried out in women over 50 years of age who have attained menopause.\n2.  Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the surgical excision of the ovaries and fallopian tubes on one side. It is suggested for younger women in whom fertility preservation is essential.\n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】Meigs’ syndrome is rare and accounts for 1% of all ovarian tumors. However, the pleural effusion and ascites completely resolve after the excision of the ovarian tumor. The affected women show a good prognosis and lead a normal life post-surgery. Therefore, the healthcare specialist must diagnose such conditions appropriately.\n\n【27】Article Resources\n\n【28】*   Meigs Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559322/\n*   Meigs syndrome  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/meigs-syndrome?lang=us\n*   So-Called “Meigs' Syndrome” Associated with Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors  \n    https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/70.4.578", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It was isolated in birds in 1953 in the Nile delta region. In 1997 a more virulent strain of the virus caused the death of different species of birds; since then, the virus has been considered pathogenic for birds. Human infections were reported in many countries, and the largest outbreak occurred in Israel, Romania, Greece, Russia, and the USA. And the sites of outbreaks were noticed to be on major birds' migratory routes. The virus is commonly found in Europe, North America, Africa, and West Asia.\n\n【2】What Is West Nile Fever?\n------------------------\n\n【3】West Nile fever is an illness contracted from infected mosquito bites. The West Nile virus can infect birds, horses, and other mammals. The disease is expected in late summer and late fall in mild zones. However, it may also occur throughout the year in southern climates. It is associated with malaise, headache, myalgia, rashes, and lymphadenopathy; and may resemble the flu.\n\n【4】What Causes West Nile Fever?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】The West Nile virus causes West Nile fever. It is a flavivirus that is transmitted through infected mosquitoes. Birds are the natural hosts of the virus and are maintained in nature by the spread between birds and mosquitoes. The West Nile virus replicates faster and spreads faster to birds at higher temperatures; one of the reasons is that climate changes impact the epidemiology of the infection. West Nile fever is the mild form of a West Nile virus infection.\n\n【6】How Does West Nile Fever Spread?\n--------------------------------\n\n【7】The West Nile virus spreads to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The mosquito gets infected by biting infected birds; birds are the natural hosts of the virus. When these mosquitoes bite humans, it causes the transmission of the virus. The virus may also spread through blood transfusions, breastfeeding, pregnancy, or organ transplants; however, this is rare. The virus does not spread through direct contact with an infected person.\n\n【8】What Are the Risk Factors for West Nile Fever?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Although anybody bitten by an infected mosquito can get west Nile fever, less than one percent of people develop severe symptoms. The risk factors for the infection may include age, as people above 60 years are more susceptible to the illness. Underlying medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, impaired immunity, and kidney problems can also increase the risk of having severe symptoms. The virus is more prevalent in males.\n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of West Nile Fever?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Almost 80 percent of people infected by the West Nile virus show no symptoms, and about 20 percent may develop West Nile fever. The symptoms appear 3 to 14 days after the bite and may last weeks or months. Symptoms include:\n\n【12】*   High fever.\n    \n*   Chills.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n*   Body ache.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Encephalitis - Symptoms, Complications, and Expert Management\n    \n    Effects of Climate Change on Our Health\n    \n    Preventive Measures for Malaria\n    \n*   Skin rashes, especially on the trunk.\n    \n*   Swollen lymph glands.\n    \n*   Excessive sweating.\n    \n*   Weakness.\n    \n*   Fatigue.\n    \n*   Drowsiness.\n    \n*   Joint pain.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Vomiting.\n    \n*   Loss of appetite.\n    \n*   Diarrhea.\n    \n\n【13】**What Are the Other Illnesses Caused By West Nile Virus?**\n\n【14】The West Nile virus can cause severe conditions like encephalitis and paralysis; in rare cases, it may even cause permanent brain damage and sometimes death.\n\n【15】*   **West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease**: It occurs when the virus infects the CNS (central nervous system).\n    \n*   **West Nile Encephalitis**: It is similar to viral encephalitis, and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, and altered mental status.\n    \n*   **West Nile Meningitis**: It involves symptoms like neck stiffness, headache, fever, and pleocytosis (an increased amount of white blood cells in the body).\n    \n*   **West Nile Meningoencephalitis**: It is the inflammation of the meninges and the brain.\n    \n*   **West Nile Poliomyelitis**: It is less common and is associated with the acute onset of asymmetric limb weakness, pain, and paralysis without sensory loss.\n    \n*   **West Nile Reversible Paralysis**: It is characterized by asymmetric paralysis or weakness.\n    \n\n【16】**Nonneurologic Complications**: These include;\n\n【17】*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).\n    \n*   Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).\n    \n*   Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).\n    \n*   Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissues).\n    \n*   Orchitis (inflammation of the testicles).\n    \n*   Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve).\n    \n*   Nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys) and hemorrhagic fever with coagulopathy.\n    \n\n【18】*   Skin Manifestations: It includes red maculopapular rashes on the extremities.\n    \n\n【19】How Is West Nile Fever Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【20】The healthcare provider may advise a blood test to check for the presence of the West Nile virus or the antibodies against the infection. In case of severe conditions of the West Nile virus that is brain-related, the physician may advise a lumbar puncture or the spinal tab test. The test includes inserting a needle into the spine and extracting the fluid. The fluid is then sent to the laboratory for testing, as the virus can increase the white blood cells in the spinal fluid. In addition, other tests like MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can help detect brain inflammation.\n\n【21】What Is the Treatment for West Nile Fever?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】West Nile virus infection does not have a specific cure. However, most people recover without treatment. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as Aspirin or Ibuprofen can help relieve headaches and muscle pain. In severe cases, hospitalization for supportive care with intravenous fluids, pain medication, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infection is needed.\n\n【23】How Can West Nile Fever Be Prevented?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【24】West Nile virus spreads to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito; since there is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, preventing mosquito bites can help protect oneself from the disease.\n\n【25】*   Use insect repellents that are environmental protection agency-registered with DEET (N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide), Picardin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone when going out.\n    \n*   Put on completely covered clothing for babies and young children.\n    \n*   Use a mosquito net to cover strollers and baby carriers.\n    \n*   If one uses sunscreen, apply it first and the insect repellent over it.\n    \n*   Do not let standing water anywhere around the house.\n    \n*   Wear full-sleeved clothing.\n    \n*   Install mosquito screens on the windows and doors of the house.\n    \n*   Use mosquito nets around the beds, cribs, and playpens.\n    \n*   Treat the clothes and gear with 0.5 percent Permethrin.\n    \n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】West Nile fever is a febrile illness caused by the West Nile virus. The virus is spread through infected mosquitoes that get the virus from infected birds. It is the mild form of the manifestations of the virus and resembles the flu, and usually subsides without any treatment. However, over-the-counter medications can help relieve the symptoms. In addition, preventing mosquitoes around the house and while going out can help prevent the illness.\n\n【28】Article Resources\n\n【29】*   West Nile Virus  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html\n*   West Nile fever--a reemerging mosquito-borne viral disease in Europe.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627720/\n*   West Nile Virus  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/west-nile-virus", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "73978c81-20f8-4f26-b8a4-e3fd471f51b8", "title": "Management of Anesthesia Failure", "text": "【0】Management of Anesthesia Failure\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Anesthesia is used very frequently in medical treatments. The primary function of anesthesia is to overcome the surgical pain and sensations over the targeted surgical site. In addition, the use of anesthesia numbs the area by blocking the nerve supply. This topic explains anesthesia, its effects, different types and modes of delivery and anesthesia failure, why it occurs, and how it can be managed.\n\n【2】What Is Anesthesia?\n-------------------\n\n【3】Anesthesia is a medicine or drug used to inhibit the pain sensation in the surgical area. They block the nerve signals going to the brain. They work as temporary loss of signals which can be regained soon after they wear off. There are different types of anesthesia present. These anesthetic medicines are delivered in different modes to the patient required. Some drugs cause unconsciousness, while some keep the patient conscious during surgery, while some serve as cream or lotion to control pain in the localized area.\n\n【4】**What Is the Use of Anesthesia?**\n\n【5】Anesthesia is used to control the pain in the targeted area. It is delivered to the patient by any means, of injection or sprays, or inhaling gasses by masks so that surgery can be performed without any pain sensation by the patient.\n\n【6】What Are the Types of Anesthesia?\n---------------------------------\n\n【7】There are four types of anesthesia. They are:\n\n【8】*   **General Anesthesia** - General anesthesia is the anesthesia in which a complete loss of consciousness causes the patient to go to sleep. At the same time, a surgical procedure is performed. It is used for head, chest, and abdomen surgeries.\n    \n*   **Regional Anesthesia** - Regional anesthesia is the anesthesia that leads the patient to be conscious with loss of sensation in the more significant body part requiring surgery, like lower limbs. They are used in cesarean surgeries, to numb the legs, or for knee or hip surgeries.\n    \n*   **Local Anesthesia** - Local anesthesia is anesthesia used to numb a small area of the body. It is mainly used in dental procedures, biopsies, or eye surgeries. It is the most used anesthesia technique. And it keeps the patient awake.\n    \n*   **Sedation** - Sedation causes anesthetic effects as it causes incomplete loss of consciousness during the surgical procedure. It is similar to general anesthesia but provides the patient with natural sleep. It can vary from mild to moderate sedation.\n    \n\n【9】What Are the Different Modes of Anesthesia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Different anesthesia uses different modes. They are:\n\n【11】*   **Inhaled Gasses by Masks** - The method uses masks to inhale the gasses for the anesthetic effects. It is used for general anesthesia.\n    \n*   **Injection** - Injection delivered into the veins is a common method used by all anesthesias. General, regional, and local anesthesia can all be given by injection.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Septal Perforation - Coping Strategies and Support\n    \n    Local Anesthetic Toxicity in Older People- Symptoms, Management, and Prevention\n    \n    Management of Multiple Systemic Disorders in Clinical Practice\n    \n*   **Sprays, Gels, or Lotions** - Local anesthesia can be applied by sprays or lotions over the targeted small area.\n    \n\n【12】Who Can Perform Anesthesia?\n---------------------------\n\n【13】Anesthesia is performed by doctors, mainly, anesthesiologists, doctors specializing in anesthesia. An anesthesiologist is required primarily in major surgeries like cesarean section or brain or heart. Ideally, general anesthesia, sedation, and regional anesthesia need an anesthesiologist to examine the patient's activity. But other doctors can perform local anesthesia for minor procedures like dental or nerve block procedures. In addition, some topical or local anesthetic present in gels or lotions can be administered directly by the patient.\n\n【14】What Are the Different Anesthetic Agents Used in Anesthesia?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】There are different types of anesthetic agents used in surgical procedures. Some of them are :\n\n【16】*   Volatile agents - Isoflurane, Desflurane, and Sevoflurane.\n    \n*   Propofol.\n    \n*   Ketamine.\n    \n*   Etomidate.\n    \n*   Diazepam.\n    \n*   Bupivacaine.\n    \n*   Lidocaine.\n    \n*   Midazolam.\n    \n*   Nitrous oxide.\n    \n*   Prilocaine.\n    \n*   Fentanyl.\n    \n\n【17】What Are the Side Effects of Using Anesthesia?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Side effects of using anesthesia are:\n\n【19】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n    \n*   Sore throat.\n    \n*   Delirium (disturbed mind).\n    \n*   Muscle aches.\n    \n*   Itchiness.\n    \n*   Shivering.\n    \n*   Headaches.\n    \n*   Difficulty in urination.\n    \n*   Hematoma (bleeding under the skin).\n    \n\n【20】**What Is Anesthesia Failure?**\n\n【21】Anesthesia failure is when the patient shows no effect on the anesthetic drug delivered by the doctor. Hence, ineffective anesthesia is called anesthesia failure. The patient feels pain in the surgical targeted area as the anesthesia is inadequate enough to numb and block the nerve sensations.\n\n【22】Why Does Anesthesia Failure Occur?\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】Anesthesia failure is not a common thing. It is rarely seen. Many factors can lead to the failure of anesthesia. Possible factors are:\n\n【24】*   Any previous infection present in the patient.\n    \n*   Wrong selection of anesthetic drugs in the patient.\n    \n*   Lesser or too much use of anesthesia in the patient.\n    \n*   Patient's anatomical variations with the accessory nerve supply.\n    \n*   Patient's anxiety.\n    \n*   Any form of technical mistakes.\n    \n*   Any other drug interaction with an anesthetic agent.\n    \n*   Using older stored anesthetic agents.\n    \n*   A patient who has already encountered repeated doses of anesthetic.\n    \n*   Wrong positioning of the patient.\n    \n*   Improper technique to deliver anesthesia.\n    \n\n【25】**What Happens if Anesthesia Failure Occurs?**\n\n【26】When anesthesia fails, the drugs do not work or wear off early, and the patient has continued nerve sensations instead of blocking nerve signals. But some medications given along with anesthesia can prevent the patient from completely becoming aware of the situation.\n\n【27】**Which Is the Most Common Reason for Anesthetic Failure?**\n\n【28】The patient's anxiety is the most common reason for anesthetic failure. So, it is essential to calm and relax the patient before starting any procedure on the patient. Anxiety causes tension and nervousness in the patient, which can cause anesthesia not to work on operating the patient further.\n\n【29】How Can One Manage Anesthesia Failure?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【30】The anesthesia failure can be managed by pre-evaluating the parameters before anesthesia. Some of the managing points are:\n\n【31】*   The doctor should check the patient's medical history in case the patient has any infection or has previously undergone an anesthetic procedure.\n    \n*   The doctor can use nerve stimulators or ultrasound X-rays for nerve detection.\n    \n*   Proper patient positioning has to be done.\n    \n*   Anesthesia and the technique used for anesthesia delivery should be evaluated before planning further procedures.\n    \n*   It is very important to relax the patient before going for anesthesia.\n    \n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】Anesthesia blocks the nerve signals and sensations going to the brain and is used very frequently in surgical procedures. There are four types of anesthesia: general, regional, and local anesthesia and sedation. The anesthesia is delivered to the patient in different modes. Furthermore, anesthesia has side effects that are very concerning to the patient and the doctor. Anesthesia failure is also faced by the doctor and the patient sometimes. However, with proper pre-evaluation techniques, anesthetic failures can be prevented.\n\n【34】Article Resources\n\n【35】*   Anesthesia  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/anesthesia.html\n*   Anesthesia Risks  \n    https://www.asahq.org/madeforthismoment/anesthesia-101/types-of-anesthesia/anesthesia-risks/\n*   Anesthesia  \n    https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/factsheet\\_anesthesia.aspx", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2a7570e8-0d4d-43eb-aea9-3cea3b99bfb4", "title": "De-syndactyly Surgery - Procedure and Complications", "text": "【0】De-syndactyly Surgery - Procedure and Complications\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Syndactyly is a common congenital anomaly. It is generally treated surgically. De-syndactyly surgery is based on timing and the type of syndactyly. There are various ways to do the surgery, for example, using flaps to reconstruct the area. The outcome for simple syndactyly is favorable as compared to complex syndactyly.\n\n【2】What Is Syndactyly?\n-------------------\n\n【3】Syndactyly is a common anomaly of the extremities that have been present since birth. There is a fusion of the soft tissues or the bones of the digits in the upper or lower limbs. Syndactyly can also be seen with certain genetic disorders like Apert and Poland syndrome. The treatment is usually a surgical separation of the digits for proper movement of the digits.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Syndactyly?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】Depending on the presence or absence of the fusion, it is differentiated into simple or complex. In complete syndactyly, the fusion extends up to the fingertips involving the nail folds. In incomplete syndactyly, the fusion does not involve the complete finger. In complicated syndactyly, there is a presence of extra or accessory digits or bones. Mostly found between the second and third toes and between the middle and the ring finger.\n\n【6】What Are the Indications of De-syndactyly Surgery?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】De-syndactyly is indicated in almost all cases of syndactyly as it leads to the independent movement of the digits.\n\n【8】What Are the Contraindications of De-syndactyly Surgery?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The contraindications of de-syndactyly surgery are as follows:\n\n【10】Related Topics\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】I had surgery for bowel obstruction, but the biopsy was done only for the appendix. Is that enough?\n\n【13】Dr. Anushtup De\n\n【14】De Quervain’s Tendinitis - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【15】*   Incomplete syndactyly that does not affect daily functions.\n    \n*   Certain medical conditions.\n    \n*   Complex syndactyly that may lead to further risk post-separation.\n    \n\n【16】When Can De-syndactyly Surgery Be Carried Out?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Since syndactyly is present since birth, surgical procedures can be scheduled even at five to six months of age. Scheduling surgeries before this age may lead to complications due to anesthesia. In case of a nail infection, the parents are instructed to wash the hand of the child with soap and water and apply an antibacterial ointment on it. If needed, oral antibiotics can also be given.\n\n【18】The timing of the de-syndactyly surgery depends on the number of digits involved and the type of syndactyly. If more digits are involved, then the surgery can be performed as soon as possible. Early surgery can help prevent the faulty rotation and angulation that progresses with the growth of the different fingers. In complex syndactyly cases, the first surgery is performed when the baby is six months old. This is due to different rates of growth of the small and the ring finger or between the index finger and the thumb. If syndactyly is not treated promptly in between these fingers, then it may lead to permanent malformations. In case of the presence of several syndactylies in the same hand, simultaneous de-syndactyly can be performed, with the consideration that one side of the finger is released. In the case of syndactyly involving both hands, the surgery can be performed in one go.\n\n【19】Multiple surgeries can be carried out in individuals with syndactyly involving many fingers. For example, if both sides of the finger are fused, then multiple surgeries might be needed. This might put the individual at a neurovascular risk. Thus step by step surgical release is made in the digits. The surgery is completed before the school age as motor skills are required.\n\n【20】**Before the Procedure:**\n\n【21】Before the surgical procedure, the parents are advised to properly bathe the kid, particularly the hands and groin area.\n\n【22】**During the Procedure:**\n\n【23】The de-syndactyly procedure usually involves one side of the finger at a time. This is done to prevent the decrease in the blood flow in that area in case any of the blood vessels are injured during the procedure. The surgery is carried out keeping in mind the type and location of the syndactyly. The surgical release is usually carried out by dividing the fingers and covering the wound with a flap with good vascularization. The commonly used flap is a rectangular dorsal flap. There are various designs that are used for this flap, such as triangular, rectangular, omega, and multi-lobed. Other flaps used are interdigitating fasciocutaneous flaps and full-thickness skin grafts.\n\n【24】The flap is inserted with a slope in the dorsal-to-volar (back of the hand to the palm region) region. The distal end of the flap ends in the finger that is closer to it. In the case of the involvement of the fingernail, the flap is divided vertically. Broad fingernails should be reduced to normal size. After the removal of the bone, the fasciocutaneous flaps should be applied to the exposed bone for proper coverage. The local interdigitating flaps should be designed such as to reduce the need for skin grafts. Full-thickness skin grafts are applied in places where fasciocutaneous flats cannot be applied. Skin grafts are required in most cases of syndactyly except incomplete simple syndactyly between the thumb and the index finger. Different techniques, such as double-opposing Z-plasty or a four-flap Z-plasty, can be done in cases with incomplete simple syndactyly, which do not need skin grafts. The four-flap Z-plasty is preferred more as compared to single Z-plasty as it gives good length and shape. The dorsal flaps are used to cover the defect in the palm region to cover the lateral finger defects. The location of the incision and its pattern is also determined. The most preferred pattern is zigzag. The Cronin technique uses matched zigzag incisions on the flexor and dorsal surfaces. The modified Cronin technique uses dorsal and volar triangular flaps with oblique zigzag incisions.\n\n【25】As compared to split-thickness grafts, full-thickness grafts are usually preferred as they grow as the patient grows and are less likely to contract over time. The common site for full-thickness graft is a lateral inguinal region. The skin is removed in the shape of an ellipse, closing the donor site fully. The rate of infection is usually low with this graft. The area heals properly without much scarring. In the case of complex syndactyly, a groin flap can be used for covering the interdigital area. A non-pigmented skin graft can also be taken from the plantar surface of the foot. The prepuce is another source of graft, as it tends to hyper pigment with time.\n\n【26】**After the Procedure:**\n\n【27】After the procedure, a dressing is applied at the surgical site. A good amount of antibiotic ointment and a non-sticky dressing over the grafted skin is applied over the incision. The hand is wrapped with a padded long-arm dressing with a splint. The graft donor site is closed with absorbable sutures. The donor site dressing should be removed three days post-surgery and thoroughly cleaned with soap water during the bath. The long-arm dressing with the splint is removed after two to three weeks after proper inspection by the doctor. If the patient is uncomfortable with the dressing, it can be removed, and the caretakers are advised to take care of the wound daily. The wound area is cleaned with a cotton swab dabbed with antibiotic ointment. The surgical site is cleaned with two by two cotton gauze, reinforced with five-centimeter gauze. Stockinettes are applied on the arms and secured with the shirt to prevent the dressing from coming off. Scar management is done six weeks post-surgery.\n\n【28】What Are the Complications of De-syndactyly Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The complication of de-syndactyly surgery includes the following:\n\n【30】*   Loss of blood supply in the finger.\n    \n*   Recurrence of syndactyly.\n    \n*   Complications associated with different skin grafts.\n    \n*   Tightening of the muscles, ligaments, tendons, or skin.\n    \n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Simple syndactyly surgery leads to independent, freely mobile fingers by significantly improving the hand appearance. In comparison, complex syndactyly surgery is associated with mobility loss due to the high risk of skin tightening and scarring. The parents are instructed to keep the stockinette in place to prevent the child from contaminating the area. Scar tissue formation can be avoided with skin massage or silicone gel sheets.\n\n【33】Article Resources\n\n【34】*   Syndactyly Release  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115922/\n*   Syndactyly Repair with a Straight-Line Technique: A Case Series  \n    https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/journals/case-reviews/issues/v1n2/gundlapalli-syndactyly/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "290d29ff-bf57-479f-9c48-df0d278224d8", "title": "Constipation Symptoms - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Constipation Symptoms - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Constipation is when a person has less than three bowel movements in a week with hard, dry, and lumpy stools. The person faces difficulties in passing the stool and feels that not all the stool has passed. However, constipation is not a disease; it is a normal disorder that can be an underlying symptom in some other diseases. The duration of constipation may vary from one person to another depending on the process of digestion, food intake, or the causing disease behind it. It is a common condition that can affect any age group or population.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Constipation?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Constipation can have more than one cause at a time.\n\n【4】The causes of constipation include:\n\n【5】*   Delayed movement of stool through the colon due to slow peristalsis. This can be due to any muscle which delays the muscle movements of the gastrointestinal tract.\n    \n*   Consumption of antacids which contain calcium and aluminum.\n    \n*   Anticholinergics which are used to treat the conditions of muscle spasms in the intestine, or antispasmodic drugs, may cause constipation.\n    \n*   Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease can also cause constipation. Parkinson's is a condition in which movement is altered due to the inability of nerve cells in the brain to produce a chemical called dopamine.\n    \n*   Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the heart's blood vessels and muscle cells, thus relaxing the blood vessels.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Preventing Constipation Naturally\n    \n    Can constipation be related to high sugar levels?\n    \n    Can constipation in my 9-month-old baby be due to antibiotics?\n    \n*   Iron supplements in cases of vitamin or iron deficiency can also cause constipation.\n    \n*   Irritable bowel syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur in the abdomen, including constipation and abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Pelvic floor disorders are conditions in which the pelvic muscles or connective tissues get weak or injured, leading to delayed stool movement in the colon, thus causing constipation.\n    \n*   Some antidepressants used to treat anxiety and depression can also cause constipation.\n    \n\n【6】What Are the Daily Routine Changes Which Can Lead To Constipation?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   The change in bowel movement can occur in a few conditions, such as:\n*   Traveling from one place to another can lead to constipation as an adaptation issue.\n*   Insufficient intake of fluids and water.\n*   In pregnancy cases, digestion can be altered, leading to constipation.\n*   Old age and constipation are very much related to each other.\n*   Changes in some medicines or consumption of antibiotics to treat some bacterial infections.\n*   Consumption of fewer fibers in the diet can create slow bowel movements.\n*   Inadequate physical activity and exercise can also lead to constipation or delayed bowel.\n*   Hypothyroidism is a condition in which thyroid hormone is deficient. One of the symptoms of the condition is constipation.\n*   Inflammation is due to inflammatory conditions such as diverticulitis and proctitis.\n*   Celiac disease is when the body is intolerant to gluten leading to constipation and other digestive issues.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Constipation?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】The Mild Symptoms of Constipation Include:\n\n【10】*   Lesser than three bowel movements in a week.\n    \n*   Difficulty in passing out stools, which can be painful in some cases.\n    \n*   Hard, lumpy, and dry stools with a strong foul smell.\n    \n*   An unsatisfactory feeling of stool not passed completely from the rectum.\n    \n*   Sometimes bleeding from the anal lining due to very hard and dry stool.\n    \n\n【11】Some of the Severe Symptoms of Constipation Are:\n\n【12】*   Bleeding from the rectum frequently during bowel movements.\n    \n*   Constant and prolonged pain in the abdomen.\n    \n*   Fever and pain in the back side of the abdomen.\n    \n*   Sudden weight loss and loss of appetite.\n    \n\n【13】How to Diagnose Constipation?\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】*   **Medical and Family History**: The history of any surgery in the gastrointestinal tract or anemia can be significant in diagnosing constipation. The periods of bowel movement and the details about the color and texture of stool are important to understand the cause of constipation.\n    \n*   **Physical Examination**: It involves palpation of the abdomen to check for any tenderness or swelling, listening to the sounds of the abdomen with the help of a stethoscope, and checking for chances of dehydration. It also includes a rectal examination to check for the presence of any infection or bleeding.\n    \n*   **Blood Tests**: Blood tests are suggested to investigate anemia, celiac disease, or conditions like hypothyroidism.\n    \n*   **Stool Tests**: Stool tests help to find traces of blood or other infectious microorganisms which can cause constipation.\n    \n*   **Urine Tests**: Urine tests to evaluate diseases such as diabetes.\n    \n*   **Endoscopy**: The doctor performs an endoscopy to look for any problems in the gastrointestinal tract.\n    \n*   **Colonoscopy**: A tube with a camera is inserted in the colon to look for any deformities in the large intestine.\n    \n*   **Imaging Tests**: Imaging tests include magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and lower gastrointestinal series.\n    \n\n【15】What Is the Treatment for Constipation?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】The treatment for constipation includes the following factors:\n\n【17】*   In cases of constipation, it is important to include lots of fiber in the diet. The fibrous foods are vegetables and fruits, which act as laxatives and improve bowel movement. Consumption of lots of water and fluids in the diet also improves bowel movements.\n*   Physical activities and exercises are also necessary for a good and regular bowel movement.\n    \n*   The doctor may advise having a specific bowel movement time that should be followed every day. In some cases, a bowel movement every day after breakfast can be tried as the food intake stimulates the colon to pass feces to the rectum.\n    \n*   Prevent the consumption of some medicines or healthcare supplements that can cause constipation.\n    \n*   The doctor can also advise using laxatives in cases of severe constipation, but always for a short duration, as it can lead to diarrhea.\n    \n*   Several stimulants or stool softeners can be advised to cure constipation.\n    \n*   The doctor may advise medicines such as Lubiprostone which helps to increase fluid in the body, makes the stool softer and reduces abdominal pain. Biofeedback therapy can be recommended by healthcare professionals to change musculature movements in cases of constipation due to weak muscles of the gastrointestinal tract.\n    \n*   Surgery is advised in cases of rectal prolapse where there can be a blockage in the path of stool.\n    \n\n【18】**Conclusion:**\n\n【19】Constipation is a common phenomenon that affects almost every human being sometimes in life. However, if the situation persists for a long duration, it can cause severe issues and infection. So the treatment of constipation is important. The symptoms of constipation include hard, dry stools with difficulty in bowel movements.\n\n【20】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【21】* * *\n\n【22】#### **1.**\n\n【23】#### **How Does the Body Feel in Constipation?**\n\n【24】Constipation is characterized by the painful and delayed movement of stools from the digestive tract. A constipated person experiences the following:  \n\\- Pain or straining on bowel movements.  \n\\- Lumpy or hard stools.  \n\\- Blockage in the rectum.  \n\\- The person feels that he cannot completely pass stools through the rectum.\n\n【25】#### **2.**\n\n【26】#### **What Are Some of the Different Types of Constipation?**\n\n【27】Constipation is a medical terminology for painful or difficult bowel movements. The two types of constipation are described below:  \n\\- Primary Constipation - It implies that constipation is the major problem and is not the symptom of underlying medical diseases. The other types of primary constipation include the following  \n\\- Outlet constipation.  \n\\- Slow transit constipation.  \n\\- Normal transit constipation.  \n\\- Secondary Constipation - It occurs due to underlying medical conditions.\n\n【28】#### **3.**\n\n【29】#### **When Can Constipation Turn Serious?**\n\n【30】   \nConstipation is not a medical emergency or a life-threatening condition. However, the patient might need to visit the emergency room if he did not have bowel movements for prolonged periods. In addition, the condition can turn serious if constipation symptoms are accompanied by bloating or severe abdominal pain.\n\n【31】#### **4.**\n\n【32】#### **Which Medications Act Fast Against Constipation?**\n\n【33】Stimulant laxatives have proven effective in providing fast relief against constipation. Bisacodyl is one of the most commonly used stimulant laxatives that elevates the fluid and salt levels in the intestines. As a result, bowel movements occur within 15 to 60 minutes.\n\n【34】#### **5.**\n\n【35】#### **What Happens if Constipation Is Left Untreated for Prolonged Periods?**\n\n【36】People with constipation rarely experience any complications in the long run. However, if left untreated for prolonged periods, constipation symptoms can worsen, resulting in piles or hemorrhoids, blockage of the rectum due to the presence of hard stools, and bowel incontinence or leakage of watery stools.\n\n【37】#### **6.**\n\n【38】#### **When Should a Person Consult the Doctor for Constipation?**\n\n【39】A person need not be worried about the occasional episodes of constipation. However, the patient must consult the doctor under the following circumstances:  \n\\- Presence of blood in stools.  \n\\- Abdominal pain, vomiting, or nausea.  \n\\- Family history or colorectal cancer.  \n\\- The person has been constipated for more than three weeks.\n\n【40】#### **7.**\n\n【41】#### **What Are the Ten Most Common Food Items That Can Cause Constipation?**\n\n【42】Several food items can worsen or ease the symptoms of constipation. Hence, a constipated person must avoid the following foods:  \n\\- Unripe bananas.  \n\\- Caffeine.  \n\\- Chewing gums.  \n\\- Processed grains.  \n\\- Alcohol.  \n\\- Gluten-containing foods.  \n\\- Dairy products.  \n\\- Red meat.  \n\\- Fried or fast foods.  \n\\- Eggs.\n\n【43】#### **8.**\n\n【44】#### **How Should a Constipated Person Sleep?**\n\n【45】A constipated patient must rest a firm pillow between the knees and the other pillow to support the spine. People who sleep on their left side get relieved of constipation symptoms easily. This is because gravity allows the passage of waste from the ascending to the transverse colon and finally to the descending colon. Finally, one has easy bowel movements in the morning.\n\n【46】#### **9.**\n\n【47】#### **Can Constipation Make a Person Sick?**\n\n【48】Constipation can make a person sick if left unattended for a long. It results in the buildup of stools in the intestine and food in the stomach. As a result, the equilibrium of gut bacteria gets disturbed, resulting in nausea, vomiting, bloating, or abdominal pain.\n\n【49】#### **10.**\n\n【50】#### **Can Warm Water Relieve Constipation Symptoms?**\n\n【51】Drinking plenty of water or staying hydrated is one of the best measures to get rid of constipation. Warm water provides an additional benefit because it helps in the breakdown of food, stimulates bowel movements, and reduces the risk of pain and straining during bowel movements.\n\n【52】#### **11.**\n\n【53】#### **Can Bed Rest Cure Constipation?**\n\n【54】The most significant fact to be noted is that bed rest does not cure constipation. Rather it increases the risk of constipation because people who stay in bed for long have reduced bowel movements. Immobility or bed rest reduces colon contractions resulting in delayed bowel movements.\n\n【55】Article Resources\n\n【56】*   Constipation  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation\n*   Constipation  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/constipation\n*   Constipation  \n    https://familydoctor.org/condition/constipation/\n*   Constipation in Children  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Constipation.aspx", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, the condition seems to be more prevalent in males than females.\n    \n\n【7】*   **Sexual Orientation**: All sexual orientation types may be affected by compulsive sexual behavior.\n    \n\n【8】How Is Compulsive Sexual Behavior Classified?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Compulsive sexual behavior is classified as:\n\n【10】**Paraphilic Behaviors:** Behaviors that fall outside of the norm for sexual behaviors.\n\n【11】These include:\n\n【12】*   **Sexual Masochism:** Intentional participation in sexual activities that involve being treated in a derogatory manner or hurt and abused to experience sexual excitement.\n    \n\n【13】*   **Sexual Sadism:** Infliction of abuse and suffering (physical or psychological) on another person to experience sexual satisfaction and excitement.\n    \n\n【14】*   **Exhibitionism:** Exhibiting one's genitals or private parts to adults or children of the opposite or same gender in an attempt to shock or surprise.\n    \n\n【15】*   **Voyeurism:** Deriving sexual pleasure from watching a person who is naked, disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity.\n    \n\n【16】*   **Fetishism:** Experiencing intense sexual arousal from focusing or obsessing on non-genital areas and objects.\n    \n\n【17】*   **Transvestic Fetishism:** Erotic interest and obsession with cross-dressing.\n    \n\n【18】*   **Pedophilia:** Perverted sexual interest towards children or minors.\n    \n\n【19】*   **Frotteurism:** Rubbing one's genitals against a non-consenting individual in an attempt to experience sexual excitement.\n    \n\n【20】**Non-Paraphilic Behaviors:**This refers to the frequent practice of common sexual behaviors, including:\n\n【21】*   Compulsive masturbation.\n    \n\n【22】*   Frequent extramarital affairs.\n    \n\n【23】*   Excessive pornographic use.\n    \n\n【24】*   Paying prostitutes for sex.\n    \n\n【25】*   Frequent visits to strip clubs.\n    \n\n【26】What Causes Compulsive Sexual Behavior?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【27】*   **Illnesses:** Patients with tumors and neurological conditions such as epilepsy and dementia may display hypersexual behavior.\n    \n\n【28】*   **Medications:** Patients on medications for Parkinson's disease may also show hypersexual behavior.\n    \n\n【29】*   **Hormonal Changes:** The role of sex hormones is not correctly understood, but it is known that testosterone levels affect sexual functioning so any variations may contribute to compulsive sexual behavior.\n    \n\n【30】*   **Chemical Imbalance in the Brain:** Chemicals that affect and regulate a person's mood, such as serotonin and dopamine, may influence compulsive sexual behavior when present in high levels.\n    \n\n【31】*   **Brain Pathway Changes:** Compulsive sexual behavior can change brain circuits and pathways over time, leading to the need for more explicit sexual content and practices to achieve sexual satisfaction.\n    \n\n【32】What Are the Risk Factors for Compulsive Sexual Behavior?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   **Health:** Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression can be especially problematic and cause compulsive sexual behavior.\n    \n\n【34】*   **Substance Abuse:** Patients with a history of substance abuse tend to become addicted to various sexual practices.\n    \n\n【35】*   **Access to Sexual Content:** The easy access that people have to sexual content, including imaginative and intensive images, videos, and text, makes it easy to form an addiction.\n    \n\n【36】*   History of sexual or physical abuse.\n    \n\n【37】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Compulsive Sexual Behavior?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   **Sexual Fantasies and Behavior:** The patient experiences intense, uncontrollable sexual urges and fantasies that affect their lives and relationships.\n    \n\n【39】*   **Remorse:** The patient engages in the behavior when the urge begins since they feel driven to do so. However, they regret the action immediately afterward and experience feelings of guilt.\n    \n\n【40】*   **Escape Tactic:** In some people, compulsive sexual behavior is a means to escape from feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.\n    \n\n【41】*   **Relationship Issues:** Patients have difficulty getting rid of the habit and consequently suffer in personal and professional relationships, and they find it hard to form or maintain relationships.\n    \n\n【42】How Is Compulsive Sexual Behavior Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【43】**1\\. Psychological Evaluation:** A psychological evaluation performed by the doctor or therapist will usually involve diagnosis based on criteria as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a publication of the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\n【44】**2\\. Screening Instruments:** Screening instruments are usually questionnaires that assess addiction based on the patient's responses. This can often mean that misdiagnosis is possible since the questionnaires rely on the patient's honesty. Some of the screening tests that might be used are:\n\n【45】*   **The Sexual Addiction Screening Test:** A self-report checklist for symptoms, consisting of 25 items. This helps identify risky behaviors predisposing to sexual addiction and compulsive sexual behavior.\n    \n\n【46】*   **Total Sexual Outlet:** Total sexual outlet is a behavioral screening test that identifies seven sexual orgasms per week as indicative of at-risk behavior - such individuals may need further testing.\n    \n\n【47】How Is Compulsive Sexual Behavior Managed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Management of compulsive sexual behavior would rely on psychosocial therapy, pharmacotherapy, and self-help.\n\n【49】**1\\. Psychosocial Therapy:** Psychosocial treatment programs for compulsive sexual behavior are usually directed at identifying the beliefs and triggers that influence sexual urges. They also help to identify better alternatives and coping strategies.\n\n【50】The commonest psychosocial approaches are:\n\n【51】*   **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT encourages people to find the triggers that precipitate unhealthy sexual activity in them. They are then given tools to cope better, such as redirecting their attention, or ensuring a lack of privacy, to prevent easy access to environments that facilitate such behavior.\n    \n\n【52】*   **Psychodynamic Psychotherapy:** Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on increasing the awareness of unconscious thoughts contributing to specific sexual behavior or behaviors. It attempts to allow the individual to gain fresh insight into their motivations and find solutions.\n    \n\n【53】*   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy:** This therapy falls under the realm of CBT and focuses on accepting the intrusive sexual urges and thoughts that recur and committing to strategies that involve alternative actions.\n    \n\n【54】*   **Family Therapy and Couples Therapy:** These are useful in encouraging better relationships between partners and minimizing feelings of shame and guilt.\n    \n\n【55】**2\\. Pharmacotherapy:** Medications have not yet been explicitly approved for compulsive sexual behavior. However, certain drugs used for different disorders might help with symptomatic treatment and treatment of underlying conditions:\n\n【56】*   **Mood Stabilizers:** Valproic acid, Lithium.\n    \n\n【57】*   **Opiate Antagonist:** Naltrexone.\n    \n\n【58】*   **Antidepressants:** Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n    \n\n【59】*   **Atypical Antidepressant:** Nefazodone.\n    \n\n【60】*   **Anti-androgens:** Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Cyproterone acetate.\n    \n\n【61】*   **Antiepileptics:** Topiramate.\n    \n\n【62】**3\\. Self-help:** Self-help would generally involve reaching out for help to self-help groups that may be conducted anonymously online or in person and provide:\n\n【63】*   Knowledge and awareness of the condition.\n    \n\n【64】*   Resources for support.\n    \n\n【65】*   Options for treatment.\n    \n\n【66】*   Resources for coping.\n    \n\n【67】*   Behavioral change strategies.\n    \n\n【68】*   Help and support in case of relapse.\n    \n\n【69】**4\\. Surgery:** This option is a rarely-used last resort. It involves castration to reduce testosterone levels and decrease urges. A surgical approach is helpful in those with paraphilic compulsive sexual behaviors rather than non-paraphilic compulsive sexual behaviors. It is mainly preferred for criminal offenders to discourage them from performing the same acts again.\n\n【70】How Can Compulsive Sexual Behavior Be Prevented?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】Compulsive sexual behavior cannot be ascribed to a specific cause and is therefore difficult to prevent. However, certain practices and self-regulatory techniques can make a difference:\n\n【72】*   Early identification and treatment of mental health disorders.\n    \n\n【73】*   Early identification and treatment of substance abuse issues.\n    \n\n【74】*   Getting help for sexual behaviors that pose problems.\n    \n\n【75】*   Avoiding situations that facilitate such behavior and put oneself and others at risk.\n    \n\n【76】What Are the Complications of Compulsive Sexual Behavior?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【77】Compulsive sexual behavior can affect the emotional, mental, interpersonal, and professional aspects of individual personalities and relationships:\n\n【78】**1\\. Personal:**\n\n【79】*   **Emotions:** Patients may experience extreme guilt and shame at their actions.\n    \n\n【80】*   **Disorders:** The individual may develop mental health conditions such as severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.\n    \n\n【81】*   **Substance Abuse:** The individual may spiral into a constant drug and alcohol use cycle.\n    \n\n【82】*   **Economic Issues:** People who overspend on sexual imagery, media, and services may be financially unstable.\n    \n\n【83】*   **Arrests:** Frequent, uncontrolled sexual urges and drives may lead to sexual offense and eventual arrests.\n    \n\n【84】**2\\. Interpersonal:**\n\n【85】*   **Partners and Families:** Patients may have fractured relationships with their significant others and families.\n    \n\n【86】*   **Sexually Transmitted Infections:** Patients may contract and pass on sexually transmitted infections, leading to further relational problems and trust issues.\n    \n\n【87】*   **Jobs:** The focus on sexual stimulations and urges may take away from time spent working and decrease productivity, leading to lousy working relationships, a negative reputation, and job struggles.\n    \n\n【88】**Conclusion:**\n\n【89】Struggling with compulsive sexual behavior can be difficult and lead to breakdowns in personal and interpersonal emotions and relationships. Therefore, it is essential to seek treatment if the behavior becomes a serious issue and to maintain an open, positive approach that will help to identify alternatives and adaptive techniques.\n\n【90】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【91】* * *\n\n【92】#### **1.**\n\n【93】#### **How to Manage Compulsive Sexual Behavior?**\n\n【94】Management of compulsive sexual behavior includes the following options:  \nPharmacotherapy:  \n\\- Valproic acid.  \n\\- Lithium.  \n\\- Naltrexone.  \n\\- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  \n\\- Nefazodone.  \n\\- Medroxyprogesterone acetate.  \n\\- Cyproterone acetate.  \n\\- Topiramate.  \nPsychosocial Therapy:  \n\\- Cognitive-behavioral therapy.  \n\\- Acceptance and commitment therapy.  \n\\- Psychodynamic psychotherapy.  \n\\- Family therapy.  \n\\- Couples therapy.  \nSelf-Help:  \n\\- Obtaining resources for information, coping strategies, relapse support, behavioral change techniques, and general help and support.\n\n【95】#### **2.**\n\n【96】#### **What Disorder Is Hypersexuality a Symptom Of?**\n\n【97】Hypersexuality occurs mainly as a result of neurological disorders that can cause an imbalance of neurotransmitters.

First, a stent is placed to keep the shunt. An interventional radiologist does this procedure with the use of image guidance. Next, a tunnel is made through the liver to connect the portal vein, which carries the blood from the digestive organs to the liver to the hepatic vein (the vein that carries blood from the liver to the heart). After that, a stent is placed in the shunt to keep it open. This procedure is done in patients with portal hypertension.\n\n【2】Portal hypertension can result in the backflow of blood from the liver back to the veins in the spleen, intestines, and lower esophagus, resulting in enlarged vessels, bleeding, and blood pooling in the chest or abdomen. This condition is seen in people with chronic liver conditions like cirrhosis. This may also be seen in children, but they do not require a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.\n\n【3】Why Is It Done?\n---------------\n\n【4】In a normal individual with a normal liver, the blood from the intestines, spleen, and stomach flows through the liver. But when there is damage or blockage in the liver, the blood cannot flow through it. This condition is known as portal hypertension. The increased pressure results in a backflow of blood to the organs in the abdomen from the portal veins. Due to this increased pressure, the vein can rupture and cause bleeding.\n\n【5】Common causes of portal hypertension are:\n\n【6】*   **Cirrhosis -** Excessive alcohol use resulting in scarring of the liver tissue.\n    \n*   **Blood Clots -** Blood clots in the vein that carries blood to the heart from the liver.\n    \n*   **Hemochromatosis -** Increased iron levels in the liver.\n    \n*   **Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C -** This can cause excessive liver scarring.\n    \n\n【7】The symptoms of portal hypertension are:\n\n【8】*   **Variceal Bleeding -** Bleeding from the intestines, stomach, or esophagus veins.\n    \n*   **Ascites -** Pooling of fluid in the abdomen.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Hepatic Hydrothorax - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Different Imaging Techniques Used in Interventional Radiology\n    \n    Is stage 2 liver fibrosis a reversible condition?\n    \n*   **Hydrothorax -** Collection of fluid in the chest.\n    \n\n【9】This procedure allows proper blood flow into the heart, back from the liver, esophagus, and intestines.\n\n【10】How Is It Done?\n---------------\n\n【11】*   TIPS is done by inserting a flexible tube called the catheter through the skin into the vein in the neck called the jugular vein. The catheter has a tiny balloon and a metal mesh stent at the end of the catheter.\n    \n*   The catheter is inserted into the vein in the liver using an X-ray machine.\n    \n*   To make it more visible, a dye, which is a contrast material, is inserted into the vein.\n    \n*   The balloon is then inflated to place the stent; the patient might experience pain during this time.\n    \n*   The doctor connects the portal vein to the hepatic vein using a stent.\n    \n*   The portal vein pressure is measured at the end of the procedure to ensure it is controlled.\n    \n*   Then the catheter is then removed.\n    \n*   A small bandage is placed over the neck area, and there are usually no stitches.\n    \n*   The procedure lasts for about 60 to 90 minutes to complete.\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Benefits and the Risks Associated With TIPS?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The benefits of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are:\n\n【14】*   A TIPS is designed in such a way as to produce a physiological result similar to a surgical shunt or bypass without doing the surgery.\n    \n*   TIPS has a shorter recovery time than surgery as it is minimally invasive.\n    \n*   The TIPS procedure will have less effect on future liver transplantation if required than an open surgical bypass as there is minimal scar formation in the abdomen.\n    \n*   The stent placed to keep the shunt open is placed entirely inside the affected liver so it is removed during transplantation.\n    \n*   The TIPS is effective in reducing variceal bleeding in the majority of cases.\n    \n*   There is no requirement for an incision on the skin; instead, a small nick is made in the skin and does not require stitches.\n    \n\n【15】The risks of TIPS are mentioned below:\n\n【16】*   The procedure which requires penetration through the skin will have the risk of infection, but the risk of getting an infection and requiring antibiotic treatment is less than one in 1000 people.\n    \n*   The chance of allergic reaction towards the contrast material used for the venograms. There is a concern for kidney failure (permanent or temporary) from using the contrast material, especially in people with affected kidney function.\n    \n*   There are certain risks in cases where the catheter is inserted inside the blood vessels. There is a risk of damage to the blood vessels, bruising, or bleeding at the puncture site and infection. The doctor will take appropriate measures to prevent these infections.\n    \n\n【17】Other possible complications of the procedure include:\n\n【18】*   Fever.\n    \n*   Stiffness of muscles in the neck.\n    \n*   There is bruising at the point of insertion in the neck.\n    \n*   There can be a delay in stenosis or narrowing inside the stent, but it is less common with the new generation stents.\n    \n\n【19】Other serious complications were seen in very few people, less than five percent of people, and they include:\n\n【20】*   Complete blockage of the stent and rapid occurrence of the symptoms.\n    \n*   Infection of the stent.\n    \n*   There may be abdominal bleeding that requires a blood transfusion.\n    \n*   There can be severe liver injury or bleeding resulting from a laceration to the hepatic artery, requiring immediate intervention or transfusion.\n    \n*   Congestive heart failure or heart arrhythmias.\n    \n*   A rare complication is radiation injury to the skin (it may happen in complex and lengthy procedures requiring extended fluoroscopy use).\n    \n*   Death.\n    \n\n【21】What Are the Limitations of TIPS?\n---------------------------------\n\n【22】When the patient has advanced-stage liver disease, there are chances of worsening the liver condition after the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Therefore, if the liver failure is severe, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt might not be used to treat the disease. Instead, a different treatment method might be opted to control the symptoms. The patient might also develop encephalopathy, a condition in which the patient is in an altered and confused mental state due to an alteration of brain function. This results from a build-up of toxic material in the blood, usually filtered out by the liver. This procedure will let these toxic substances bypass the liver, so a patient with encephalopathy due to liver disease will not be the best person to receive this treatment. Encephalopathy may be treated with a special diet, medications, or by revising the stent, but sometimes the stent must be blocked intentionally to solve the problem.\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts is a procedure done to connect the portal veins to the adjacent blood vessels guided through X-ray. The shunt is kept open by using a stent. Since it is an X-ray-guided procedure, there is no need for open surgery. However, this is done in patients with interrupted blood flow through the liver and can result in other complications. Hence if one notices any symptoms of liver disease, consult a doctor as soon as possible to avoid complications from a late diagnosis of the condition.\n\n【25】Article Resources\n\n【26】*   NIH  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251783/\n*   Gastroliver Medicine  \n    https://gastroliver.medicine.ufl.edu/hepatology/for-patients/tips-shunt/\n*   Radiologyinfo.org  \n    https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/tips", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Muscular dystrophies are usually inherited and progressive at varying rates. Rigid spine syndrome is a form of congenital muscular dystrophy affecting the neck and torso muscles. It is a rare disease, the prevalence of which is unknown.\n\n【2】What Is Rigid Spine Syndrome?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Rigid spine syndrome is a rare congenital muscular dystrophic condition. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive rigidity of the spinal muscles leading to an abnormal posture or curvature of the spine and muscle weakness. Rigid spine syndrome is also known as severe spine muscular dystrophy.\n\n【4】What Causes Rigid Spine Syndrome?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Rigid spine syndrome is a genetic disease, meaning the syndrome is caused due to one or more genes that are not working correctly.\n    \n*   Rigid spine syndrome is caused due to the mutations of SEPN1 (SELENON) and ACTA1 genes.\n    \n*   SELENON gene mutations cause about 40 percent of rigid spine syndrome cases.\n    \n*   SELENON gene produces information for the production of a protein called selenoprotein N. The exact function of this protein is not established, but it is believed to play a role in the formation of muscle tissue before birth and muscle function after birth.\n    \n*   The mode of inheritance of rigid spine syndrome is autosomal recessive, which means one copy of the mutated gene from both parents is inherited for the individual to develop the disease.\n    \n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Rigid Spine Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Symptoms of rigid spine syndrome start appearing in newborn and infant stages. The severity and number of symptoms differ among individuals affected by this syndrome. Symptoms of rigid spine syndrome affect different body systems. Some of the signs and symptoms associated with this syndrome are listed below.\n\n【8】**Very Frequent Symptoms**\n\n【9】*   Abnormal skeletal morphology with abnormalities in the bones' form, size, or structure.\n    \n*   Spinal rigidity results in reduced ability to move the spine and reduced neck and trunk movements.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    What is the cause and treatment of muscular dystrophy?\n    \n    Fukuyama Type Congenital Muscular Dystrophy\n    \n    IPEX Syndrome : A Rare Autoimmune Genetic Disorder\n    \n*   Scoliosis refers to an atypical lateral curvature of the spine.\n    \n*   Myopathy is a disease of the muscles affecting the muscle fibers and their functions.\n    \n*   Generalized muscle hypotonia ( decreased muscle tone).\n    \n*   Neck muscle weakness results in reduced strength of the neck muscles.\n    \n*   Respiratory insufficiency causes impairment of the gas exchange and breathing difficulties.\n    \n\n【10】**Other Frequent Symptoms**\n\n【11】*   Poor head control with difficulty in maintaining the correct position of the head while standing or sitting.\n    \n*   Muscle contractures refer to the tightening and stiffness of the muscles and the shortening of the muscle length.

{"seq_id": "e5aa116e-8d53-45ee-b237-cde8b48eaa1e", "title": "Virilization - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Virilization - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The development of male features and characteristics in a female is termed virilization. It is an abnormal condition and is often associated with physical and psychological adverse effects on the affected individual. Virilization is also referred to as the normal process occurring in a male’s body during and after puberty. Symptoms include excess facial and body hair, baldness, acne, deepening of the voice, increased muscularity, and an increased sex drive. The most common causes of virilization are; adrenal tumors, anabolic drugs, exposure to excess androgen (male sex hormones) during prenatal development, etc.\n\n【2】What Is Virilization?\n---------------------\n\n【3】When a female develops typical adult male characteristics, the condition is called virilization. The condition is associated with androgen (the primary male sex hormone). It is a condition related to the development of enhanced masculine characteristics in women, primarily due to excess androgens production by the adrenal glands. Androgens are male sex steroid hormones, like testosterone, responsible for developing male features. Both genders produce androgens. The adrenal glands and the testicles in males principally produce androgens. Whereas the adrenal glands mainly produce androgens in females, the ovaries produce a small amount. However, in females, androgens are present in a minimal quantity compared to males. Because of the associated symptoms of the condition, virilization is also often referred to as masculinization.\n\n【4】What Causes Virilization?\n-------------------------\n\n【5】The causes of virilization include the following:\n\n【6】*   Excessive androgen or testosterone production. Excess production of androgens causes virilization, which is usually caused by a tumor in or enlargement of the adrenal gland, a tumor in the ovary, or unusual hormone synthesis by the ovaries.\n    \n*   Adrenal hyperplasia is the enlargement of the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland, especially the part responsible for producing hormones.\n    \n*   Adenoma of the adrenal gland (hormone-producing tumors).\n    \n*   Virilization can also be caused by cancer outside the adrenal gland that produces androgens.\n    \n*   Anabolic drugs: The use of androgen pills and injections to increase muscle mass and performance enhancement.\n    \n*   A congenital defect that causes an abnormality in the enzyme of the adrenal gland.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna - An Overview\n    \n    Adult Granulosa Cell Tumor - Causes, Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Androgenic Alopecia (Pattern Baldness)\n    \n*   Virilization can be caused by any medical condition that promotes an imbalance of the sex hormone.\n    \n*   In newborns, virilization can occur due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the baby or the mother. Additionally, it can develop due to certain medications the mother takes during pregnancy.\n    \n*   In girls undergoing puberty, virilization can occur due to PCOS (polycystic ovarian disorder), anabolic drugs, tumors of the ovaries, or adrenal glands (that produce androgens).\n    \n*   In adult women, virilization can occur due to steroid drugs and tumors of the ovaries and the adrenal glands.\n    \n\n【7】What Is Prenatal Virilization?\n------------------------------\n\n【8】When an excessive amount of androgen is produced by the fetal adrenal glands or an excess of androgen is present in maternal blood, prenatal virilization of a genetically female baby can occur. Intersex disorders and ambiguous genitalia are frequently caused by prenatal virilization of genetic females.\n\n【9】What Is Medically Induced Virilization in Transgenders?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Hormone replacement therapy is sometimes used by transgender people who were medically identified as female at birth. However, this procedure induces virilization by generating many characteristics of normal male puberty. Many of these effects are irreversible, but others can be reversed if the transgender person discontinues or delays medical treatment.\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Virilization?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The testosterone level in a woman's body determines the signs and symptoms of virilization. Symptoms of virilization also depend on the sex and age of the individual.\n\n【13】**Symptoms due to low testosterone levels include:**\n\n【14】*   Facial hair growth in the beard and mustache area. The facial hair growth is usually dark and thick.\n    \n*   Increased body hair growth.\n    \n*   Acne.\n    \n*   Oily skin.\n    \n*   Oligomenorrhea (Irregular menstrual cycles).\n    \n\n【15】**Symptoms due to moderate testosterone levels include:**\n\n【16】*   Androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness.\n    \n*   Atypical female fat distribution.\n    \n*   Reduction in breast size.\n    \n\n【17】**Symptoms due to high testosterone levels include:**\n\n【18】*   Clitoromegaly (clitoral enlargement).\n    \n*   Muscle growth in male muscle pattern.\n    \n*   Deep voice.\n    \n*   Shrinking of the uterus.\n    \n\n【19】In men, virilization can cause infertility due to an excess adrenal hormone present in the body. These hormones suppress the normal functioning of the testes.\n\n【20】How Is Virilization Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【21】The diagnosis of virilization is made with the help of detailed medical and family history, thorough clinical and physical evaluation, and several diagnostic tests. These tests include:\n\n【22】*   **Blood Examinations:** Blood samples are collected and sent to the laboratory to check the levels of several hormones present in the body. The levels of testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, etc., are measured.\n    \n*   **Dexamethasone Suppression Test:** Some clinicians employ a dexamethasone suppression test to assess whether the problem is an adenoma or enlargement of the adrenal glands when the level of adrenal androgens is exceptionally high. Dexamethasone stops the adrenal glands from producing androgens in case of adrenal gland enlargement. Whereas, Dexamethasone decreases androgen production just slightly or not if the problem is an adenoma or cancer.\n    \n*   **Imaging Tests:** Several imaging tests like CT scan (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are done in cases where a tumor is suspected.\n    \n\n【23】How Is Virilization Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【24】Treatment of virilization is done in the following ways:\n\n【25】*   The treatment of virilization depends primarily on the underlying cause of the condition, whether anabolic drugs, tumors, etc, cause it.\n    \n*   Surgery is advised in case of a tumor or adenomas. Adrenal cancers and hormone-producing adenomas are usually treated by surgically removing the adrenal gland (containing the tumor).\n    \n*   In the case of adrenal gland enlargement (adrenal hyperplasia), Glucocorticoids are used to reduce androgen production. Hydrocortisone is the most commonly used Glucocorticoids in the case of adrenal hyperplasia.\n    \n*   Virilization occurring due to anabolic drugs can be reversed by stopping drug intake. However, not all aspects of virilization can be reversed.\n    \n\n【26】What Is Demasculinization?\n--------------------------\n\n【27】Demasculinization means the removal of masculine characters and traits. Demasculinization naturally occurs in older men when their testosterone levels drop low in advanced age. In addition, it may occur due to medical conditions like hypogonadism, and it is artificially induced with the help of drugs like antiandrogens drugs, estrogen, etc. With the help of demasculinization, transgender women who have gone through pubertal masculinization attain physical feminine characteristics that might otherwise be hidden or never appear.\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】The prognosis of virilization treatment is good. The excess amount of androgens present in the body is generally reduced after surgical removal of adrenal tumors or cessation of the anabolic drugs. A female adult may develop virilization due to androgens exposure; many symptoms disappear after the hormones are discontinued. Reversible virilization effects include upper body muscle development, increased sweating, body odor, red blood cell count, etc. Meanwhile, irreversible virilization effects include deepening the voice, facial and body hair growth, clitoral enlargement, balding, shrinking of breasts, etc.\n\n【30】Article Resources\n\n【31】*   Virilization  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/virilization\n*   Virilization  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002339.htm\n*   Approach to the Virilizing Girl at Puberty  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33367768/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "158a22a6-b5c9-44b5-840e-0908986f500f", "title": "Ureterorrhagia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Ureterorrhagia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**What Is Ureterorrhagia?**\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Ureterorrhagia is bleeding from the urethra generally caused by irritation. It is characterized by a normal urinary stream accompanied by a few drops of bright red blood at the end or blood spots. The urine flows out of the urinary tract through the urethra. Any irritation or bleeding from the urethra is followed by the occurrence of bright red bleeding in young adolescent boys. Ureterorrhagia is a pediatric condition characterized by staining of the blood in the undergarments usually present between urination and terminal hematuria. Thus, the condition is gross hematuria. The position from which the bleeding occurs from the urethra is away from the point of attachment of the neck of the bladder. Therefore, bleeding occurs from the area of the bladder neck. Sometimes, ureterorrhagia is associated with dysuria (painful urination). The assessment of ureterorrhagia is different from any other condition as it is normal gross hematuria occurring in children. Generally, ureterorrhagia is painless and can resolve on its own over time without medical interference.\n\n【2】**What Causes Ureterorrhagia?**\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The pathology of ureterorrhagia stays ambiguous. The origin of red blood cells in the urine is generally from renal tubules, glomerular, interstitium of the urinary tract, bladder, urethra, and collecting systems. The urine dipstick test containing chemicals is used to detect microscopic blood in the urine (hematuria) and is specific and sensitive. The source of bleeding in pediatrics is generally from the glomeruli region rather than the urinary tract. Abormalities in red blood cells present in the urine are often detected through a microscope. Ureterorrhagia Is linked with abnormality in the red blood cells. Abnormalities in the red blood cells such as changes in their shape and size are characteristic features of glomerular ureterorrhagia. Such deformities in the red blood cells coupled with increased levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) are the initial signs of ureterorrhagia. An ultrasound is required in case of any signs of glomerular disease in order to assess the pathology in a detailed manner. The functional part of the kidney called the renal parenchyma is subdivided into two parts: renal medulla and renal cortex. Patients with lesions of renal parenchyma are more prone to have minor or major episodes of ureterorrhagia. Ureterorrhagia can be caused by various reasons like irritation, infection, and other injuries. The following are the causes of ureterorrhagia:\n\n【4】**Urinary Tract Infections -** The bladder portion of the urethra is generally affected either by bacterial or viral infections. A more complicated urinary tract infection involves the infection of the kidneys too.\n\n【5】*   Elevated calcium levels in the urine.\n    \n*   Bacterial or viral infections.\n    \n*   Kidney stone.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Clots in the Urine ( Hematuria ) - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Please suggest treatment for hematuria.\n    \n    I have microscopic hematuria. Is this curable?\n    \n\n【6】**Medications -** Ureterorrhagia can be initiated by using inevitable medications such as blood thinners like Aspirin, antibiotics like Penicillin, and sulfa-containing drugs. The other drugs include:\n\n【7】*   Aminoglycosides.\n    \n*   Anticonvulsants.\n    \n*   Diuretics.\n    \n*   Cyclophosphamide.\n    \n\n【8】**Glomerular Disease -** It is the most common cause of ureterorrhagia. It is a disorder of the kidneys with irregular functioning of the kidney. Following are the subtypes of different diseases falling under glomerular diseases:\n\n【9】*   Membranous nephropathy.\n    \n*   Disorders linked with the blood and blood-forming organs (hematological disorders).\n    \n*   Sickle cell disease.\n    \n*   Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\n    \n*   Goodpasture's disease.\n    \n*   Coagulopathy.\n    \n*   Von Willebrand's disease.\n    \n*   Recurrent gross hematuria.\n    \n\n【10】**How Is Ureterorrhagia Diagnosed?**\n------------------------------------\n\n【11】To clinically evaluate a child suffering from ureterorrhagia a thorough medical history, and physical examination is required. The medical history, of the patient, must include various factors such as any form of overdone exercise, the recent history of trauma, pain during urination, history of kidney stones or passing a Stone through urine, yet recent history of respiratory organ infection, and any ongoing medication such as NSAIDs. A patient's family history profile should also be made, and cases of hypertension, hematuria, renal stones, renal failures, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice are considered.\n\n【12】Regular monitoring of other major physical conditions related to ureterorrhagia should be made such as inflammation in the face and leg, weight loss, increased urinary frequency, sore throat, and back pain. Heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and breathing pattern should always be given priority while investigating the patient physically. The presence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and high urine output may indicate some other disorder. Similarly, blood in the urine (hematuria) and skin rashes might also change course in another direction.\n\n【13】The appearance of hematuria (blood in the urine) arising from any dysfunction in the glomerular region needs to be detected by monitoring the urine color. The urine is normally brown or cola-colored under normal circumstances, but on a macroscopic level where the disorder gets origin from the urinary tract, the urine color usually observed is pink or red.\n\n【14】Urethrorrhagia is generally diagnosed based on clinical history alone. However, if there is any anticipation to rule out bleeding then the diagnosis is made based on an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder. A uroflow study and an ultrasound is required to see if any urine is left in the bladder. Bladder and bowel emptying habits are also discussed by the urologist to further understand the child’s condition.\n\n【15】**How Is Ureterorrhagia Treated?**\n----------------------------------\n\n【16】Urethrorrhagia is usually a benign condition. It generally does not need any special treatment. Healthcare providers generally advise patients to stay hydrated and to keep the urine dilute (clear to very light yellow in color), which in turn will prevent any irritation to the lining of the urethra.\n\n【17】**Conclusion**\n\n【18】Urethrorrhagia can be intermittent in appearance and can come and go, but typically it is self-limiting and does not require prolonged follow-up. In some patients, a history of urethrorrhagia is associated with the development of strictures or narrowing of areas inside the urethra. This commonly occurs over months or years after the bleeding episode. Strictures can result in straining to empty the bladder or difficulty with urination. That is why healthcare providers typically suggest that patients with urethrorrhagia return to the clinic for a follow-up visit. Complete a uroflow examination that measures the urinary flow rate is necessary to make sure there is no evidence of narrowing can help to rule out the disease.\n\n【19】Article Resources\n\n【20】*   Urethrorrhagia  \n    https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/urethrorrhagia\n*   \\[Angiomatosis of the prepuce, the glans penis and the scrotum with ureterorrhagia in puberty\\]  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13704079/\n*   Urethral Bleeding  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/urethral-bleeding", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These bumps usually do not hurt or itch. Keratosis pilaris is sometimes called “chicken skin” because it resembles goosebumps. It commonly occurs in babies, toddlers, children, and teenagers, and the condition often worsens around puberty. However, it usually fades by age 30. Keratosis pilaris is not contagious. It is a harmless one of several types of skin bumps and growths. This condition is often considered a variant of normal skin. However, it cannot be cured or prevented. But moisturizers and prescription creams can help improve the skin appearance.\n\n【2】How Common Is Keratosis Pilaris?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Keratosis pilaris is a common condition. It is considered a skin type instead of a medical condition. About 50 % to 80 % of teenagers and 40 % of adults develop the condition at some point in their lifetime.\n\n【4】What Causes Keratosis Pilaris?\n------------------------------\n\n【5】The bumps in keratosis pilaris are collections of keratin. These bumps are often confused for clusters of small pimples. Instead, keratosis pilaris bumps occur when keratin blocks the openings of the hair follicles, causing dry, rough patches and small bumps. It is still unclear why keratin builds up in some people with keratosis pilaris and not others. It may be associated with a genetic disease or skin conditions like atopic dermatitis. Keratosis pilaris may be related to vitamin A deficiency.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Keratosis Pilaris?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The main characteristic feature of keratosis pilaris is the appearance of patches of small, rough, painless, discolored bumps on the skin.\n\n【8】The other signs and symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   Dry or itchy skin, especially on the face, forearms, chest, back, thighs, and buttocks.\n    \n*   Irritation of the bumps makes them more discolored and observable (frictional lichenoid dermatitis).\n    \n*   Rough, sandpaper-like skin where bumps appear, resembling goose flesh.\n    \n*   Worsening of the bumps in dry air and low humidity, like in the winter seasons.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Psoriasis - Causes, Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) - Causes, Symptoms and Treatment\n    \n    Keratosis Pilaris - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   Other cutaneous conditions can sometimes cause these symptoms, such as dry, itchy skin. These include eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and fungal infections.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Risk Factors for Keratosis Pilaris?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Keratosis pilaris can affect people of any age, but it is more common in babies, toddlers, children, and teenagers. In addition, some people with certain conditions are at a higher risk of developing this condition.\n\n【12】These include:\n\n【13】*   Family history of keratosis pilaris.\n    \n*   Fair or light-skinned.\n    \n*   Skin conditions, such as eczema or ichthyosis vulgaris.\n    \n*   Asthma.\n    \n*   Hypothyroidism.\n    \n*   Cushing’s syndrome.\n    \n*   Down syndrome.\n    \n*   Diabetes.\n    \n*   Obesity.\n    \n\n【14】How Is Keratosis Pilaris Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】The healthcare provider typically diagnoses keratosis pilaris with a simple physical examination of skin that shows signs of keratosis pilaris. Keratosis pilaris is easily recognized, so no laboratory testing is necessary. The location and characteristic features of the bumps can help the provider identify the condition. But if the healthcare provider is unsure, they may recommend an allergy test or a biopsy.\n\n【16】How Is Keratosis Pilaris Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【17】Keratosis pilaris is harmless and usually clears up on its own gradually. So usually, no treatment is needed. For most people, the bumps go away on their own or become less noticeable by age 30. Some people may also notice that the bumps disappear in summer and only become noticeable in winter. In the meantime, one may use moisturizers, creams, and other products available to help improve the skin's appearance. If these self-care measures do not help, the doctor may prescribe any of the following treatments:\n\n【18】**1\\. Medications:**\n\n【19】*   **Over-The-Counter Moisturizing Lotions:** Dry skin can worsen keratosis pilaris. Applying over-the-counter creams or lotions can help keep the skin hydrated and minimize and soften the bumps. Moisturizers containing ammonium lactate, alpha hydroxyl acids, lactic acid, and salicylic acids are the best to treat rough, bumpy skin and people with keratosis pilaris. Apply these moisturizers several times daily, especially after showering while the skin is still damp, to lock in the moisture. However, the acids in these moisturizers can cause stinging, redness, or skin irritation, so they are not recommended for young children.\n    \n*   **Medicated Creams:** The healthcare provider may recommend prescription-strength moisturizers. Creams with ingredients such as urea, alpha hydroxy acids, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid can help improve the symptoms of keratosis pilaris. In addition, medicated Vitamin A creams (topical retinoids) can help decrease the keratin buildup that causes keratosis pilaris. However, overuse of these medicated creams can irritate the skin.\n    \n*   **Exfoliation:** Gently wash the affected areas of the skin while showering or bathing with a loofah, washcloth, or exfoliating gel or scrub in small, circular motions. Avoid scrubbing too hard as it irritates the skin and worsens the symptoms.\n    \n*   **Laser Therapy:** A laser or light treatment may help improve the skin's discoloration and texture and reduce swelling and redness associated with keratosis pilaris. The dermatologist sometimes may add a few microdermabrasion sessions to the treatment plan to get the best results.\n    \n\n【20】**2\\. Lifestyle Changes and Home Remedies:**\n\n【21】Self-help practices do not prevent keratosis pilaris or make it disappear. But these practices help enhance the appearance of the affected skin. In addition, a few simple things can help keep the skin comfortable:\n\n【22】*   Use warm water and take shorter showers (10 minutes or less) as hot water and long showers or baths remove natural oils from the skin.\n    \n*   Avoid using harsh, drying soaps, and be gentle to the skin. For example, gently pat the skin with a towel after showering or bathing to retain moisture.\n    \n*   Apply over-the-counter creams containing urea, lactic acid, alpha hydroxy acid, or salicylic acid to loosen and remove dead skin cells.\n    \n*   While the skin is still moist from bathing, generously apply a moisturizer containing lanolin, petroleum jelly, or glycerin. These ingredients help soothe dry skin and lock in moisture. Reapply the moisturizer to the affected skin many times a day daily.\n    \n*   Because low humidity makes skin dry, use a humidifier to add moisture to the air inside the home.\n    \n*   Avoid wearing tight clothes. Protect the affected skin from friction by wearing loose clothes.\n    \n\n【23】What Is the Outcome for People With Keratosis Pilaris?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Most cases of keratosis pilaris usually clear around the mid-20s and completely disappear by age 30 without treatment. With treatment, people start seeing improvement within four to six weeks. Keratosis pilaris is not preventable. But avoiding dry skin by following a gentle skincare regimen can help improve the appearance of keratosis pilaris.\n\n【25】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【26】See a health care provider if people do not see improvement four to six weeks after initiating a treatment plan or if the keratosis pilaris affects their self-esteem or quality of life.\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】Keratosis pilaris is often a temporary skin condition that goes away over time. It usually does not cause any symptoms. But if a person experiences discomfort like itchy or dry skin, or if it affects their self-esteem, reach out to a healthcare provider. Treatment for keratosis pilaris involves medications, lifestyle modifications, and home-based remedies. See a health care provider if no improvement is seen in four to six weeks after initiating a treatment plan.\n\n【29】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【30】* * *\n\n【31】#### **1.**\n\n【32】#### **How Do I Get Rid of Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【33】Following are some of the common steps to treat keratosis pilaris,  \n\\- Apply over-the-counter medicated creams that contain urea, lactic acid, salicylic acid, or AHA (alpha hydroxy acid).  \n\\- Always pat or blot dry with a soft clean towel after a shower. This will help in retaining moisture in the skin.\n\n【34】#### **2.**\n\n【35】#### **What Causes Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【36】In simple terms, keratosis pilaris is caused due to buildup of keratin. Keratin is a hard protein that protects the skin from infection and harmful substances. The keratin buildup blocks the hair follicles leading to rough, bumpy skin.\n\n【37】#### **3.**\n\n【38】#### **Does Keratosis Pilaris Go Away on Its Own?**\n\n【39】Fortunately, most cases of keratosis pilaris go away on their own in a few days with simple at-home care with moisturizing creams. But if the condition persists for a very long time, a person must consider consulting a general physician or a dermatologist.\n\n【40】#### **4.**\n\n【41】#### **Can I Use Coconut Oil to Treat Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【42】No, coconut oil, in general, is comedogenic. This means coconut oil usually blocks the pores of the skin. Whereas in the case of keratosis pilaris, the skin is already clogged, and using coconut oil over it will only worsen the situation.\n\n【43】#### **5.**\n\n【44】#### **Can Sunlight Help in Bettering Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【45】Keratosis pilaris is known to worsen during dry winters. Therefore using a humidifier at work and at home is highly recommended. Coming to sunlight, yes, exposure to sunlight (of course with sunscreen) can soothe keratosis pilaris.\n\n【46】#### **6.**\n\n【47】#### **Can a Particular Diet Cause Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【48】No, following any particular diet or food item does not cause keratosis pilaris.\n\n【49】#### **7.**\n\n【50】#### **How Long Does It Take to Get Rid of Keratosis Pilaris Completely?**\n\n【51】Keratosis pilaris is usually considered a normal skin condition. Using moisturizers and taking good care of the skin can better the condition. However, keratosis pilaris, in most cases, is known to disappear by the age of 30.\n\n【52】#### **8.**\n\n【53】#### **Where Does Keratosis Pilaris Usually Develop?**\n\n【54】Keratosis pilaris, commonly known for giving a ‘chicken skin' appearance, can appear on the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or legs. This condition is harmless and usually disappears on its own by age 30.\n\n【55】#### **9.**\n\n【56】#### **Is It Fine if Keratosis Pilaris Becomes Itchy?**\n\n【57】Keratosis pilaris is harmless and is considered a normal skin condition. Keratosis pilaris does not usually hurt or cause any itchiness.\n\n【58】#### **10.**\n\n【59】#### **How to Stop Keratosis Pilaris From Itching?**\n\n【60】The following measures can help in soothing keratosis pilaris,  \n\\- Apply a moisturizer.  \n\\- Exfoliate the skin (do not exfoliate extremely).  \n\\- Use certain skin creams containing lactic acid, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) to help loosen the dead skin cells.  \n\\- Use a steroid cream to get rid of itching and redness.\n\n【61】#### **11.**\n\n【62】#### **What Worsens Keratosis Pilaris?**\n\n【63】Arid weather that causes dry skin can worsen keratosis pilaris. Therefore, it is essential to use a humidifier at home and work during dry winters. Also, never forget to wear moisturizers.\n\n【64】Article Resources\n\n【65】*   Keratosis Pilaris  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17758-keratosis-pilaris\n*   Keratosis pilaris  \n    mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratosis-pilaris/symptoms-causes/syc-20351149\n*   KERATOSIS PILARIS: DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT  \n    https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/keratosis-pilaris-treatment#\n*   Keratosis Pilaris  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546708/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is considered a developmental-origin odontogenic cyst and has the lowest incidence compared to other developmental cysts in the oral cavity. The most frequent location for LPC is the mandibular premolar area, followed by the anterior region of the maxilla. It is usually asymptomatic and may be a finding by the dentist on a routine radiographic examination.\n\n【2】The cysts exhibit round or ovoid radiolucent areas with sclerotic margins (less uniform borders as a reaction of the bone to the inflammatory lesion) and less than one centimeter in size. Lateral periodontal cysts are mostly associated with vital teeth, but in rare cases, they can occur around a nonvital tooth. According to research, these cysts contribute nearly 0.8 to 2 percent of all odontogenic cysts encountered clinically. LPC is more prevalent in age groups of adults, specifically between the 5th to 7th decades, with mean peak prevalence at 52 years of age and does not have any gender predilection.\n\n【3】How Can Lateral Periodontal Cysts Be Identified?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The World Health Organization (WHO) mainly classifies odontogenic cysts into two varieties based on their epithelial lining as;\n\n【5】*   Cysts of inflammatory origin.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Oral Focal Mucinosis - Etiology, Clinical, and Histopathological Features\n    \n    Common Radiographic Imaging and Views in Dentistry\n    \n    Dental X-Rays\n    \n*   Cysts of developmental origin.\n    \n\n【6】In most cases, a lateral periodontal may be diagnosed by radiographs. It presents as a well-circumscribed or teardrop-shaped radiolucent area. Due to its location, LPC can be commonly mistaken to be an endodontic or infectious lesion. The final diagnosis can be confirmed by a histopathologic examination.\n\n【7】Histologically, lateral periodontal cysts are similar to most developmental cysts, with the presence of a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium. These epithelial layers are one to five cell layers thick and often resemble the reduced enamel epithelium. The epithelial lining may also exhibit focal thickening, showing the presence of glycogen in the epithelial cells. The connective tissue below or adjacent to this epithelium exhibits a specific hyalinization zone which is a marked feature for diagnosing LPC.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Lateral Periodontal Cysts?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Based on the morphological characteristics, lateral periodontal cysts can be classified into two variants, the unicystic form and the multicystic form. A botyroid odontogenic cyst is not considered a true form of LPC, as it is a cystic lesion extending beyond the lateral area of the tooth root and has the potential for recurrence even after enucleation.\n\n【10】How Is a Lateral Periodontal Cyst Formed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【11】The exact pathogenesis of lateral periodontal cysts is not clearly defined, but according to research, one of these three hypotheses may explain its possible origin and development :\n\n【12】1.  According to histologic observations, the cyst is lined by nonkeratinized epithelium, indicating that the reduced enamel epithelium is retained. This cyst is of developmental origin, supported by the patterns observed through immunohistochemical methods.\n    \n2.  The cyst arises from the remnants of the dental lamina, which is attributed to the fact that LPC presents with specific glycogen-rich clear cells.\n    \n3.  The cyst originates from the remnants of epithelial cell rests of Malassez, which may be responsible for the adjacent location.\n    \n\n【13】How Can Lateral Periodontal Cysts Be Diagnosed and Managed?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The diagnosis of a lateral periodontal cyst is considered when the cyst location is restricted to the periodontal segment of the tooth, anterior maxillary tooth roots, or around mandibular premolar roots. The radiographic findings play a major role in establishing a diagnosis. Differentiation between LPC from other cysts stemming from inflammatory origins or potential keratocystic odontogenic tumors is based on histopathological studies and analysis. After establishing a confirmatory diagnosis, treatment is carefully planned and executed to prevent the recurrence of the lesion.\n\n【15】The main treatment modality adopted for LPC is the surgical enucleation of the cyst. This procedure can be performed conservatively (without causing any injury to the adjacent teeth) by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. The clinical and radiological outcome of the treatment is satisfactory, and the recurrence of the lateral periodontal cyst is usually uncommon.\n\n【16】**Conclusion**\n\n【17】Lateral periodontal cysts are non-keratinized and non-inflammatory cysts of developmental origin located lateral to the root of a vital tooth. It is usually asymptomatic and may be identified on a routine radiographic examination. The lateral periodontal cyst must be considered in the differential diagnosis for any radiolucent lesion around or adjacent to the roots of the teeth. Timely diagnosis, histopathological examination, and appropriate treatment can be useful in eliminating the lesion along with preventing the recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Blurry vision, seeing double or ghost images, trouble seeing well at night, and sensitivity to light are some symptoms of cataracts. It is the most common eyesight issue with age and usually starts showing symptoms post-40. Only surgery can remove cataracts.\n\n【2】How Does Cataract Surgery Work?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The eye surgeon will perform cataract surgery by removing the eye's natural lens, which has already turned cloudy. An artificial lens will then replace it. The newly placed lens is called an intraocular lens (IOL). These Lenses are of different types. Multifocal (allows one to see both near and far objects), monofocal (provides vision at one distance), or accommodative (uses the natural movement of the muscles of the eyes to shift focus) are some examples.\n\n【4】No medications or eye drops can reverse the formation of cataracts. But, initially, changing glasses can improve vision for the time being. Not all cataracts have to be removed surgically. Some cataracts may not show symptoms and may not cause any interference with routine activities. Surgery should be considered if eyesight issues disable the person from doing activities like driving, reading, and performing everyday physical activities. The apt time to perform the surgery may differ for all individuals and depends entirely on the symptoms present.\n\n【5】What Are the Complications of Cataract Surgery?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Fortunately, the majority of cataract surgeries end up being successful. But the surgery still has the potential to show severe complications and may result in pain or permanent vision loss.\n\n【7】*   **Endophthalmitis -** It is a severe eye infection that occurs post-cataract surgery. It is a bacterial infection usually caused by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus bacteria. The symptoms usually develop after one week of surgery and include redness, pain, yellow or greenish discharge from the eyes, swelling, and decreased vision. It is necessary to seek medical help immediately, otherwise it can lead to permanent loss of vision and the eye. Antibiotic injections usually treat it with or without surgery.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Presbyopia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Dry Eyes After Cataract Surgery\n    \n    Does my wife's condition require surgery?\n    \n\n【8】*   **Retinal Detachment -** Retinal detachment occurs when the retina (light-sensitive part of the eye) develops a tear or hole and gradually detaches from the wall of the eye. The blood circulation to the retina will also get reduced and degenerate the retina irreversibly. The irreversible damage caused to the retina can cause permanent vision loss. Retinal tears are usually treated by laser or cryotherapy (freezing procedure). Retinal detachment can be treated by surgical procedure. After treatment, consistent monitoring is necessary in both cases.\n    \n*   **Eye Inflammation -** Eye inflammation can develop after cataract surgery, and the vision may be foggy and blurred. Anti-inflammatory eye drops can cure the condition.\n    \n\n【9】*   **Light Sensitivity-** Mild light sensitivity can be due to dryness and inflammation. Severe cases may usually be due to infection or iritis (inflammation of the iris- the colored part of the eye). Steroid eye drops or using sunglasses can manage the condition.\n    \n\n【10】*   **Photopsia -** Seeing flashes of lights or floaters (spots in the vision) is called photopsia. It is caused by the gel inside the eye separating from the retina. Photopsia may get resolved on its own, and in severe cases, a surgery called a vitrectomy might be performed that replaces the gel.\n    \n\n【11】*   **Macular Edema -** The center part of the retina (light-sensitive part of the eye) that processes what is seen directly is called the macula. It becomes edematous or swollen when the fluid builds up. Proper meditation can treat the problem.\n    \n\n【12】*   **Ptosis -** Ptosis is the drooping of the eyelid and occurs due to trauma during surgery. It disappears within days or weeks after the surgery. Persisting ptosis may require surgical correction.\n    \n\n【13】*   **Intraocular Lens Dislocation -** It occurs if the newly placed lens or intra-ocular lens is not correctly seated or gets dislocated. As a result, the individual may get double vision or see the lens's edge. Immediate surgery is required to correct this condition.\n    \n\n【14】*   **Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) -** PCO occurs when opacification occurs on the back part of the lens. It is also known as a secondary cataract. It occurs when some parts of the old cataract cells are not removed during surgery. Anti-inflammatory eye drops and laser treatment can cure the condition.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Expected Side Effects of Cataract Surgery?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Post-surgical effects are inevitable in the case of any surgery. However, it may resolve independently after a few days or weeks. Some of the symptoms are:\n\n【17】*   Discomfort or itchiness in the eye.\n    \n*   Blurred vision.\n    \n*   Redness of the eye.\n    \n*   Dryness or feeling of grittiness in the eye.\n    \n*   Swelling of the eyelid.\n    \n*   Light sensitivity.\n    \n*   Residual effects of anesthesia, like nausea or vomiting.\n    \n\n【18】What Are the Post-Operative Cataract Care Steps?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Post-surgically, patients will be given counseling on using eye drops and cleaning the lid margins and surrounding areas with surgical cotton. They will also be instructed not to let any foreign body or fluid enter the eyes. The patients will also be recommended to wear sunglasses or dark glasses outdoors to protect and reduce glare.\n\n【20】The patient will be sent home wearing an eye patch and eye shield and instructed to remove them two to three hours after reaching home. They will also be instructed to use antibiotic drops and topical steroids. The individual should wear the sterile eye patch on the night following the surgery. The inpatients will get the procedures done by the nurse.\n\n【21】**Conclusion**\n\n【22】Cataract surgery is inevitable if cataracts interfere with daily activities. Therefore, it is essential to know about the procedure and its complications. But the chances of complications are less in the case of cataract surgery. Doctors and nurses will take appropriate pre-surgical and surgical care. Proper post-surgical care is also vital to preserving eye health, which has to be followed by the patient. It is also essential to have a diet rich in vitamins and minerals that can improve vision.\n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Possible Side Effects and Complications After Cataract Surgery  \n    https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/cataract-surgery.html\n*   When Should an Individual Have Cataract Surgery?  \n    https://visionaware.org/your-eye-condition/cataracts/considering-cataract-surgery/\n*   What Are Cataracts?  \n    https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-are-cataracts", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In osteoporosis, bones become fragile, giving rise to fragility fractures that are generally seen in a population above the age group of 50. Along with decreased bone mineralization rate, incidents of falls in the elderly contribute to the fragility of fractures. An essential fracture risk assessment is an assessment of falls in the elderly population. Detection of osteoporosis happens only at a much later stage when the bone starts to break, causing severe debilitating pain, hence involving the elderly age group. This can affect their ability to walk, cause postural deformities, reduce their daily activities and interfere with the patient’s quality of life.\n\n【2】Who Is at a Greater Risk of Developing Osteoporosis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Women are four times more likely to develop osteoporosis when compared to men. They develop osteoporosis at a much-advanced age, sometimes after they attain menopause. White and Asian women are more likely to develop osteoporosis compared to the black population. Women should take additional care of their bones as they might experience increased bone loss for ten years after menopause. Even though women are at a greater risk of developing this disease, men should also take care and avoid all the risk factors leading to osteoporosis, as they cannot be completely risk-free of this disease.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Osteoporosis in the Elderly?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Unfortunately, no specific cause leads to osteoporosis, but many listed risk factors exist.\n\n【6】*   A family history where a close family member had osteoporosis can put you at a higher risk of developing the disease.\n    \n*   Elderly patients with smaller bone frames compared to those who are fat with a broader bone frame are at much higher risk of osteoporotic fractures as they have an amount of bone that can quickly be resorbed.\n    \n*   Certain underlying medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, thyroid disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), celiac disease, and stroke can make the patient more prone to developing osteoporosis.\n    \n*   In addition, certain medications like steroids, anti-seizure medications, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and hormone treatments for certain cancer can increase a person’s risk of developing osteoporosis.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    I have osteoporosis.

Patients who have a history of fractured bone following a minor fall should undergo a bone density test to check for osteoporosis. A bone density test uses dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans which are low-intensity X-rays used to determine the mineral content of the patient’s bone.\n\n【12】Who Should Take This Test?\n--------------------------\n\n【13】*   Both men and women have risk factors for developing osteoporosis.\n    \n*   Post-menopausal women with high-risk factors.\n    \n*   Women in their menopause period, and a bone density test of the hip and spine of women 65 years of age or older.\n    \n*   Along with this test, a computed tomography(CT) scan and ultrasound can also be done as further investigations.\n    \n\n【14】What Is the Treatment for Osteoporosis in Elderly Patients?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】It is best to keep a check on the risk factors and consult a doctor at the earliest. The treatment protocol depends on the bone density test scores; if the risk of breaking your bone in the next ten years is much higher, the doctor might not start with medications but try to modify the risk factors to reduce bone loss and falls.\n\n【16】**1) Medicines:**\n\n【17】In medications, Bisphosphonates (Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, and Zoledronic acid) are the most widely used drugs.\n\n【18】*   Common side effects when these drugs are taken orally are nausea, heartburn, and abdominal pain. When they are given in intravenous (IV) form, they might cause fever, headache, and muscle aches.\n    \n*   Very rarely do they cause a crack in the thigh bone and osteonecrosis of the jaw bone following dental extraction.\n    \n*   Another prescribed drug is Denosumab which produces similar results as Bisphosphonates.\n    \n*   The mode of administration for Denosumab is delivering a shot under the skin every six months.\n    \n*   They cause similar side effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw and rarely a crack in the thigh bone.\n    \n*   Hormone-related therapy should be started. Estrogen should be given to post-menopausal women, which helps maintain bone density.\n    \n*   In men, osteoporosis can be linked to a decline in testosterone levels with increasing age; therefore, testosterone therapy is recommended for men.\n    \n*   In addition, doctors might prescribe a group of bone-building medications (like Teriparatide, Abaloparatide, and Romosozumab) to treat osteoporosis. These are used in certain severe cases along with other osteoporosis drugs.\n    \n\n【19】**2) Dietary Planning:**\n\n【20】People diagnosed with osteoporosis are advised to take increased quantities of calcium and vitamin D in their diet, along with multivitamin supplements, which will help in getting a sufficient amount of these nutrients. It is recommended that adults, especially women aged 50 years and older need to take 1,200 mg of calcium and 800 - 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily.\n\n【21】**3) Lifestyle Changes:**\n\n【22】Making lifestyle changes after being diagnosed with osteoporosis is very important. Give up on smoking, drinking, and other forms of tobacco; this will improve muscle strength and reduce bone loss. Include exercise in daily routine like, jogging, walking, dancing, etc., to improve bone remodeling. It is advisable to consult a doctor to make an exercise routine.\n\n【23】**Conclusion:**\n\n【24】Once diagnosed with osteoporosis, be very careful to avoid any falls. Avoid clutter, spread non-slippery rugs across the house, provide sufficient lighting in the house, and hold on to some form of grip while taking a bath. Follow the treatment protocol given by the doctor strictly. Make necessary dietary and lifestyle changes.\n\n【25】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】#### **1.**\n\n【28】#### **What Is the Major Problem in Elderly People That Have Osteoporosis?**\n\n【29】The major problem with osteoporosis in old age is the increased susceptibility to fractures. This is because the bone becomes porous, brittle, and fragile. Therefore, minor accidents or a sudden fall can cause hairline or major fractures. Another primary concern is the inability to stand or sit in one position for a long time.\n\n【30】#### **2.**\n\n【31】#### **How To Manage Osteoporosis in Old Age?**\n\n【32】Management of osteoporosis in old age includes–  \n\\- Vitamin D and calcium supplements strengthen bones and prevent them from becoming brittle.   \n\\- Hormone therapy like estrogen and testosterone therapy to delay the effects of osteoporosis.  \n\\- Bone-building medications help promote bone formation and reduce bone resorption.\n\n【33】#### **3.**\n\n【34】#### **What Is Osteoporosis?**\n\n【35】Osteoporosis is an age-dependent disease of the bone that mostly occurs in old age. The bone is subjected to constant remodeling (bone formation and resorption). When bone resorption is more than bone formation, the bone starts depleting and becomes porous and brittle. As a result of this low bone density, the person becomes more susceptible to fractures. Therefore, one must take care and start with vitamin D and Calcium supplements to delay the symptoms of osteoporosis at an early age.\n\n【36】#### **4.**\n\n【37】#### **What Is End-Stage Osteoporosis?**\n\n【38】During the end stage of osteoporosis, there is significant bone loss. The bones become soft and porous, especially in the spine, resulting in deformity. During this stage, any slight impact on the bone could cause the bone to fracture. The bone may break into smaller fragments that cannot be fixed with minor surgical procedures.\n\n【39】#### **5.**\n\n【40】#### **What Should One Avoid Doing In Osteoporosis?**\n\n【41】Osteoporosis is a disease of the bone characterized by low bone-density levels, usually occurring in older age groups. When suffering from osteoporosis, one must avoid–  \n\\- High-impact exercises.  \n\\- Walking on slippery surfaces.  \n\\- Leading a sedentary life.  \n\\- Consumption of alcohol and smoking.\n\n【42】#### **6.**\n\n【43】#### **How to Increase Bone Density Quickly?**\n\n【44】Doctors may prescribe medications to delay bone resorption and promote bone density. Oral medications that help increase bone density and vitamin D supplements are the fastest way to increase bone density. Calcium supplements are the first line of medications to be prescribed in osteoporosis to help increase bone density.\n\n【45】#### **7.**\n\n【46】#### **How Quickly Does Osteoporosis Progress?**\n\n【47】Studies show that bone loss begins at a rate of 0.25 percent a year and varies depending on genetic and environmental factors. This is considered the second stage of osteoporosis. One must understand that this is a perfectly normal part of the aging process. However, certain factors (for example, other medical conditions and factors) may decrease bone density faster than the normal range. This may increase the risk of early osteoporosis in some people.\n\n【48】#### **8.**\n\n【49】#### **What Are the Early Warning Signs of Osteoporosis?**\n\n【50】Here are the early warning signs of osteoporosis–  \n\\- Recurrent fractures of the limbs, wrist, and spine.  \n\\- Loss of height (two inches or more over a while).  \n\\- Periodontal bone loss and receding gums.  \n\\- A curved, stooped shape to the spine.  \n\\- Persistent lower back pain.  \n\\- Low calcium levels in the body.  \n\\- Low vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n【51】#### **9.**\n\n【52】#### **Can Walking Reverse Osteoporosis?**\n\n【53】Osteoporosis is an age-dependent bone disorder. Physical activities like walking will help a person stay active and delay the symptoms of osteoporosis. Walking, however, will not reverse the symptoms of osteoporosis. Medications, lifestyle modifications, and vitamin supplements can help increase bone density and reverse osteoporosis.\n\n【54】#### **10.**\n\n【55】#### **What Foods Should Be Avoided In Osteoporosis?**\n\n【56】Diets high in sugar, processed foods, and excessive salt intake could impact bone health and increase the risk of osteoporosis. Likewise, a high-cholesterol diet, sweetened beverages, fried foods, processed meats, and refined grains could accelerate osteoporosis. One must also limit the intake of citric foods and juices.\n\n【57】#### **11.**\n\n【58】#### **Does Osteoporosis Make One Feel Tired?**\n\n【59】Osteoporosis independently does not make one tired, but the long-term effects of osteoporosis and other factors can make one feel fatigued. Weak bones are not able to maintain posture for too long. As a result, weak bones and low bone strength could cause body weakness.\n\n【60】#### **12.**\n\n【61】#### **Does Osteoporosis Affect Teeth?**\n\n【62】Osteoporosis affects all the bones in the body, including the jaw bones in the oral cavity. Low bone density levels cause jaw bones to become weak and porous. However, weak bone structures cannot hold the tooth in place. As a result, the tooth loses bone and gum support and starts to shake or move. This may cause early tooth loss in people with osteoporosis.\n\n【63】Article Resources\n\n【64】*   Osteoporosis in Aging  \n    https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/01/osteoporosis-aging\n*   What Is Osteoporosis and How Does It Impact Older Adults?  \n    https://ncoa.org/article/what-is-osteoporosis-and-how-does-it-impact-older-adults", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It also enhances immune function and prevents clogging in the arteries. The liver metabolizes and excretes the other forms of vitamin E, but it resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein. Free radicals harm cells and may play a role in cancer and cardiovascular disease development.\n\n【2】How Bad Is Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   A deficiency of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy).\n    \n*   Some may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss.\n    \n*   Most people with ataxia, due to a vitamin E deficiency, start experiencing problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years, which worsens with age.\n    \n\n【4】**What Are the Other Names for Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED).\n    \n*   Familial isolated vitamin E deficiency (FIVE).\n    \n*   Friedreich ataxia phenotype with selective vitamin E deficiency.\n    \n*   Friedreich-like ataxia.\n    \n\n【6】**How Common is the Disease?**\n\n【7】*   Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is rare; however, its prevalence is unknown.\n    \n\n【8】**What is the Genetic Background of the Disease?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   Due to a mutation in both copies of the gene in each cell, this condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive pattern.\n    \n*   An autosomal recessive condition is one in which one copy of the mutated gene is carried by each parent, who is asymptomatic in most cases.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Ataxia Due to Vitamin E Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   Mutations in the TTPA gene cause ataxia with a vitamin E deficiency.

Still, symptoms and disease severity can differ even between siblings in families with different pathogenic variants.\n    \n\n【16】The first symptoms include,\n\n【17】*   Progressive ataxia (lack of coordination).\n    \n*   The clumsiness of the hands (poor coordination, movement, or action).\n    \n*   Loss of proprioception (reduction in the sense that includes the awareness of posture, weight, movement, and limb position about the environment).\n    \n*   Areflexia (a condition in which your muscles do not respond to stimuli).\n    \n\n【18】Other features include,\n\n【19】*   Dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid, quick, synchronous, alternating muscle movements, including rotational forearm movement, fast finger tapping, opening and closing of the fists, foot tapping, etc.).\n    \n*   Dysarthria (weakness in the muscles of speech, which causes slowed or slurred speech).\n    \n*   Positive Romberg sign (inability to maintain an erect posture over 60 seconds with eyes closed).\n    \n*   Head titubation (involuntary tremor of the head, neck, and trunk area).\n    \n*   Positive Babinski sign (extension/ dorsiflexion /upward movement) of the big toe causing the fanning of the other toes).\n    \n*   Macular atrophy (loss in the center of the field of vision).\n    \n*   Retinitis pigmentosa (decreased vision at night or in low light and loss of side vision).\n    \n\n【20】How to Diagnose Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】**Suggestive Findings:**\n\n【22】*   Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) should be suspected in individuals who typically present the symptoms mentioned above at the beginning of puberty.\n    \n\n【23】**Definitive Findings:**\n\n【24】*   There are currently no universal diagnostic standards for AVED.\n    \n\n【25】The primary diagnostic indicator is the presence of\n\n【26】*   A neurologic phenotype resembles Friedreich ataxia.\n    \n*   A marked decreased plasma vitamin E (α-tocopherol) concentration.\n    \n*   Standard lipoprotein profile in the absence of known causes of malabsorption of vitamin E.\n    \n\n【27】**Antenatal Diagnosis:**\n\n【28】*   Antenatal diagnosis is confirmed by identifying bi-allelic TTPA pathogenic variants via molecular genetic testing when the mutation has been identified in the family.\n    \n\n【29】How to Manage Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】**Treatment of Manifestations:**\n\n【31】*   Lifelong high-dose oral vitamin E supplementation to bring plasma vitamin E concentrations into the high-normal range.\n    \n*   If the treatment starts at the early stage of the disease, it may, to some extent, reverse ataxia and mental deterioration.\n    \n\n【32】**Prevention of Primary Manifestations:**\n\n【33】*   Children with biallelic TTPA pathogenic variants who are presymptomatic can take vitamin E therapy to delay the onset of symptoms.\n    \n\n【34】**Genetic Counseling:**\n\n【35】*   Since AVED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, the parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes, carry one pathogenic variant, and are asymptomatic.\n    \n*   Carrier detection for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing can be done if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.\n    \n\n【36】**Surveillance:**\n\n【37】*   Check the level of plasma vitamin E every six months, especially in children.\n    \n\n【38】**Agents or Circumstances to Avoid:**\n\n【39】*   Smoking, occupations requiring quick responses, or good balance can be avoided.\n    \n\n【40】**Evaluation of Relatives at Risk:**\n\n【41】*   Evaluation for vitamin E deficiency, especially in the younger siblings of the person affected with the disease.\n    \n\n【42】**Others:**\n\n【43】*   People with AVED may find it challenging to ride a bicycle or operate a vehicle due to abnormal position sense in the extremities.\n    \n*   A doctor should evaluate affected people before driving to check if they can safely operate a vehicle.\n    \n\n【44】What is the Prognosis of Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】*   If people are treated with vitamin E before the symptoms start, people with AVED can lead normal lives.\n    \n*   Without treatment, individuals with AVED will become dependent on a wheelchair between the ages of 11 and 50 and may experience severe physical and mental problems.\n    \n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a rare cause of hereditary ataxia in developing countries with an unknown prevalence. AVED is reversible if treated in time with vitamin E supplementation. In addition, vitamin E supplementation decreases the symptoms and prevents disease progression.\n\n【48】Article Resources\n\n【49】*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1241/\n*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ataxia-with-vitamin-e-deficiency/?filter=ovr-ds-resources\n*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency: Widening the Phenotypic Spectrum  \n    https://n.neurology.org/content/94/15\\_Supplement/2197", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1d9bda52-99bd-4e13-978b-28ea64adaa0f", "title": "Trimalleolar Fracture - Causes, Symptoms, and Management", "text": "【0】Trimalleolar Fracture - Causes, Symptoms, and Management\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】A trimalleolar fracture is a severe ankle injury that affects three of the ankle's bony protrusions, or malleoli. It is a relatively uncommon injury, accounting for only about 10 % of all ankle fractures. However, it is a serious injury that requires prompt medical attention and often involves surgical intervention.\n\n【2】What Is the Anatomy of the Ankle?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】To understand a trimalleolar fracture, it's essential to understand the anatomy of the ankle. The ankle joint comprises three bones: the tibia, fibula, and talus. The tibia and fibula are the long bones of the leg, and they join together to form a hinge joint with the talus, which is the bone that sits on top of the foot. Several ligaments, including the lateral ligaments on the outside of the ankle and the medial ligaments on the inside, stabilize the ankle.\n\n【4】What Is a Trimalleolar Fracture?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】A trimalleolar fracture is a break in all three of the ankle's malleoli. The malleoli are the bony protrusions on the sides of the ankle that provide stability to the joint. The lateral malleolus is the bony bump on the outside of the ankle and part of the fibula bone. The medial malleolus is the bony bump on the inside of the ankle, and it is part of the tibia bone. The posterior malleolus is the bony bump at the back of the ankle and part of the tibia bone.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Trimalleolar Fractures?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Trimalleolar fractures are typically caused by a high-energy trauma to the ankle, such as a fall from a height, a car accident, or a sports injury. They can also occur in older adults with weaker bones due to osteoporosis, where a simple twist or slip can result in a trimalleolar fracture.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Trimalleolar Fractures?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The symptoms of a trimalleolar fracture may include the following:\n\n【10】*   Severe pain around the ankle.\n    \n*   Swelling and bruising around the ankle.\n    \n*   Difficulty bearing weight on the affected foot.\n    \n*   Deformity or dislocation of the ankle.\n    \n*   Limited range of motion.\n    \n*   Tenderness to the touch.\n    \n*   Numbness or tingling in the foot.\n    \n*   Inability to walk or stand on the affected foot.\n    \n\n【11】How Is Trimalleolar Fractures Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【12】Diagnosing a trimalleolar fracture usually involves a physical examination and imaging tests.\n\n【13】1.  During the physical exam, the doctor assesses the ankle for signs of deformity, swelling, and tenderness.\n    \n2.  They may also ask about the patient's medical history and how the injury occurred.\n    \n3.  Imaging tests such as X-rays are typically used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the injury. In some cases, additional imaging tests such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan may be necessary to assess the full extent of the fracture and any associated soft tissue damage.\n    \n\n【14】How to Treat Trimalleolar Fractures?\n------------------------------------\n\n【15】The treatment for trimalleolar fractures depends on the severity of the injury.\n\n【16】For less severe fractures where the bones are not out of placec (displaced), treatment may involve immobilizing the ankle with a cast or brace to allow the bones to heal. The patient may also need to use crutches to avoid putting weight on the affected ankle (place non-weight bearing) for sometime.\n\n【17】For more severe fractures where the bones are out of place, surgery may be necessary to realign the bones and stabilize the ankle joint. During surgery, the doctor may use screws, plates, or wires to hold the bones in place. After surgery or immobilization, the patient will likely need to undergo physical therapy to regain strength, flexibility, and range of motion in the ankle joint.\n\n【18】Pain and anti-inflammatory medication may also be prescribed to manage pain and swelling during recovery. It is important for patients with trimalleolar fractures to follow their doctor's instructions carefully and attend all follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and prevent long-term complications.\n\n【19】Can Trimalleolar Fractures Cause Disability?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Trimalleolar fractures can cause disability if left untreated or not properly managed. If the fracture is severe and involves significant damage to the ankle joint, it can lead to long-term complications such as chronic pain, limited mobility, arthritis, and instability in the ankle joint.\n\n【21】In some cases, surgery may not fully restore the function of the ankle joint, which can significantly affect a person's ability to walk, stand, or engage in physical activities. It is important to seek prompt medical attention and follow the recommended treatment plan to reduce the risk of long-term disability.\n\n【22】How to Prevent Trimalleolar Fractures?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【23】Trimalleolar fractures can be prevented by taking some precautions. Here are some simple tips that can help reduce the risk of a trimalleolar fracture:\n\n【24】*   **Wear Appropriate Footwear:** Wear shoes that fit well are comfortable, and provide support to the ankle. Avoid high heels or shoes without support, especially when walking on uneven surfaces.\n    \n\n【25】*   **Use Protective Gear:** If people are involved in high-impact sports such as basketball, soccer, or football, wearing appropriate protective gear such as ankle braces, shin guards, or helmets is important. Watch your step and use caution when walking on uneven surfaces such as stairs or slippery floors.\n    \n\n【26】*   **Exercise Regularly:** Strengthening the muscles and bones in the legs and feet helps reduce the risk of ankle injuries. Regular exercise and stretching can also improve balance and coordination, which can prevent falls.\n    \n\n【27】*   **Take Breaks:** Regular breaks are important if anyone is involved in activities requiring standing or walking for long periods. This can help reduce the risk of fatigue and ankle injuries.\n    \n\n【28】*   **Seek Treatment for Any Foot or Ankle Problems:** If anyone has any foot or ankle problems, such as flat feet or weak ankles, seek treatment from a doctor or physical therapist to prevent injuries.\n    \n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】Trimalleolar fractures are severe ankle injuries that can cause significant pain, swelling, and difficulty bearing weight on the affected foot. Diagnosis is typically made through physical examination and imaging tests, and treatment may involve immobilization with a cast or brace or surgery to realign the bones. Prevention involves wearing appropriate footwear, using protective gear during high-impact activities, being cautious on uneven surfaces, exercising regularly, taking breaks, and seeking treatment for any foot or ankle problems. By following these tips, individuals can reduce the risk of trimalleolar fractures and other ankle injuries.\n\n【31】Article Resources\n\n【32】*   Trimalleolar fracture  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/trimalleolar-fracture\n*   Current management of trimalleolar ankle fractures  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8419795/\n*   Ankle Fractures (Broken Ankle)  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/ankle-fractures-broken-ankle/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The catheter, with the help of a fluoroscope, is carefully advanced up through the vein to the right chamber of the heart and into the pulmonary artery, which guides to the lungs.\n    \n*   The contrast material will be injected via the catheter, and X-ray images will be taken.\n    \n*   The course and the movement of the dye will help to evaluate the presence of any blockages within the blood vessel.\n    \n*   Patients could feel nausea or headache for a brief time when the contrast is injected. They can also get a salty or metallic sensation in their mouth.\n    \n*   Once the images are taken, the catheter is removed.\n    \n*   Pressure and dressing are applied over the incision site for the bleeding to stop.\n    \n\n【8】**What Are the Instructions After the Procedure?**\n\n【9】*   Patients should lie flat on their back with legs and hands stretched for two hours after the procedure.\n    \n*   Analgesics would be given to relieve any pain.\n    \n*   Patients are advised to drink plenty of water to expel the contrast material from the body.\n    \n*   Refrain from smoking and alcohol.\n    \n*   Patients should avoid any form of physical strain for the next few days.\n    \n*   Patients should monitor the incision site for any unusual changes.\n    \n\n【10】When to Seek Medical Advice?\n----------------------------\n\n【11】*   A sudden rise in temperature.\n    \n*   Uncontrolled bleeding from the site of the incision.\n    \n*   Swelling, redness, discharge from the incision site.\n    \n*   Pain, weakness, or tingling sensation in any of the extremities.\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Benefits and Risks of This Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】**Benefits:**\n\n【14】*   Minimally invasive.\n    \n*   Can detect arterial, venous, and structural abnormalities.\n    \n\n【15】**Risks:**\n\n【16】*   Patients can develop abnormal heart rhythms, which will be managed by the doctor immediately.\n    \n*   Infection and bleeding.\n    \n*   Allergic reaction to the contrast material used.\n    \n*   Catheter insertion can rarely cause damage to the blood vessels or nerves.\n    \n*   The possibility of a pulmonary embolism as an existing clot may get dislodged.\n    \n*   Hematoma formation.\n    \n*   Risk of radiation exposure.\n    \n*   Heart attack, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure.\n    \n\n【17】**What Are the Limitations of This Procedure?**\n\n【18】*   Pulmonary angiography is not advised in pregnant women and lactating mothers.\n    \n*   Caution needs to be exercised while using this procedure in renal disease patients and patients on dialysis.\n    \n*   Known history of allergy to contrast material.\n    \n\n【19】What Are the Recent Advancements in Pulmonary Angiography?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Conventional pulmonary angiography is almost completely replaced by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). CTPA is now considered the standard diagnostic test used to detect any blockages in blood vessels or a pulmonary embolism. A conventional pulmonary angiography may be used only in situations where a CT may be contraindicated or may prove non-diagnostic.\n\n【21】The indications for using a CTPA are similar to that of pulmonary angiography. The procedure is similar except that instead of a conventional X-ray, a CT scanner would be used to image the patient.\n\n【22】How Is CTPA Finer Than a Conventional Pulmonary Angiography?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   CTPA has increased sensitivity and specificity than its conventional counterpart.\n    \n*   CTPA provides images with high precision.\n    \n*   A conventional pulmonary angiography uses a single X-ray source and detector, resulting in a two-dimensional image, whereas a CTPA uses many X-ray sources and scanners, thus enabling a three-dimensional image with increased resolution.\n    \n*   A CTPA has the added benefit of imaging other structures along with the lung simultaneously.\n    \n\n【24】What Is the Role of CT Pulmonary Angiography in COVID-19?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common complications encountered in COVID-19 patients. It has had serious debilitating effects on the prognostic outcome. Though a chest CT has proved vital in diagnosing COVID pneumonia and other thoracic complications, further enhanced assessment is needed in patients with respiratory failure and other compromised conditions. A CTPA is indicated in COVID-19 patients with:\n\n【26】*   Severe respiratory failure.\n    \n*   High demand for oxygen despite controlled lung disease.\n    \n*   Dilation of the right chamber of the heart.\n    \n*   Compromised hemodynamic state.\n    \n*   When coagulation parameters are abnormal.\n    \n\n【27】CTPA is not only useful to detect pulmonary embolism, but is also found useful to evaluate deep vein thrombosis (DVT), right ventricular dysfunction, vasculopathy, and defects in the lung parenchyma in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Pulmonary angiography is a safe and minimally invasive technique to evaluate the blood flow to the lungs. CTPA has proved even more efficient than conventional pulmonary angiograms in detecting blocked vessels and embolisms. The advantage of this procedure is both diagnostic and therapeutic, making it ideal and benefiting the patient.\n\n【30】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【31】* * *\n\n【32】#### **1.**\n\n【33】#### **What Distinguishes Pulmonary Angiography From CT Angiography?**\n\n【34】The computerized tomography (CT) coronary angiogram examines the arteries that supply blood to the heart. A CT coronary angiogram creates images of the heart and its blood vessels using a powerful X-ray machine. The examination is used to identify several heart conditions. An angiogram of the blood vessels in the lungs is known as a pulmonary angiogram. A specialized contrast dye is injected into the body's blood vessels to perform the procedure.\n\n【35】#### **2.**\n\n【36】#### **How Much Time Does a Pulmonary Angiogram Require?**\n\n【37】The pulmonary angiogram procedure is completed in less than an hour. The radiologist pokes a needle or makes a tiny cut in a vein, and a catheter—a small, hollow tube—is inserted. The catheter is inserted through the vein and slowly advances up into and through the right-sided heart chambers and the pulmonary artery, which supplies blood to the lungs. It is then injected with dye after the catheter has been positioned. The dye aids in the detection of any blood flow obstructions. Further, X-rays are taken to see how the dye moves through the lung arteries.\n\n【38】#### **3.**\n\n【39】#### **Why Is a CT Pulmonary Angiogram Done?**\n\n【40】A CT pulmonary angiogram (or CTPA) helps detect blood clots in the lungs (or pulmonary embolism, or PE). A CT pulmonary angiogram may have been advised to:  \n\\- Check for any enlarged blood vessels.  \n\\- Check for any arteries that are unusually connected to veins.  \n\\- Check for and treat a blood clot.  \n\\- Detects blood vessel wall narrowing.  \n\\- Examine the lung’s blood flow\n\n【41】#### **4.**\n\n【42】#### **How to Prepare for a Pulmonary Angiography?**\n\n【43】Refrain from eating or drinking anything for eight hours before the angiography. Make arrangements for transportation home. Additionally, it is recommended that a person stay with the patient the night after the procedure because they might experience lightheadedness or drowsiness for the first 24 hours following the cardiac angiography.\n\n【44】#### **5.**\n\n【45】#### **Is a Pulmonary Angiogram Performed When Awake?**\n\n【46】The patient will be awake for the test, but a general anesthetic may be used for young children. First, a tiny cut is made in the skin over one of the arteries, typically close to the groin or wrist; a local anesthetic is then applied to make the cut painless. The pulmonary angiogram procedure is completed in less than an hour.\n\n【47】#### **6.**\n\n【48】#### **Can an Angiogram Help Clear Blockage?**\n\n【49】No, an angiogram is a diagnostic procedure done to detect blocks in the arteries, which could further help treat the condition because it can be used to identify and treat a blood clot. Pulmonary angiography is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The most frequent indications for pulmonary angiography are pulmonary embolism, aneurysm, pulmonary hypertension, and venous malformation.\n\n【50】#### **7.**\n\n【51】#### **How Is the Blood Circulated Through the Body?**\n\n【52】The heart's right and left sides allow blood to flow freely throughout the body. The right atrium receives blood from the body, which then flows into the right ventricle and is forced into the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. The blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, passes through the left atrium and left ventricle, and exits to the body's tissues through the aorta.\n\n【53】#### **8.**\n\n【54】#### **What Are the Uses of Pulmonary Angiography?**\n\n【55】Pulmonary angiography is used to look for pulmonary emboli and other blood flow obstructions in the lungs. Additionally, pulmonary angiography can be used to help determine:  \n\\- The lung's atrioventricular malformations.  \n\\- Congenital pulmonary vessel narrowing.  \n\\- Aneurysms in the pulmonary arteries.  \n\\- Pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【56】#### **9.**\n\n【57】#### **Is Pulmonary Angiography an Invasive Procedure?**\n\n【58】Pulmonary angiography is a minimally invasive test that allows for direct pulmonary artery visualization and makes it easier to detect a clot quickly. First, a tiny cut is made in the skin over one of the arteries, typically close to the groin or wrist; a local anesthetic is applied to make the cut painless. The catheter is inserted through the vein and slowly advanced into and through the right-sided heart chambers and the pulmonary artery, which supplies blood to the lungs. It is then injected with dye after the catheter has been positioned.\n\n【59】#### **10.**\n\n【60】#### **What Are the Causes of Pulmonary Hypertension?**\n\n【61】Pulmonary hypertension has several common underlying causes, including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, connective tissue disease, liver disease (cirrhosis), blood clots in the lungs, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Genetics also has an impact. Numerous other conditions, such as heart disease and lung disease, can coexist with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension frequently results in heart failure.\n\n【62】Article Resources\n\n【63】*   CT pulmonary angiography in COVID-19 pneumonia: relationship between pulmonary embolism and disease severity  \n    https://ejrnm.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43055-020-00389-7\n*   Imaging approach to COVID-19 associated pulmonary embolism  \n    https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.14340\n*   Pulmonary Angiogram  \n    https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=92&contentid=p07758", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These are the most common fractures seen in the pediatric population, accounting for 10 to 15 % of all cases worldwide. The fracture is distinguished by pain, swelling, and tenderness in the area of injury, resulting in an inability to raise the elbow or arm. Although elbow fracture is common, it is often unrecognized; thus, awareness in detecting elbow fractures is ideal. Proper assistance and management of these fractures are critical because they have the potential to compromise the neurovascular elements.\n\n【2】How Commonly Are Elbow Fractures Seen?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Elbow fractures are the second most common fractures and constitute around fifteen percent of all fractures occurring in children. It is commonly seen in children between the age of three to seven, with the highest occurrence rate around the age of six. This is commonly seen involving male and female populations, with an increased incidence in males.\n\n【4】How Does an Elbow Fracture Occur?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】Elbow fractures occur due to trauma with wide stretched arms or fall with a direct hit on the elbow or arm. Factors causing elbow fractures are trauma, sports injury, fall injury, low bone density, calcium deficiencies, or abnormal twisting of the arm.\n\n【6】What Are the Types of Elbow Fractures?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】These fractures are important as they can cause injury to the associated nerves and muscles. There are different types of elbow fractures seen based on the position, and they are:\n\n【8】*   **Supracondylar Fracture:** This fracture involves the distal part of the humerus bone (bone of the upper arm) and is the most common type of elbow fracture seen, affecting almost sixty percent of the cases. This fracture type is considered an immature skeletal bone injury occurring between the ages of five and ten. Supracondylar injury, based on the mechanism of occurrence and displacement, is called an extension of the flexion type of fracture.\n    \n*   **Lateral Condyle Fractures:** It is the second most common type (almost fifteen to twenty percent of the cases) of fracture seen in children. It has the highest incidence during the age of four to ten years. It involves the lateral condyle of the upper arm.\n    \n*   **Medial Epicondyle Fracture**: These fractures are the third most common fracture type in children. This fracture occurs as an extra-articular fracture (fracture that does not involve a bony joint). It involves the posteromedial surface of the elbow and is commonly seen in children around nine to fourteen years old. The common cause of this fracture type is elbow dislocation or stress.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Triad Injury of the Elbow - Causes, Symptoms, Investigations, and Treatment\n    \n    Do heel bone fractures require surgery?\n    \n    Elbow Pain - Location, Common Disorders, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n\n【9】*   **Radial Head and Neck Fractures:** Radial head fractures involve around one to five percent of elbow fractures in children. It is commonly seen between the age of nine to ten years. These fractures involve the epiphyseal and metaphyseal ends of the bone.\n    \n*   **Olecranon Fractures:** These are among the most uncommon fractures in children associated with the radial head and neck.\n    \n\n【10】How Is It Seen Clinically?\n--------------------------\n\n【11】Elbow fractures are seen with sharp, excruciating pain associated with swelling or bruising on the skin. In addition, there will be stiffness of the joint with the inability to move the arm, visible arm deformity, an audible popping sound heard at the time of injury, and numbing of the arm, wrist, and hand due to compression in the blood vessels.\n\n【12】How Is an Elbow Fracture Evaluated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】Elbow Fractures can be evaluated using multiple diagnostic techniques. They are:\n\n【14】*   **Radiographic Imaging (X-rays)** \\- X-rays are two-dimensional images used to identify any bony defect. In an elbow fracture, X-rays are taken in the front, back, and a side view to locate the fracture.\n    \n*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** The MRI is a three-dimensional imaging technique used to detect any anomalies in the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site. The MRI scan of an elbow fracture reveals soft tissue and ligament injuries near the radial head.\n    \n\n【15】How Is an Elbow Fracture Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【16】The treatment of all types of elbow fractures is the same, with slight variations depending on the location of the injury.\n\n【17】**Non-Displaced Fractures:** These are the type of fractures where the fractured segment is not displaced and is within the elbow compartment. In non-displaced fractures, surgical management is not required. The fractured segment is immobilized and stabilized using S-splint, keeping the elbow outstretched and forearm in a stable neutral position. The splint is removed, and casting is done once the swelling has subsided. The casting is removed three to four weeks after reviewing with an X-ray.\n\n【18】**Displaced Fractures:** These fractures are called so because the broken segment is displaced from the original position. This can be an open or closed fracture and is treated with surgical management. The surgical management of the fracture is as follows:\n\n【19】*   In the case of a closed fracture, the reduction of the fractured segment is made by fixing it in the original position using metal pins, followed by casting.\n    \n*   In an open fracture, the wound is surgically opened, and the fracture is fixed internally, followed by sling bandages and immobilization.\n    \n\n【20】What Are the Conditions That Appear Similar to Elbow Fracture?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The conditions which appear similar to elbow fractures are\n\n【22】*   Avulsion (loosening of the bone).\n    \n*   Bursitis (inflammation of the fluid sac near the joint).\n    \n*   Distal bone injuries of the hand.\n    \n*   Fracture of the hand.\n    \n*   Fracture of the forearm.\n    \n*   Tendon ruptures near the elbow.\n    \n\n【23】What Are the Complications of Elbow Fracture?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】There are various complications associated with elbow fractures, and they are:\n\n【25】*   **Neuropraxia:** Neuropraxia is the injury of the end nerves due to trauma.\n    \n*   **Vascular Injury:** Vascular injury is the injury of the blood vessels occurring due to laceration of the soft tissue by a broken bone fragment.\n    \n*   **Compartment Syndrome:** It is a clinical condition characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation occurring due to pressure build-up due to infection during fracture management.\n    \n*   **Malunion:** This occurs when the bone is not aligned during repositioning or immobilization.\n    \n*   **Non-union:** This mainly occurs due to secondary infection during management or healing.\n    \n\n【26】**Conclusion:**\n\n【27】Elbow fractures are commonly occurring fractures requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving general doctors, bone surgeons, X-ray specialists, physical therapists, etc. It is crucial to manage these fractures as they can compromise the nerves and muscles attached to them. Therefore, a lot of patients require extensive medical and surgical management along with physiotherapy to regain strength and motion. With periodic follow-up and strengthening, patients show favorable outcomes.\n\n【28】Article Resources\n\n【29】*   Elbow Fractures Overview  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441976/\n*   Elbow (Olecranon) Fractures  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/elbow-olecranon-fractures/\n*   Elbow Fractures  \n    https://www.assh.org/handcare/condition/elbow-fractures", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

To make the process easier and more universal, computational and systems pathology (CSP) will be helpful. It has a similar scope and the scientific goals of classical pathology disciplines.\n\n【2】The main characteristics of CSP are the utilization of computational approaches and mathematical modeling to know about diseases. In addition, it also provides many data obtained from different sources like digital images, molecular data, etc. The aim of the CSP is to improve patient care and outcomes by speeding up the diagnostic processes.\n\n【3】What Is Computational Pathology?\n--------------------------------\n\n【4】Computational pathology is a branch of pathology that aids in diagnosis by combining data from multiple sources, such as pathology, clinical, radiology, and molecular, using machine learning (ML) and mathematical models. This helps develop the best possible decision by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and lab efficiency. It helps to examine the slides virtually with the respective data, which includes patients' medical and insurance information, how was samples acquired, and annotations.\n\n【5】Related Topics\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】Neuropsychology of Language and Language Disorders - Types and Treatment\n\n【8】Rehabilitation and Biomechanics\n\n【9】It is very efficient with its deep learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks to fetch information from visual imagery, making them a perfect constituent in computer vision and image recognition in healthcare. Artificial intelligence (AI) also plays a paramount role in collecting information that is overlooked or invisible to human eyes due to factors like negligence, weariness, etc. AI improves the proficiency of tissue-based diagnosis, offering more sensitive and accurate readings than human pathologists. Additionally, it also plays a dominant role in precision medicine, health care designed to advocate personalized treatment.\n\n【10】What Is the Role of Computational Pathology in the Modern World?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Computational pathology goals are similar to classical pathology disciplines. The unique aspect of computational pathology is using mathematical modeling and computational approaches and knowing about the disease process. This is carried out by collecting data from multiple sources, such as digital images, molecular data, etc. The aim of the long series of effects is to generate precise diagnostic processes and treatments to improve patient care and outcomes. The scope of computational pathology prioritizes comput0ational methods and understanding the disease pathogenesis, and offering treatment. It is also paying attention to developing the core competencies of pathology to expand the ability to provide actionable knowledge effectively. The main areas of science focused on computational pathology are clinical genomics and other omics, digital pathology and image analysis, and the integration of multi-modality data with clinical information.\n\n【12】What Are the Limitations of Implicating Computational Pathology?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The transition from normal pathology to computational pathology is still a faraway project. This can occur in the future by incorporating a pathologist's supervision and computerized automation. There are many limitations and challenges in establishing a computational pathology; a few are mentioned below.\n\n【14】**1) Multi-Gigapixel Images -** Implementing computational pathology depends solely on powerful hardware and effective software to handle large gigapixel WSIs (whole slide imaging). Because of the large size of the image, there comes the need for significant storage in the pathology department, and also transferring data is a backbreaking task. To overcome this, a patch-by-patch approach is followed, which allows breaking down the images into smaller patches or tiles on annotation input or other preprocessing steps. The patching is a time-consuming process and also needs humongous storage. Patching has the trouble of contextual information loss and computational constraints that makes compromises with the resolution of the images and patch size.\n\n【15】**2) Standardization -** The quality of the WSI is determined by the quality of slide preparation, which involves processes like tissue fixation, cutting the slices, and staining the histological slides. Also, the scanning process may be carried out with different types of scanners and settings. All these different steps of processing may cause variations in WSI and make automatic processing a difficult task. WSIs can identify and exclude minor errors while processing the slides, such as issue folds, air blobs, shadows, and blurring, where the quality of the images is compromised and reduce the performance of systems that analyze them. Also, in some cancer cases, the tumors are removed by cauterization, damaging the tissue part and losing needed diagnostic information.\n\n【16】There will be variations in the staining colors of WSI images inter-hospital due to different protocols being followed, like the stain used and acquisition system differences. Also, intra-hospital variability can happen due to differences in the thickness of tissue slides, lack of uniformity of the stains used, age of the slides before scanning, etc. These color variations put the analogous outcome in deep learning models in difficulty. Because it is impossible to provide a diverse training set with all possible normal variations, different approaches should be followed to deal with variations of colors of the WSIs, like color normalization and augmentation.\n\n【17】**3) Labeling -** Artificial intelligence algorithms are completely data-based and need different data to produce good AI models. AI models can be well-trained by supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised techniques. Supervised learning is simple and the most straightforward strategy, where data has truth labels to tune the model's parameters. To have a clinically relevant label, pathologists are required to label the WSIs. Also, both semi-supervised and unsupervised methods require a test set labeled according to the task and performance of prediction models.\n\n【18】**4) Data Fusion -** To evaluate the behavior for carcinoma, only the present clinical and histopathological features are not adequate. Combination data is necessary for personalized diagnosis and treatment. Different noninvasive techniques, such as endoscopy, ultrasound imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optical coherence tomography (OCT), are also widely performed for the early detection of the disease and evaluation of the progression of a tumor. Mostly all these procedures are usually done before the biopsy and, therefore, before the histopathological examination; its results provide pathologists with details of regions and features of interest. So, combining WSIs with other data may be relevant in the future of computational pathology, helping professionals in the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Data fusion can be implicated in early and late fusion modalities.\n\n【19】**Conclusion:**\n\n【20】Computational pathology is a revolution in classic pathology that can provide automatic diagnostics, involve pathologists with specific areas of interest, and predict prognostic. By implicating such new technologies, it is believed that the workload of pathologists and the turnaround time at pathology labs will be reduced. So this area is getting more limelight and becoming a significant area of research and having rapid growth. However, there is many cumbersome to overcome and bring computational pathology into action, which is concentrated by many research community from different angles to come up with solutions for each problem in all applications.\n\n【21】Article Resources\n\n【22】*   Computational pathology definitions, best practices, and recommendations for regulatory guidance: a white paper from the Digital Pathology Association  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6852275/\n*   Computational Pathology  \n    https://www.embs.org/jbhi/computational-pathology/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "aba2ce53-0195-4c22-9fc6-d03e2f12e66c", "title": "Root Canal Treatment", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The most common complaint that the patients come up with to a dentist is toothache and the frequently heard term by them is root canal treatment. It is a simple chairside procedure done to save the tooth that has been affected by caries severely, infecting the pulp of the tooth, and sometimes extending beyond theapex of the root of the tooth, infecting the surrounding periradicular tissues.\n\n【2】When Is Root Canal Treatment Indicated?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Once the carious process reaches the third layer (soft tissue-pulp) of the tooth, the only two options left to save the tooth in a mature adult tooth are either extraction or root canal treatment (RCT). The tooth needs to be assessed and evaluated to check for the prognosis and decide the treatment.\n\n【4】Classic signs and symptoms of a tooth recommended for root canal procedure are,\n\n【5】*   Prolonged tooth pain.\n    \n*   Swollen and inflamed gums.\n    \n*   Tooth is sensitive to hot and cold foods and drinks.\n    \n*   Loose teeth.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    My teeth are wearing away and roots are exposed.What do I do?\n    \n    Root Canal Treatment\n    \n    Kindly advise the treatment for sensitive tooth.\n    \n*   Discolored tooth structure.\n    \n\n【6】How Is the Root Canal Procedure Done?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【7】As the name suggests, root canal treatment is associated with treating the canals of the root of the tooth. The procedure can be divided mainly into three processes, namely, getting access to the canal, cleaning, and shaping of the canal and finally refilling the space within the canal with an inert material. After doing all the required basic history taking (personal, medical and regarding the complaint of the patient), doing clinical and radiological examinations (OPG or IOPA X-rays), diagnosing and treatment planning, the procedure is carried out.\n\n【8】Being a chairside procedure, it is done under local anesthesia. Once the tooth is anesthetized, the dentist opens and cleans the cavity, reaching the canal opening. After which, the remnants of dead pulp and debris are removed followed by cleaning and shaping the canal and disinfecting it. Sometimes, when the infection is chronic or has reached beyond the tooth within the bone, the first appointment ceases here with the application of intracanal medicament (Calcium hydroxide dressing). In other cases, it can be completed within a single visit. The second visit or the last process involves filling the cleaned and shaped canal with an inert material (Gutta-percha) in order to prevent any reinfection, mainly any retrograde infection.\n\n【9】Following all this, the cavity is sealed with a temporary filling for 5 to 7 days and if there are no symptoms within those days, it is changed to a permanent filling and a crown is placed. Again, simply a crown or post and core is suggested based on the remaining tooth structure and other prognostic factors.\n\n【10】Most of the time, the root canal treatment term being a cliched one, brings in fear in the patient. But, though the procedure seems to be vast, there is nothing dangerous or painful to be worried about. All the concerns of the patient are taken into consideration by the dentist and the patient is always welcome to talk about the doubts and fears to the doctor.\n\n【11】What Are the Various Causes of Root Canal Treatment?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】There can be various causes leading to root canal treatment and they are as follows:\n\n【13】*   Deep cavity reaching pulp (pulpitis). It shows symptoms like pain, though a chronically infected tooth might be symptomless and can be diagnosed during a routine dental examination.\n    \n\n【14】*   Periapical infections (infections reaching beyond the tooth root via tooth pulp) like a cyst, abscess, etc., showing pain associated with swelling or sinus opening or discharge, even symptomless sometimes.\n    \n\n【15】*   Non-vital tooth due to a previous injury (mostly discolored).\n    \n\n【16】*   Recent trauma or fracture of tooth exposing pulp frankly.\n    \n\n【17】*   An avulsed tooth (tooth coming out of socket due to trauma and remaining outside for a long extraoral time or in a wrong or no storage medium or turning non vital after replantation into tooth socket).\n    \n\n【18】*   Intentional root canal, when the size of the tooth has to be reduced or altered for placement of crown or bridge or correct occlusion during any esthetic or functional dental treatment.\n    \n\n【19】It is necessary to do the RCT in such scenarios as leaving behind the infected, necrosed or diseased pulp within the tooth might cause infection, pain and swelling in future and might even communicate to other vital spaces and structures making the condition more serious.\n\n【20】What Are the Complications and Side-Effects of Root Canal Treatment?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The complications can be largely divided into two: the one the dentist faces and the one the patient faces. The dentist while treating the tooth can come across various hindrances which are as follows:\n\n【22】*   Anatomy or morphology of the tooth: Extra root canals, lateral canals, pulp stones, curved canals, etc.\n    \n\n【23】*   Errors during the procedure: Instrument breakage, perforation, zipping, over or under instrumentation (going beyond apex of the tooth or finishing way before reaching the apical working length, respectively, so on.\n    \n\n【24】*   Patient factors: Stressed or anxious patient, anesthesia not working properly.\n    \n\n【25】The dentist is trained enough to overcome these complications and do the needful and bring comfort to the patient. Sometimes, there may be some complications following this procedure in the patient which are temporary and can be overcome easily. They are as follows:\n\n【26】**1\\. Continuous Pain:**\n\n【27】There may be a dull aching pain post RCT for 3 to 5 days (maximum 7 days) which is common during the healing period, but if the pain is severe and continues for a prolonged time or the pain subsides but recurs again after 5 to 7 days, it is advisable to consult your dentist again. For the dull aching mild pain, the analgesics prescribed by your dentist can be taken in the prescribed doses. It is very important to continue and finish the antibiotic course prescribed by the dentist even if the pain, swelling, and infection subside.\n\n【28】**2\\. Sodium Hypochlorite Accident:**\n\n【29】The injection of this solution beyond the apex of the tooth may lead to toxic tissue reaction and show the following symptoms: Severe immediate pain, swelling, bleeding from tooth as well as within tissues. To manage this, ice pack compression can be done for 24 hours (15 minutes interval) to reduce swelling and post that warm, moist compression can be done (15 minutes interval). Analgesics prescribed by your dentist can be taken for pain relief.\n\n【30】3\\. Unnoticed crack in root or missed lateral canals: These can be a source of reinfection and need the attention of the dentist.\n\n【31】4\\. Any hematoma (localized blood collection) or swelling or paresthesia (partial numbness even after the effect of anesthesia goes off). These are very rare complications and should be brought to the notice of the dentist as soon as possible.\n\n【32】How to Prevent a Tooth From Going for Root Canal Treatment?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The major cause of RCT is tooth cavity which can be prevented if taken proper measures, like maintaining good oral hygiene, visiting the dentist once a year for a regular dental checkup and getting caries (cavities) filled in the initial stages itself, if any. In case of any trauma to the tooth, visit the dentist as soon as possible.\n\n【34】The major fear and dilemma among the patients regarding the RCT is pain and neglecting the importance of the tooth. It is always a better option to save the tooth instead of removing and replacing it as the function of the natural tooth can never be mimicked by an artificial tooth. It is important to be aware of the precautionary as well as the treatment aspects of tooth-related conditions.\n\n【35】As the online medical platforms have made the patient-doctor communication much simpler and convenient, when in doubt or if you have any symptoms or notice anything different or unusual from normal in your oral cavity, it is advisable to consult your dentist online with just mentioning the details of complaint, sharing images and X-rays to get detailed knowledge about the condition and the available treatment for the same.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】Endodontic treatment is not a frightening one, as many suggest. It is in fact a saving procedure, where the tooth can be saved from removal and unnecessary complications with missing teeth.\n\n【38】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【39】* * *\n\n【40】#### **1.**\n\n【41】#### **In Which Part of the Tooth Is Root Canal Treatment Done?**\n\n【42】In root canal treatment, an access hole is made in the crown portion of the tooth through which the dentist can reach the root portion. After which, the infected pulp from the root is removed, and any abscess present is drained. The tooth is then filled with a from the root portion.\n\n【43】#### **2.**\n\n【44】#### **Is Root Canal Treatment Very Painful?**\n\n【45】Before starting a root canal procedure the tooth and the area where the root canal is performed is numbed with the help of local anesthesia. The only pain felt during the procedure is while giving local anesthesia and the procedure is done only after the tooth is completely numb so the root canal procedure involves minimal to slight pain.\n\n【46】#### **3.**\n\n【47】#### **What Medications Have to Be Taken Before and After Root Canal Treatment?**\n\n【48】Anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen, Aspirin, etc., are given before and after the root canal treatment. They help in reducing pain before, during, and after the procedure. In some cases, antibiotics are given as prophylaxis and after treatment to reduce the infection in the surrounding tissues.\n\n【49】#### **4.**\n\n【50】#### **Why Is There a Foul Smell During Root Canal?**\n\n【51】The bacteria present in dental caries produce a foul smell that is felt during the root canal procedure. Moreover, cutting off the infected enamel and dentin produces an unpleasant smell during the root canal procedure.\n\n【52】#### **5.**\n\n【53】#### **How Long Can Tooth Be Saved With Root Canal Procedure?**\n\n【54】Root canal procedure removes infection and caries from the tooth. Root canal treated teeth with crown placement, along with regular maintenance and checkups, can last lifelong.\n\n【55】#### **6.**\n\n【56】#### **Will There Be Pain After Root Canal?**\n\n【57】During the root canal procedure, only the infection from the tooth is removed. Inflammation and swelling in the surrounding structure will take some time to heal. Henc, there might be light pain for a few days after the root canal, which will subside on its own.\n\n【58】#### **7.**\n\n【59】#### **In What Situations Root Canal Procedure Is Contraindicated?**\n\n【60】In certain situations, even a root canal procedure will not be able to save the teeth. In such situations it is better to avoid a root canal. For example:  \n\\- When the remaining tooth structure is not enough to restore the teeth.  \n\\- When there is perforation in the pulpal floor due to caries or trauma.  \n\\- When there is root resorption involving one-third of the root.  \n\\- When there is severe mobility of the tooth due to the loss of surrounding bone structure.\n\n【61】#### **8.**\n\n【62】#### **What Foods Can Be Taken and Avoided After Root Canal Treatment?**\n\n【63】It is better to take a soft diet after root canal treatment until the pain subsides. Very hot foods, very cold foods, sticky foods, hard and crunchy foods, etc., have to be avoided after a root canal treatment. Once the pain is completely settled and a crown is placed, a normal diet is advised.\n\n【64】#### **9.**\n\n【65】#### **Is It Fine to Brush My Teeth After Root Canal Procedure?**\n\n【66】There are no restrictions in brushing the teeth or flossing after a root canal procedure. It is always better to brush and floss the teeth to maintain good oral health. So once the numbness wears off, brushing can be done without putting more pressure on the root canal-treated tooth.\n\n【67】#### **10.**\n\n【68】#### **How to Manage Pain Until Getting Root Canal Procedure Done?**\n\n【69】Medications like anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics are prescribed to help patients manage pain caused by an infected pulp until a root canal procedure is done. The patient is also asked to keep the tooth clean and avoid hot or cold foods to prevent pain.\n\n【70】#### **11.**\n\n【71】#### **Which Is Better: Root Canal or Extraction?**\n\n【72】If the tooth can be saved with a root canal, it is always better to do a root canal and save the tooth instead of getting it removed, as no replacement option is as good as a natural tooth. Once the tooth is removed, it should always be replaced to maintain oral harmony.\n\n【73】Article Resources\n\n【74】*   Root Canal Explained  \n    https://www.aae.org/patients/root-canal-treatment/what-is-a-root-canal/root-canal-explained/\n*   What to expect from root canal treatment  \n    https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142780", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Retinal vasculitis is either idiopathic or can result from systemic disease and infection. The research suggests that almost 33 percent of retinal vasculitis cases have unknown etiology. On the other hand, systemic diseases include multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, or polyangiitis. The condition usually represents the symptoms from pain to visual acuity in patients. There are a plethora of differential diagnoses associated with this condition, and after ruling them out with various diagnostic methods, the doctor can go for the management. Moreover, there are many ophthalmic imaging options available that can evaluate the extent and progress of the condition as well as the location and the complications associated with it.\n\n【2】What Are the Classifications of Retinal Vasculitis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Retinal vasculitis is classified as below:\n\n【4】*   **According to the Location:**\n    \n    *   **Retinal Vasculitis Affecting Near Macula:** This type of condition causes critical symptoms such as affected visual acuity: This type of form is usually asymptomatic.\n        \n    *   **Retinal Vasculitis Affecting Peripheral Vessels:** It is a systemic or inflammatory disorder affecting peripheral retinal vessels. The condition is caused by either viral or bacterial infections.\n        \n*   **According to the Occlusive Form:**\n    \n    *   **Occlusive:** It is a rare type of retinal vasculitis that can lead to neovascularization which leads to vitreous hemorrhage.\n        \n    *   **Non-occlusive:** It is usually in the asymptomatic form.\n        \n\n【5】What Are the Disorders Associated With Retinal Vasculitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】There are the following disorders connected with retinal vasculitis:\n\n【7】*   **Bacterial Disorders:**\n    \n    *   Tuberculosis.\n        \n    *   Syphilis.\n        \n    *   Lyme disease.\n        \n    *   Whipple’s disease.\n        \n    *   Pots-streptococcal syndrome.\n        \n\n【8】*   **Viral Disorders:**\n    \n    *   Human T lymphoma virus.\n        \n    *   Herpes simplex virus.\n        \n    *   Varicella zoster virus.\n        \n    *   Acquired immunodeficiency virus.\n        \n    *   West Nile virus.\n        \n        Related Topics\n        \n        * * *\n        \n        Chester Porphyria - Cause, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n        \n        I cannot move my eye outwards.

During this condition, the inflammations are seen associated with all uveal components of the eyes.\n    \n*   Hypopyon formation is usually seen in corneal ulcers where the neutrophils and fibrin are accumulated.\n    \n*   Neovascularization is the condition where new blood vessels are formed and grow. It is usually seen in the retina and cornea, where due to this condition, the blood vessels might leak and cause vision problems.\n    \n*   Epiretinal membrane is a fibrovascular tissue that is commonly found on the inner exterior of the retina.\n    \n*   Intraretinal hemorrhage is a dark red and sharply outlined lesion seen on the deep capillary layer of the eye due to bleeding in the new vessels.\n    \n*   Vascular sheathing condition is the accumulation of inflammatory cells around the affected vessels in the eye. It is usually caused by toxoplasmosis along with TB (tuberculosis).\n    \n*   Intraocular inflammation is an eye inflammation caused by infection, injury, or trauma.\n    \n\n【14】How to Diagnose Retinal Vasculitis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】The diagnostic method is based on the physician's differential diagnosis from the case history and physical examination. Moreover, if the patient's symptoms are suggestive of underlying diseases, the healthcare provider usually suggests other tests. For instance, fluorescein angiogram, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, VDRL (veneral disease research laboratory test), FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption), blood chemistry, urinalysis, tuberculin skin testing, HIV serology (human immunodeficiency virus), and chest radiograph are the next options for diagnosis.\n\n【16】There are the following diagnostic methods used for retinal vasculitis:\n\n【17】*   **Laboratory Tests:**\n    \n    *   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n        \n    *   C-Reactive protein.\n        \n    *   Blood sugar.\n        \n    *   Tuberculin skin testing.\n        \n    *   Lyme disease serology.\n        \n    *   Dengue virus serology.\n        \n*   **Imaging:**\n    \n    *   **Ultra Wide-Field Fluorescein Angiography:** This type of diagnostic method is used to evaluate the extent of the condition, along with the location of vascular leakage in the retina. Also, with this diagnostic method along with others, retinal infiltration, retinal vasculitis, and cystoid macular edema can be detected with this diagnostic option.\n        \n    *   **Optical Coherence Tomography and Fundus Photography:** This diagnostic method is used to detect retinal and choroidal lesions. Also, complications such as cystoid macular edema or retinal neovascularization can be detected with this method.\n        \n    *   **Ultrasonography:** This diagnostic method is usually evaluated if the patient is suffering from retinal detachment or other vascular abnormalities associated with the eyes.\n        \n    *   **Chest X-ray:** This diagnostic method is used to check an abnormality or complication associated with the heart, lungs, or other arteries caused by retinal vasculitis.\n        \n    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** MRI is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic procedure that can give any information about the body’s soft tissues, blood flow, or organ function.\n        \n    *   **Sacroiliac X-ray:** This diagnostic method is used to evaluate the etiological factor behind the pain or swelling in the pelvic region of the body.\n        \n\n【18】What Are the Differential Diagnosis of Retinal Vasculitis Based on Ophthalmoscopic Findings?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The following are the differential diagnosis based on ophthalmoscopic findings:\n\n【20】*   **Phlebitis:**\n    \n    *   Bachet’s disease.\n        \n    *   Tuberculosis.\n        \n    *   Human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n        \n\n【21】*   **Arteritis:**\n    \n    *   Acute retinal necrosis.\n        \n    *   Idiopathic retinal vasculitis.\n        \n    *   Polyarteritis.\n        \n\n【22】*   **Cotton-Wool Spots:**\n    \n    *   Systemic vasculitis.\n        \n    *   Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n        \n\n【23】*   **Internal Infiltrations:**\n    \n    *   Bachet’s disease.\n        \n    *   Cat scratch disease.\n        \n\n【24】*   **Necrotizing Retinitis:**\n    \n    *   Ocular toxoplasmosis.\n        \n    *   Acute retinal necrosis.\n        \n\n【25】*   **Frosted Branch Angiitis:**\n    \n    *   Crohn’s disease.\n        \n    *   Epstein-Barr virus infection.\n        \n    *   Herpes simplex virus.\n        \n    *   Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n        \n\n【26】*   **Retinal Ischemic:**\n    \n    *   Tuberculosis.\n        \n    *   Eale’s disease.\n        \n    *   Multiple sclerosis.\n        \n\n【27】How to Manage Retinal Vasculitis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【28】There are different factors affecting the management options suitable for the patient. For instance, etiology, severity, cause of vasculitis, and type there are the following management options available for retinal vasculitis:\n\n【29】*   **Systemic Immunosuppressant:**\n    \n    *   Corticosteroids and Cyclosporine A to manage inflammation.\n        \n    *   IMS agents, such as Methotrexate, along with systemic corticosteroids, can reduce cotton wool spots or vasculopathy.\n        \n    *   Azathioprine twice a day.\n        \n\n【30】*   **Biologics:**\n    \n    *   In the cases of vision acuity, anti-TNF (Antitumor necrosis factor alpha) drugs are used. These are Infliximab and Adalimumab. In severe cases, these drugs can be used as the first line of IMS treatment too. These two drugs are usually an excellent choice in treating refractory cases of sarcoidosis along with retinal vasculitis.\n        \n\n【31】*   **Plasma Exchange:**\n    \n    *   Although plasma exchange has not proven to be as beneficial as other treatment options, it is still useful for severe cases of cerebritis or alveolar hemorrhage.\n        \n    *   In critical cases of systemic lupus erythematosus, Plasma exchange treatment along with Rituximab infusion has given stability in occlusive retinal vasculopathy.\n        \n\n【32】*   **Other Drugs:**\n    \n    *   Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is managed by drug therapy that includes anticoagulants, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange. Having said that, long-term anticoagulation therapy has not proven to be much beneficial in retinal vaso-occlusive events.\n        \n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】Retinal vasculitis can cause fatal damage along with many health-related complications. The condition has many different causes from genetics to systemic disease. If the patient with this condition is not treated on time, they might suffer from irreversible vision. Usually, with retinal vasculitis, patients are recommended the diagnostic option such as wide-field angiography which can evaluate retinal ischemia.\n\n【35】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【36】* * *\n\n【37】#### **1.**\n\n【38】#### **What Is Occlusive Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【39】Occlusive retinal vasculitis is also known as hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV). It is a rare condition that occurs after a cataract surgery where intraocular vancomycin is used at the time of surgery. It is an effectively devasting condition or complication of cataract surgery.\n\n【40】#### **2.**\n\n【41】#### **How to Diagnose Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【42】Ophthalmologists usually recommend ancillary tests to diagnose retinal vasculitis. An ancillary test used to diagnose retinal vasculitis is fluorescein angiography. The fluorescein angiography shows vascular leakage, capillary non-perfusion, retinal neovascularization, macular edema, optic nerve head inflammation, and choroidal vascular flow. In addition to this, the doctors also recommend some laboratory tests.\n\n【43】#### **3.**\n\n【44】#### **What Is Retinal Vasculitis Vitritis?**\n\n【45】Vitritis is an intraocular inflammation of the vitreous (which is a gel-like substance located behind the lens and middle of the eye). Vitritis may be the differential diagnosis of retinal vasculitis.\n\n【46】#### **4.**\n\n【47】#### **How to Check for Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【48】When a person is affected with retinal vasculitis, they may have symptoms like blurred vision, scotoma (visual field abnormality), altered color vision, metamorphopsia (the shape of the object appears distorted in this syndrome), pain, flashes, and floaters. The person may have signs like perivascular sheathing(collection of the exudate), intraretinal infiltrates(inflammation of the retina), cotton wool spots(occurs due to retinal obstruction), retinal necrosis(usually caused by herpes simplex virus), frosted branch angiitis, and retinal ischemia(cause blindness).\n\n【49】#### **5.**\n\n【50】#### **What Is the Most Common Cause of Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【51】Usually, retinal vasculitis is associated with various systemic conditions that are affected by cytomegalovirus and conditions like toxoplasmosis (infection caused by Toxoplasma gonadii), tuberculosis (disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis), herpes virus infections, syphilis (infection caused by Treponema pallidum), and many other conditions. In some cases, the cause may be unknown, in which it is said as idiopathic retinal vasculitis.\n\n【52】#### **6.**\n\n【53】#### **Does MS Cause Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【54】In the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis, the retinal vascular changes may be asymptomatic. Still, the spectrum of variation may range from mild retinal peri phlebitis in the peripheral region to peripheral occlusive retinal vasculitis. Thus multiple sclerosis may also cause retinal vasculitis.\n\n【55】#### **7.**\n\n【56】#### **What Is the Laser Treatment for Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【57】The laser treatment which is used to treat retinal vasculitis is retinal laser photocoagulation. It is a minimally invasive procedure that seals the leaking blood vessels in the retina. It is absolutely a safe laser treatment for retinal vasculitis. This procedure does not require hospitalization.\n\n【58】#### **8.**\n\n【59】#### **How Does a Laser Remove a Vascular Lesion?**\n\n【60】When laser light is targeted at the vascular lesion, it absorbs the light by oxyhemoglobin, so there the light is converted to heat. This heat diffuses radially inside the blood vessels, which results in selective microvascular parts damage with the help of mechanical injury and photocoagulation.\n\n【61】#### **9.**\n\n【62】#### **What Is the Success Rate of Retinal Lasers?**\n\n【63】The success rate for treating retinal detachments, retinal tears, and vascular changes in the retina is 98 %. These procedures can be done in the outpatient setting and do not require hospitalization.\n\n【64】#### **10.**\n\n【65】#### **Which Laser Is Best Suited for Ophthalmic Vascular Disease?**\n\n【66】Flash lamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (PDL) is the most commonly used laser to treat vascular lesions of the eye. This flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (PDL) emits a yellow light pulsed beam at 585 nm, which is powered by a flash lamp. It also has side effects like hypo and hyperpigmentation, dermal and epidermal atrophy, etc.\n\n【67】#### **11.**\n\n【68】#### **Does Lupus Cause Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【69】Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune condition that may cause various ocular conditions like retinal vasculitis, retinal hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. It can be treated by prescribing high doses of corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents.\n\n【70】#### **12.**\n\n【71】#### **What Autoimmune Disease Causes Retinal Vasculitis?**\n\n【72】The autoimmune diseases that cause retinal vasculitis include   \n\\- Vaso- occlusive (also called a sickle cell crisis).  \n\\- Retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes).  \n\\- Occlusive vasculitis.  \n\\- Systemic lupus erythematosus (inflammatory disease).   \n\\- Crohn's disease (chronic inflammatory bowel disease).  \n\\- Sarcoidosis (a condition that affects the immune system).  \n\\- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.  \n\\- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.  \n\\- Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (inherited disorder).  \n\\- Polyarteritis nodosa (inflammatory blood vessel disease).\n\n【73】#### **13.**\n\n【74】#### **What Are the Stages of Vasculitis Retinal?**\n\n【75】Retinal vasculitis is categorized under four stages. They are   \n\\- Stage 1 - Stage of Inflammation - Characterized by active inflammation causing retinal edema (accumulation of fluid in the retina), retinal hemorrhages, and macular edema (swelling in the retinal part).  \n\\- Stage 2 - Stage of Ischemia - Characterized by tortuous collaterals and sclerosed vessels.  \n\\- Stage 3 - Stage of Neovascularization - Most commonly present with vitreous hemorrhage.  \n\\- Stage 4 - Stage of Complications - Complications include tractional retinal detachment and neovascular granuloma.\n\n【76】#### **14.**\n\n【77】#### **Is Retinal Vasculitis Fatal?**\n\n【78】It is a fatal condition if left untreated as it may cause swelling of blood vessels in the retina. It may also cause severe visual loss if left untreated. It is a recurrent and aggressive disease that requires immunosuppressive therapy and steroids.\n\n【79】Article Resources\n\n【80】*   Retinal Vasculitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4893321/\n*   Retinal Vasculitis: It’s Significance  \n    https://uveitis.org/physician\\_articles/retinal-vasculitis-significance/\n*   Ischemic Retinal Vasculitis and Its Management  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262456481\\_Ischemic\\_Retinal\\_Vasculitis\\_and\\_Its\\_Management", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

All of the muscles below the knee and the posterior thigh have motor functions. Additionally, below the knee receives sensory function, with the exception of a small band on the medial lower leg. Patients undergoing lower extremity surgery are given anesthesia or analgesia through sciatic nerve block. When paired with a femoral nerve block, the anterior approach to the sciatic nerve is beneficial because it is carried out with the patient supine.\n\n【2】Although the anterior approach employing surface anatomical landmarks does have technical difficulty and is regarded as an advanced nerve block technique, the sciatic nerve passes along the posterior thigh and behind the femur. Despite few reliable surface anatomical landmarks and the procedure being technically challenging, ultrasonography guidance may make performing the anterior approach to the sciatic nerve block easier.\n\n【3】What Is an Ultrasound-Guided Sciatic Nerve Block?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】There are various anatomic sites where the sciatic nerve can be blocked by regional anesthesia. These sites are the sacral plexus, traditional trans gluteal approach, subgluteal approach, anterior approach, and popliteal approach. Similar to the majority of other regional anesthetic methods, ultrasound visualization has evolved into the accepted standard of care.\n\n【5】*   **Sacral Plexus Approach:** The patient is placed in a prone or lateral position, and a line is established between the tuberosity of the ischial and posterior superior iliac spine, the site to be anesthetized. Despite the fact that ultrasound techniques are rarely employed in routine clinical practice, in sacral plexus block it is. When paired with lumbar plexus blockage, the sacral plexus is the sole region of the peripheral sacral nerve that is close enough to offer anesthesia for hip surgery. There are sensory articular extensions that originate from the hip's superior gluteal nerve.\n    \n\n【6】*   **Trans-Gluteal Approach:** The greater trochanter of the hip and the posterior superior iliac spine's midpoint are located with the patient in Sim's position. From this midpoint, a line perpendicular to the initial line is formed. A second line is drawn from the upper trochanter to the sacrum hiatus. The location of the needle is where the second line's perpendicular to the first line intersects it. The use of ultrasound in regional anesthesia has led to a switch away from the conventional sciatic nerve block technique towards the subgluteal, frontal, and popliteal approaches, despite the fact that it has been relatively constant.\n    \n\n【7】*   **Subgluteal Approach:** The subgluteal approach to sciatic nerve blocking has taken over as the standard method. (example tourniquet placement). The sciatic nerve is seen via ultrasonic imaging along a line between the greater trochanter and ischial tuberosity. It is situated above the quadratus femoris muscle in the subgluteal fascial plane. Although this method is typically carried out while lying on one side, a supine variation with the hip flexed is also possible.\n    \n\n【8】*   **Anterior Sciatic Approach:** The anterior sciatic approach is helpful at the level of the lesser trochanter. It is indicated when the patient cannot be positioned laterally. The knee is flexed and the thigh is externally rotated. The lesser trochanter of the femur is located by ultrasound visualization. After that, the sciatic nerve is found medially and deeply in this skeletal landmark. Similar anesthetic outcomes to the subgluteal method.\n    \n\n【9】*   **Popliteal Approach:** The most distant site for blocking the sciatic nerve is the popliteal approach. Approximately 6 cm above the popliteal crease, the sciatic nerve is anesthetized right where it splits into the tibial nerve and the more lateral common peroneal nerve. Since the development of ultrasound visualization, it has evolved from its original description as a landmark-based blind approach to becoming a staple of the knee and lower leg anesthesia and analgesia. The tibial nerve, which lies just posterior to the popliteal artery, is also situated in the knee crease. As the probe is progressively advanced in a proximal direction, the tibial nerve is continuously visible until the common peroneal nerve connects with it to form the sciatic nerve. The popliteal technique can be used to set up a blockage.\n    \n\n【10】What Is the General Consideration of Ultrasound-Guided Sciatic Nerve Block?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The anterior approach to the sciatic nerve block may be helpful for patients that are unable to place in a lateral orientation because of discomfort, trauma, and the existence of external stabilization devices that obstruct the placement and may result in other issues. Compared to the landmark-based strategy, the ultrasonography (US)-guided approach may lower the chance of femoral artery puncture. Instead of the anterior surface of the proximal thigh, the actual scanning and needle insertion are done on the anteromedial portion of the thigh. This may necessitate a minor external rotation and abduction of the thigh. This block is not well suited for catheter insertion because it is an uncomfortable location (medial thigh), a large needle must pass through several muscles (causing discomfort during the procedure and risk of hematoma), and it is challenging to insert the catheter at roughly a perpendicular angle to the sciatic nerve.\n\n【12】What Are the Techniques of Ultrasound-Guided Sciatic Nerve Block?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   The transducer is placed to locate the sciatic nerve while the patient is positioned appropriately and the skin is disinfected. To increase contrast and make the nerve stand out from the musculature, move the transducer proximally or distally while sliding and tilting it. The nerve frequently moves within the intermuscular plane when the patient can dorsiflex and/or plantarflex the ankle, making identification easier. In either case, the needle is moved towards the sciatic nerve from the medial portion of the thigh.\n    \n\n【14】*   The needle was used at a sharp angle with the usage of a curved or nonlinear probe, due to this an in-plane technique may prove less useful. When nerve stimulation (1.0 milliampere per 0.1 millisecond) is used, the interaction of the syringe tip meets the sciatic nerve is often results in a motor response in the foot or calf. Once the needle tip is in the ideal spot, 1 to 2 milliliters of local anesthetic is administered to ensure that the injectate is being distributed properly. The sciatic nerve should be pushed out from the needle with this injection, which helps define the sciatic nerve's boundaries within its muscular tunnel. The position of the needle tip may need to be adjusted due to an inappropriate local anesthetic dissemination or nerve displacement.\n    \n\n【15】*   For an effective block in an adult patient, 10 to 15 milliliters of local anesthetic is typically sufficient. While a single injection of this amount of local anesthetic is sufficient, it may be advantageous to administer two to three smaller aliquots at various sites to ensure that the local anesthetic is distributed evenly along the sciatic nerve.\n    \n\n【16】**Conclusion:**\n\n【17】Sciatic nerve blocks are frequently carried out by pain specialists and anesthesiologists. Positioning is crucial when a sciatic nerve block is carried out because the supine position precludes the use of trans gluteal and sacral plexus methods. The popliteal and subgluteal approaches can both be carried out in the supine position, but only the anterior sciatic approach does so on a regular basis. When selecting a sciatic nerve block technique, consideration must be given to elements such as tourniquet location, surgical site, accessibility, and postoperative motor impairment.\n\n【18】Article Resources\n\n【19】*   Sciatic Nerve Block  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470391/\n*   Which Ultrasound-Guided Sciatic Nerve Block Strategy Works Faster?

The mechanism of action is as follows:\n\n【10】*   Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide. The action of this class is inhibiting the bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid. Now, dihydrofolate is an essential dose in synthesizing nucleic acids. Nucleic acids make up the genetic material of the bacteria and hence are vital for its survival.\n    \n*   Trimethoprim, in a similar manner, inhibits the synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is again synthesized from dihydrofolic acid.\n    \n\n【11】Hence, both the antibiotics in this combination prevent the subsequent steps of nucleic acid synthesis and thereby kill the bacteria.\n\n【12】**The Onset of Action:**\n\n【13】About 97% (Sulfamethoxazole) and 90% (Trimethoprim) of the drug reach the blood circulation. The drug reaches its maximum concentration in blood in one to four hours post-oral administration. It is excreted mainly through the kidneys, and around 85% of Sulfamethoxazole and 66 % of Trimethoprim is excreted through urine.\n\n【14】In short, the onset of action for this medication is between one to four hours after oral administration.

Though women are more affected by this condition, it is one of the common conditions among people over 60 years of age. Hypothyroidism is not a serious health condition and can be easily treated with proper medical treatment.\n\n【2】What Causes Hypothyroidism?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】There are several causes of hypothyroidism, and it can be due to either,\n\n【4】*   Primary thyroid gland disorders (primary hypothyroidism).\n    \n*   Decreased TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) secretion by the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism).\n    \n*   Post-surgeries like thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism or large goiter.\n    \n*   Post-ablative causes (radio-iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism).\n    \n\n【5】**A. Primary Hypothyroidism:**\n\n【6】1\\. Removal of some or all parts of the thyroid gland.\n\n【7】2\\. Following iodine 131 administration for hyperthyroidism.\n\n【8】3\\. Congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n【9】4\\. Goitrous.\n\n【10】*   Hashimoto's thyroiditis - Immune system attacks the thyroid, which is the most common cause.\n*   Iodine deficiency.\n*   Drug-induced such as lithium, amiodarone, and methimazole.\n*   Genetic enzyme defects (dys-hormonogenesis).\n*   Inflammation of the thyroid.\n\n【11】**B. Secondary Hypothyroidism:**\n\n【12】1\\. Destruction of the pituitary gland,\n\n【13】*   After surgery.\n*   Radiation treatment.\n*   Tumor.\n\n【14】2\\. Disorders of the hypothalamus.\n\n【15】The common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide is iodine deficiency. However, hypothyroidism might occur in areas where iodine deficiency is absent, known as autoimmune thyroiditis. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is initially associated with goiter (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Later it becomes atrophic, namely atrophic thyroiditis (organ-specific autoimmune disease).\n\n【16】Who Is at Risk for Hypothyroidism?\n----------------------------------\n\n【17】The risk of getting hypothyroidism is greater in,\n\n【18】*   Women - Particularly older women are more prone to get hypothyroidism than men.\n    \n*   People whose close relatives have hypothyroidism or autoimmune disease.\n    \n\n【19】The other risk factors are seen in people with:\n\n【20】*   Type 1 diabetes.\n    \n*   Have had surgery for a thyroid problem.\n    \n*   Turners syndrome.\n    \n*   Autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's disease, vitiligo, or pernicious anemia.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Can hypothyroidism cause symptoms like fever, hives all over the body, and a swollen thyroid gland?\n    \n    Why do I have numbness and pain all over my body?\n    \n    Can hypothyroidism be the reason for high TSH and normal T3 and T4 levels?\n    \n*   Radiation treatment to the thyroid, chest, or neck.\n    \n*   Pregnant or became a mother recently.\n    \n*   Lupus (a chronic autoimmune disease).\n    \n\n【21】What Are the Clinical Manifestations of Hypothyroidism?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】**1) In Adults:**\n\n【23】The signs and symptoms vary from person to person, and the important symptoms of hypothyroidism in adults are,\n\n【24】*   General symptoms:\n    \n\n【25】*   Weakness.\n    \n*   Cold intolerance.\n    \n*   Hair loss.\n    \n*   Tiredness.\n    \n*   Dry, coarse skin.\n    \n*   Loss of color of the skin and mucous membrane.\n    \n*   Puffy face, hand, and feet.\n    \n*   Goiter (swelling of the thyroid gland).\n    \n*   Myxedema (a severe form of hypothyroidism).\n    \n*   Poor appetite.\n    \n*   Weight gain.\n    \n*   Hypothermia (faster loss of body heat).\n    \n*   Hoarse voice.\n    \n\n【26】*   Gastrointestinal symptoms:\n    \n\n【27】*   Constipation.\n    \n*   Enlarged tongue.\n    \n*   Bloating.\n    \n\n【28】*   Reproductive symptoms:\n    \n\n【29】*   Menorrhagia (abnormal menstrual bleeding).\n    \n*   Amenorrhea (absence of menstrual bleeding).\n    \n*   Infertility.\n    \n*   Galactorrhea (milky nipple discharge).\n    \n\n【30】*   Nervous system symptoms.\n    \n\n【31】*   Poor memory.\n    \n*   Poor concentration.\n    \n*   Numbness.\n    \n*   Tingling.\n    \n*   Delayed relaxation of deep reflexes.\n    \n*   Weakness of hands.\n    \n\n【32】*   Cardiovascular symptoms:\n    \n\n【33】*   Bradycardia (slower than normal heartbeat).\n    \n*   Hypertension.\n    \n*   Ischemic heart disease (damage to major blood vessels of the heart).\n    \n*   Pericardial effusion (extra fluid in the space around the heart).\n    \n\n【34】Prolonged hypothyroidism causes the deposition of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in tissues. This results in non-pitting edema (myxedema). As hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people will not be able to notice the signs and symptoms of the disease for several months or years.\n\n【35】**2) In Infants or Babies:**\n\n【36】Infants with hypothyroidism will not have any symptoms. However, if symptoms occur, they may show up the following.\n\n【37】*   Little or no growth.\n    \n*   Constipation.\n    \n*   Poor feeding habits.\n    \n*   Extreme sleepiness.\n    \n*   Hoarse cry.\n    \n*   Stomach bloating.\n    \n*   Cold hands and feet.\n    \n*   Low muscle tone.\n    \n*   Persistent jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes).\n    \n*   Puffy face.\n    \n*   Umbilical hernia (an abnormal opening makes the organ or the tissue bulge).\n    \n*   Swollen tongue.\n    \n\n【38】**3) In Children and Teens:**\n\n【39】They might also have hypothyroidism with symptoms seen in adults. In addition, they also have:\n\n【40】*   Delayed growth.\n    \n*   Delay in puberty.\n    \n*   Slower mental development.\n    \n*   Delayed eruption of permanent teeth.\n    \n\n【41】What Are the Complications of Hypothyroidism?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【42】If hypothyroidism is untreated, it might lead to various complications such as:\n\n【43】*   Increasing the risk for heart problems.\n    \n*   Contributes to high cholesterol.\n    \n*   Leading to myxedema coma, a condition where the body's functions slow down to a point, resulting in a life-threatening condition.\n    \n*   Increased body weight.\n    \n*   Joint pain.\n    \n*   Pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and premature birth. In addition, it slows down the growth and development of the baby.\n    \n\n【44】How Is Hypothyroidism Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【45】If the patient experiences the symptoms of hypothyroidism, the doctor will ask for the following to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【46】*   Family history of hypothyroidism.\n    \n*   Past and present medical history.\n    \n*   Physical examination.\n    \n*   **Thyroid Function Tests:** High serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is the earliest indicator of primary hypothyroidism, and when it is low, it indicates secondary hypothyroidism. The serum T4 (thyroxine) is low in hypothyroidism. High serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and normal serum thyroxine might indicate subclinical or mild hypothyroidism, which is the early stage of hypothyroidism. High titer antibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) are found in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and atrophic thyroiditis.\n    \n\n【47】*   **Blood Tests:** The blood reports of people with hypothyroidism show,\n    \n\n【48】1.  Anemia (normocytic or macrocytic).\n    \n2.  Increased serum creatine kinase.\n    \n3.  High serum cholesterol.\n    \n4.  Increased triglycerides.\n    \n5.  Elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase).\n    \n6.  Decreased sodium levels in the blood.\n    \n\n【49】If the doctor suspects hypothyroidism with the above diagnosis, then further diagnosis with the imaging tests is taken to check for the nodules or inflammation.\n\n【50】1.  Thyroid scan.\n    \n2.  Ultrasound.\n    \n\n【51】How Is Hypothyroidism Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【52】Hypothyroidism should be treated with oral Levothyroxine. The treatment is usually started with a low dose (50 to 100 micrograms daily) and gradually increases. In elderly individuals, a smaller starting dose (25 micrograms) is preferred to avoid cardiac side effects. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is monitored periodically, and the dosage adjustment of thyroxine is made accordingly. The ideal goal is to maintain thyroid-stimulating hormone at the lower half of the reference range, and the treatment is needed lifelong. The prescription for hypothyroidism can be easily obtained even via tele-consultation.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】As a person gets older, it is natural for some changes to occur in our body, such as the low production of thyroid hormones. This is very common and can be easily managed with proper medical treatment and a balanced diet. Since there might be other conditions associated with hypothyroidism, it is necessary to consult a doctor regularly to keep track of the treatment progress.\n\n【55】Article Resources\n\n【56】*   Hypothyroidism  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519536/\n*   Hypothyroidism  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/hypothyroidism#:~:text=Hypothyroidism%2C%20also%20called%20underactive%20thyroid,the%20front%20of%20your%20neck\n*   Hypothyroidism  \n    https://www.thyroid.org/hypothyroidism/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The vaccines can prevent Hib disease. Hib vaccination is recommended for all children below five years. Multiple shots are needed. The shots should be given at two months, four months, six months, and 12 through 15 months. Hib vaccines are safe, and most children who get a Hib vaccine do not have any problems. Hib infection can cause pneumonia, swelling in the throat, difficulty in breathing, infections of joints and bones, and can also lead to death.\n\n【2】What Is Haemophilus Influenzae Type B Vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The Hib vaccine prevents Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) disease. There are two types of vaccines used to protect against Hib disease they are:\n\n【4】*   DTap-IPV/Hib vaccine protects children aged two through 18 months from Hib disease, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, and diptheria.\n    \n*   This vaccine helps in protecting children and adults from Hib disease.\n    \n\n【5】What is the Composition of the Haemophilus Influenzae Type B Vaccine?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The Hib vaccine is a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, a type of inactivated bacterial vaccine. It is made by joining a piece of polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the Hib bacterium to a protein carrier. The vaccines use different carrier proteins.\n\n【7】**1) Monovalent Vaccines** \\- There are three monovalent vaccines licensed in the United States. These vaccines can be used in infants as young as six weeks. They are:\n\n【8】*   ActHIB (PRP-T)\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Can Pentavalent vaccine cause loose motion?\n    \n    Croup Imaging - Diagnostic Evaluation and Scoring Systems\n    \n    Functional Hyposplenism - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   Hiberix (PRP-T)\n    \n*   PedavaxHIB (PRP-OMB)\n    \n\n【9】**2) Combination Vaccines** - Manufacturers create several different vaccines that can be used. They are:\n\n【10】*   **Pentacel** - This vaccine contains lyophilized ActHIB reconstituted with a liquid DTaP/IPV solution. FDA has approved Pentacel for all doses of Hib.\n    \n*   **Vaxelis** - This vaccine contains Pentacel except with PedvaxHIB for the Hib component and Recombivax HB. Vaxelis for dose one of three of the Hib primary series. It should not be used for booster doses.\n    \n\n【11】How Is Haemophilus Influenzae Transmitted?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Haemophilus influenzae type B causes different kinds of infections. Hib infection spreads through droplets that come through coughing and sneezing. It usually affects children below five years of age but can also affect adults. The Hib bacteria causes mild to severe illnesses like ear infections, bronchitis, or blood infection. The severe Hib infection is called invasive Hib disease, which requires hospitalization and can lead to death. Earlier the Hib infection was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children below five years of age. Meningitis leads to brain damage and deafness.\n\n【13】How Many Doses of This Vaccine Are Needed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are three to four doses of the Hib vaccine. It is given as follows:\n\n【15】*   **For Infants** - The Hib vaccine is given at two months of age.\n    \n*   **For Children Between 12 Months and Five Years of Age** - The children in this age group may need one or more doses of the Hib vaccine if the child has yet to receive the vaccine before.\n    \n*   **For Children Above Five Years and Adults** - Children above five years and adults usually do not receive the Hib vaccine. Still, the vaccine can be recommended for those whose spleen is damaged or has been removed and also recommended in people with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Anyone whose immune system is suppressed or weak due to cancer treatment or other drugs should consult the doctor.\n    \n\n【16】The Hib vaccine can be given along with the other vaccines. Hib vaccines are immunogenic in patients with an increased risk for invasive disease. The Hib vaccine provides long-lasting immunity, but the duration of immunity is still not known.\n\n【17】Who Needs to Get the Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The Hib infection is indicated in infants and children below five years. Children and infants need Hib vaccination as a part of their vaccination schedule. Three to four doses of vaccines are required depending on the brand of the Hib vaccine. The infants and children need the doses at the following ages:\n\n【19】*   First dose - Two months.\n    \n*   Second dose - Four months.\n    \n*   Third dose - Six months.\n    \n*   Booster dose - 12 to 15 months.\n    \n\n【20】Children above five years and adults can also get vaccinated. Adults who are at risk for developing Hib infection should also get vaccinated.\n\n【21】Who Does Not Need to Get the Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The following people should avoid getting the Haemophilus vaccination:\n\n【23】*   Children have had an allergic reaction to the Hib vaccine in the past.\n    \n*   Infants younger than six weeks.\n    \n*   People having a serious allergy to vaccines.\n    \n\n【24】What Are the Potential Side Effects of This Vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The side effects of the Hib vaccine include:\n\n【26】*   There can be redness, swelling, or warmth that can appear on the injection site.\n    \n*   Fever can happen a few days after Hib vaccination.\n    \n*   Some people can feel dizzy after vaccination.\n    \n*   If one observes any kind of allergic reaction like hives, swelling of the face and throat, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, or weakness after the vaccination, report to the healthcare provider immediately.\n    \n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】Hib infections can cause serious complications and can even be deadly. So the best way to prevent Hib disease is to get vaccinated. In addition, the patient can consult the doctor to know more about the vaccination schedule and the dosage.\n\n【29】Article Resources\n\n【30】*   Haemophilus influenzae Disease  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/index.html\n*   Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae Type B)  \n    https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/diseases/hib/index.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "18678899-4ff8-443d-9b0a-a83e7e11dcc1", "title": "Living With Cancer", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Cancer is a clinical condition characterized by the abnormal growth of cells of the body. It is a nightmare to get diagnosed with cancer, and it takes a toll on the patient as well as the family members after the news. The treatment depends on the type of cancer, staging, patient factors, etc. The process of treatment is also disturbing. There are a lot of brave hearts that overcome this disease. Living with cancer itself is a big deal. Chronic cancer is a type of cancer that cannot be treated, but the treatment is extended for several months or years to improve the quality of life of the patients. There are so many factors that can affect living with cancer which will be discussed in this article.\n\n【2】Why Is Extended Treatment Required?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Extended treatment is given after the initial diagnosis and provision of primary treatment. It is done for the following reasons:\n\n【4】1\\. To control the cancer-like cases of chronic leukemia, breast cancer, etc.\n\n【5】2\\. To manage the severe stage of advanced cancer. This is more focused on cases with metastatic cancer.\n\n【6】3\\. To prevent the recurrence of cancer.\n\n【7】Can Chronic Cancer Be Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【8】Although chronic cancer cannot be cured completely, the treatment can help in improving the lives of the patient. It can include the provision of chemotherapy, which can be a single drug or combination of drugs. Also, your specialist or physician may use certain other therapies like immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, etc.\n\n【9】**Certain factors can affect the type of treatment you obtain. Following are the factors:**\n\n【10】*   The type of cancer.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Oral Cancer - Causes, Symptoms, Stages, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Testicular Cancer - Types, Symptoms, Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Eye Cancer - Causes, Types, Symptoms, Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   The quantity of cancer.\n    \n*   Location of cancer or the affected site or sites.\n    \n*   Age of the patient.\n    \n*   Treatment options available for that specific type of cancer.\n    \n*   Overall general health of the patient.\n    \n*   Previous treatments underwent by the patient.\n    \n*   Metastasis or spread of cancer.\n    \n*   Personal preferences of the patient.\n    \n\n【11】Based on these factors, the extended treatment is decided in the patient.\n\n【12】How Long Can This Chronic Cancer Extend?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【13】There is no specific guaranteed time for cancer or treatment. All this depends on the following factors:\n\n【14】*   The type of cancer the patient is suffering from.\n    \n*   Prognosis or outcome of the treatment.\n    \n*   Physical and emotional condition of the patient while receiving the treatment.\n    \n*   The type of treatment planned and provided.\n    \n*   Age of the patient.\n    \n*   Stage of cancer: Based on its spread and aggressiveness.\n    \n*   The overall health of the patient.\n    \n\n【15】How Can You Cope With Cancer?\n-----------------------------\n\n【16】Following will help you to manage as well improve your quality of life while living with cancer. The first thing you should remember before anything is you have to be positive. Positive vibes can create miracles.\n\n【17】1.  Try Developing a Survivorship Care Plan With Your Specialist - This includes your future check-ups, tests for cancer, any side effects of the treatment that you will be provided, and suggestions for improving your routine life.\n    \n2.  You can talk to your doctor or healthcare team about any side effects that the treatment or cancer may cause and how you can manage or overcome it.\n    \n3.  It is important to understand the benefits and side effects of the medication that you are taking. Hence, ask your specialist or physician about it.\n    \n4.  You should have regular follow-ups and also all follow-up medical tests.\n    \n5.  Rehabilitation is something you should think about. It can include various things like pain management, diet planning, emotional support, physical therapies, etc.\n    \n6.  It is important to follow a healthy lifestyle.\n    \n7.  Prevent Recurrence by the Following:\n    \n\n【18】Although there is no assured permanent cure for cancer, the recurrence can be minimized. There are so many things that are in your hand. If the external factor had caused cancer-like tobacco or smoking, you could stop consuming it. Take care of yourself. Eat healthy food, control your weight. Be physically fit by doing regular exercise.\n\n【19】Losing weight adds benefits to your quality of life. Being overweight is known to be associated with breast, kidney, pancreas, esophagus, colorectal cancer, etc. The association is seen both during the first-time diagnosis and during recurrence. You should stop or at least minimize consuming high fat-containing foods, have control over the portion, and consume more fruits and vegetables.\n\n【20】The most commonly preferred diet is the Mediterranean-style diet. This includes nuts, poultry, whole grains, fish, etc., and red meat is limited in this. Also, you can consume healthy fats like olive oil.\n\n【21】Apart from the food, it is very important to do exercise regularly to reduce weight. Regular physical activity helps in decreasing the risk of getting colon, breast, or endometrial cancer. It is also helpful in preventing recurrence.\n\n【22】1.  You can talk to your cancer management team or oncologist regarding options for financial support and resources.\n    \n2.  Manage stress and anxiety.\n    \n\n【23】Cancer term itself gives too much stress and anxiety. It is important to cope up with it as it can affect the prognosis and recurrence. You can follow a convenient way to spell out your stress and anxiety. You can do yoga, meditation, write whatever comes to your mind. Apart from these, you can meet up or talk with people who are going through the same situation as you. There are so many social groups that have many cancer surviving patients who meet up regularly and share their life experiences and how they are coping up with the stress.\n\n【24】### Conclusion:\n\n【25】Chronic cancer or any cancer can lead to an emotional and physical breakdown. Surviving from cancer is not easy, but you can always extend your hand for help from trained specialists to lead a better life. Online medical platforms make this consultation process very easy. Hence ask an expert to know more about living with cancer online.\n\n【26】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】#### **1.**\n\n【29】#### **Is It Possible to Live a Normal Life With Cancer?**\n\n【30】Yes, it is possible to live a normal life with cancer if it is detected early and treated appropriately. Reports show that people with cancer have lived for considerably longer time than expected. Life expectancy is increased when cancer is controlled, and remission is evident.\n\n【31】#### **2.**\n\n【32】#### **How to Learn to Live With Cancer?**\n\n【33】People with cancer must talk about their feelings to their family members and healthcare providers. They should stay active, have a balanced diet, and should follow a healthy lifestyle.  \nThey should treat themselves to things that make them happy such as a hot bath or a relaxing nap. Getting help for routine jobs such as cooking, cleaning, and other household activities would make them feel stress-free.\n\n【34】#### **3.**\n\n【35】#### **What Are the Feelings Commonly Seen in People Living With Cancer?**\n\n【36】The common feelings encountered by people with cancer are loneliness, sadness, and depression. They feel lonely and often distant from other people. Persistently having the sense of not feeling healthy makes them sad. Emotional support from family, peer group, and friends helps to regain their emotional balance.\n\n【37】#### **4.**\n\n【38】#### **How To Stay Positive While Living With Cancer?**\n\n【39】People with cancer should stay positive and healthy. They should not think more about their cancer status or be confined to talking only about health-related issues. Focusing on things that could be controlled gives them positive energy. Appreciating their loved ones, developing a favorable support system, and nurturing a never-give-up attitude helps people with cancer to stay positive.\n\n【40】#### **5.**\n\n【41】#### **What Is the Average Age of Mortality From Cancer?**\n\n【42】The average age for mortality due to cancer increases with age. The age-specific mortality rates gradually increase from the age group of 45 to 49 years and more steadily around the age group of 70 to 74 years. The highest mortality rates occur in people who are 90 years of age and above.\n\n【43】#### **6.**\n\n【44】#### **What Cancers Are Least Treatable?**\n\n【45】Certain types of cancers are very challenging to treat and do not respond well to therapeutic interventions. The five-year survival estimate is markedly lower in cancers such as pancreatic cancer (7.3 %), mesothelioma (7.2 %), and brain cancers (12.8 %). \n\n【46】#### **7.**\n\n【47】#### **Does Cancer Ever Gets Cured After Being Treated?**\n\n【48】After completing cancer treatment, most cancer survivors feel normal and brace for a new normal lifestyle. Clinical evidence shows that cancer is curable if complete remission for five years and above is seen. Usually, the recurrence of cancer occurs within the first five years following the treatment.  \n\n【49】#### **8.**\n\n【50】#### **Why Is It So Difficult to Survive Cancer?**\n\n【51】Cancer cells are not alien cells; they are our own body cells that grow in an abnormal manner. This complexity makes it difficult for our immune system to identify cancer cells and differentiate them from normal cells. Presently over 200 types of cancers have been detected, and each of them shows diverse patterns of progression. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms of cancer growth.\n\n【52】#### **9.**\n\n【53】#### **Can Spreading of Cancer Be Felt?**\n\n【54】Unexplained pain is the first symptom which indicates cancer is spreading. Headaches, dizziness, seizures, and gastric disturbances are some of the signs that show the spread of illness. Frequent fractures, jaundice, and breathing difficulty indicate organ involvement. \n\n【55】#### **10.**\n\n【56】#### **What Types of Cancers Are More Likely to Spread Fast?**\n\n【57】Cancers spread through metastasis (spreading through lymph nodes). Some of the fast-growing cancers are blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and thyroid cancer also show rapid metastasis.\n\n【58】Article Resources\n\n【59】*   Living with cancer and other chronic conditions: Patients’ perceptions of their healthcare experience  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516374/\n*   Conceptual framework for living with and beyond cancer: A systematic review and narrative synthesis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6594071/\n*   Quality of Life among Cancer Patients  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5661349/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d91ac0bc-9a01-48f4-8e83-23ee7400bf2b", "title": "Hallermann-Streiff Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Hallermann-Streiff Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (HSS) is a rare condition that affects the skull, face, hair, eyes, teeth, skin, and height. People with HSS may have a short, broad head with a prominent forehead and narrow nose, a small or underdeveloped lower jaw, and a narrow, highly arched roof of the mouth. They may also have clouding of the lenses of the eyes at birth, small eyes, and dental defects such as missing or misaligned teeth. HSS is caused by a new genetic change and seems to happen randomly.\n\n【2】What Is the Cause?\n------------------\n\n【3】The exact cause of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (HSS) is not fully understood, but it is believed to be the result of a new genetic mutation that occurs spontaneously (de novo) during embryonic development. This means that the genetic mutation is not inherited from either parent but instead arises spontaneously in the affected individual. The specific gene or genes involved in HSS are not yet known, but research suggests that the condition may be caused by mutations affecting genes that play a role in the development of the skull, face, hair, eyes, teeth, and skin. Some cases of HSS have been associated with abnormalities in chromosome 4, but not all individuals with HSS have these chromosomal abnormalities. It is important to note that HSS is not caused by anything the affected individual or their parents did or did not do, and there is no known way to prevent the condition.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】Some of the signs and symptoms associated with HSS include:\n\n【6】*   **Skull and Facial Malformations:** Individuals with HSS may have a short, broad head (brachycephaly) with an unusually prominent forehead and sides of the skull (dyscephaly); a small, underdeveloped lower jaw (hypoplastic mandible); a narrow, highly arched roof of the mouth (palate); and a thin, pinched, tapering nose.\n    \n*   **Sparse Hair:** Hypotrichosis, or sparse hair, is another common symptom of HSS, and it is often present from birth.\n    \n*   **Eye Abnormalities:** Clouding of the lenses of the eyes at birth (congenital cataracts or corneal stromal opacities); unusually small eyes (microphthalmia); and other ocular abnormalities (glaucoma, retinal detachments) are frequently seen in individuals with HSS.\n    \n*   **Dental Defects:** Dental defects may include natal or neonatal teeth, delayed tooth eruption, enamel hypoplasia (defect of the teeth in which the enamel is deficient in quantity), absent permanent teeth (hypodontia or partial anodontia), abnormal tooth development resulting in short roots and early loss of teeth, or improper alignment of teeth.\n    \n*   **Skin Atrophy:** Individuals with HSS may experience degenerative skin changes (atrophy), particularly in the scalp and nasal regions.\n    \n*   **Proportionate Short Stature:** HSS can also cause proportionate short stature, which means that a person's arms, legs, and torso are all shorter than those of an average person of the same age and gender.\n    \n\n【7】How to Diagnose Hallermann-Streiff Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The diagnosis of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (HSS) is usually based on a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and genetic testing. A physical examination may reveal characteristic craniofacial features, sparse hair, dental defects, and other abnormalities associated with HSS. Medical imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT (computed tomography) scans, may also be used to evaluate the skull and facial bones, as well as the eyes and teeth. Genetic testing, such as chromosomal analysis or molecular genetic testing, may be used to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific genetic mutation responsible for HSS. Due to the rarity of HSS, it is important that individuals suspected of having this condition seek evaluation and diagnosis from a healthcare professional with expertise in diagnosing and managing rare genetic disorders.\n\n【9】What Are the Treatment Options?\n-------------------------------\n\n【10】*   The approach to treating Hallermann-Streiff syndrome depends on the specific symptoms that a patient presents with. The care of individuals with this syndrome may require the involvement of a team of medical professionals such as pediatricians, craniofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, dental specialists, and other healthcare providers.\n    \n*   For infants who experience respiratory and feeding difficulties, early management includes monitoring breathing, the consideration of tracheostomies, and supportive measures to ensure sufficient nutrient intake. Early surgical removal of cataracts may be recommended to preserve vision, but it may not always be necessary as cataract absorption may occur spontaneously in some patients. Regular ophthalmology follow-up is essential to identify and treat other eye abnormalities that may require surgical intervention. Dental anomalies must be managed appropriately to prevent complications related to oral cavity dimensions and the development of dental caries.\n    \n*   Surgical reconstruction may be necessary for craniofacial malformations, particularly in the mandibular and nasal regions, at the appropriate age. However, patients may have a risk of anesthetic complications due to upper airway obstruction, making intubation challenging. For infants and children with heart defects, surgical intervention or medical treatment may be recommended based on the nature and severity of the anatomical abnormalities.\n    \n*   Early intervention is crucial to ensuring that individuals with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome reach their full potential. Special services such as remedial education, social support, physical therapy, and other medical and vocational services may be beneficial.\n    \n*   Affected individuals and their families could benefit from genetic counseling. Any other treatment is focused on relieving and supporting specific symptoms.\n    \n\n【11】At What Stage Do the Symptoms of Hallermann-Streiff Syndrome Manifest?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The indications of this condition can present themselves during infancy or shortly after birth.\n\n【13】The onset of symptoms can vary across different illnesses, with some starting within a specific age group or spanning multiple age groups. In certain diseases, symptoms can emerge at any age. Understanding when the symptoms first appeared can assist healthcare professionals in making an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【14】**Conclusion**\n\n【15】Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (HSS) is a rare genetic condition that affects multiple parts of the body, including the skull, face, hair, eyes, teeth, skin, and height. The exact cause of HSS is not fully understood, but it is believed to be the result of a new genetic mutation that occurs spontaneously during embryonic development. The diagnosis of HSS is based on clinical evaluation, medical history, and genetic testing, and treatment depends on the specific symptoms that a patient presents with.

{"seq_id": "a1d87e33-6e5e-425f-98f9-3217bee063d0", "title": "Dorsal Foot Exostosis - Causes, Symptoms, and Management", "text": "【0】Dorsal Foot Exostosis - Causes, Symptoms, and Management\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The dorsal midfoot exostosis is a noticeable, frequently uncomfortable bulge on the top of the foot. The bulge, which is frequently noticeable, is caused by bony growth on top of the arch, which is medically referred to as the metatarsal-cuneiform joint.\n\n【2】What Is Exostosis?\n------------------\n\n【3】A bony protrusion known as an exostosis can develop anywhere on the body. This condition, also known as a bone spur, develops when a bony growth protrudes above the surface of the bone. These calcium-based bony growths can develop in any area of the body. It is known as a saddle bone malformation and occurs most frequently in the heel. An alternative name for it is metatarsal cuneiform exostosis, referred to as the protrusion of bone that develops over the arch on the top of the foot. The first metatarsal cuneiform joint's excessive movement or mobility might lead to the development of this condition. In an effort to reduce the joint's movement, bone growth takes place. The onset and severity of pain will increase gradually.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Dorsal Foot Exostosis?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The causes of dorsal foot exostosis are:\n\n【6】*   Supinated (high-arch) feet are more likely to develop this ailment than over-pronated (rolled-in) feet.\n    \n*   The overpronated foot frequently has weak foot mechanics. The first metatarsal tends to move about excessively, which might irritate the metatarsal-cuneiform joint and lead to bony growth.\n    \n*   The first metatarsal in the supinated foot has a steeper degree of inclination toward the ground, which can make the base of the metatarsal stand out at the top of the foot.\n    \n*   Long-term irritation to the area, such as that brought on by tight footwear, inflammation, and trauma, are other causes of dorsal midfoot exostosis.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Dorsal Foot Exostosis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The common signs and symptoms of dorsal foot exostosis are:\n\n【9】*   A raised, firm hump on the arch of the foot indicates dorsal midfoot exostosis. The development of bone is not painful in and of itself; rather, the difficulties brought on by the bony expansion are typically painful.\n    \n*   The bony protrusion makes it difficult for sufferers to wear certain shoes. In general, open-toed shoes do not create any issues, but enclosed shoes can compress and rub against the bony protrusion, often causing pain, redness, and swelling.\n    \n*   Beyond the bump itself, compression and rubbing can exacerbate nearby nerves in addition to the bump itself. Aching, tingling, and pins and needles sensations are frequently felt in the top of the foot and the toes as a result of irritation to these nerves.\n    \n*   In more severe situations, pain may also be felt even if the bone growth is not directly irritated. This frequently manifests as a severe aching ache, commonly following weight-bearing exercise.\n    \n*   Compression of the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve (nerve supplying certain areas of the foot and leg) across the area may cause paresthesias (abnormal prickling or burning sensation), tingling, and numbness. Almost always, the metatarsocuneiform joint is crossed by the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve.\n    \n\n【10】What Are the Investigations Done in Dorsal Foot Exostosis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   **Sensory Testing:** Nerve involvement may be detected through sensory testing, particularly in the dorsal first web space.\n    \n*   **X-Ray:** The dorsal prominence will be seen on a lateral X-ray, and the dorsal hypermobility may cause a plantar gap in the metatarsocuneiform joint (a joint in the foot).\n    \n\n【12】How Is Dorsal Foot Exostosis Classified?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【13】The different types of dorsal foot exostosis are:\n\n【14】*   **Type 1:** Localized dorsal exostosis.\n    \n*   **Type 2:** Dorsal exostosis combined with joint osteoarthritis.\n    \n*   **Type 3:** An angular deformity and dorsal exostosis.\n    \n*   **Type 4:** Exostosis bridges other metatarsocuneiform joints.\n    \n*   **Type 5:** Pseudoexostosis of the anterior pes cavus' dorsal humping.\n    \n\n【15】How Is Dorsal Foot Exostosis Managed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【16】**1\\. Conservative Treatment:** One or more of the therapies might be:\n\n【17】*   **Footwear Modifications:** Modifications to footwear and padding can be highly beneficial since they relieve direct bump irritation and ease compressive forces.\n    \n*   **Orthotic Therapy:** This can assist in addressing the underlying issues, such as excessive pronation and high-arched feet.\n    \n*   **Advice About Footwear:** Wearing the right shoes is important. Finding comfortable shoes that do not irritate the bump can be challenging for many people.\n    \n*   **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Medicines (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen, or Aspirin will reduce pain and swelling when used as directed by a doctor.\n    \n*   **Injection Therapy:** This can ease joint and nerve-related problems alike.\n    \n\n【18】**2\\. Surgical Treatment:** Surgical intervention may be necessary in situations where conservative therapy is ineffective. The midfoot exostectomy procedure, which involves surgically removing the hump, may be beneficial if there are no symptoms of underlying arthritis. Pain can stay the same or occasionally go worse if there is any arthritis and the lump is just removed. A surgical alternative may be suggested in this situation.\n\n【19】*   **Midfoot Exostectomy:** Surgery is typically advised if one is in pain, limited or disabled, and having trouble getting into shoes despite wearing sensible shoes. Patients will be awake during the procedure because a local anesthetic is typically used. On the day of the procedure, patients can eat normally and take their regularly prescribed medications. Injections are used to inject the local anesthetic near the exostosis and the ankle. Compared to a dental injection, most patients find this to be more comfortable.\n    \n\n【20】An injection behind the knee may occasionally be recommended. The procedure lasts roughly an hour; however, people should plan on spending about four to five hours in the day surgery unit. This gives the time to recover from the procedure while the doctor provides any necessary discharge instructions and packs. For the first day and night after surgery, patients must have a responsible adult at home for their safety.\n\n【21】What Benefits Can Surgery Provide?\n----------------------------------\n\n【22】The advantages of surgical treatment are:\n\n【23】*   To lessen discomfort and a noticeable bone deformity.\n    \n*   To enhance the comfort and fit of the footwear.\n    \n*   The procedure is localized.\n    \n\n【24】What Are the Complications of the Surgery?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Everyone should already have received the pre-operative information leaflet, which describes the general risks of foot surgery. Additionally, this technique carries the following particular risks:\n\n【26】*   Numbness on the top of the foot due to nerve injury.\n    \n*   Persistent discomfort in the underlying joint.\n    \n*   The bump coming back.\n    \n*   Stiff joints.\n    \n*   An improper procedure.\n    \n*   Joint pain due to arthritis.\n    \n*   Sensitivity to scars.\n    \n*   Persistent swell.\n    \n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】In conclusion, bony protrusions can be found on the top of the foot in a condition known as dorsal foot exostosis. It might be painful and uncomfortable, which would limit someone's movement and quality of life. Conservative methods including rest, pain medication, and shoe modifications are among the treatment possibilities, but in more severe circumstances, surgery to remove the bone growths may be necessary. It is advised to see a healthcare provider for a precise diagnosis and suitable treatment choices if it appears that one may have dorsal foot exostosis.\n\n【29】Article Resources\n\n【30】*   Dorsal foot pain due to compression of the deep peroneal nerve by exostosis of the metatarsocuneiform joint  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16166463/\n*   Dorsal Metatarsal Cuneiform Exostosis  \n    https://podiapaedia.org/wiki/orthopaedics/exostoses/dorsal-metatarsal-cuneiform-exostosis/\n*   Dorsal Medial Cuneiform Bony Outgrowth-Apophysis or Exostosis: A Case Report.  \n    https://europepmc.org/article/med/33577190", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

People consume ackee for various conditions, but there is no proper scientific evidence for the usage of these products. Therefore, these products have been banned in the United States for the past three decades.\n\n【2】The ackee fruit contains a large black seed and a fleshy yellow aril. The yellow aril is the edible portion of the fruit. When unripe, the edible portion contains high levels of the toxin hypoglycin. When the fruit ripens, the hypoglycin levels drop to the safer level for human consumption. The unripe ackee fruit is very dangerous and can cause poisoning. Differentiating the ripe from the unripe ackee fruit is necessary to prevent any potential side effects. Ripe ackee fruit is yellow-red to red in color and has a wide-open appearance with visible seeds. The unripe fruit is green to yellow, and the seeds are not visible. Even cooking an unripe fruit will not reduce its potential for toxicity. Risk factors for ackee fruit toxicity include:\n\n【3】*   Eating an unripe ackee.\n    \n*   Purchasing tampered ackee.\n    \n*   Consuming the water used to cook unripe ackee.\n    \n\n【4】What Is Ackee Poisoning?\n------------------------\n\n【5】Hypoglycin A is the toxin found in the ackee fruit that can cause acute toxicity. It is also called Jamaican vomiting sickness or toxic hypoglycemic syndrome. This fruit grows in the ackee plant, found in West Africa, southern Florida, the Caribbean, and Central America. Many of these plants are a source of food in many countries.\n\n【6】Ripe ackee fruit (Blighia sapida) is taken as food and is considered a dietary staple (like cereal grains and tuber) in Jamaica. Toxicity occurs only with the ingestion of the unripe ackee fruit. The seeds are also toxic and should not be ingested.\n\n【7】The ripe ackee fruits are edible, but the unripe fruits are toxic to consume due to hypoglycin A and B. The unripe fruit can cause severe hypoglycemia, often accompanied by convulsions and death.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Ackee Poisoning?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【9】The symptoms of poisoning from consumption of unripe ackee and the roasted ackee seeds can manifest within six to 48 hours and include gastrointestinal distress, hypoglycemia, and CNS (central nervous system) depression. The common symptoms may include:\n\n【10】*   Cholestatic jaundice.\n    \n*   Vomiting.\n    \n*   Hypoglycemia.\n    \n*   Convulsions.\n    \n*   Coma.\n    \n*   Potentially death.\n    \n\n【11】It may take about six to 48 hours for the onset of symptoms after the ingestion of the unripened fruit.\n\n【12】A remission period may be followed by symptoms like lethargy, hypothermia, hypotonia, which might progress to convulsions and coma.\n\n【13】If this condition is left untreated as soon as possible, it can be life-threatening. Death is more commonly seen in children than in adults. Death can occur in an average time of 12.5 hours.\n\n【14】The other symptoms in a few cases may include tonic-clonic convulsions, seizures, and fatty degeneration of the liver. Other symptoms like fever or diarrhea will not occur.\n\n【15】It is not safe to give unripe ackee fruit to children, pregnant and breastfeeding women as the unripe ackee fruit contains hypoglycin A at higher concentrations than ripe ackee fruit.\n\n【16】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Ackee Poisoning?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The differential diagnosis of ackee poisoning may include:\n\n【18】*   Acute gastritis.\n    \n*   Meningitis.\n    \n*   Influenza.\n    \n*   Hypoglycemia\n    \n*   Acute poisoning in general.\n    \n*   Aspirin poisoning.\n    \n*   Intestinal obstruction.\n    \n*   Sulfonylurea poisoning.\n    \n\n【19】How to Treat Ackee Poisoning?\n-----------------------------\n\n【20】Currently, there is no antidote for hypoglycin A, so the treatment is usually primary management. Patients are monitored carefully for hypoglycemia and should be infused with Dextrose. Intravenous fluids should be given to avoid dehydration and antiemetics to relieve symptoms like vomiting. Vomiting and dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalance which should be replaced.\n\n【21】**Medications:**\n\n【22】*   Benzodiazepines may be used to treat seizures.\n    \n*   GI (gastrointestinal) decontamination is done with activated charcoal and gastric lavage when there is potential toxicity and also if the patient is rushed to the hospital within a few hours of ingestion. But there is no evidence that GI decontamination can improve patient outcomes. Riboflavin and glycine are included in the treatment to antagonize hypoglycin A.\n    \n*   Methylene blue is used for potentially fatal encephalopathy.\n    \n*   Patients with symptoms like seizures, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, poor perfusion, or altered mental status will require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).\n    \n*   Education regarding the health hazards of eating unripe ackee fruits may decrease the future incidence of the disease.\n    \n\n【23】Healthcare providers working in the emergency department should be aware of the potential toxicity of unripe ackee fruit for early diagnosis and timely management. The public should be educated regarding the proper preparation of the ackee fruit to reduce the toxicity rates in areas where it is endemic.\n\n【24】The nursing staff should assess the patients exposed to the casualties and immediately communicate with the clinical emergency department staff to consult the toxicologists. Once the disease is diagnosed, the interprofessional team of clinicians and nurses must communicate to ensure appropriate support is rendered soon. The nurses must monitor the patient carefully for any changes in the vital signs and immediately report to the clinical team to initiate adjustments in care.\n\n【25】What Are the Complications of Ackee Poisoning?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The complications of ackee poisoning may include hypoglycemia, coma, and eventually death. There can also be acidosis, hypovolemia, and seizures.\n\n【27】How to Prevent Ackee Poisoning?\n-------------------------------\n\n【28】The best way to prevent ackee poisoning is by avoiding the consumption of unripe ackee fruit and water in which the ackee fruit has been boiled.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】The nurses and clinicians, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and physicians, must educate patients about the dangers of consuming ackee fruit. Ensuring children and adults are not exposed to unripe ackee fruit is the safest approach to prevent morbidity and mortality.\n\n【31】Article Resources\n\n【32】*   Ackee  \n    https://www.drugs.com/npp/ackee.html#:~:text=Poisoning%20from%20consumption%20of%20unripe%20ackee%20%28including%20of,hypotonia%2C%20hypothermia%2C%20and%20progress%20to%20convulsions%2C%20and%20coma\n*   Ackee  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16099087/\n*   Ackee Poisoning  \n    https://manchestermc.gov.jm/news/03-2015/ackee-poisoning", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "5be7059d-25f1-4e89-ac25-e16ac4d0d14d", "title": "Psoriasis and Cancer: Is There a connection?", "text": "【0】Psoriasis and Cancer: Is There a connection?\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects people of all ages. It is an autoimmune-mediated disease, and the exact cause is not known but related to genetics.\n\n【2】In psoriasis, the immune system responds to nonexistent danger, and in response to this danger, skin cells proliferate rapidly. This new growth of cells moves to the surface of the skin and results in thickened patches of dead skin on the original surface of the skin. And in recent times, concerns have arisen that psoriasis, its risk factors, and treatment might lead to cancer.\n\n【3】What Is Psoriasis?\n------------------\n\n【4】Psoriasis is a long-term autoimmune skin disorder with symptoms of dry, itchy, scaly patches on the skin seen mainly on knees, elbows, trunk, and scalp, and it has no cure. This condition shows periods of flare-ups and remissions. The cause of psoriasis is related to immune system problems, where the infection-fighting cells of the body attack and damage skin cells that are healthy by mistake. Psoriasis is not contagious, and environmental genetic factors play an important role in this condition. Genetic predisposition when combined with triggering factors such as infections, stress, and trauma could lead to psoriasis.\n\n【5】What Are the Triggering Factors for Psoriasis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Many people with psoriasis remain non-symptomatic until some factors, like environmental factors, trigger psoriasis. Some of them include the following:\n\n【7】*   Weather conditions like extreme cold and dry climates.\n    \n*   Certain medications.\n    \n*   Stress.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Can psoriasis cause dark discoloration of the penis?\n    \n    Cancer Immunotherapy - Types and Side Effects\n    \n    Cancer Lump on Back of Head - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   Alcohol consumption and smoking.\n    \n*   Hormonal factors, especially in women after puberty.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Treatment Options for Psoriasis?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Treatment options include:\n\n【10】1.  **Topical Therapy**: With corticosteroids, salicylic acid, retinoids, and vitamin D analogs.\n    \n2.  **Light Therapy**: They include sunlight, PUVA (psoralen plus ultraviolet A), UVB broadband, and narrow brand.\n    \n3.  **Oral Or Injected Drugs**: Steroids, retinoids, biologics, methotrexate, cyclosporine.\n    \n\n【11】Can Psoriasis Cause Cancer?\n---------------------------\n\n【12】Psoriasis is considered one of the risk factors for cancer-causing, but it does not directly cause cancer. There is a well-established link between smoking and cancer. However, such a well-established link cannot be seen between psoriasis and cancer.\n\n【13】How Did the Question of Cancer Arise?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【14】It is because of inflammation. Long-term inflammations of the skin have an increased risk of cancer. Because skin inflammation is one of the major symptoms of psoriasis, this is one of the main reasons it has been linked to cancer. Inflammation is also seen in other organs, joints, and blood vessels. Psoriasis patients have an increased risk of organ-specific cancers in the respiratory tract, digestive system, liver, pancreas, and urinary tract. People with psoriasis are at high risk of developing leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. People with psoriasis have an increased risk of skin cancers, especially non-melanoma skin cancers.\n\n【15】How Is Psoriasis Treatment Related to Cancer?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Since psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder directly related to the patient's immune system, most medications target the immune system. In the treatment process, some drugs slow down skin cell production, while some suppress the body’s immune system to reduce the patient's symptoms. And this weakened immune system is more prone to infections. Hence the patient with psoriasis is at threat of cancer. Chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease also increase the chances of other cancers.\n\n【17】Certain treatments in psoriasis like ultraviolet light therapy, which heals psoriatic patches, may increase the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma. This is directly related to the number of ultraviolet light therapies. Patients who receive 250 ultraviolet light therapies are at risk of developing cancer. Patients with psoriasis have other habits like tobacco use and alcohol intake. And these conditions are associated with cancer risk. Psoriasis patients who receive systemic medications and phototherapy are more likely to develop malignant (cancerous) conditions.\n\n【18】What Is the Difference Between Psoriasis and Skin Cancer?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Psoriasis and skin cancers are two different conditions. But signs and symptoms of certain types of skin cancer may look very similar to psoriasis.\n\n【20】**The Appearance Of Psoriasis** \\- The appearance differs depending on skin tone and color.\n\n【21】*   **Fair skin:** Psoriasis looks pink or red, with silvery-white scales.\n    \n*   **Medium skin:** It appears pinkish-orange, with silvery white flakes.\n    \n*   **Darker skin:** It appears dark brown or sometimes difficult to see, and the scales look gray.\n    \n\n【22】**Symptoms of Psoriasis** -\n\n【23】*   Skin appears to be dry. Cracking and bleeding can also be seen.\n    \n*   Feels like burning and itching of the skin, followed by pain.\n    \n*   Nails become very thick. Most patients with psoriasis have flare-up periods and remission. However, in flare-up periods, the symptoms get aggressive and worsen.\n    \n\n【24】*   Psoriasis covers larger areas of the body, but skin cancers cover only small areas and mostly occur on the skin regularly exposed to the sun.\n    \n*   Psoriasis has intervals of remission and flare-ups. But skin cancer symptoms will worsen without treatment.\n    \n\n【25】**Symptoms of Skin Cancer** \\-\n\n【26】Like any other cancer, skin cancer is also an uncontrolled growth of faulty skin cells. And this uncontrolled growth of cells piles up and moves onto the surface of the surface, causing lumps known as tumors.\n\n【27】*   Skin appears symmetrical in shape due to rapid growth.\n    \n*   Psoriasis has intervals of remission and flare-ups, but skin changes and grows over time without remission in skin cancers.\n    \n*   Scaly skin, bleeding, crusting.\n    \n*   Skin appears waxy, shiny, raised, oddly colored, with a firm texture.\n    \n\n【28】How to Reduce Cancer Risk if Diagnosed With Psoriasis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Lifestyle modifications like avoiding smoking and alcohol, and eating a healthy and balanced diet, keeping the weight under control help reduce cancer risk factors and other health conditions like heart problems. Psoriatic patients must consult doctors for cancer screening tests like mammograms, lung imaging, and colonoscopies.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**:\n\n【31】Cancer does not cause psoriasis, and psoriasis does not cause cancer. But patients with psoriasis present an overall high risk of developing cancer. Psoriasis is a lifelong disorder, but if efforts were made to lead a healthy lifestyle, one could reduce or minimize the risk of cancer and other health conditions. Increased inflammation due to psoriasis and treatment side effects of psoriasis may likely increase cancer-causing conditions in the patient. A person with psoriasis must be in regular checks and follow-ups. Cancer screening must also be discussed with the doctor. However, cancer-causing chances are more in psoriasis patients who have received medications and phototherapy. Therefore, dermatologists who treat psoriasis must advise cancer screening to their patients.\n\n【32】Article Resources\n\n【33】*   What Are the Symptoms of Skin Cancer?  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic\\_info/symptoms.htm\n*   The Risk of Cancer in Patients With Psoriasis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5273859/\n*   Psoriasis Therapy and Skin Cancer: A Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8538945/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "918dceac-f140-49a8-970a-fae47703c5c0", "title": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome", "text": "【0】What Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?\n-------------------------------\n\n【1】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is mainly characterized by chronic abdominal pain and melanocytic pigmentation and is often ignored in some individuals. This can potentially lead to the development of life-threatening cancers. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a hamartomatous gastrointestinal disease most commonly prevalent in the small intestine. But there can also be an extra-intestinal involvement as in the bronchi of the lungs, the gallbladder, the nasal cavity passageway, the renal tubules, or the urinary bladder and ureter.\n\n【2】These hamartomatous polyps make the individual predisposed to cancerous lesions or instead pose a definitive risk if left untreated, paving the way for potential malignancies.\n\n【3】Gastrointestinal polyposis and pigmentation of mucocutaneous membranes is a main characteristic feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Though gastrointestinal polyposis mostly affects the jejunum part of the small intestine, the stomach and the large intestine also need to be checked diagnostically for the growth of polyps as it is not uncommon for them to grow there.\n\n【4】What Is the Role of Genetics In Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The STK11 pathogenic variant is said to play an important role in the autosomal transmission of genes from the affected parent to the progeny. The proband identification of the STK11 gene in even one affected parent can make the genetic transmission chances of the child inheriting this variant (approximately around 50%) and, in turn, being affected by the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome again. Prenatal screening for expecting mothers in family members with a history of this syndrome can help identify the pathogenic component causing Peutz-Jeghers syndrome earlier.\n\n【6】Women are slightly more prone to this syndrome than men, and most people who are affected by this disease usually need surgical intervention by 18 to 21 years of age. Because of the predisposition to certain cancers, be it of the breasts, cervix, uterus, or ovaries, women affected by Peutz-Jeghers syndrome need immediate intervention to prevent the complications arising by timely intervention or surgical modalities.\n\n【7】Related Topics\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Hereditary Cancer Syndrome - Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Prevention\n\n【10】Do I need to get radiotherapy for breast cancer?\n\n【11】From the photos, kindly tell me if the fibroma on my soft palate is cancerous.\n\n【12】*   Cancer screening for susceptible or suspected individuals should be done especially in boys and girls as early as around 8 years of age with the right diagnostic modality like endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and breast examination can prove very beneficial in preventing the continuing complication of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome mainly increasing the risk of these cancers (listed as per the approximate or estimated risk for these individuals to develop cancer):\n    \n*   Breast cancer (most prevalent) ranges from 30 to 50%.\n    \n*   Colon or rectal cancers range up to 40%.\n    \n*   Pancreatic cancer (the third most prevalent subtype for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome individuals) ranges from 10 to 35%.\n    \n*   Stomach cancer range up to 30%.\n    \n*   Ovarian cancer range up to 20%.\n    \n*   Other cancers are small intestine cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, and lung cancers, usually ranging between 3 to 13% of the individuals chronically affected by Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n    \n\n【13】What Are the Clinical Features and Prevalence of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The clinical features of this syndrome mainly include vomiting, frequent nausea, abdominal pain, and may be accompanied by rectal bleeding. This is caused due to the intestinal obstruction created by gastrointestinal polyp formation or hamartomas that start growing within the gastrointestinal tract. The affected individuals also, as mentioned previously, have been prone to the development of skin freckling or freckled skin (melanocyte macules) inside the oral, anal, orbital, and nasal cavities or around the fingers.\n\n【15】These clinical symptoms can be observed as early as in the first decade of life. A characteristic oral diagnosis by the dental surgeon in recognizing this syndrome is that even though in adulthood these macules tend to fade, they persist in the oral mucosal membranes. Similarly, young adults or children developing gynecomastia as a consequence of Sertoli cell or testicular tumors need to be assessed by the physician for other clinical features to identify this syndrome, or the later complications may be life-threatening and severe.\n\n【16】If the clinical features of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are not recognized, it may result in testicular cancer in males (Sertoli cells of the testes would be impacted or affected by tumors) and benign neoplasms or benign tumors of the ovaries in females. Cases of cervical malignancies are also reported in females who have left Peutz-Jeghers syndrome untreated. Men also can be prone to the development of gynecomastia and short stature, affecting skeletal growth, age, and development in these individuals suffering from this syndrome.\n\n【17】Apart from gender-related complications that arise due to ignorance of the clinical symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the folding of the intestine into itself altering its morphology, also termed medically as intussusception, is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires surgical intervention almost immediately when the patient presents with severe abdominal pain.\n\n【18】How Are Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Features Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】MRE (magnetic resonance enterography) and VCE (video capsule endoscopy) are diagnostic surveillance techniques to confirm Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Testicular examination in suspected male individuals and gynecologic and breast examination in females will be of paramount importance in preventing the aggravation of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\n【20】How Are the Symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Managed?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】1.  Endoscopic surgery techniques and polypectomy or the surgical resection or removal of gastrointestinal polyps is the main modality to relieve the clinical symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (for all polyps greater than 1 cm).\n    \n2.  Mastectomy or hysterectomy (cancer surgery for breast or uterus removal) is preferable for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients suffering from cancers. Similarly, ovarian cancers need to be treated by oophorectomy.\n    \n3.  As the brown and freckled skin, that is, the melanocytic pigmentation of macules, leaves a chronic psychological impact on the patient, laser surgery after consulting with the dermatologist would be appropriate in partially clearing the pigmentation.\n    \n4.  For prevention of cancers in those individuals who have remained unaffected by any of these malignancies, yearly examination by the physician or gynecologist with a Pap test, a biopsy from the uterine tissues or transvaginal ultrasound in females above 25 years, and testicular examination in males with testicular ultrasound beginning as early as possible in childhood is a useful cancer-preventive intervention.\n    \n\n【22】**Conclusion:**\n\n【23】There is a need for individuals suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome to undergo diagnostic screening for cancer and also trace the genetic component by the physician or from the family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. These affected individuals can be promptly saved from the long-term psychosomatic impact on their health. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, though a chronic medical condition, needs to be assessed in a timely surgical and preventive manner, especially after observing the clinical features to prevent the risk of aggravation to cancers and gastrointestinal complications that can increase the mortality rate in these individuals.\n\n【24】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【25】* * *\n\n【26】#### **1.**\n\n【27】#### **How Do You Know If You Have Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【28】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome manifests as dark-colored spots on various parts of the body such as the mouth, lips, eyes, nose, anus, hands, and feet. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, stomach pain, and small bowel obstruction.\n\n【29】#### **2.**\n\n【30】#### **Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Curable?**\n\n【31】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not curable. Since there is no cure, the treatment is mainly focused on controlling the symptoms. The patients are under lifelong surveillance for monitoring their organs to prevent secondary complications.\n\n【32】#### **3.**\n\n【33】#### **Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Premalignant?**\n\n【34】People with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are more likely to develop cancer during their lifetime. The polyps developed during the syndrome are premalignant, but there is a strong association between the syndrome and gastrointestinal carcinoma.\n\n【35】#### **4.**\n\n【36】#### **How Do You Control Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【37】There is no permanent cure for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The patients are under lifelong surveillance to prevent secondary complications. It was stated that patients who are under continuous surveillance could avoid the need for emergency surgery, and they also do not develop any cancer. This is because the polyps are removed before they can cause any obstruction or before they develop into cancer.\n\n【38】#### **5.**\n\n【39】#### **What Cancers Are Associated With Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【40】People with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are at high risk for developing polyps in the digestive tract as well as cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, pancreas, stomach, testicles, ovaries, lung, cervix, and uterus.\n\n【41】#### **6.**\n\n【42】#### **Why Does My Baby Have a Black Spot on Her Lip?**\n\n【43】Dark-colored black spots on the skin are a hallmark sign of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. It is commonly seen in 95% of children within the first two years of birth. These spots can also be developed in other parts of the body.\n\n【44】#### **7.**\n\n【45】#### **How Common Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【46】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare condition that can affect both males and females. It is calculated that around 1 in 50,000 to 3,00,000 are affected by this syndrome. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome goes undiagnosed in many cases because the spots are often not visible in adulthood.\n\n【47】#### **8.**\n\n【48】#### **At What Age Can Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Cause Cancer?**\n\n【49】The risk of cancer increases with age. There is around 1 to 2% risk by 20 years, 30% risk by age 50, and the risk is more than 80% around the age of 70 years. And in women with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the risk of breast cancer is estimated to be 8% at the age of 40 and 31% at the age of 60.\n\n【50】#### **9.**\n\n【51】#### **How Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) Inherited?**\n\n【52】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and can be passed from generation to generation. An autosomal dominant pattern means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is enough to increase the risk of developing non-cancerous polyps and cancerous tumors.\n\n【53】#### **10.**\n\n【54】#### **What Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Mutation?**\n\n【55】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a genetic condition that is caused by inheriting a mutation in the STK11 gene from one affected parent. This happens in around half of the cases of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, whereas in people with no family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, it results from new mutations in the STK11 gene.\n\n【56】#### **11.**\n\n【57】#### **How Rare Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【58】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare and uncertain condition. It is estimated that around 1 in 50,000 to 3,00,000 individuals are affected with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "84bf5443-d9cc-44be-abdf-36ff9240c3f5", "title": "Tongue-Tie - Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Tongue-Tie - Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】For the tongue to do all its functions, it should be able to reach every part of the mouth. This full range of motion helps you to speak by making different sounds. It also helps in swallowing and sweeping away the food particles sticking in the mouth and helps keep the mouth clean. In this condition, known as \"tongue-tie,\" the tongue is literally tied to the floor of the mouth, restricting speech, eating, and other activities involving a range of motion. Tongue-tie is a common condition seen in around five percent of all newborns, and it is three times more common among boys than girls.\n\n【2】What Is Tongue-Tie?\n-------------------\n\n【3】Tongue-tie refers to a condition in which the lower side of the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth, restricting it from moving freely. This happens when the strip of tissue called the lingual frenulum that connects the tongue and the floor of the mouth is shorter than normal. It is otherwise known as ankyloglossia. This is a condition that has been present since birth.\n\n【4】How Is Tongue-Tie Developed?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】When an embryo is growing in the womb, the tongue and the floor of the mouth fuses together, and eventually, the tongue separates from the floor of the mouth, and finally, only a thin cord of tissue connects the bottom of the tongue with the floor of the mouth and as the child grows the lingual frenulum thins and shrinks whereas in children with tongue-tie the lingual frenulum stays thick and does not recede restricting the movement of the tongue.\n\n【6】How to Know if My Baby Is Tongue-Tied?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】Tongue-tie is associated with difficulties in breastfeeding. Tongue-tie is often noticed when the baby is finding it hard to breastfeed. The symptoms are different in each child, and some children may not have any symptoms, whereas some may have noticeable symptoms. The other symptoms that can be noticed in a baby with tongue-tie include the following:\n\n【8】*   The baby tends to chew more than sucking.\n    \n*   Difficulty latching while breastfeeding.\n    \n*   Baby does not gain weight as expected.\n    \n*   Breastfeeds for a long time.\n    \n*   The baby is fussy when trying to breastfeed.\n    \n*   The baby makes a clicking sound while feeding.\n    \n*   The baby seems hungry all the time.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    My 3 year old daughter failed her OAE test. Is that due to hearing loss?\n    \n    Why does my 4.3 years old son find it difficult to speak fluently?\n    \n    Early Detection of Dental Problems in Kids\n    \n*   The baby may not be able to move the tongue from side to side and cannot reach the tongue to the roof or upper gums of the teeth. They may also find it hard to put their tongue out of their mouth.\n    \n\n【9】In young children, here are a few commonly noticed symptoms, which include:\n\n【10】*   Impairment in speech.\n    \n*   Difficulty in swallowing.\n    \n*   Not being able to lick ice cream.\n    \n*   Problems sticking the tongue out.\n    \n*   Difficulty kissing.\n    \n*   Difficulty in moving the tongue towards the roof of the mouth or sideways.\n    \n\n【11】In addition to finding certain symptoms in the baby, the mother might also have a few symptoms like:\n\n【12】*   Pain while or after breastfeeding.\n    \n*   Sore or cracked nipples.\n    \n*   Inflammation or infection of the breast (mastitis).\n    \n*   Reduced milk supply.\n    \n\n【13】How Is Tongue-Tie Classified?\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】Coryllos ankyloglossia grading scale is used to classify the tongue-tie types. The types include:\n\n【15】*   **Type I:**\n    \n\n【16】In type I, the lingual frenulum is thin and elastic and attaches the tip of the tongue to the ridge behind the lower teeth.\n\n【17】*   **Type II:**\n    \n\n【18】In type II the frenulum is fine and elastic, and the tongue is attached 2 to 4 millimeters from the tip to the floor of the mouth.\n\n【19】*   **Type III:**\n    \n\n【20】In type III, the frenulum is thick and stiffened and connects the tongue from the middle of the lower side of the tongue to the floor of the mouth.\n\n【21】*   **Type IV:**\n    \n\n【22】In type IV, the lingual frenulum is posterior, or sometimes it is not visible. Only when touched is the tongue-tie noticed.\n\n【23】Along with the Coryllos grading scale, the Hazelbaker assessment tool (HATLFF) is also used to determine tongue function.\n\n【24】How Does Tongue-Tie Affect Breastfeeding and Speech?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】**Tongue-Tie and Breastfeeding:**\n\n【26】For breastfeeding, an adequate seal is required for which the baby has to extend their tongue over the jawline, whereas in the case of tongue-tied babies, this is not possible, and so they use their gums to keep the nipple in the mouth while breastfeeding.\n\n【27】**Tongue-Tie and Speech Impairment:**\n\n【28】The exact pathology behind how tongue-tie affects speech is still not clear. But however, it is found that the tongue needs contact with the roof of the mouth to pronounce certain lingual sounds like \"t,\" \"d,\" \"z,\" \"n,\" \"l,\" \"s,\" and \"th.\" In the case of tongue-tie, the baby cannot move the tongue to reach the roof of the mouth, so they have difficulties with pronunciation.\n\n【29】How Is Tongue-Tie Diagnosed?\n----------------------------\n\n【30】Tongue-tie is usually diagnosed during the physical examination when the symptoms are examined.\n\n【31】What Are the Available Treatment Options for Tongue-Tie?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】There are cases where the child having tongue-tie does not have any noticeable symptoms like difficulty breastfeeding, swallowing, and speech impairment. So in those cases, treatment is not required.\n\n【33】**Frenectomy:**\n\n【34】In cases when the child is having symptoms, a surgical procedure called frenectomy is performed. Frenectomy is a simple surgical procedure that is carried out under local anesthesia in which the lingual frenulum is cut. This procedure is also known as frenulectomy, frenotomy, and tongue-tie division. Frenectomy is a painless procedure, but like any other surgical procedure, it carries certain risks like bleeding, scarring, infection, or injury to the salivary ducts present in the mouth.\n\n【35】**Frenuloplasty:**\n\n【36】Frenuloplasty is an extensive procedure that is carried out under general anesthesia. This surgical procedure is recommended when the lingual frenulum is too thick for a frenectomy.\n\n【37】What Are the Complications Associated With Tongue-Tie?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The long-term effects associated with tongue-tie are:\n\n【39】*   **Malnutrition:**\n    \n\n【40】Poor breastfeeding leads to inadequate nutrition and results in malnourishment.\n\n【41】*   **Impaired Speech:**\n    \n\n【42】Due to tongue-tie, the child may not be able to pronounce certain sounds, which can later affect their speech and overall school performance.\n\n【43】*   **Poor Oral Hygiene:**\n    \n\n【44】Because of tongue-tie, it may be difficult to sweep away the food debris sticking on from the teeth contributing to tooth decay or plaque formation resulting in a condition known as gingivitis.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】There is no particular way to prevent tongue-tie, but early diagnosis and treatment are key to a child's recovery. Most babies recover completely without any treatment. But in severe cases, when not treated, the child may not be able to breastfeed. Poor breastfeeding can lead to inadequate nutrition.\n\n【47】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【48】* * *\n\n【49】#### **1.**\n\n【50】#### **Do Tongue-Ties Go Away on Their Own?**\n\n【51】In most cases, tongue-ties usually go away after two or three years of life. However, in some severe cases, the individual might require surgical treatment where the frenum cut is made to better the condition.\n\n【52】#### **2.**\n\n【53】#### **Is Surgery Mandatory for a Tongue-Tie?**\n\n【54】Surgical requirements depend upon the severity of the tongue-tie. However, most doctors opt for a surgical intervention where the frenum is cut and altered to manage the tongue-tie as it helps the infant latch to the mother's breast naturally while feeding.\n\n【55】#### **3.**\n\n【56】#### **Do Tongue Ties Cause Speech Impairments?**\n\n【57】In certain severe tongue-tie cases, the person finds it challenging to make certain sounds that require the tip of the tongue to touch the roof of the mouth. For example, the affected person might find it hard to pronounce the words that contain letters such as t, d, n, s, z, and r.\n\n【58】#### **4.**\n\n【59】#### **How Do You Know If a Person Has a Tongue-Tie?**\n\n【60】Some of the signs of tongue-tie are as follows,  \n\\- The person will not be able to protrude their tongue past the front teeth.  \n\\- The protruded tongue will have a notch or will form a heart shape.  \n\\- The person will have difficulty lifting the tongue to the roof of their mouth, or they will find it hard to move their tongue in a sideways motion.\n\n【61】#### **5.**\n\n【62】#### **What Happens if We Do Not Treat Tongue Ties?**\n\n【63】Tongue ties, if not treated, can cause different complications depending upon the child's age and the severity of the tongue-tie. First, the bonding between the baby and the mother might be hindered as the baby finds it hard to feed. Later the child will have speech impairments.\n\n【64】#### **6.**\n\n【65】#### **Who Can Diagnose a Tongue-Tie?**\n\n【66】A pediatrician or a primary care doctor can diagnose tongue ties in infants during regular checkups.\n\n【67】#### **7.**\n\n【68】#### **Do Tongue Ties Cause a High Palate?**\n\n【69】Restricted tongue movements can cause specific palate abnormalities like high palate and bubble palate.\n\n【70】#### **8.**\n\n【71】#### **Do Tongue Ties Cause a Weak Chin?**\n\n【72】A study conducted in 2014 shows that people with tongue ties are more prone to have a weak chin and class 2 malocclusion.\n\n【73】#### **9.**\n\n【74】#### **Can a Tongue-Tie Affect Sleep?**\n\n【75】People with tongue ties have an underdeveloped palate, leading to smaller airways. This can cause upper airway collapse and can cause sleep apnea.\n\n【76】#### **10.**\n\n【77】#### **Can a Tongue-Tie Affect Face Shape?**\n\n【78】People with untreated tongue ties can have restricted tongue movements which may alter the shape of the face.\n\n【79】Article Resources\n\n【80】*   Tongue Tie  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tongue-tie.html\n*   Tongue-tie  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tongue-tie/\n*   Tongue-tie  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/tongue-tie", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting one or more joints of children aged 16 or below. An autoimmune disorder is a medical condition in which the immune system attacks and kills the body's normal cells by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorder that causes pain and swelling in the lining of the joints. It commonly affects the joints of fingers, knees, wrists, ankles, elbows, shoulders, and hips. In adults, rheumatoid arthritis is chronic and lifelong, but children outgrow juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes juvenile idiopathic arthritis affects bone development in growing children.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Types of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:\n\n【4】*   **Oligoarthritis-** Oligoarthritis commonly affects one to four joints in the first six months of the onset. If no more joints are involved further, it is known as the persistent type; if more joints are involved after six months, it is known as the extended type.\n    \n*   **Polyarticular-** Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) type affects five or more joints in the first six months of the onset. It is the second most common type of JIA. It causes fever and painful swelling in the wrists, ankles, toes, fingers, knees, hips, jaw, and neck. A blood test for RF (rheumatoid factor) can determine whether it is RF positive or RF negative.\n    \n*   **Systemic-** Systemic arthritis is the least common type of arthritis that affects one or more joints and also causes skin rashes and high spiking fever that lasts at least two weeks. It also affects internal organs such as the liver, heart, spleen, and lymph nodes. It occurs in one in ten children with JIA.\n    \n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis-** In psoriatic arthritis, children might have joint pain along with reddish, scaly skin rashes on the scalp, elbow, behind the ears, and knee. It commonly causes inflammation of the toes and fingers and pits in the fingernails.\n    \n*   **Enthesitis Related-** In this type, children have arthritis along with enthesis. Enthesis affects areas where the tendon or ligament joins the bone, most common in the knees, feet, and hips.\n    \n*   **Undifferentiated-** Undifferentiated arthritis has symptoms of two or more types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or sometimes it does not match with any of the JIA types.\n    \n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis vary in children. They might appear only during flare-ups or sometimes chronic. They are:\n\n【7】*   Joint pain.\n    \n*   Swollen joints.\n    \n*   Joint stiffness.\n    \n*   Fever.\n    \n*   Rashes.\n    \n*   Swollen lymph nodes.\n    \n*   Fatigue (tiredness).\n    \n*   Redness and warmth in joints.\n    \n*   Decreased appetite.\n    \n*   Weight loss.\n    \n*   Decreased ability to use one or more joints.\n    \n*   Swollen and dry eyes.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Most Commonly Involved Joint Structures in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The most commonly involved joint structures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:\n\n【10】*   **Knee -** The knee is the most commonly affected joint in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Knee joint involvement is characterized by painful, swollen, warm joints with decreased function. The common imaging features of JIA in the knee joint are joint effusion (fluid collection in the joint), synovial thickening, and bone marrow edema. Sometimes bone erosions, cartilage loss, tendinopathy, and bone cysts are also observed.\n    \n\n【11】*   **Hip -** Juvenile idiopathic arthritis affects the hip joint in about 20 to 50 percent of children, and it becomes irreversible destructive damage within five years. The hip joint shows tendinitis, bursitis (swelling of the small, fluid-filled sacs \\[bursae\\]), and synovitis (swelling of the synovium).\n    \n\n【12】*   **Spine -** Cervical spine is most commonly involved in JIA. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows joint effusion, cervical spine arthritis, bone marrow edema, and synovial thickening. In the later stage, it shows subluxation (incomplete dislocation of the joint), erosions, joint ankylosis (stiffness of the joints due to fusion), and nerve compression.\n    \n\n【13】*   **Sacroiliac Joint -** Sacroiliac joints are involved in about 30 percent of children in JIA, which are not affected in the early stage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging tool for detecting the inflammation of sacroiliac joints. In addition, MRI shows bone marrow edema, fatty deposition, and synovitis.\n    \n\n【14】*   **Temporomandibular Joint -** Contrast-enhanced MRI is used to detect TMJ involvement in JIA. MRI shows erosions, bone marrow edema, synovial thickening, and joint effusion. MRI is taken in both open and closed-mouth sequences to detect JIA.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Imaging Techniques Used in the Diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The imaging techniques used in the diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:\n\n【17】**Plain Radiograph:**\n\n【18】*   In plain radiograph, JIA appears as bony erosions, soft tissue swelling, periostitis, growth disturbances, and joint space narrowing.\n    \n*   Osteopenia, osteoporosis, epiphyseal compression fracture, joint subluxation, intra-articular bony ankylosis, and synovial cysts (fluid-filled sacs) are also seen.\n    \n*   The major drawback of plain radiography in juvenile idiopathic arthritis is that it does not allow direct examination of synovium, articular cartilage, and non-calcified structures in the joints.\n    \n\n【19】**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**\n\n【20】*   Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard imaging tool used in diagnosing juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n    \n*   It is effective in distinguishing bony erosions from changes in articular cartilage.\n    \n*   Bony erosions appear as a loss of low signal intensity of cortical bone and loss of high signal intensity of trabecular bone in T1 weighted images.\n    \n*   On T2 weighted images, subchondral cysts appear as hyperintense lesions, and bone erosions appear as hypointense lesions.\n    \n*   The MRI imaging protocol for diagnosing juvenile idiopathic arthritis should include a T1 spin-echo sequence, T1 fat-suppressed sequence precontrast, and post-contrast fat-suppressed sequence. The post-contrast fat-suppressed sequence includes:\n    \n\n【21】1.  Classic T2 fat-sat.\n    \n2.  Short-tau inversion recovery (STIR).\n    \n3.  DIXON fat-suppression sequence.\n    \n\n【22】*   MRI is a highly sensitive radiologic indicator of disease activity. It can show soft tissue swelling, synovial hypertrophy, and the status of the articular cartilage and joint integrity.\n    \n*   MRI can detect both bone marrow and soft tissue changes.\n    \n\n【23】**Ultrasonography:**\n\n【24】*   Ultrasonography is more sensitive than plain radiography in diagnosing cartilage effusions and erosions, but its sensitivity is based on the operator's efficiency.\n    \n*   Synovial inflammation appears as a mixed echogenic area lining the articular cartilage.\n    \n*   The effusion volumes and synovial thickness are measured to evaluate the disease progression.\n    \n*   Doppler ultrasound is helpful in detecting the blood supply of the synovium.\n    \n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】Plain radiography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis and follow-up of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Contrast-enhanced MRI sequences are used to improve the visualization of cartilaginous erosions and synovial hypertrophy in inflammatory arthritis. Gadolinium-enhanced T1 weighted (T1W) MRI images are used to distinguish synovitis from joint effusion as both of them are hyperintense on short-tau inversion recovery images (STIR) and T2 weighted (T2W) images. Ultrasonography plays an important role in pediatric rheumatology by monitoring the treatment and guiding joint injections.\n\n【27】Article Resources\n\n【28】*   Imaging of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

It is typically diagnosed when the symptoms persist for at least three months, despite attempts to improve bowel regularity.\n\n【2】Chronic constipation can have various causes, like low fiber and inadequate fluid intake. Certain medications, such as pain medications (for example., opioids), antacids with aluminum or calcium, and some antidepressants, can cause constipation as a side effect. Chronic constipation can be associated with underlying medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypothyroidism, neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease), and pelvic floor dysfunction. Stress, anxiety, and depression can impact bowel function and contribute to chronic constipation.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of Chronic Constipation?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The symptoms of chronic constipation may vary from person to person, but some common signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【5】*   Infrequent bowel movements.\n    \n*   Difficulty passing stools or straining during bowel movements.\n    \n*   Hard, dry stools.\n    \n*   A feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation.\n    \n*   Abdominal bloating or discomfort.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Constipation In Children - Causes, Prevention, and Management\n    \n    Tetrapyrrole Metabolism Disorders - Refsum Disease and Hepatic Porphyrias\n    \n    Constipation - Danger Signs in Toddlers\n    \n*   Rectal pain or discomfort.\n    \n*   Manual maneuvers (such as pressing on the abdomen) are needed to assist with bowel movements.\n    \n\n【6】What Are the Neurologic Causes of Chronic Constipation?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Neurological diseases can play a role in chronic constipation by affecting the nerves that control the gastrointestinal tract muscles. Here are some neurological causes of chronic constipation:\n\n【8】*   **Parkinson's Disease:** Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement control, including the gastrointestinal tract muscles. The slowed movement of the intestines and reduced coordination of the muscles can lead to chronic constipation.\n    \n\n【9】*   **Spinal Cord Injury (SCI):** SCI can damage the spinal cord's nerves, affecting the signals that control bowel function. Depending on the level and severity of the injury, chronic constipation can result from impaired nerve function.\n    \n\n【10】*   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that impacts the central nervous system, including the nerves responsible for regulating bowel function. Damage to the nerves can disrupt regular muscle contractions and coordination of the intestines, leading to constipation.\n    \n\n【11】*   **Hirschsprung's Disease:** Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital condition with a lack of nerve cells in a portion of the colon, leading to functional obstruction and chronic constipation since the affected segment of the colon cannot usually propel stool.\n    \n\n【12】*   **Autonomic Neuropathy:** Persistent constipation can arise when the nerves that control the autonomic nervous system, responsible for regulating involuntary bodily functions, including digestion, are damaged. This can occur in diabetes, amyloidosis, and other neuropathies.\n    \n\n【13】*   **Stroke:** A stroke, a disruption of blood flow to the brain, can affect the nerves that control bowel function. Depending on the location and extent of the stroke, it can result in chronic constipation.\n    \n\n【14】*   **Other Neurological Disorders:** Certain other neurological disorders, such as muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can impact the nerves that control the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions result in chronic constipation.\n    \n\n【15】It is important to note that each case of chronic constipation is unique, and the specific neurological cause and severity of symptoms may vary. For chronic constipation linked to neurological conditions, it is crucial to undergo a thorough assessment and receive a diagnosis from a healthcare provider specializing in neurology or gastroenterology. This evaluation will help determine the underlying cause and establish an effective treatment plan.\n\n【16】How Is Diabetes Associated With Chronic Constipation?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Diabetes can potentially impact bowel function and contribute to chronic constipation. Here are some ways in which diabetes can be associated with chronic constipation:\n\n【18】*   **Neuropathy:** Diabetes can cause damage to the nerves, a condition called neuropathy. Neuropathy can affect the nerves that control the digestive tract muscles, leading to slowed or weakened contractions (peristalsis) that propel stool through the intestines, resulting in constipation.\n    \n\n【19】*   **High Blood Sugar Levels:** Elevated blood sugar levels resulting from uncontrolled diabetes can impact the moisture level of stool. High blood sugar levels can draw excess water from the intestines, resulting in harder and drier stool that is more difficult to pass, leading to constipation.\n    \n\n【20】*   **Medications:** Some medications used to manage diabetes, such as certain types of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, can affect bowel function and contribute to constipation as a side effect.\n    \n\n【21】*   **Diet and Lifestyle:** Poor dietary choices and a sedentary lifestyle, which can be risk factors for diabetes, can also contribute to constipation. A diet low in fiber, inadequate fluid intake, and a lack of physical activity can disrupt normal bowel function and result in constipation.\n    \n\n【22】What Is the Treatment of Chronic Constipation in Neurologic Diseases?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The treatment for constipation in neurological diseases typically involves a multi-faceted approach that addresses the underlying neurological condition, promotes bowel regularity, and manages any contributing factors. Here are some common treatment options for constipation in neurological diseases:\n\n【24】*   **Medications:** Various drugs may be used to manage constipation in neurological diseases. These include laxatives, stool softeners, and prokinetic agents that promote movement of the intestines. The selection of medication is contingent upon several factors, including the severity of constipation, the underlying neurological condition, and other relevant considerations.\n    \n\n【25】*   **Fiber Supplements:** Fiber supplements, such as Psyllium husk or Methylcellulose, may be recommended to increase bulk and soften stool, which can help promote regular bowel movements. However, fiber supplements should be used cautiously in some neurological conditions, as they may sometimes worsen symptoms.\n    \n*   **Fluid Intake:** Staying adequately hydrated by drinking fluids, especially water, can help soften stool and facilitate bowel movements. Unless contraindicated by other health conditions, it is crucial to ensure sufficient fluid intake is maintained.\n    \n\n【26】*   **Diet Modifications:** Dietary changes, such as increasing high-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and avoiding low-fiber foods like processed foods and dairy products, can help improve bowel function. A registered dietitian or healthcare provider can provide specific dietary recommendations tailored to the individual's needs and underlying neurological condition.\n    \n\n【27】*   **Bowel Retraining:** Bowel retraining techniques, such as establishing a regular bowel routine, can help retrain the bowels to have regular bowel movements. This may involve scheduling time for bowel movements, creating a relaxed environment, and using relaxation techniques during bowel movements.\n    \n\n【28】*   **Physical Activity:** As tolerated and appropriate for the individual's condition, regular physical activity can help stimulate bowel function and promote regular bowel movements.\n    \n\n【29】*   **Pelvic Floor Therapy:** Pelvic floor therapy, which involves exercises and techniques to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, may be beneficial in cases where pelvic floor dysfunction contributes to constipation. A pelvic floor physical therapist can guide appropriate exercises and techniques.\n    \n\n【30】*   **Enemas or Suppositories:** In some cases, enemas or suppositories may help relieve severe constipation. However, these should be used with caution and only under the guidance of a healthcare provider.\n    \n\n【31】*   **Adjustments to Medications:** If medications being taken for the underlying neurological condition contribute to constipation, a healthcare provider may consider adjusting the medication regimen or exploring alternative options.\n    \n\n【32】*   **Other Interventions:** In some cases, more invasive interventions, such as manual disimpaction or other bowel evacuation techniques, may be necessary for severe cases of constipation.\n    \n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】Chronic constipation can be attributed to neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's. To determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan for chronic constipation associated with neurological conditions, it is crucial to undergo a thorough evaluation and receive a diagnosis from a healthcare provider with expertise in neurology or gastroenterology. The treatment approach may encompass personalized lifestyle adjustments, medications, and other interventions tailored to meet the specific requirements of the individual and address the underlying neurological disorder.\n\n【35】Article Resources\n\n【36】*   Chronic Constipation  \n    https://uclacns.org/patients/disease-information/chronic-constipation/\n*   Faecal impaction  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/bowel-problems/types/chronic-constipation\n*   The pathophysiology of chronic constipation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206564/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "7983040b-d745-4f41-9846-743c96915cb3", "title": "Scleral Icterus - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Scleral Icterus - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Most people are usually familiar with the medical term jaundice. Scleral icterus is nothing but yellowing of the eyes caused due to various medical conditions like jaundice. The yellowing of the sclera of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels in the body.\n\n【2】What Causes the Yellowing of the Eyes?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Increased bilirubin levels in the body can cause the yellowing of skin and mouth, including the eyes. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment produced by the body as a byproduct during the breaking down of red blood cells (hemolysis). The liver removes the bilirubin from the blood and excretes it as bile in the feces. However, some underlying medical conditions or liver problems (viral hepatitis) can cause bilirubin levels in the blood to rise.\n\n【4】Yellowing of the eyes is due to the accumulation of the yellowish pigment in the conjunctiva (the layer that covers the sclera) and not the sclera (the white portion of the eye). Hence, some medical professionals often term scleral icterus as conjunctival icterus. However, some believe it is the yellowish pigmentation of the scleral tissues of the eye and hence the term scleral icterus.\n\n【5】Jaundice and icterus are no different. Both these conditions refer to yellowing of the eyes due to increased bilirubin levels. Some researchers consider jaundice, a complication of liver disorders and icterus due to systemic jaundice.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Scleral Icterus?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】Scleral icterus can indicate the initial signs of an underlying condition. It can also occur as an initial symptom of systemic jaundice. However, there could be times when only scleral icterus occurs. Scleral icterus could occur on its own in the case of:\n\n【8】*   Subconjunctival hemorrhage produces an excess amount of bilirubin at the injury site (similar to yellow bruising).\n    \n*   Choroidal hemorrhage following eye surgery.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Is jaundice in a newborn dangerous? What has to be done?\n    \n    What do bile salt and bile pigment signify in jaundice?\n    \n    Infant Jaundice: A Common Complication in Newborns\n    \n\n【9】Normal bilirubin levels are one milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). Scleral icterus occurs when the levels are between two to three milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). At times medical professionals may misdiagnose the yellowing of the eyes for scleral icterus. However, it could also be the subconjunctival fat that results in a yellow hue. Scleral icterus also affects the area near the corneal tissues.\n\n【10】Causes of scleral icterus are different among different age groups; they vary on the age of the person -\n\n【11】**In Infants and Babies**\n\n【12】*   **Physiologic Jaundice -** The most common cause is physiologic jaundice which usually occurs in newborns ( first week of birth).\n    \n*   **Breastmilk Jaundice -** They can also develop breast milk jaundice due to factors present in the breast milk causing increased absorption of bilirubin from the intestines.\n    \n*   **Hereditary -** Inherited diseases like Gilbert’s disease and Crigler-Nijaar syndrome also lead to fluctuations in the bilirubin levels in the body and can lead to scleral icterus.\n    \n*   **Viral Hepatitis -** Viral hepatitis is the most severe form of the disease that causes scleral icterus in children (infected liver cells cause improper absorption of bilirubin, leading to accumulation of bilirubin in the blood).\n    \n\n【13】**In Elderly**\n\n【14】*   **Obstructive Jaundice -** Obstruction of bile ducts can commonly cause scleral icterus in adults. Obstruction of bile ducts can occur as a result of gallstones or malignancy. Other causes include pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Inflammation of the gall bladder (cholecystitis) can also sometimes obstruct the bile flow leading to scleral icterus.\n    \n\n【15】*   **Liver Dysfunction -** Damage to liver cells can cause liver functional impairment. This leads to improper absorption of bilirubin and tends to accumulate in the blood, causing scleral icterus. Alcoholic liver cirrhosis, non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, and drug-induced liver diseases are some causes of scleral icterus in adults.\n    \n\n【16】What are the Symptoms of Scleral Icterus?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】The scleral icterus is when the eyes start to have a yellowish hue. However, scleral icterus will not cause symptoms but is rather a symptom of jaundice.\n\n【18】Scleral icterus can occur because of increased bilirubin levels, and one may experience different symptoms that appear along with scleral icterus. Symptoms that may occur along with scleral icterus include:\n\n【19】*   Itchy skin.\n    \n*   Joint pains.\n    \n*   Fullness in the stomach.\n    \n*   Fatigue and dullness.\n    \n*   Malaise.\n    \n*   Fever.\n    \n*   Changes in urine or stool.\n    \n*   Loss of appetite.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Sudden weight loss.\n    \n*   Yellowing of the skin.\n    \n*   Pale skin.\n    \n*   Yellowing of eyes.\n    \n\n【20】How Is Scleral Icterus Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】Medical professionals start with complete physical and medical history followed by multiple tests to diagnose the condition. The person may have to undergo routine blood and liver function tests to check for liver abnormalities and disorders. Tests may also include serum bilirubin levels to diagnose jaundice. Signs and symptoms are checked for, and complete medical history, including the history of drugs, alcohol, use of toxic substances, hepatitis (inflammation of liver), HIV status, genetic disorders, duration of jaundice, and other medical conditions, are noted and taken into consideration.\n\n【22】What Is the Treatment for Scleral Icterus?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Though there is no definitive treatment for scleral icterus or jaundice, treatment does depend on the underlying medical conditions. Symptoms usually subside after treatment for the underlying cause of jaundice (depending on the liver disorder). The prognosis of scleral icterus due to the resorption of hematomas or Gilbert syndrome (genetic liver disorder) is usually better than other liver disorders like liver cirrhosis. Studies also show the primary way to treat yellow eyes or scleral icterus is to treat the underlying cause as well as maintain a healthy diet to help in faster recovery. Doctors recommend having more fruits and a high fiber diet to help with faster healing.\n\n【24】When jaundice is caused by infections like hepatitis or malaria, it is usually treated with an antibiotic, antifungals, or antiviral medications. Alcohol-induced or drug-induced jaundice may need additional medical assistance to help with quitting the habits. Jaundice resulting from organ damage or as a result of anemia, injuries, cirrhosis, blockage, or cancer may require extensive treatments like surgeries, transplants, chemotherapy or radiation therapies, and at times also, blood transfusions. Neonatal jaundice is usually resolved by increasing breastfeeding sessions to eight to twelve times a day. This helps to improve digestion and helps in bilirubin excretion faster.\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】Serum bilirubin levels above the normal range indicate scleral icterus. Though scleral icterus does not require treatment, treatment for underlying jaundice can help treat scleral icterus. However, one should seek medical help and consult an ophthalmologist if they start noticing yellowing of eyes at the earliest. This will help the doctors to diagnose the condition and seek the proper and correct treatment.\n\n【27】Article Resources\n\n【28】*   Scleral Icterus: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment  \n    https://www.visioncenter.org/conditions/scleral-icterus/\n*   Scleral Icterus  \n    https://www.osmosis.org/answers/scleral-icterus\n*   An unusual case of unilateral scleral icterus  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4333557/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

An alternative that can benefit as much as medicines with the added benefit of zero side effects sounds too good to be true. However, this is a possibility for certain diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis is one such disease.\n\n【2】What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Arthritis is commonly understood as a disease that makes movements difficult for the elderly. Rheumatoid arthritis is much more than that. It is an autoimmune disease, where the body’s immune system attacks one's own cells and tissues. It affects the lining present in the joints of the bones, causing swelling, which subsequently causes bone erosions and deformities. It affects more than one joint simultaneously. In some instances, it affects the entire body, including the skin and eyes, as well as major organs such as the heart and lungs.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Individuals experience stiff, painful joints that are usually swollen and warm to the touch. Rare instances of fever and tiredness may also be experienced. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, there are times when the symptoms are silent (remission - no pain or swelling) and also times when the symptoms intensify (flare- extreme pain and swelling).\n\n【6】What Is the Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The doctor prescribes medications after a physical assessment, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the duration since the onset of symptoms.\n\n【8】Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example Ibuprofen), corticosteroids (for example Prednisolone), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs- for example Methotrexate), and biologicals (a new line of DMARDs-for example: Adalimumab) are some of the medications prescribed to relieve the pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【9】Related Topics\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Can rheumatoid arthritis cause breast lumps?\n\n【12】Rheumatoid Arthritis and Homeopathy\n\n【13】Maxillary Sinus Membrane Fixation\n\n【14】Rheumatoid arthritis cannot be cured permanently, so these drugs need to be consumed regularly for the rest of one's life to gain relief for a suffering individual. Unfortunately, these drugs have severe side effects with prolonged use. This is where complementary and alternative medicine in rheumatoid arthritis comes into play. Alternative therapeutics are implemented to ease daily movements for an extended period without the risk of side effects.\n\n【15】What Is the Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Complementary and alternative medicine for rheumatoid arthritis includes a variety of modalities such as yoga and meditation, Tai chi, acupuncture, diet, and dietary supplements.\n\n【17】Does Yoga Help Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n------------------------------------\n\n【18】As the disease progresses, rheumatoid arthritis affects all joints of the body. The condition of the body can be best judged by the doctor after the examination. On the doctor’s advice, informing the yoga instructor in detail about the condition is important. Studies have shown certain poses and stretches of yoga do relieve the stiffness and pain related to arthritis, but this has to be done under strict supervision.\n\n【19】Yoga is known to help improve the quality of life for an individual too. For individuals diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, yoga can help with improved flexibility and functionality of the joints, as well as helps calm and relax, which directly benefits the body's overall healing.\n\n【20】Does Meditation Help Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Rheumatoid arthritis takes a toll on the mental health of an individual due to the limitations that may be put on them due to the condition. These mental disturbances can be controlled with the help of meditation. There are various mediation techniques. Some of them that have been shown to help with arthritis are as follows:\n\n【22】*   **Yoga Breathing Exercises**: This technique concentrates on breathing. Sit in a comfortable, relaxed position and inhale, hold for four seconds, and then exhale, hold for four seconds and this is repeated for two minutes.\n    \n\n【23】*   **Transcendental Meditation**: Helps the wandering mind to focus. A mantra or phrase is chanted while one sits with eyes closed and comfortably for fifteen to twenty minutes twice a day.\n    \n\n【24】*   **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction**: This is a technique that accepts the present, acknowledges it, and lets it go. When an arthritic individual is in pain, the individual is taught to accept pain as a part of himself and that it is ok to feel it, and let go.\n    \n\n【25】Does Tai Chi Help Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【26】Tai chi is a form of Chinese martial art that involves low-impact, slow-motion exercises that relax the muscles, do not require extreme bending of joints, and do not stretch the connective tissues. All of this is beneficial for an individual suffering from arthritis. Studies have shown that practicing Tai Chi can help improve flexibility, muscle strength, and mood. However, no relevant studies prove that Tai Chi relieves pain and swelling from arthritis. An individual may practice Tai Chi on a doctor’s advice and under the supervision of a trained professional for the other benefits that Tai Chi offers.\n\n【27】Does Acupuncture Help Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Acupuncture is a practice where an acupuncturist uses fine needles at the body’s pressure points to help relax the muscles of the area. Studies have shown that acupuncture helps relieve pain but not necessarily the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. It has been shown to have beneficial effects when done along with medications.\n\n【29】**Which Diet Is Good for Rheumatoid Arthritis?**\n\n【30】Food cannot cure rheumatoid arthritis, but a change in diet can help reduce and control inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis should have a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet for better health and well-being.\n\n【31】*   **Mediterranean Diet** - Mediterranean diet includes fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, grains, and fish which are rich in antioxidants and chemicals that help reduce inflammation in the body. Studies have shown that individuals with rheumatoid arthritis benefit from relief from symptoms as well as the overall well-being of the body by following a Mediterranean diet.\n    \n\n【32】*   **Intermittent Fasting** - Some studies have shown that intermittent fasting provided some relief with symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The exact reason for this effect is not known, however, it is assumed that it could be because of the elimination of certain allergens in the food normally consumed that may cause inflammation in the body.\n    \n\n【33】*   **Vegan or Vegetarian** - Studies have shown that individuals on a vegan (no animal products or dairy) or a vegetarian (no eggs) diet experienced a decrease in the intensity of pain, stiffness, flares of disease, and inflammation. However beneficial it has proven to be, individuals do not tolerate the diet well for a prolonged period to show long-standing benefits.\n    \n\n【34】*   **Dietary Supplements for Rheumatoid Arthritis**\n    \n*   **Fish Oil** - It is a rich source of omega-3 essential fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties. Individuals who included fish oil in their diet had a decreased intensity of pain, tenderness, and stiffness. However, fish oil may interfere with clotting mechanisms; hence, should be used only on the doctor’s advice.\n    \n*   **Borage Seed Oil** - Borage seed oil is a plant-based oil that has been shown to help reduce joint swelling and tenderness if taken along with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Prolonged use may have adverse effects on the liver; hence, must be used on a doctor’s advice and cautiously.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】Rheumatoid arthritis does not have a permanent cure. Complementary and alternative medicine has a very broad range of options. The measures help ease the pain, relax muscles, and reduce swelling and tenderness. In addition, studies have shown that it benefits stressed individuals as well. However, care must be taken to follow complementary and alternative measures only on the advice of the doctor to avoid complications to one’s health.\n\n【37】Article Resources\n\n【38】*   Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis  \n    https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/patient-corner/disease-management/ra-complementary-alternative-medicine/\n*   The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Turkish Patients with Rheumatic Diseases  \n    https://archivesofrheumatology.org/full-text/443\n*   Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Considerations for the Pharmacological Management of Elderly Patients  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313863206\\_Complementary\\_and\\_Alternative\\_Medicine\\_Use\\_in\\_Rheumatoid\\_Arthritis\\_Considerations\\_for\\_the\\_Pharmacological\\_Management\\_of\\_Elderly\\_Patients", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "380325a9-1c27-4dda-94bc-104bcb8fde3c", "title": "Custom Fit Mouth Guards", "text": "【0】Custom Fit Mouth Guards\nWhat Is Black Eye?\n------------------\n\n【1】Mouth guards (also called gum shields or mouth protectors) are defined as resilient devices or appliances placed inside the mouth to reduce oral injuries, particularly to the teeth and surrounding structures. Mouth guards cover the teeth as well as the gingival structure forming a shield for the oral cavity. They not only reduce the severity but also prevent the occurrence of injuries.\n\n【2】Children and adolescents frequently take part in various contact sports, physical exercises, and unsupervised recreational activities, which pose an increased risk of minor to extremely complex dental injuries in these individuals. Sporting accidents are reported to be accountable for 10 to 39% of dental injuries in children. Dental concussion Injuries need to be avoided as much as possible for sports players and athletes.\n\n【3】Concussion injuries usually occur either after a fall or impact directly or indirectly to the face or the facial muscles affecting the jaws and dentition. This can lead to discoloration of the tooth structure if there is a nerve-related injury (that is, to the tooth pulp) or, in severe cases, can be a leading cause of dentoalveolar fractures and injuries. By protection with the mouth guard (preferably fabricated and customized by the dental surgeon), the incidence of these kinds of jaw-related or tooth concussion injuries can certainly be avoidable.\n\n【4】What Are the Salient Features of a Mouth Guard?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   To provide adequate protection, a mouth guard should be properly fitted to the wearer’s mouth and accurately adapted to his or her oral structures, and should importantly be physiologically comfortable to suit the patient’s teeth suiting his or her oral needs.\n    \n*   It should be relatively easy to fabricate and clean with high-impact energy absorption. The necessity of high-impact absorptive forces by the mouth guard is, in turn, to reduce transmitted forces upon impact from any external force, especially in sports players.\n    \n*   The mouth guard should fundamentally have the four ideal characteristics of being tear-resistant, odorless, being tasteless, and, lastly, should not interfere with the speech.\n    \n*   The mouth guard should also not interfere with the patient’s original occlusion or bite; for this purpose, a dentist suggested, and dental lab-made custom-fit mouth guards are usually preferable for professional sports players and athletes. Current research in sports medicine supports not only the usage of pressure laminated custom-fit mouth guards but also the reinforcement by sports players will spread awareness on why its usage is crucial to the prevention of concussion injuries, jaw fractures, and dentoalveolar or facial injuries.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    What are the ways to strengthen my ankles?\n    \n    I broke a big part of my tooth and it smells and looks pale brown color. Is it infected?\n    \n    Apart from extraction, what else can be done for a broken tooth with severe pain?\n    \n\n【6】The American society for testing and materials designated three categories for athletic mouth guards:\n\n【7】A. Prefabricated, ready-made, or stock mouth guard.\n\n【8】B. Mouth-formed, “boil-and-bite “protector.\n\n【9】C. Custom-made, either vacuum-formed or pressure-laminated, usually based on the instructions given by the dental surgeon.\n\n【10】The two categories of custom mouth guards are the vacuum mouth guard and the pressure-laminated mouth guard. Although custom mouth guards can be the most expensive option, they generally offer better retention and comfort, less interference with speech and breathing, and more adaptability to orthodontic appliances as they are individually designed and form-fitted under the dentist’s supervision.\n\n【11】How Are Custom-Fitted Mouth Guards Fabricated?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Fabrication of custom-fitted mouth guards requires five standard steps:\n\n【13】1.  An alginate impression, which includes all teeth (except erupting third molars), the gingiva (till the mucolabial fold), the labial frenum, the palatal portion including the full vestibular extensions and borders are made. If a wax bite is required by the dental laboratory, it is recommended to be taken with the teeth approximately 1.5 mm distance apart.\n    \n2.  The impression is poured with high-strength dental stone to produce a model of the patient’s dentition and other oral structures.\n    \n3.  The mouth guard is formed using one or more sheets of thermoplastic material (most commonly ethylene vinyl acetate) on the stone model.\n    \n4.  The mouth guard is then seated with proper occlusal balance and with correct equilibration.\n    \n5.  Excess material is trimmed from the mouth guard wherein the labial flange should ideally extend to within 2 mm of the vestibular reflection and have rounded edges, and the palatal flange should extend to within 10 mm of the palatal gingival margins and have a tapered edge.\n    \n6.  If any orthodontic tooth movements are to be undertaken, the laboratory should be informed of the proposed movements so that the mouth guards can be fabricated to accommodate them. Depending on the extent of the tooth movements, the mouth guard may need to be remade as treatment progresses.\n    \n\n【14】**Vacuum-Formed Mouth Guards:** A vacuum-formed mouth guard is constructed using a conventional vacuum machine that applies low heat and vacuum (equivalent to approximately one atmosphere of pressure) to soften a single layer of thermoplastic material.\n\n【15】**Pressure-Laminated Mouth Guards:** The pressure lamination technique utilizes a combination of heat and pressure which facilitates proper lamination and precise adaptation of the mouth guard within the specifications of the copolymer material, technique, and machinery used. Up to 10 atmospheres of positive pressure is applied using the pressure lamination machine.\n\n【16】How Should Mouth Guards Be Taken Care of?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Do not chew or alter the mouth guard as this will affect the fit and possibly damage or decrease its effectiveness.\n    \n*   The mouth guard after removal should be stored in only cold water as hot water can dimensionally alter its fit in the oral cavity.\n    \n*   Proper oral hygiene like mouthwash twice a day will also help achieve plaque control in the oral cavity. Since the mouth contains bacteria and plaque, it is important to clean your mouth guard after each use. Clean with toothpaste or toothbrush or clean it in cool, soapy water and rinse thoroughly.\n    \n*   Store and transport the mouth guard in a firm, perforated container to prevent damage and permit air circulation. Do not close the mouth guard container until the freshly washed mouth guard is dry.\n    \n*   Do not share your mouth guards with others.\n    \n*   Avoid high temperature or direct sunlight to minimize distortion.\n    \n*   Check the condition of the mouth guard occasionally and replace it if it has holes or tears, becomes loose, or irritates the teeth or gums.\n    \n*   It is recommended to avoid the use of removable orthodontic appliances simultaneously with the mouth guard.\n    \n*   Mouth guards wear out over time.

Awareness of the players about the usage and dental approach to mouth guards will be beneficial in the prevention of physical injuries to the orofacial cavity.\n\n【20】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【21】* * *\n\n【22】#### **1.**\n\n【23】#### **Is Getting a Custom Mouthguard Helpful?**\n\n【24】Wearing a mouthguard or night guard can prevent the teeth from grinding against each other, thereby preventing attrition of teeth (loss of tooth structure by constant friction against each other). If an individual is prone to stress, tooth attrition, grinding, and teeth clenching, it is worth getting a custom-made mouthguard or night guard to protect the teeth from damage. \n\n【25】#### **2.**\n\n【26】#### **Do Dentists Make Customized Mouthguards?**\n\n【27】Yes, dentists can fabricate custom-made mouthguards and night guards that fit into one’s mouth properly. Every individual has a different jaw size and different anatomy of the teeth. Unlike the readymade, easily available mouthguards, custom-made ones are specially made for the patient’s mouth. These are more convenient and comfortable to wear. The dentist takes impressions of the teeth and jaws with alginate materials, after which the mouthguards or night guards are fabricated in the laboratories.\n\n【28】#### **3.**\n\n【29】#### **How Long Can Custom Mouthguard Be Used?**\n\n【30】Depending on the patient's habits and other factors, mouthguards may last three to five years. A night guard has an average lifespan of five years, but depending on the wear, it can need replacement in just one year. Night guards may also get torn or get broken if not handled properly. They can also turn yellow and stink if not cleaned properly. \n\n【31】#### **4.**\n\n【32】#### **Can Night Guards Affect the Temporomandibular Joint?**\n\n【33】Night guards are usually prescribed as a treatment or solution for nighttime bruxism (teeth clenching or grinding). Unfortunately, most individuals use night guards incorrectly or, for the first time, experience worsening pain in their jaw joint, also called the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), after wearing the appliances. Over-the-counter ready-made or prefabricated night guards may or may not fit properly, causing severe pain in the jaw joint. This may affect the TMJ over a while. Hence. It is always advised to wear night guards fabricated by dentists (custom-made).\n\n【34】#### **5.**\n\n【35】#### **How Many Times Can One Wear a Mouthguard?**\n\n【36】There is no specific number of times a person could wear a mouthguard or a nightguard. However, dentists recommend replacing the mouthguard after every six months or when the mouthguard becomes thin or yellow. Research shows that mouthguards become less effective when their thickness reduces. This is because there is less protective material to absorb the masticatory forces or external impact and protect the teeth.\n\n【37】#### **6.**\n\n【38】#### **Can a General Dentist Make Mouthguards?**\n\n【39】Yes. A general dentist can make a mouthguard or night guard. The process involves taking impressions of the patient’s mouth and sending the impressions made from alginate material to the laboratory. The lab technician uses these impressions to make plaster models over which the nightguard or mouthguard is fabricated. The nightguard is then fit into the patient's mouth and checked for any fitting issues or problems.\n\n【40】#### **7.**\n\n【41】#### **Do Night Guards Cause the Teeth to Shift?**\n\n【42】Over-the-counter or ready-made and prefabricated night guards can cause the teeth to shift from their original positions over time in case they do not fit properly. This shifting can also cause other side effects like attrition, malalignment of the teeth, poor aesthetics, altered smile and mouth sores from the material rubbing against the gums and soft tissue, and soreness of the jaw joint (temporomandibular joint).\n\n【43】#### **8.**\n\n【44】#### **Can a Mouthguard Realign Teeth?**\n\n【45】No, mouthguards nor night guards can realign your teeth. Clear and invisible braces called clear aligners are used to realign and straighten the teeth out of alignment to improve the smile. Mouthguards and night guards are fabricated over the already existing teeth positions, whereas clear aligners are fabricated on the desired and altered teeth positions.\n\n【46】#### **9.**\n\n【47】#### **Does One Have to Wear a Nightguard Forever?**\n\n【48】Whether short-term or long-term, dentists prescribe or recommend the duration of nightguards depending on the severity, the existing condition of the teeth, the severity of attrition, and the intensity of clenching and grinding habits. Wearing the night guard protects teeth from further damage. One can stop wearing night guards if the habits no longer exist and continue to show damaging effects. However, these habits may also occur subconsciously at night, so it is best to continue wearing them as a preventive measure.\n\n【49】#### **10.**\n\n【50】#### **Which Is Better Upper or Lower, the Night Guard?**\n\n【51】Both upper and lower night guards are capable of preventing dental disorders. However, the best results are achieved by wearing the lower nightguard. Most people find night guards for lower teeth more comfortable than upper ones. Lower night guards also fit better and are less likely to shift or become loose at night. They are also less likely to trigger a gag reflex.\n\n【52】#### **11.**\n\n【53】#### **Which Dental Problems Are Prevented With a Night Guard?**\n\n【54】   \nThe night guard effectively protects the teeth against disorders like teeth grinding and clenching that lead to severe tooth attrition and consequences. Teeth grinding (bruxism) is a condition where the patient grinds their upper and lower teeth against each other. This leads to loss of tooth structure due to constant friction between the teeth. This can also cause severe teeth sensitivity and pain. It could also lead to other problems, such as jaw pain, pain in the jaw joint (TMJ), tooth pain, and sore gums.\n\n【55】#### **12.**\n\n【56】#### **How to Stop Teeth From Clenching at Night?**\n\n【57】Clenching of teeth and teeth grinding at night is a result of severe and chronic stress. Reducing stress levels can help prevent clenching habits while asleep. Here are some ways to stop teeth clenching at night–  \n\\- Try relaxation techniques to calm down before bed.  \n\\- Listen to relaxing and soothing music.  \n\\- Practice facial yoga.   \n\\- Wear custom-made night guards fabricated by dentists.\n\n【58】#### **13.**\n\n【59】#### **Are Custom-Fitted Mouthguards Expensive?**\n\n【60】Custom-made mouthguards are a bit more costly than the ready-made ones available in the market, especially the ones made by dentists. It involves a more precise fit and better benefits. However, the price range also depends on the dentist and the condition of the teeth, and their alignment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of this complex brain disorder.\n\n【2】What Are the Inheritance and Perpetuation of Manic Episodes?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Those afflicted with bipolar disorder are prone to a lot of mood changes, sometimes on a day-to-day basis. This disorder runs in families, and research has identified many loci for its inheritance.\n\n【4】The various facets of this disorder include hypomania, mania, and depression. Each of these phases can be debilitating. The majority of those suffering from bipolar disorder spend their time being depressed rather than in mania or hypomania.\n\n【5】*   The maximum duration that depression occurs or an episode can last is for 9 to 12 months, while a manic episode will remit within 3 to 6 months. However, this is not the rule in every case, but it is the maximum time period that a mood episode can last. Following this, there will be spontaneous remission, what is called ''the natural course'' of the disorder.\n    \n*   Spontaneous remission of the mood episode (depression or mania or hypomania) is not seen in all cases, and there are quite a few chronic mania patients as well.\n    \n*   Rather than the severity or duration of manic symptoms, factors associated with chronicity in mania are the presence of psychotic symptoms and issues related to social and occupational functioning.\n    \n\n【6】What Are Behavioral Disturbances?\n---------------------------------\n\n【7】Mood episodes are intense, and people are prone to have behavioral disturbances during such episodes. It is imperative to seek professional help from a psychiatrist.\n\n【8】If left untreated, there will be serious socioeconomic implications with resultant loss of functioning capacity, quality of life, pay, and absence from work.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of People with a Manic Episode?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   They may feel very ''up'' or ''high'', feel ''jumpy'' or ''wired''.\n    \n*   They talk really fast with difficulty in interrupting them.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Do my symptoms indicate bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?\n    \n    Taking medicines for bipolar disorder, but unable to sleep.

Even with such little sleep, they will feel refreshed and display high energy levels.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of People with a Depressive Spell?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】On the other hand, those having a depressive spell will experience symptoms that are poles apart from that of a manic episode.\n\n【13】*   Depressed individuals will feel ''down'', worry a lot, and cannot concentrate on things at hand.\n    \n*   They keep forgetting a lot of stuff.\n    \n*   They become disinterested in day-to-day living.\n    \n*   They experience difficulty in falling asleep.\n    \n*   They keep getting thoughts about death and suicide.\n    \n*   Coupled with this, they also experience a lot of fatigue and become less active.\n    \n\n【14】What Are the Risk Factors of Bipolar Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Factors increasing the risk of developing bipolar disorders are,\n\n【16】*   A first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with bipolar disorder.\n    \n*   High stress due to a traumatic event or the death of a loved one.\n    \n*   Drug abuse or alcohol abuse.\n    \n\n【17】What Are the Complications of Bipolar Disorder?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】When bipolar disorder is left untreated, it can result in serious problems affecting every day of your life, such as:\n\n【19】*   Issues of drug and alcohol abuse.\n    \n*   Unable to concentrate on studies.\n    \n*   Suicide attempts.\n    \n*   Financial problems.\n    \n*   Trouble maintaining a stable relationship.\n    \n*   Poor work performance.\n    \n\n【20】How Is Bipolar Disorder Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】*   Bipolar disorder is diagnosed using criteria, either from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). More often than not, it is common for clinicians to miss a previous mood episode which altogether changes the diagnosis.\n    \n*   Bipolar disorder is a clinical diagnosis, and there is no investigation that will effectively point to the diagnosis as of now.\n    \n*   Research is going on to find reliable biomarkers, as in the case of cancer, for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n    \n\n【22】How Is Bipolar Disorder Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】Bipolar disorder cannot be prevented. But getting treatment at the earliest can help prevent bipolar disorder or any other mental health conditions from getting worsened.\n\n【24】When you have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, following some strategies can help to prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes. They are,\n\n【25】*   **Paying Attention To Warning Signs** \\- When we address the symptoms earlier, one can prevent episodes from getting worse because the pattern of bipolar episodes and its triggering factors can be identified. Reach the doctor when you feel falling into an episode of mania or depression. Also, involve your family or friends to watch for warning signs.\n    \n*   **Avoid Drugs and Alcohol** \\- Recreational drugs or alcohol consumption can worsen the symptoms and make them more likely to return.\n    \n*   **Take the Medications As Directed** \\- Do not stop the medication or reduce the dose on your own because it may cause withdrawal effects or the symptoms may worsen or recur.\n    \n\n【26】How Is Bipolar Disorder Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【27】A host of options exist for the treatment of bipolar disorders. The current philosophy of treating bipolar disorder lies in symptom control and prophylaxis.\n\n【28】Risk for recurrent episodes exists throughout one's life, and one school of thought says that prophylaxis should be for a lifetime. Again, there are differing schools of thought, as there is none to fit all treatment.\n\n【29】**Medication:**\n\n【30】These are referred to as mood stabilizers. Those with euphoric (intense sense of happiness) mania are treated with Lithium, and those with dysphoric or irritable mania are treated with Valproate.\n\n【31】Those who have a preponderance of repeated depressive spells in their course of this disorder are treated with Olanzapine-Fluoxetine combination, Quetiapine, or Lamotrigine. All atypical antipsychotics serve as antimanic agents.\n\n【32】**Therapy:**\n\n【33】''Talk'' therapy can help clients change their behavior and manage their lives. Therapy should also include family members, and they should be educated about the illness, its natural course, prognosis, and treatment options.\n\n【34】A specialized form of therapy, called Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), exists for clients with bipolar disorder. All psychiatrists undergo training to administer this form of therapy.\n\n【35】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【36】* * *\n\n【37】#### **1.**\n\n【38】#### **Can Bipolar Episodes Be Controlled?**\n\n【39】There is no such cure for bipolar episodes, but it can be managed through mood stabilizers, behavior therapy, and other bipolar medicine.

NCS usually affects multiple body systems and may cause intellectual disability, seizures, and physical features such as growth delays, birthmarks, and skin abnormalities.\n\n【2】NCS is often referred to as phakomatoses or neuroectodermal syndromes. It is divided into three main types:\n\n【3】*   **Tuberous Sclerosis** \\- A genetic disorder that causes benign (non-cancerous) tumors to develop in different body parts.\n    \n*   **Neurofibromatosis -** Tumors of the brain, spinal cord, and nerve, including NF1 (Neurofibromatosis-1), Neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2), and Schwannomatosis.\n    \n*   **Sturge-Weber Syndrome** \\- A genetic disorder that affects the blood supply to a certain brain area.\n    \n\n【4】What Causes Neurocutaneous Syndrome?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】Genetic mutations cause neurocutaneous syndromes. These mutations may be passed down from a parent or spontaneous mutation. Many neurocutaneous syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that affect cell division, metabolism, or the structure of tissues. Some neurocutaneous syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that play a role in the growth and development of the brain, spinal cord, or organs.\n\n【6】The effects of these genetic mutations may differ from one person to the next depending on the type of mutation and the gene affected. It should be noted that not all neurocutaneous syndromes are genetic. For example, Sturge-Weber syndrome is caused by a change in blood vessels in the brain and is not linked to any genetic mutation.\n\n【7】Related Topics\n\n【8】* * *\n\n【9】Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis - Stages, Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Neurocutaneous Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The symptoms of neurocutaneous syndromes vary depending on the specific syndrome; they may include the following:\n\n【12】1\\. **Tuberous Sclerosis (TS)**: Tubers or growths commonly found inside the brain and the retinal area of the eye. Tuberous sclerosis affects numerous organs in the body, including the child's brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, kidneys, skin, and skeletal bones. This disease is also linked to intellectual disability, developmental delays, learning disabilities, seizures, mental retardation, autism, skin lesions, and benign brain, heart, lung, and kidney tumors.\n\n【13】2\\. **Neurofibromatosis (NF)**: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is classified into three types: NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis.\n\n【14】**a) Neurofibromatosis1 (NF1)**:\n\n【15】*   The most common type of neurofibromatosis is NF1, known as Von Recklinghausen’s disease. It is characterized by light brown patches of pigmentation on the skin, known as cafe-au-lait spots. It is also associated with benign (noncancerous) nerve tumors called neurofibromas.\n*   Neurofibromas are frequently found on the child's nerves and in various organs. Patients with NF have a high incidence of brain tumors. However, less than 1 percent of people with NF will develop malignant (cancerous) changes in their neurofibromas.\n*   Lisch nodules (dome-shaped elevations projecting from the iris surface) also may be developed on the iris (the colored part of the eye); it is small tumors that can appear in adolescence but rarely cause problems.\n*   There may also be hearing loss, headaches, seizures, scoliosis, and facial pain or numbness. Intellectual disability affects up to 1 percent of people with neurofibromatosis I, while other children may experience learning difficulties and hyperactivity.\n\n【16】**b) Neurofibromatosis 2**:\n\n【17】*   NF2 is a less common neurofibromatosis characterized by tumors that develop on both cranial and spinal nerves.\n*   This type of neurofibromatosis affects about one in every 25,000 people, and symptoms usually appear between 18 and 22 years of age. However, it is less common and is known as bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis. Tumors on the eighth cranial nerve cause hearing loss, headaches, problems with facial movements, balance problems, and difficulty walking.\n*   They may also be associated with seizures, meningiomas (membranous tumors around the brain and spinal cord), neurofibromas (skin nodules), and cafe-au-lait spots (dark to light brown pigmented birthmarks that appear on the newborn’s skin)\n\n【18】c) **Schwannomatosis**:\n\n【19】Schwannomatosis is an uncommon variant of NF characterized by painful growths of Schwann cells that can develop anywhere in the body but are most commonly found in the head, neck, spine, arms, and legs. It is characterized by intense pain and the growth of tumors except for the brain and spine. Symptoms can vary widely, including tingling, numbness, pain, balance problems, muscle weakness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment.\n\n【20】3. **Sturge -Weber Disease**:\n\n【21】Sturge-Weber Syndrome is caused by a mutation that affects the blood supply to certain brain parts, which can cause neurological abnormalities such as seizures, intellectual disability, and paralysis. It is characterized by a port wine stain on the child's face, typically near or around the eye and forehead areas, which is the most common symptom of this disease. A port wine flat stain area on the child that ranges from red to dark purple and is present from birth. The birthmark is caused by the formation of an abnormally large number of tiny blood vessels beneath the skin. A child also has increased pressure in the eye region called glaucoma at birth.\n\n【22】How Are Neurocutaneous Syndrome Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】A physical examination and diagnostic tests are used to make the diagnosis. During the examination, the doctor obtains the child's complete prenatal and birth history and asks if any other family members have any of these conditions. The doctor will also inquire about developmental milestones in older babies and children, as these disorders can be associated with other neurological issues and may necessitate additional medical attention.\n\n【24】The following diagnostic test are carried out:\n\n【25】1. **Genetic Testing**\\- This is often the first step in diagnosing a neurocutaneous syndrome. A geneticist or genetic counselor can review family medical history and other relevant information to determine if a genetic mutation is present.\n\n【26】2. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** \\- They use large magnets, radio waves, and computers to help assess the structure of the brain and body.\n\n【27】3\\. **Computed Tomography Scan (CT Scan)** \\- A diagnostic imaging procedure that employs X-rays and CT scans to create horizontal or axial images of the body. A CT scan produces high-resolution images of the body parts, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans provide more information than standard X-rays.\n\n【28】4\\. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** \\- EEG is used to detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain through the electrodes (sticky pads) attached to the scalp.\n\n【29】5\\. **Eye Examination** \\- An eye examination is done to look for signs of glaucoma (excess pressure on the eye) or cataracts (clouding of the eye's normally clear lens).\n\n【30】6\\. **Biopsy** \\- A biopsy may be performed to confirm the presence of tumors or other abnormalities. A small tissue from the tumor is taken and examined under the microscope.\n\n【31】How Is Neurocutaneous Syndrome Treated?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【32】Treatment of neurocutaneous syndrome depends on the underlying condition and symptoms. It will depend upon the child’s symptoms, age, and general health. Treatments may include medication, surgery, and lifestyle changes to help manage the symptoms. A neurocutaneous syndrome is a lifelong condition with no cure. Because of that, the child is treated by healthcare providers, which may include:\n\n【33】1\\. **Pediatrician or Family Doctor**\\- The child's primary care physician.\n\n【34】2\\. **Neurologists**\\- They are physicians who treat brain, nerve, and spinal cord conditions.\n\n【35】3\\. **Neurosurgeon**\\- The surgeon who treats the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【36】5\\. **Orthopedic Surgeon**\\- The surgeons deal with muscles, bones, ligaments, and tendons.\n\n【37】6\\. **Ophthalmologist**\\- The physician who treats eye problems.\n\n【38】7\\. **Oncologist**\\- The doctor who treats cancers and other tumors.\n\n【39】8. **Nurses** - Healthcare providers who frequently collaborate with other healthcare professionals.\n\n【40】9\\. **Rehabilitation Team** \\- Physical, occupational, speech, and audiology therapists are included in the rehabilitation group.\n\n【41】How To Prevent Neurocutaneous Syndrome In a Child?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Preventing neurocutaneous syndromes (NCS) in children is possible through genetic counseling. Genetic counseling can inform families about the risks of having a child with NCS and advise reducing the risks. Parents may be advised to have a family history taken and have their children tested for NCS-related genes. Genetic testing can also be performed to identify if a parent or relative is a carrier of an NCS-related gene.\n\n【43】Preventative measures can be taken if a child is at risk. These may include regular check-ups, screening for conditions associated with NCS, and medications or therapies to manage symptoms. Surgery may sometimes be recommended to remove tumors or abnormal tissue. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Neurocutaneous syndromes are genetic disorders affecting the spinal cord, brain, organs, skin, and bones. These disorders are lifelong conditions that can be challenging to diagnose and treat but can be managed with proper care. They can also cause many problems, such as hearing loss, seizures, and developmental problems. Still, with the right combination of medical intervention and lifestyle modifications, individuals living with these conditions can enjoy a good quality of life.\n\n【46】Article Resources\n\n【47】*   Neurocutaneous Syndromes  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537001/\n*   Neurocutaneous Syndromes in Children  \n    https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/neurocutaneous-syndromes-children\n*   Neurocutaneous Syndromes in Children  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/neurocutaneous-syndromes-in-children", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is most commonly seen in the southwest regions of the United States with exposure to rodents in the work or home environment. This can also be found in South America and Canada. In humans, these viruses mainly affect the lungs, heart, and kidneys. In Asia, the other types of Hantaviruses commonly affect the kidney instead of the lungs. It commonly occurs in the summer and spring seasons.\n\n【2】What Causes Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by the several types of Hantaviruses that are carried by different types of rodents. The disease is transmitted to humans directly or indirectly through air contaminated with saliva or fluids from infected rodents that carry the virus. The respiratory mode of transmission is frequently observed in the infections caused by Sin Nombre Hantaviruses. In North America, the primary carrier of this disease is the deer mouse, and other carriers include\n\n【4】*   The Bayou virus is seen in rice rats in the regions of Texas and Louisiana.\n    \n*   Black Creek Canal virus is found in the cotton rat in the regions of Florida.\n    \n*   New York viruses are seen in the white-tailed mouse, mostly in the eastern part of the United States.\n    \n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】*   The symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome may initially present with:\n    \n\n【7】*   Fever.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n*   Myalgias (muscle aches).\n    \n*   Cough.\n    \n*   Abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Chills.\n    \n*   Diarrhea.\n    \n*   Malaise (discomfort).\n    \n*   Vomiting.\n    \n\n【8】*   Other symptoms may include:\n    \n\n【9】*   Tachypnea (rapid breathing).\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    What is the risk of getting a hantavirus infection after contact with rat feces?\n    \n    I have shortness of breath and pain in shoulder.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be challenging.\n    \n*   The presence of flu symptoms and the history of potential rural rodent exposure associated with shortness of breath suggest hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.\n    \n*   Blood samples are taken to confirm the presence of antibodies produced against the Hantavirus.\n    \n\n【29】How To Treat Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   There is no specific mode of treatment or vaccine for the prevention of Hantavirus infection.\n    \n*   Oxygen therapy is provided for patients suffering from breathing difficulties.\n    \n*   In intensive care, patients are intubated and managed with supplemental oxygen therapy to help in the management of severe respiratory distress.\n    \n*   Early diagnosis and treatment aid in early recovery.\n    \n*   Patients with severe respiratory distress may show less rate of recovery.\n    \n*   Patients with flu symptoms related to rodent exposure are advised to visit the physician immediately to prevent further complications.\n    \n*   In order to maintain an adequate supply of oxygen, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is recommended. In this, a machine continuously pumps the blood in which the carbon dioxide is removed, and oxygen is added more.\n    \n\n【31】How To Prevent Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【32】*   Avoid contact with rodents in-home, at campsites, or workplace.\n    \n*   Seal up the holes or gaps in the home, garage, and outside areas to keep rodents away.\n    \n*   Set traps are placed in and around the home to minimize rodent infestation.\n    \n*   Open up the campers and cabins before cleaning.\n    \n*   Follow the safety precautions before and during cleaning the rodent-infested areas. The safety procedures help in preventing the spread of viruses, and these include:\n    \n\n【33】*   Before cleaning, wear masks and gloves.\n    \n*   Spread the disinfectant or bleach solution over the nest, dead rodents, or droppings, and allow it to remain undisturbed for five minutes.\n    \n*   For cleaning, use paper towels and immediately dispose of the towels in the garbage.\n    \n*   Mop the area completely with the disinfectant.\n    \n*   Wash the gloved hands and dispose of both the gloves and the masks.\n    \n*   Finally, hands must be washed clearly with soap and water.\n    \n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a life-threatening respiratory disease. A timely diagnosis and prompt treatment help in the positive outcomes of the disease. Majority of people who are treated recover completely and are not found with any long-lasting effects. Certain lung infections may take several months to heal completely, but most people recover within a few days after the successful treatment.\n\n【36】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【37】* * *\n\n【38】#### **1.**\n\n【39】#### **What Happens When a Person Has Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【40】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but serious illness caused by a virus that spreads through the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents, particularly deer mice. Symptoms typically begin with flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, which are then followed by shortness of breath and coughing. The disease can progress rapidly, causing severe respiratory distress and organ failure.\n\n【41】#### **2.**\n\n【42】#### **Does Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Go Away?**\n\n【43】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can be fatal, but it is possible for the disease to go away with proper medical treatment. Early diagnosis and medical intervention can improve the chances of survival. Treatment usually involves hospitalization and supportive care, such as oxygen therapy to improve breathing and medications to manage symptoms. Recovery can take several weeks, and patients may experience fatigue and shortness of breath for an extended period after the illness has resolved.\n\n【44】#### **3.**\n\n【45】#### **How Do a Person Get Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【46】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is typically contracted by inhaling air contaminated with the virus, which is shed in the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. People can become infected with HPS by coming into contact with contaminated materials such as mouse urine, droppings, or nesting materials. In rare cases, HPS can also be contracted through a rodent bite. The risk of contracting HPS can be reduced by avoiding contact with rodents and their droppings, keeping homes and workplaces clean, and taking precautions when cleaning up areas with rodent activity.\n\n【47】#### **4.**\n\n【48】#### **How Do the Test for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【49】Diagnostic tests for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) typically involve laboratory testing of blood, urine, or tissue samples to detect the virus or antibodies to the virus. These tests can confirm the presence of HPS and rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms. Diagnosis of HPS can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, and the disease is rare. Early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment, and patients who are experiencing symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.\n\n【50】#### **5.**\n\n【51】#### **How Long Does It Take to Recover from Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【52】The recovery time for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can vary depending on the severity of the illness and the individual's overall health. Some patients may recover within a few weeks, while others may require several months to recover fully. Treatment for HPS usually involves hospitalization and supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and medications to manage symptoms. After recovering from HPS, patients may experience fatigue and shortness of breath for an extended period.\n\n【53】#### **6.**\n\n【54】#### **How Can a Person Protect themself from Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【55】To protect yourself from Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), it is essential to take precautions to avoid exposure to the virus. This includes avoiding contact with rodents and their droppings, sealing up cracks and holes in buildings to prevent rodent entry, and keeping homes and workplaces clean. When cleaning up areas with rodent activity, it is essential to take precautions, such as wearing gloves and a mask and wetting the area to prevent the virus from becoming airborne.\n\n【56】#### **7.**\n\n【57】#### **What Antiviral Is Used for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?**\n\n【58】Currently, there is no specific antiviral medication for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Treatment usually involves hospitalization and supportive care, such as oxygen therapy to improve breathing and medications to manage symptoms. Ribavirin, an antiviral medication, has been used to treat some patients with HPS, but its effectiveness in treating the disease is unclear. Treatment is most effective when started early, so patients who are experiencing symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.\n\n【59】#### **8.**\n\n【60】#### **How Long Does Hantavirus Live in Mouse Droppings Indoors?**\n\n【61】The survival time of hantavirus in mouse droppings indoors can vary depending on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. In general, the virus can remain infectious for a few days to several weeks. To prevent exposure to the virus, it is essential to avoid contact with rodent droppings and to take precautions when cleaning up areas with rodent activity. This includes wearing gloves and a mask, wetting the area to prevent the virus from becoming airborne, and thoroughly disinfecting the area.\n\n【62】#### **9.**\n\n【63】#### **What Is the Most Serious Respiratory Disease?**\n\n【64】There are several serious respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is also a serious respiratory disease that can be fatal if left untreated. It is essential to seek medical attention if a person experience symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, to receive prompt diagnosis and treatment. Preventative measures, such as getting vaccinated and avoiding exposure to respiratory irritants like smoke, can help reduce the risk of developing respiratory diseases.\n\n【65】#### **10.**\n\n【66】#### **What Does Hantavirus Do to Humans?**\n\n【67】Hantavirus is a type of virus that is typically transmitted to humans through contact with rodents, such as deer mice, that carry the virus. When humans come into contact with rodent urine, droppings, or saliva, they can inhale the virus and develop Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can be fatal if left untreated. While the virus is rare, it is important to take precautions to avoid exposure to rodents and their droppings, especially in areas where rodents are common, such as rural or suburban areas.\n\n【68】#### **11.**\n\n【69】#### **How Likely Is It to Get the Hantavirus?**\n\n【70】The likelihood of getting Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome depends on several factors, including geographic location, exposure to rodents and their droppings, and individual susceptibility to the virus. The virus is more common in rural or suburban areas where rodents are prevalent, and people who live or work in these areas may be at a higher risk of exposure. However, HPS is still rare, and not everyone who is exposed to the virus will develop the illness.\n\n【71】#### **12.**\n\n【72】#### **How Fatal Is Hantavirus?**\n\n【73】Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can be a fatal illness if left untreated, with a mortality rate of approximately 40 %. The disease can cause severe respiratory distress and other complications, and treatment is most effective when started early. Prompt medical attention is essential for anyone who develops symptoms of HPS, such as fever, muscle aches, and shortness of breath, especially if they have been in contact with rodents or droppings. Preventative measures, such as avoiding exposure to rodents and their droppings and keeping homes and workplaces clean, can help reduce the risk of infection.\n\n【74】#### **13.**\n\n【75】#### **Can One Survive Hantavirus?**\n\n【76】The survival rate for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) varies depending on the severity of the illness and how quickly treatment is started. With prompt medical attention, the mortality rate can be reduced to around 15 %. However, without treatment, the mortality rate can be as high as 50 %. The disease can cause severe respiratory distress and other complications, and patients who recover may experience ongoing health issues. Taking preventative measures to avoid exposure to rodents and seeking prompt medical attention if one develops symptoms of HPS can help improve the chances of survival.\n\n【77】#### **14.**\n\n【78】#### **How Do Doctors Test for Hantavirus?**\n\n【79】Doctors can test for Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome by performing blood tests to detect antibodies to the virus. The test is typically done during the early stages of illness, and multiple tests may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Other tests, such as chest X-rays and pulmonary function tests, may be done to evaluate the severity of the disease and guide treatment. Prompt medical attention is essential for anyone who develops symptoms of HPS, such as fever, muscle aches, and shortness of breath, especially if they have been in contact with rodents or droppings.\n\n【80】#### **15.**\n\n【81】#### **Where Is Hantavirus Most Common?**\n\n【82】Hantavirus is found worldwide, but the specific strains of the virus and the prevalence of the disease vary depending on geographic location. In the United States, the virus is most commonly found in the southwestern and western regions, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas. Other regions where the virus has been identified include Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. People who live or work in areas where rodents are common may be at a higher risk of exposure to Hantavirus and should take precautions to avoid contact with rodents and their droppings.\n\n【83】Article Resources\n\n【84】*   Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hps/index.html\n*   Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)  \n    https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome\n*   About Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)  \n    https://foundation.chestnet.org/lung-health-a-z/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome-hps/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The most common conditions where steroids are used in infants are atrioventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defect.\n\n【12】Other conditions where steroids are indicated for better outcomes post-surgery are:\n\n【13】1.  Post-operative hospital length stays less than 90 days.\n2.  Renal failure with temporary dialysis.\n3.  Ventilator support for less than 7 days.\n4.  Multiple-system organ failure.\n5.  Postoperative unplanned interventional catheterization.\n6.  Post-operative cardiac arrest.\n7.  Preoperative bleeding.\n8.  Unplanned delayed sternal closure.\n9.  Postoperative mechanical circulatory support.\n10.  Unplanned cardiac operation.\n11.  Multisystem organ failure.\n12.  Respiratory failure with permanent dialysis.\n13.  The neurologic deficit persists at discharge.\n14.  Operative mortality.\n\n【14】Do Corticosteroids Lead To Less Inflammation and Better Clinical Outcomes?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】For many years, measured the effect of glucocorticosteroids on markers of inflammation but, importantly, tried to correlate them with the clinical outcomes. Steroids can blunt inflammation, but some others are the opposite.\n\n【16】*   It is difficult to characterize the multifaceted nature of SIRS response, a variety of activated cytokines that interact occur in an unpredictable manner.\n    \n*   The use of corticosteroids is subject between centers and various types of steroids, routes of administration, various regimes, and making a more difficult correlation between clinical outcomes and inflammation.\n    \n*   Small-sized and displaying a variability between endpoints, the standard corticosteroid regimen recommended to all individuals may not address host inflammatory response but the approach to SIRS.\n    \n\n【17】Are Steroids Worth the Risk?\n----------------------------\n\n【18】It is difficult to assess the short-term risk of steroid administration. Some groups of infants have no effect of steroids during their administration after undergoing heart surgery. However, some cases raised concerns about infection and steroid-treated groups.\n\n【19】*   Children undergoing heart surgery have no significant benefits from steroids. Steroids are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in low-risk individuals.\n    \n*   The course of steroid administration is associated with increased rates of sepsis, fractures, and venous thromboembolism.\n    \n*   Infants with premature lung disease and early administration of steroids harm cognition outcomes and neuromotor effects on children.\n    \n*   Infants with respiratory distress found steroids associated with delayed development and cerebral palsy incidence.\n    \n*   Long-term follow-up is aimed at studying the effects of steroids on neurocognition.\n    \n\n【20】How Do Steroids Lead to Benefits in Infant Heart Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】When the steroid comparison is compared to two groups that include postoperative infection and mortality, hospital stay and mechanical ventilation support are:\n\n【22】*   The rate of mortality postoperative complications was 17.2 percent for the steroid group and 20.3 percent for the placebo group.\n    \n*   The mortality rate of infants who received steroids was 2.8 percent for the placebo group and 2 percent for the steroid group.\n    \n*   Postoperative infections occurred around 5.2 percent in steroid administration, while 4 percent in placebo administration.\n    \n*   6.8 percent steroid administration was required to prolong mechanical ventilation, while 8.5 percent was in the placebo group.\n    \n*   Individuals who received steroids had ten days of hospital stay and 11 days for the placebo group.\n    \n*   Steroid-administered infants had more risk of high blood sugar, where 19 percent required insulin within surgery, while 6.7 percent of infants in the placebo group required insulin within 24-hour surgery.\n    \n\n【23】**Conclusion:**\n\n【24】Steroid use in pediatric cardiac surgery in three main areas: adrenal function, neuroprotection, and effect on inflammation. Characterized by the complex inflammation in response to the surgery, the effects of steroids remain limited on the outcomes. However, the significant benefit of corticosteroids is associated with high mortality and morbidity rate and in lowering risk in patients. The potential impact of the different dosing regimens of steroids and the timing of the administration levels may help evaluate and design future trials.\n\n【25】Article Resources\n\n【26】*   Corticosteroids and Outcome in Children Undergoing Congenital Heart Surgery  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.948737\n*   STeroids to REduce Systemic Inflammation After Infant Heart Surgery (STRESS)  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03229538\n*   Corticosteroids and Outcome in Children Undergoing Congenital Heart Surgery: Analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems Database  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013053/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by the formation of small, dilated blood vessels called telangiectasia, which can bleed easily and cause various symptoms depending on the location of the affected vessels. Primary telangiectasia, also known as essential telangiectasia, refers to the widening of capillaries without a known cause. It is not associated with any other skin or internal conditions. Generalized essential telangiectasia is a specific type of primary telangiectasia characterized by its widespread distribution throughout the body.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes?\n--------------------\n\n【3】The exact cause of generalized essential telangiectasia is not fully understood. However, it is known to be an inherited disorder caused by mutations in certain genes, specifically endoglin, and ACVRL1. These genes code for proteins required for blood arteries' development and function. When mutations occur in these genes, the proteins do not work correctly, leading to the formation of abnormal blood vessels and the symptoms of HHT. The ailment is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that an individual only has to inherit one copy of the defective gene from one parent to acquire the condition. Primary telangiectasia is not related to varicose veins or other issues with the veins. It is possible that environmental factors, like sun exposure, could be a contributing factor to its development.\n\n【4】Who Is Affected by Generalized Essential Telangiectasia?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Generalized essential telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder that can affect anyone. It occurs in males and females and can affect people of all races and ethnicities. However, it is relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of one in 5,000 to one in 10,000 individuals worldwide. The onset of generalized essential telangiectasia typically occurs around the age of 40 to 50, and it tends to affect women more frequently than men. People with a family history of HHT are more likely to be affected.\n\n【6】What Are the Sign and Symptoms of Generalized Essential Telangiectasia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The following features characterize generalized essential telangiectasia (HHT):\n\n【8】*   **Telangiectasia:** The presence of dilated capillary blood vessels that are red or pink in color, typically measuring less than 0.2 mm (millimeter) in diameter and arranged in a lacework or branching pattern. These vessels most commonly appear on the feet, ankles, and lower legs but can also be found on the trunk and upper body areas such as the hands and arms. When pressure is applied to the affected areas, the vessels temporarily lose color before refilling with blood.

Some of the most important conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of HHT include:\n\n【12】*   **Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome:** This is another inherited disorder similar to HHT in many ways, including developing telangiectases on the skin and mucous membranes. However, it is caused by mutations in a different gene, and it also includes other features, such as the formation of AVMs in organs such as the lungs, brain, and liver.\n    \n*   **Ataxia-Telangiectasia:** This rare genetic disorder affects the nervous system, immune system, and DNA repair mechanisms. It is characterized by the formation of telangiectases on the skin and mucous membranes, as well as other symptoms such as ataxia, immune deficiency, and increased susceptibility to infections and cancer.\n    \n*   **Varicose Veins:** Varicose veins are dilated, twisted veins most commonly found in the legs. They can cause similar symptoms to HHT, such as aching, swelling, and skin changes. However, varicose veins are not inherited or associated with developing telangiectasia on the skin and mucous membranes.\n    \n*   **Rosacea:** This is a common skin condition that affects the face and is characterized by the formation of redness, papules, and pustules. It can be mistaken for HHT, but it is not inherited and is not associated with the formation of telangiectases on the skin and mucous membranes.\n    \n\n【13】What Are the Treatment Options?\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】The treatment of generalized essential telangiectasia (HHT) is aimed at managing the symptoms and preventing complications associated with abnormal blood vessels. The approach to treatment will depend on the specific symptoms and affected organs.\n\n【15】*   **Telangiectases:** Telangiectasia on the skin and mucous membranes can be treated with laser therapy, electrocautery, or sclerotherapy. These treatments use heat or a chemical solution to shrink or destroy the dilated blood vessels.\n    \n*   **Recurrent Nosebleeds:** Nosebleeds caused by telangiectasia in the nose and sinuses can be treated with nasal cautery or surgery to remove or shrink the abnormal blood vessels.\n    \n*   **Anemia:** If anemia is caused by chronic blood loss from telangiectasia or other blood vessels, treatment may include iron supplements, blood transfusions, or surgery to remove the abnormal vessels.\n    \n*   **Digestive Tract Telangiectasia:** Telangiectasia in the gastrointestinal tract can be treated with endoscopic methods such as argon plasma coagulation (APC) or with surgery.\n    \n*   **Respiratory Tract Telangiectases:** Telangiectasia in the lungs can be treated with embolization, which blocks blood flow to the abnormal vessels, or surgery.\n    \n*   **Cerebral Telangiectasia:** Telangiectasia in the brain can be treated with embolization or surgery.\n    \n*   **Telangiectasia Associated With Visceral Avms:** In organs such as the liver, lung, and brain, telangiectasia can be treated with embolization or surgery.\n    \n\n【16】Regular monitoring and follow-up care: Regular monitoring is important for people with HHT to detect any new or worsening symptoms and to monitor for the development of AVMs or other complications.\n\n【17】**Conclusion**\n\n【18】In conclusion, generalized essential telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder that affects blood vessels in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. It is characterized by the formation of small, dilated blood vessels called telangiectasia, which can bleed easily and cause various symptoms depending on the location of the affected vessels. The exact cause of HHT is not fully understood, but it is known to be an inherited disorder caused by mutations in certain genes. HHT can affect anyone, and it occurs in males and females; it is relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of one in 5,000 to one in 10,000 individuals worldwide. HHT is a multidisciplinary approach, and it's important to have a team of specialists that includes a geneticist, hematologist, and interventional radiologist, among others.\n\n【19】Article Resources\n\n【20】*   Generalized essential telangiectasia  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14961914/\n*   Generalized essential telangiectasia  \n    https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6dd8m6rk\n*   Generalised essential telangiectasia  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/generalised-essential-telangiectasia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d750afab-a01f-4640-8328-6a703aa7a22f", "title": "Neonatal Transient Myasthenia Gravis - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Neonatal Transient Myasthenia Gravis - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Myasthenia gravis is a chronic neuromuscular autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies are formed against the cholinergic receptors in the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia gravis is of Greek and Latin origin, which means ‘grave, serious, muscle weakness.’ It is more common in females than males. The younger females have abnormalities in the thymus, like thymus hyperplasia. It causes fatigue in the muscles that are under voluntary control. In addition, it weakens the skeletal muscles. The symptoms are intermittent, not, which is worse for some time and improve after some rest. The powers responsible for breathing and some body parts are involved in moving, like the arms and legs. Eighty-five percent of the patients with myasthenia gravis have autoantibodies directed against nicotinic receptors of the muscle. As a result, people experience symptoms such as drooping of the eye muscles, blurred or double vision, impaired speech (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing, a change in facial expression, and weakness in the hands, arms, legs, neck, and fingers.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Myasthenia Gravis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】It is due to the problem of transmitting impulses from the nerves to the muscles. It happens when communication is interrupted between the muscle and the nerves. The neurons use neurotransmitters like acetylcholine to communicate information in the brain. When the impulses travel down a motor nerve, the neurotransmitters are released from the nerve endings that bind to the acetylcholine receptors in the muscle. This activates the muscle for muscle contraction. In myasthenia gravis, autoimmune antibodies destroy the receptors for acetylcholine and prevent muscle contraction. Antibodies to other proteins, such as muscle-specific kinase protein, also impair the transmission at the neuromuscular junction.\n\n【4】How Does Thymus Gland Cause Myasthenia Gravis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The thymus gland plays a significant role in developing the immune system because it produces T-lymphocytes that protect the body against infections. After puberty, the thymus gland becomes small and is replaced by fat. People with this condition have clusters of immune cells in the thymus gland that develop into thymus gland tumors. They can be cancerous in the future. In myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland may give incorrect information to the growing immune cells, producing autoimmune antibodies (acetylcholine receptor antibodies) that act against their acetylcholine receptors in the muscle.\n\n【6】What Is Neonatal Transient Myasthenia Gravis?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Neonatal myasthenia gravis affects neonates born to mothers with autoimmune myasthenia gravis. The transmission occurs through the transplacental passage of antibodies directed against the neuromuscular junction. The antibodies are directed against the antigens like the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChr) and specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSKR). In this disorder, there is the transplacental transmission of maternal antibodies. The circulating maternal antibodies are transmitted to the baby through the placenta, which destroys the acetylcholine receptors in the developing fetus. Seventy-five percent of the mothers have acetylcholine receptor antibodies. These antibodies degrade the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that blocks the acetylcholine binding to the muscles. It is not very clear why the antibodies are transferred to the fetus. It is believed that it is due to the specific autoantibody characteristics that differ between individuals. Infants with this condition may be born to mothers who are not displaying only a few or no symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Women who surgically removed their thymus glands also have significantly less chance of transmitting the disease to the baby.\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Neonatal Transient Myasthenia Gravis?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Most infants exhibit symptoms 3 to 72 hours after birth. The signs and symptoms include:\n\n【10】*   They lack facial expressions (facial diplegia).\n    \n*   Breathing.\n    \n*   Cry weakly.\n    \n*   Poor sucking.\n    \n*   Respiratory distress.\n    \n*   Generalized hypotonia with a weak cry.\n    \n*   Swallowing difficulties.\n    \n*   Ptosis (the upper eyelid droops over the eye) may be unilateral, bilateral, or asymmetric.\n    \n*   Multiple joint fractures (arthrogryposis multiplex congenital).\n    \n*   Frog leg position suggestive of diffuse hypotonia.\n    \n*   Open mouth.\n    \n*   Flabby muscles and prominent head lags.\n    \n*   Deep tendon reflexes are intact.\n    \n\n【11】What Is Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is congenital contracture tightening the muscles, tendons, skin, and nearby tissues. The situation occurs alone or is associated with multiple developmental defects and is a part of many syndromes. The disease is characterized by fluctuating pathological painless muscle weakness with remission and exacerbations involving one or several skeletal muscles. In addition, the continuous flow of acetylcholine receptor antibodies during pregnancy can lead to severe fetal movement, leading to arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.\n\n【13】What Are the Diagnosis Test Done for the Neonates?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The infants often recover soon after the condition like, within a few weeks or months, because the maternal antibodies disappear independently. Most neonates completely recover before four months, and more than 90 percent before two months. Neonatal myasthenia gravis is the ultimate clinical diagnosis. A strong history with a mother with known autoimmune myasthenia gravis and a physical examination is sufficient to make the diagnosis. However, in rare cases, the clinical presentation is not classic, and the mother is asymptomatic for myasthenia gravis. Getting positive results on one or more standard diagnostic tests.\n\n【15】1.  **Electromyogram or Nerve Conduction Study (EMG or NCS) -** The test measures the electrical activity of muscles. A single-fiber EMG test is done, which is a more sensitive test. Traditional single-fiber electromyography is impractical for children, as it cannot be performed under sedation or general anesthesia. A variant of single-fiber electromyography, stimulated single-fiber electromyography, is beneficial in children and adolescents.\n    \n2.  **Intramuscular Neostigmine Test -** Intramuscular neostigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) can be administered to evaluate the response of ptosis, dysphagia, and head lag. Suppose there are negative results, a second dose is given after 4 hours. It is best if this testing is performed in a monitored setting where advanced cardiorespiratory support is available in case of any rare heart signs during the testing, primarily when higher doses are used. The adverse effects are abdominal cramps, sudden diarrhea, and cardiac arrhythmia (abnormality in heart rhythm). Therefore, intravenous neostigmine is contraindicated in babies before two years of age due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeats).\n    \n3.  **Antibody Testing for Anti-acetylcholine Receptor -** Antibody testing is done in myasthenia gravis. Positive antibody titers confirm the diagnosis, and further testing is needed if the clinical presentation is atypical. Antibody testing only involves serum testing and is relatively inexpensive, especially for acetylcholine receptor antibodies.\n    \n\n【16】What Is the Treatment for Neonatal Transient Myasthenia Gravis?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Neonatal myasthenia gravis is treated by the following methods:\n\n【18】*   The treatment for neonatal myasthenia gravis involves drug treatment to increase the availability of acetylcholine neurotransmitters.\n    \n*   In addition, immunomodulation and immunosuppression are more robust approaches to medical therapy.\n    \n*   However, immunomodulation and immunosuppression are typically more invasive and have significant side effects. Immunosuppression improves the clinical situation because the antibodies released from the immune cells are decreased.\n    \n*   The pediatric patients are counseled regarding medications that may exacerbate myasthenia gravis. If mildly symptomatic, small and frequent feeding is necessary with proper surveillance for aspiration and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing).\n    \n*   In severe cases, oral or intramuscular neostigmine is required with gavage feeding (a small tube is placed through the mouth or nose).\n    \n*   Administration of Neostigmine 30 minutes before feeding can help with dysphagia. Pyridostigmine (a slightly longer-acting agent) can be used alternatively.\n    \n*   Fortunately, plasmapheresis (a method of removing blood plasma from the body separating into plasma and cells), intravenous immunoglobulins, and corticosteroids are all efficient in treating myasthenia gravis in older children and adults but rarely are needed and only necessary for managing severely affected neonates for rapid removal of circulating antibodies.\n    \n*   Infants born to mothers who have taken corticosteroids during pregnancy should be monitored for adrenal inefficiencies during the newborn period.\n    \n\n【19】**Conclusion:**\n\n【20】The results of the classical form of neonatal myasthenia gravis are excellent, provided the respiratory and nutritional support is good. Long-term complications in neonates with myasthenia gravis are found in severe and rare disease variants. However, most patients experience spontaneous remission after a period of weeks to months.\n\n【21】Article Resources\n\n【22】*   Neonatal Myasthenia Gravis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558935/\n*   Myasthenia Gravis  \n    https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/myasthenia-gravis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This type of cancer is characterized by genetic abnormalities in the form of chromosomal translocations, which result in the fusion of genes and the subsequent production of abnormal proteins. In 2004, it was identified as a form of kidney cancer that typically has a slow growth rate and does not commonly present symptoms in patients.\n\n【2】TRCC was first described in 2004 and has since been recognized as a distinct entity within the family of RCC. It typically affects children and younger individuals. It is more common in men than women, and often presents as a solitary mass in one kidney.\n\n【3】What Is the Difference Between Renal Cell Carcinoma and Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma (TRCC)?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer that develops in the cells lining the small tubes in the kidney that filter waste and fluids from the blood. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90 to 95 percent of all kidney cancer cases. It can be further classified into different subtypes based on the appearance of the tumor cells under a microscope and genetic characteristics.\n\n【5】Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) is a rare subtype of RCC that is characterized by a specific chromosomal abnormality. In TRCC, there is a genetic rearrangement involving the TFE3 gene that causes the gene to fuse with another gene and produce an abnormal protein. This protein promotes the growth and division of cancer cells, leading to the development of TRCC.\n\n【6】What Is the Cause?\n------------------\n\n【7】Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) is characterized by chromosomal abnormalities where the structure of chromosomes is disrupted, resulting in improper functioning of cells. In TRCC, a specific gene known as TFE3 undergoes a break and rearrangement, and the detection of this particular chromosomal change is used by doctors to confirm the diagnosis of translocation renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【8】How to Diagnose It?\n-------------------\n\n【9】Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) can be diagnosed using various techniques that include:\n\n【10】Related Topics\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】Is RCC benign or malignant and what is the treatment?\n\n【13】Other than Sutent, which medicine can I opt for papillary renal cell carcinoma?\n\n【14】Adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Renal Cell Carcinoma - An Overview\n\n【15】*   Imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI, or ultrasound, to identify the presence of a tumor in the kidney and to evaluate its size and location.\n    \n*   Biopsy, which involves taking a small sample of the tumor tissue and examining it under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of TRCC.\n    \n*   Molecular testing to look for specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with TRCC, such as the rearrangement of the TFE3 gene.\n    \n*   Blood and urine tests to evaluate kidney function and detect any abnormal levels of certain substances, such as protein or blood cells, which may be indicative of TRCC or other kidney problems.\n    \n\n【16】The diagnosis of TRCC usually involves a combination of these methods to accurately confirm the presence of this specific type of kidney cancer.\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【18】Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) usually does not cause any symptoms in its early stages. As the tumor grows, some common symptoms may include:\n\n【19】*   Blood in the urine.\n    \n*   Pain or discomfort in the back or side of the body.\n    \n*   A mass or lump felt in the abdomen or side.\n    \n*   Fatigue or weakness.\n    \n*   Unintended weight loss.\n    \n*   Fever.\n    \n*   High blood pressure.\n    \n\n【20】What Is the Prognosis?\n----------------------\n\n【21】Prognosis refers to the anticipated long-term impact of a disease on an individual, which can vary depending on various factors including the location of the tumor in the body, the extent of cancer spread to other body parts, and the extent of tumor removal during surgery. As each person's situation is unique, the prognosis may differ based on individual circumstances.\n\n【22】To determine the survival rates of individuals with translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC), doctors evaluate the outcomes of groups of patients who had the condition in the past. However, due to the limited number of TRCC cases, these estimates may not be very precise. Typically, children diagnosed with TRCC have a more favorable prognosis compared to adults. It is crucial for patients to continue receiving medical care and monitoring even after treatment, as TRCC can spread to other areas of the body many years after the initial diagnosis.\n\n【23】What Is the Treatment of TRCC?\n------------------------------\n\n【24】Treatment for translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) typically depends on the stage and extent of the cancer, as well as the individual's overall health. Some common treatment options include:\n\n【25】*   **Surgery:** Surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue may be recommended in early-stage TRCC cases.\n    \n*   **Radiation Therapy:** High-energy radiation is used to destroy cancer cells and may be recommended after surgery to remove any remaining cancer cells.\n    \n*   **Chemotherapy:** Chemotherapy is generally not very effective for treating TRCC, however it may be administered in some circumstances to reduce symptoms or limit the growth of the tumor.\n    \n*   **Targeted Therapy:** This type of treatment uses drugs that specifically target and attack cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy cells. Targeted therapy is often used to treat advanced-stage TRCC.\n    \n*   **Clinical Trials:** New treatments and medications for TRCC may be available through clinical trials, which involve testing new therapies and drugs to determine their effectiveness and safety.\n    \n\n【26】What Is the Survival Rate?\n--------------------------\n\n【27】According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the overall five-year survival rate for patients with advanced-stage TRCC was about 51%, which is higher than the survival rates for other types of kidney cancer. However, it is important to note that survival rates can vary widely depending on individual circumstances, and it is important for patients to discuss their prognosis and treatment options with their healthcare provider.\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】In conclusion, Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC) is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that is characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities. TRCC typically affects children and younger individuals and presents as a solitary mass in one kidney. While TRCC is generally slow-growing and may not present symptoms in its early stages, it can spread to other areas of the body many years after the initial diagnosis. The diagnosis of TRCC usually involves a combination of imaging tests, biopsies, molecular testing, and blood and urine tests. Treatment options for TRCC may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and clinical trials.\n\n【30】Article Resources\n\n【31】*   Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-kidney-tumors/translocation-renal-cell-carcinoma#\n*   Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma: An Update on Clinicopathological and Molecular Features  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615326/\n*   Translocation Renal Cell Carcinomas in Adults: A Single Institution Experience  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527899/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The short-term response is acute inflammation and long-term, and the ongoing response is chronic inflammation. The cellular and molecular changes post-injury reduce impending injury and infections. Any long-term inflammation can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\n【2】**What Is Acute Inflammation?**\n\n【3】Acute inflammations begin immediately after injury. This damage can be thermal, mechanical, chemical, radiation or infection. Acute inflammation can present in the form of acute bronchitis, sore throat, wound or trauma, or appendicitis.\n\n【4】Related Topics\n\n【5】* * *\n\n【6】Is Gum Inflammation a Curable Problem?\n\n【7】How can inflammation of the eye be cured?\n\n【8】I suddenly developed multiple joint pain yesterday morning. What could be the cause?\n\n【9】It has four characteristic features. They are as follows:\n\n【10】*   **Rubor** \\- Redness due to increased blood flow.\n*   **Calor** \\- Localized increase in temperature or heat.\n*   **Tumor** \\- Swelling occurs due to increased fluid loss into extracellular spaces.\n*   **Dolor** \\- Pain which occurs due to stimulation of nerves.\n*   **Functio Laesa** \\- This causes loss of function.\n\n【11】**What Are the Common Causes of Inflammation?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The causes of the inflammation can be classified into two main groups:\n\n【13】*   **Exogenous Agents:** Consists of microbial agents and non-microbial agents.\n*   **Microbial Agents:** Include pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These consist of microorganisms, and virulent agents, which trigger the inflammatory response.\n*   **Non-Microbial:** Causes include allergens, toxic compounds, irritants, and foreign bodies. These include silica and asbestos.\n*   **Endogenous Agents:** Include signals released by the dead, damaged, malfunctioned, or stressed tissue.\n\n【14】The causes can also be classified as\n\n【15】*   **Infectious**: Agents include bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.\n*   **Non-Infectious:** Agents include physical injuries like frostbite, burns, physical injury, foreign bodies, trauma, ionizing radiation, and chemical compounds.\n\n【16】**What Is the Clinical Significance of Acute Inflammation?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   **Cardiovascular Disease**: In atherosclerosis, inflammatory mediators play a major role. An increase in the levels of chemokines and cytokines is seen. The first sign of cardiac stress is inflammation.\n*   **Pancreatitis**: Pancreatitis is a genetic disease due to alcohol abuse or pancreatic duct obstruction. This infection activates inflammatory cells like neutrophils and granulocytes. They further secrete inflammatory cytokines.\n*   **Liver Infection**: Inflammation will try to protect the liver from further injury and infection. When this infection exceeds, it will cause liver cell injury, metabolic changes, and ischemia. The infectious agent in such cases is Hepatitis virus, ischemia, alcoholic hepatitis, or drug-induced hepatitis.\n*   **Kidney Infection**: Kidney infections are caused by endothelial cells of renal tubules. These cells secrete cytokines which bring about inflammation.\n*   **Intestine Infections**: Inflammatory bowel disease is caused due to gut microbial flora. They induce cytokines. This is seen in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\n【18】**What Are the Phases of Acute Inflammation?**\n\n【19】Acute inflammation has two phases; vascular phases, which involve a change in the blood vessels, and cellular phase, which consists of a change in cellular components.\n\n【20】**Vascular Phase:**\n\n【21】*   **Vasodilatation -** In this phase, the blood vessels surrounding the injury dilate. This increases the blood flow to the injured area. The cells of the blood vessel are called endothelial cells. These cells initially enlarge, followed by contraction.\n*   **Exudation of Fluid -** The contraction of endothelial cells creates spaces between the cells to increase fluid loss. This loss of fluid in the extracellular space causes swelling.\n*   An increase in the tissue fluid increases the migration of inflammatory proteins like complement and immunoglobulins. This increases lymphatic drainage and helps clear pathogens and cellular debris.\n\n【22】**Cellular Phase:**\n\n【23】The neutrophil is an important cell in inflammatory reactions. The release of chemotaxis follows injury; these are the mediators that help neutrophils attract to the injury site. The neutrophils migrate in the following stages:\n\n【24】*   **Margination:** The neutrophils line up against the endothelial cells.\n*   **Rolling**: They are in close contact with the endothelial cells and roll along them.\n*   **Adhesion**: They attach to the endothelial cell wall.\n*   **Emigration**: They move through the gaps between the endothelial cells to the affected area. Once the neutrophils are in contact with the pathogen, the pathogen is engulfed to form a phagosome. This process is called phagocytosis. This phagosome is destroyed by an enzyme called lysozyme. This is an oxygen-independent reaction. Another way of phagosome destruction is by free radical formation. This is an oxygen-dependent reaction.\n\n【25】The injury can show the following outcomes:\n\n【26】*   Complete repair and resolution.\n*   In cases of increased inflammation, fibrosis and scar formation occurs.\n*   If the damage continues, it can lead to chronic inflammation.\n*   If bacteria invade the site, it can lead to abscess formation.\n\n【27】How to Diagnose Inflammation?\n-----------------------------\n\n【28】*   Increased levels of inflammation increase the levels of biomarkers, substances that increase in the body due to inflammation. C-reactive protein levels can be assessed.\n*   The erythrocyte sedimentation rate test measures the inflammation, the rate at which red blood cells immerse in the blood tube. Increased inflammation can increase the thickness of blood.\n\n【29】**How to Treat Inflammation?**\n------------------------------\n\n【30】Inflammation does not require any specific treatment. Following measures can be followed to control inflammation.\n\n【31】*   Adequate rest is needed.\n*   Cold fomentation with the use of ice packs can provide symptomatic relief.\n*   Good care of the wound to prevent infection.\n*   We can consume a diet consisting of food with anti-inflammatory properties. Diet rich in fish, fish oil, green leafy vegetables, olive oil, broccoli, avocados, green tea, mushrooms, and tomatoes.\n*   Bacterial or fungal infections can require the prescription of antibiotics or antifungals.\n*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce pain, swelling, and fever. These drugs inhibit inflammatory enzymes. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and Aspirin are a few such drugs available over the counter. Consult the physician before the long-term use of such medications.\n*   Pain relief can be obtained with the use of over-the-counter Paracetamol or Tylenol.\n*   Corticosteroids are a group of steroid drugs that help in the treatment of arthritis, dermatitis, hepatitis, asthma, and certain allergic reactions.\n*   Topical analgesics are used for acute pain. Topical creams containing Ibuprofen or Diclofenac can help relieve topical inflammatory symptoms.\n\n【32】**How to Prevent Inflammation?**\n--------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Maintenance of healthy weight and regular exercise.\n*   Avoid smoking.\n*   Limit alcohol intake.\n*   Stress management techniques like meditation and yoga.\n*   Try to avoid fried and processed food, red meat, sugar-containing drinks, and saturated fats in the diet.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Inflammation is the physiological response of the body to any sort of injury or infection. On the basis of time taken to develop these responses, the inflammation can be classified into acute (shorter duration) or chronic (longer duration). Inflammation is mostly accompanied by redness, swelling, and pain. Inflammation does not require any specific treatment.The symptoms can be easily managed and avoided by adapting a healthy lifestyle.\n\n【36】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【37】* * *\n\n【38】#### **1.**\n\n【39】#### **What Is the Acute Inflammatory Response in Traumatic Brain Injury?**\n\n【40】As a respose to traumatic brain injury, there is increased release in cytokines, interleukin1beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor after 24 hours of injury. In severe brain injury, the presence of immune response is associated with reduced consciousness and higher risks of death from injury.\n\n【41】#### **2.**\n\n【42】#### **What Is the Acute Inflammatory Response During a Trauma?**\n\n【43】During trauma, a dysregulated acute inflammatory response is induced that affects several organs and sets in a viciuos cycle of inflammation driven by cytokines, chemikines, and products of damaged, stresses, or dysfunctional tissue. It is also pivotal in clearing invading organisms and offending agents and promoting tissue repair under certain conditions.\n\n【44】#### **3.**\n\n【45】#### **Does Acute Inflammatory Response Cause Asthma?**\n\n【46】Asthma is caused by an aberrant inflammatory response to non-pathogenic stimuli in the airways leading to  a chronic inflammatory response relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. This inflammation affectes all compartments of the airways including the upper respiratory tract and nose.\n\n【47】#### **4.**\n\n【48】#### **What Do Acute Inflammatory Response Involve?**\n\n【49】Acute inflammatory response involves five signs-   \n - Heat.  \n - Redness.  \n - Swelling.  \n - Pain.  \n - Loss of function.\n\n【50】#### **5.**\n\n【51】#### **What Are the Characteristics of Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【52】Characteristics of acute inflammatory response is local edema, redness,swelling,  tenderness, and pain, increased temperature and loss of tissue function which result from local immune, vascular and inflammatory cell responses to infection or injury.\n\n【53】#### **6.**\n\n【54】#### **Is there Heart Rate Variability in Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【55】Due to the physiological association between inflammatory processes and vagus activity, there is higher heart rate variability (HRV), especially indices of vagally-mediated HRV, to be associated with decreased levels of inflammation through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.\n\n【56】#### **7.**\n\n【57】#### **How Does Acute Inflammatory Response Help to Fight Against Infections?**\n\n【58】Whenever there is an infective agent invasion, the acute inflammatory response results in release of chemical mediators that cause blood vessels to produce white blood cells called phagocytes that protect the body against infective agents by eat up the microbes or damaged cells. This increases the blood flow in the affected area.\n\n【59】#### **8.**\n\n【60】#### **What Are the Stages or Steps of Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【61】The four steps of the inflammatory response   \n - Recognizing  the damaged tissue,  \n - Recruitment of inflammatory cells,   \n - Removal of extraneous objects, and  \n - Repair the damaged tissue.\n\n【62】#### **9.**\n\n【63】#### **What Are the Functions of Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【64】The main function of acute inflammatory response is to trigger immune response in an area of the body that requires to fight against pathogens causing infection or to aid in injury healing.   \nThree functions or steps inculde: vasodialtion, increased vascular permeability, and migration of leukocytes to the affected area.\n\n【65】#### **10.**\n\n【66】#### **How Long Does Acute Inflammatory Response Last For?**\n\n【67】Acute inflammatory response lasts for a short duration of time from minutes to hours or days based on the type and extent of injury.\n\n【68】#### **11.**\n\n【69】#### **What Do You Mean Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【70】Acute inflammatory response is a pattern of immune response to a cell or tissue injury, characterized by immediate accumulation of immune cells at the injury site.\n\n【71】#### **12.**\n\n【72】#### **How Does Acute Inflammatory Response Aid in Maintaining Homeostasis?**\n\n【73】Acute inflammatory response helps in maintaining the homeostasis by coordinating with host immune system function, including T-cell mediated response to recognise and eliminate cancer cells. They modulate tissue environment at all stages of homeostatic imbalance, for example, promotion and resolution of inflammation, tissue regenatio, and remodelling or fibrosis.\n\n【74】#### **13.**\n\n【75】#### **What Are the Goals Included in Acute Inflammatory Response?**\n\n【76】The main goals of acute inflammatory response include:  \n - Fight against infection or pathogen.  \n - Prevent infection.  \n - Eliminate tissue damage.  \n - Promote healing.  \n - Recruiting cells of innate immunity.\n\n【77】Article Resources\n\n【78】*   Acute Inflammatory Response  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556083/\n*   Acute Inflammatory Response  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310543/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The following measures need to be implemented by any individual affected by the COVID virus hence:\n\n【34】*   Firstly, self-medication by the patient is strictly not indicated. Mucormycosis is a dangerous fungal infection with deep-rooted systemic manifestations that mainly target the brain, sinuses, and lungs. Any of the symptoms pertaining to mucormycosis should be strictly reported by the patient or those in contact with the patient to curb its spread as an epidemic.\n*   Immediate consultation with the ENT doctor, ophthalmologist, or treating doctor in case of any abnormal findings. MRI/CT with contrast - paranasal sinuses and orbit, if needed-on doctor's advice.\n*   It is important for the physician to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and to reduce steroid usage, and, if possible, discontinue the use of immunomodulating drugs.\n*   The patient's treatment for mucormycosis specifically should not be discontinued at least for 4-6 weeks or, as advised by the physician, to rule out the possibility of recurrent infection in the individual.\n*   As steroid usage in the treatment of COVID infection and in mucormycosis is implemented by many doctors, the patient should maintain extra personal hygiene and environmental hygiene. As the effects even after treatment by steroids continue to last 3-4 weeks and the patient's immune response may not be normal, it will still be in a state of immune suppression, hence the need for extra precaution after treatment.\n*   As the oral immune defense is breached primarily in mucormycosis, oral hygiene maintenance is of pivotal importance. Regular mouth washing with betadine gargle or an antiseptic mouthwash every day, along with disinfection of the toothbrush in an antiseptic solution, will definitely reduce the risk of transmission of the fungal infection via the oral route. Also, toothbrushes need to be disposed of after recovery from COVID infection, and in the absence of a mouthwash, daily rinsing with warm saline or saltwater will also aid in maintaining oral hygiene. Toothbrushing twice a day and mouth washing are essential to keep the immune response of the oral cavity from the reservoir of fungal or viral pathogens that it is prone to.\n*   Physicians in COVID wards are instructed to check the patient's nose (the nostrils) and skin for signs of any infection. The water used in oxygenation should be cross-checked for contamination, and the patient's oxygen mask and cannula need to be sterile to prevent the fungal invasion by the pathogens.\n*   Proper use of masks (three-ply masks), gloves, and fully covering one's arms and legs while staying in damp or dusty places for the COVID patient will prevent the spread of infection. If possible, damp and dusty places need to be avoided by the COVID patient.\n\n【35】Hence timely detection and diagnosis in high-risk cases and patients affected by COVID is the need of the hour to prevent the spread and the secondary infections that follow because of mucormycosis.\n\n【36】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【37】* * *\n\n【38】#### **1.**\n\n【39】#### **How Can One Detect Mucormycosis Early?**\n\n【40】A tissue biopsy can be used to make an early diagnosis, in which a small sample of damaged tissue is examined under a microscope or in a fungal culture in a laboratory for evidence of mucormycosis.\n\n【41】#### **2.**\n\n【42】#### **How To Prevent Mucormycosis Infection?**\n\n【43】 - Better glycemic management in people with diabetes, proper administration of systemic corticosteroids, and reduced unnecessary antibiotic, antifungal, and immunomodulator use.  \n - When visiting dusty or construction sites, wear a face mask to avoid inhaling fungal spores that could cause mucormycosis and excess mucus.\n\n【44】#### **3.**\n\n【45】#### **What Are the First Symptoms of Black Fungus?**\n\n【46】Mucormycosis on the skin might appear as blisters or ulcers, and the diseased region can darken. Individuals may also experience discomfort, warmth, redness, or swelling near a cut. Mucormycosis of the GI tract can cause abdominal pain.\n\n【47】#### **4.**\n\n【48】#### **How To Detect Black Fungus?**\n\n【49】Sinusitis or nasal blockage and congestion are black fungus symptoms that signal you have a fungal infection caused by black fungus and mucormycosis. Keep an eye out for nasal discharge with a sticky appearance or a hint of blood in it.\n\n【50】#### **5.**\n\n【51】#### **How Is Mucormycosis Diagnosed?**\n\n【52】A tissue biopsy is a procedure where a small sample of the affected tissue is examined in a lab for signs of mucormycosis under a microscope or in a fungal culture.\n\n【53】#### **6.**\n\n【54】#### **How to Prevent Getting Infected With Black Fungus?**\n\n【55】When individuals are out in nature or working with dirt and manure, make sure to protect themselves by wearing appropriate footwear, long pants, t-shirts with full sleeves, and gardening gloves. This will keep oneself safe and prevent the symptoms of black fungus. In addition, one needs to practice good hygiene by regularly changing their clothes, giving scrub baths, and continuously washing their hands.\n\n【56】#### **7.**\n\n【57】#### **What Triggers Mucormycosis?**\n\n【58】Mucormycosis primarily affects persons with health problems or who use medications that reduce the body's capacity to resist infections and illness. It typically affects the sinuses or the lungs after breathing fungal spores from the air. It might also manifest following a skin wound, burn, or cut.\n\n【59】#### **8.**\n\n【60】#### **What Treatments Can Cure Black Fungus Naturally at Home?**\n\n【61】One can try this home remedy by mixing one teaspoon of Gudici powder, one teaspoon of Tinospora cordifolia powder, one teaspoon of Neem powder, one teaspoon of turmeric powder, and a half glass of water. The mixture should be taken three times a day.\n\n【62】#### **9.**\n\n【63】#### **How Quickly Does Mucormycosis Progress?**\n\n【64】The incubation period for mucormycosis is typically between one and two weeks. However, there are sometimes delays in diagnosis, and the progression of the disease naturally occurs fast over just a few days.\n\n【65】#### **10.**\n\n【66】#### **Can Mucormycosis Be Cured?**\n\n【67】Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, was formerly believed to be a rare infection, but it is now the second most common invasive mould infection. Despite the development of more recent antifungal medications, the death rate associated with mucormycosis continues to be alarmingly high. The early diagnosis of mucormycosis is essential to the successful care of the condition, as is the reversal of any underlying predisposing risk factors, surgical debridement, and the quick delivery of active antifungal medications. Mucormycosis, on the other hand, does not always respond favorably to treatment.\n\n【68】#### **11.**\n\n【69】#### **How Long Can One Have Mucormycosis?**\n\n【70】According to the literature reviews, the average time that symptoms lasted was reported to be 11 days and can be between 2 to 30 days.\n\n【71】#### **12.**\n\n【72】#### **Can CT Scan Detect Mucormycosis?**\n\n【73】Yes, it is possible to detect mucormycosis through a CT (computed tomography) scan. Sinonasal mycosis can be found with CT, which is 100 % accurate and 78 % specific. Imaging features may look like cancer, but invasive fungal infections should be considered in the proper clinical situations.\n\n【74】#### **13.**\n\n【75】#### **Who Is at Risk for Mucormycosis?**\n\n【76】In a patient with a recent history of COVID-19 infection, the most critical risk factors for developing mucormycosis are uncontrolled diabetic mellitus and high-dose steroid treatment and individuals with low immunity.\n\n【77】#### **14.**\n\n【78】#### **Is There a Blood Test for Mucormycosis?**\n\n【79】Mucormycosis can not be found with any biochemical markers. Fluid culture's bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has a low yield and is only 20 % to 50 % sensitive. This infection can not be found with beta-D-glucan or galactomannan antigen tests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8df029cb-885e-4aee-87e5-0ab0dcb3a0c5", "title": "Sodium Azide Poisoning and Its Prevention", "text": "【0】Sodium Azide Poisoning and Its Prevention\nWhat Is Sodium Azide?\n---------------------\n\n【1】A swiftly acting, possibly lethal chemical called sodium azide is an odorless, white solid. When sodium azide is combined with water or acid, it quickly becomes a poisonous gas with a harsh (pungent) smell. In addition, when it comes into contact with solid metals, it transforms into a poisonous gas (hydrazoic acid). Most people are familiar with sodium azide as the substance used in car airbags. When a car hits due to an electric charge, sodium azide inside the airbag explodes and turns into nitrogen gas. Sodium azide is a chemical preservative in hospitals and laboratories for pest management in agriculture (farming). Additionally, it is used in detonators and other explosives.\n\n【2】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Experienced on Exposure to Sodium Azide?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】People who worked in laboratories were involved in the majority of reported incidents. Exposures exceeding or equal to 700 mg (10 mg/kg) cause fatal dosages. The range of nonlethal doses was 0.3 to 150 mg (0.004–2 mg/kg).\n\n【4】**Acute Symptoms:**\n\n【5】*   People exposed to sodium azide may experience any or all of the following symptoms within minutes of being exposed to it through their skin, breathing it in, or eating foods that contain it.\n    \n*   Nose discharge is caused due to gas or dust exposure.\n    \n*   Cough.\n    \n*   Loss of coordination.\n    \n*   Headache.\n    \n*   Nausea and diarrhea.\n    \n*   Rapid breathing.\n    \n*   Increased heartbeat.\n    \n*   Redness of eyes due to gas or dust exposure.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Local Anesthetic Agents in Dentistry\n    \n    Procaine - Mechanism, Indications, Contraindication, and Adverse Effects\n    \n    Ester-Type Topical Anesthetics - Mechanism of Action, Indications.\n    \n*   Restlessness.\n    \n*   Weakness in muscles.\n    \n*   Skin blisters and burns (explosion or direct skin contact).\n    \n\n【6】**Chronic Symptoms:**\n\n【7】Long-term exposure to a significant amount of sodium azide may result in these other health consequences as well:\n\n【8】*   Seizures.\n    \n*   Reduced blood pressure.\n    \n*   Mutations in genes lead to cancer risk.\n    \n*   Loss of awareness.\n    \n*   Lung damage.\n    \n*   Sluggish heartbeat.\n    \n*   Death caused by respiratory failure.\n    \n\n【9】What Safety Precautions Can Be Taken on Exposure to Sodium Cyanide?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】**Move Away from Location:**\n\n【11】*   First, leave the place where sodium azide was emitted to obtain some fresh air.\n    \n*   Get away from the location where sodium azide was discharged if it was an outdoor release. Get outside if the sodium azide emission occurs inside.\n    \n*   If exiting the sodium azide-contaminated region is not an option, stay as close to the ground as possible since the vapors ascend.\n    \n*   Emergency managers may advise one to leave the area if sodium azide is being released or to \"shelter in place\" within the building to prevent exposure to chemicals.\n    \n\n【12】**Removing the Garments:**\n\n【13】*   Take away any clothes that could have sodium azide on them right away. Any garment that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off at the torso.\n    \n*   If one is assisting someone else in taking off their clothing, try to keep their hands away from any potentially infectious places and remove the garment as fast as possible.\n    \n\n【14】**Taking a Shower:**\n\n【15】*   Wash off any sodium azide from the skin as soon as possible with lots of soap and water. People may protect themselves from any chemicals on their bodies by washing them with soap and water.\n    \n*   Rinse the eyes with water for 10 to 15 minutes if they are burning or if one experiences a blurry vision.\n    \n*   Remove any contact lenses one may be wearing and store them alongside the infected items.\n    \n*   Do not replace the contacts in eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). Wash the glasses with soap and water if one has to wear them. Once they are washed, individuals can wear spectacles.\n    \n\n【16】**Disposing of the Worn Garments:**\n\n【17】*   After washing oneself, carefully dispose of the garments into a plastic bag before throwing them away.\n    \n*   Do not touch any infected clothing or surfaces. If one cannot avoid touching contaminated parts or are unsure of their location, put on rubber gloves or use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or other similar things to place the garments in the bag.\n    \n*   Everything that comes in contact with the contaminated clothing should also be thrown in the bag.\n    \n*   Before placing it inside another plastic bag, close the first one. This garment disposal method can help protect not only themselves but others from any pollutants that may be present.\n    \n\n【18】**Call for Emergency Help:**\n\n【19】*   The emergency services or the health department will make arrangements for further disposal. Never touch plastic bags by oneself.\n    \n*   One should not induce vomiting or offer someone fluids to drink if they have consumed sodium azide.\n    \n*   Additionally, if one is certain the individual has consumed sodium azide, avoid performing mouth-to-mouth breathing during CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).\n    \n*   One might be exposed to sodium azide if they provide CPR to someone who has consumed the poison.\n    \n*   When sodium azide is consumed, the deadly gas hydrazoic acid is created when it reacts with stomach acid. To prevent exposure to the poisonous gas, separate the individual who has consumed sodium azide and remain away from the stomach contents (such as if the individuals vomit).\n    \n*   Food, water, or vomit should never be put down the drain since they might cause the drain to rupture and cause significant injury.\n    \n*   Always seek immediate medical help.\n    \n\n【20】How to Handle and Store Sodium Azide?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】*   Sodium azide can be kept in a dark, cold, dry environment away from acids with other acutely poisonous compounds.\n    \n*   Store in well-ventilated and air-tight containers.\n    \n*   It is best to keep away from places where acids, acid gas, or heat are produced. Sodium azide should be stored away from metals, acids, carbon disulfide, bromine, chromyl chloride, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrazine, and dimethyl sulfate because contact with acids creates the very deadly gas hydrazoic acid. The word \" Toxic\" should be written on both the primary and backup containers.\n    \n*   In plumbing systems, sodium azide will react with metals like silver, gold, lead, copper, brass, or solder to create explosive metal azides. The spatula can be made of stainless steel.\n    \n*   Sodium azide may become statically charged and dissipates quickly with fume hood airflow.\n    \n*   Sodium azide rapidly hydrolyzes in water when combined with water or acid to generate hydrazoic acid, a very poisonous and explosive gas. When moving stuff to the desired container, one should be extremely cautious.\n    \n\n【22】**Conclusion**\n\n【23】There are several ways to be exposed to azide, which can cause various symptoms and illness severity. The effectiveness of treatment can be equivocal and is heavily influenced by the injury's nature, location, and severity. The best action is to prevent or minimize exposure, particularly among high-risk individuals.\n\n【24】Article Resources\n\n【25】*   Facts About Sodium Azide  \n    https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sodiumazide/basics/facts.asp\n*   Sodium Azide Poisoning  \n    https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sodiumazide/tsd.asp\n*   Sodium azide poisoning: a narrative review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349855/\n*   Human health effects of sodium azide exposure: a literature review and analysis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12851150/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "f4826234-ff1b-4e1e-86f7-d69cc5b574d6", "title": "Actinic Purpura - A Dermal Disorder", "text": "【0】Actinic Purpura - A Dermal Disorder\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Actinic purpura is a dermal disorder affecting the connective tissues. Actinic purpura occurs due to chronic or prolonged sun exposure. Bateman first described actinic purpura in 1818. Actinic purpura was also known as Bateman senile purpura or bateman disease. It is observed that actinic purpura usually affects adult people. The signs of actinic purpura are characterized by dark purple-colored patches in the sun-exposed areas. The most commonly involved areas of actinic purpura are the hands and the upper extremities. The symptoms of actinic purpura are usually resolved in three weeks.\n\n【2】What Is Actinic Purpura?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Actinic purpura is also known as solar purpura, bateman purpura, bateman disease, bateman senile purpura and senile purpura. Actinic purpura arises due to chronic exposure and causes abnormalities in the dermal connective tissues.\n\n【4】Sun-exposed areas include:\n\n【5】*   The external surface of the forearm.\n    \n*   The back region of the hands.\n    \n*   The neck region.\n    \n*   The face.\n    \n\n【6】Actinic purpura has no gender predilection.\n\n【7】What Are the Causes of Actinic Purpura?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【8】Long-term exposure or prolonged exposure to the sun causes actinic purpura. Actinic or solar purpura occurs due to the sun's or ultraviolet or UV rays' effects on the skin, causing ultraviolet dermal atrophy. People with fair skin and adults are more susceptible to actinic purpura. Extravasation of blood into the dermis layer causes the actinic purpura. Chronic sun exposure causes skin atrophy, and the minor blood vessels become fragile, causing bleeding into the dermis layer of the skin. In addition, the skin is sensitive to minor trauma and other similar forces causing bleeding. Skin atrophy may also occur as a result of aging and a history of prolonged sun exposure.\n\n【9】The most common causes of actinic purpura are given below.\n\n【10】*   Chronic sun exposure.\n    \n*   Ultraviolet rays or UV rays exposure.\n    \n*   Skin atrophy.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Laser-Assisted Drug Delivery - Indications, Challenges and Safety Protocol\n    \n    Cutaneous Manifestations of Hematological Disorders: A Detailed Glossary\n    \n*   Photo aging.\n    \n*   Dermatoporosis.\n    \n*   Minor trauma or other shearing forces.\n    \n*   Fragile blood vessels.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Signs of Actinic Purpura?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】The signs of actinic purpura are the dark purple-colored patches and macules. The edges of the patches are irregular, and the commonly involved areas are the forearm, hands, face, neck, and legs. The lesions of actinic purpura are usually present with dark purple macules. Extensive ecchymosis is present in actinic purpura conditions, and the lesion size ranges from 1 to 4 cm in diameter.\n\n【13】Symptoms like pruritus and tenderness are absent in actinic purpura. Sometimes the macules of actinic purpura are asymptomatic. The surrounding skin is inelastic and thin-pigmented. Other symptoms like wrinkling, pseudo stellate scars, lentigines, actinic keratosis, and the skin appearing with a sallow yellow hue are seen. Symptoms of actinic purpura last for three weeks, and they resolve spontaneously after three weeks. Ecchymosis affects the cosmesis. Actinic purpura has no severe complications.\n\n【14】The signs of actinic purpura are mentioned below.\n\n【15】*   Dark purple patches and macules.\n    \n*   Extensive ecchymosis.\n    \n*   Lesion is 1 cm- 4 cm in diameter.\n    \n*   Pruritus is absent.\n    \n*   Tenderness is absent.\n    \n*   Pigmented and inelastic surrounding skin.\n    \n*   Photoaging symptoms lie in wrinkling, lentigines, and actinic keratosis present.\n    \n*   Sallow yellow-hued skin.\n    \n\n【16】What Is the Diagnosis of Actinic Purpura?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Diagnosis of actinic purpura is mainly the clinical and histological findings. Clinic examination involves the proper history and physical inspection of the patient. Hemosiderin deposits are indicated with Perl's stain. The coagulation analysis is required in rare cases, and the results show no abnormalities.\n\n【18】*   A proper history of the patient, which includes sun exposure.\n    \n*   Symptoms like dark purple patches with irregular patches are examined during the physical examination.\n    \n*   The biopsy is done.\n    \n\n【19】Histopathological findings of actinic purpura will show the following features.\n\n【20】*   Thin epidermis.\n    \n*   The dermis is altered.\n    \n*   Collagen fibers are reduced.\n    \n*   Elastic fibers are abnormal.\n    \n*   Extravasation of blood cells.\n    \n*   Rarely neutrophilic infiltration.\n    \n*   No inflammatory changes.\n    \n*   No abnormalities in the coagulation analysis.\n    \n*   Perl's stains mark the hemosiderin pigments.\n    \n\n【21】What Is the Treatment for Actinic Purpura?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The symptoms of actinic purpura are spontaneously resolved within three weeks. Actinic purpura does not require any specific treatment. Prevention or limiting sun exposure, ultraviolet rays, or UV rays will reduce or avoid the incidence of actinic purpura. Actinic purpura is a benign condition. Prevention of skin from chronic sun exposure or ultraviolet rays, UV rays can be done with sun protection factor or SPF which is greater than 50, containing sunscreen.\n\n【23】Wearing clothes with long sleeves and pants will also reduce the chances of acquiring actinic purpura. The skin should be protected from ultraviolet rays A or UVA, and ultraviolet B or UVB should be done by applying sunscreen in sun-exposed areas. A derivative of vitamin A called tretinoin, or retinoic acid, will reverse skin damage due to sun or other artificial sources. The topical application of tretinoin improves collagen and elastic fiber production. Photo aging effects can be resolved with laser therapy. Skin dryness is treated with skin moisturizers.\n\n【24】The various treatment measures for treating actinic purpura are given below.\n\n【25】*   Reducing or avoiding chronic sun exposure.\n    \n*   Avoid ultraviolet rays or UV rays exposure.\n    \n*   Sunscreen containing a sun protection factor of more than 50 is applied to sun-exposed areas.\n    \n*   Long sleeve pants and clothing can be done.\n    \n*   Vitamin A or retinoids promotes collagen and elastic fiber production.\n    \n*   Topical application of tretinoin.\n    \n*   Laser therapy to treat photoaging effects.\n    \n*   Skin moisturizers to treat skin xerosis.\n    \n\n【26】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Actinic Purpura?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The symptoms of actinic purpura are similar to other dermal conditions. However, the distinguishing features will lead to differential diagnosis and help avoid misdiagnosis.\n\n【28】The differential diagnosis of actinic purpura is mentioned below.\n\n【29】*   Purpura, steroid induced purpura.\n    \n*   Physical trauma.\n    \n*   Side effects of anticoagulants.\n    \n*   Vitamin C deficiency or scurvy.\n    \n*   Palpable purpura, with bleeding and inflammation.\n    \n*   Amyloidosis, primary systemic amyloidosis in particular.\n    \n*   Psychogenic purpura.\n    \n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Actinic or solar purpura is a benign dermal connective tissue disorder due to chronic sun exposure or other ultraviolet or UV rays. Actinic purpura is characterized by dark purple patches and macules on the sun-exposed areas such as hands, face, forearm, neck, and legs affecting older people. Symptoms are usually resolved within three weeks. Actinic purpura does not require any specific treatment. Derivatives of vitamin A or retinoids will reverse the skin damage and promote collagen and elastic fiber production. Photoaging effects can be improved with laser therapy. However, the prognosis of actinic purpura is excellent. Limiting or avoiding sun exposure will reduce or prevent the incidence of actinic purpura.\n\n【32】Article Resources\n\n【33】*   NIH - Actinic Purpura  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448130/\n*   NIH - Treatment of Actinic Purpura  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605207/\n*   Derm Net - Senile purpura  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/senile-purpura", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Breastfeeding maintains maternal health and prevents long-term disease conditions. It is proven that breastfeeding over a period of time significantly reduces the maternal risk of developing chronic diseases. However, its association with maternal mortality has not been widely discussed. This article helps in assessing the correlation between the duration of breastfeeding and its influence on maternal mortality.\n\n【2】What Is the Optimal Breastfeeding Duration?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Longer duration of breastfeeding enhances the benefits of lactation by improving the baby’s survival, growth, development, and long-term health. Standardized guidelines have been formulated by worldwide health organizations to ensure optimal breastfeeding duration.\n\n【4】*   The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that infants should be exclusively breastfed during the first six months of their neonatal life.\n    \n*   After the initial six months, breastfeeding should be continued along with the introduction of solid complementary foods up to or above 12 months of age.\n    \n*   The American Academy of Pediatrics as well as the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with continued breastfeeding up to or more than two years of age along with appropriate solid foods.\n    \n*   Woman's lifetime breastfeeding duration including all consecutive child births are also collectively calculated to assess the duration of breastfeeding.\n    \n*   Lactating mothers should breastfeed their babies for a minimum of at least one year because longer breastfeeding duration provides greater protection from certain illnesses and also reduces the risk of long-term diseases in children.\n    \n*   Greater the months and years a woman breastfeeds, which covers combined breastfeeding of all her children greatly increase its benefits on maternal health.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Malarial Nephropathy - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Breastfeeding Techniques - Recommendations, Techniques, and Advantages.\n    \n    Coumadin-Induced Skin Necrosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n    \n*   According to the World Health Organization, women breastfeeding below 24 months per infant is considered suboptimal breastfeeding.\n    \n\n【5】How Do Lactating Mothers Benefit From Breastfeeding?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Numerous scientific data are available to elicit the benefits of breastfeeding in a child’s growth and development. Similarly, lactation and breastfeeding improve the mother’s health, protect her against certain illnesses, and promote long-term wellness. This perspective of maternal health is often poorly studied. Recently, research and clinical studies are conducted to study the influence of breastfeeding on maternal well-being. Some of the proven benefits of breastfeeding on maternal health are as follows -\n\n【7】*   Breastfeeding lowers the risk of developing certain types of cancers such as breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n    \n*   It prevents the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, and type 2 diabetes.\n    \n*   Breastfeeding reduces maternal cardiovascular risk factors by preventing high blood pressure.\n    \n*   Longer duration of breastfeeding effectively reduces long-term cardiovascular complications such as hypertensive diseases and myocardial infarction.\n    \n*   Increased episodes of breastfeeding contribute to postpartum (after childbirth) weight loss.\n    \n*   Breastfeeding contributes to positive maternal mental well-being and reduces postpartum depression.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Lifestyle Factors That Influence Breastfeeding and Maternal Health?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Breastfeeding is not an isolated factor that influences maternal health. Lifestyle conditions have a greater impact on breastfeeding duration and also women’s well being particularly after childbirth. Some of the lifestyle factors that affect both breastfeeding and female mortality are as follows -\n\n【10】*   Cigarette smoking increases the mortality risk in women. In addition, it also reduces the lactation duration leading to early cessation of breastfeeding.\n    \n*   Appropriate nutrition is essential for longer breastfeeding duration.\n    \n*   Lack of physical activity eventually leads to being overweight or obese which increases mortality risk.\n    \n*   Maternal age also significantly influences both breastfeeding duration and maternal mortality.\n    \n\n【11】How Does Breastfeeding Reduce Mortality Risk in Females?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】From the scientific evidence, it is observed that this inverse relationship between breastfeeding duration and female mortality risk is attributed to the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy followed by lactation and breastfeeding. The following biological factors that occur during breastfeeding help in reducing the mortality risk in females.\n\n【13】*   Hormonal changes and subsequent fat accumulation occur during various stages of pregnancy that are required for fetal development and preparation for lactation.\n    \n*   This increased energy storage is needed along the course of childbirth and is characterized by increased visceral fat deposition.\n    \n*   Gradual increase in fat increases insulin resistance and impairs insulin production causing elevated circulating lipid levels that are considered risk factors for various metabolic disorders, and long-term illnesses.\n    \n*   Lactation and breastfeeding play a crucial role in reverting these risk factors back to normal by mobilizing stored fat.\n    \n*   Increased duration of breastfeeding helps to reestablish glucose homeostasis and regulate insulin secretion.\n    \n*   Lipid metabolism is promoted after delivery, and breastfeeding further improves glucose metabolism and enhances pancreatic beta-cell activity.\n    \n*   Continuous breastfeeding and lactation establish favorable lipid profiles, enhance postpartum weight loss and reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases.\n    \n*   Thus, breastfeeding plays a key role in reestablishing normal maternal metabolic functioning.\n    \n*   Breastfeeding increases metabolic expenditure and thereby reduces the risk of developing long-term diseases such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer and thereby eventually reduces the risk of female mortality in later stages of life.\n    \n\n【14】What Are the Consequences of Suboptimal Breastfeeding?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Suboptimal breastfeeding refers to the practice of breastfeeding which falls short of the optimal medical recommendations suggested by worldwide organizations. Inadequate breastfeeding has a negative impact on both maternal as well as children’s well-being. Recent studies show that nearly 80 % of maternal mortality correlates to suboptimal breastfeeding. Some of the ill effects of suboptimal breastfeeding on maternal health are as follows -\n\n【16】*   Increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n    \n*   Inadequate breastfeeding or premature cessation leads to the early development of type 2 diabetes in women.\n    \n*   There is a higher risk of developing maternal hypertension and heart problems such as myocardial infarction in the later years among women who breastfeed their babies less than the recommended duration.\n    \n*   Partial breastfeeding leads to obesity and increases the risk of premenopausal (at an early age) ovarian cancer.\n    \n*   Suboptimal breastfeeding, particularly in western countries, is currently associated with excessive and premature maternal deaths.\n    \n*   Unnecessary early cessation of breastfeeding increases postpartum depression.\n    \n\n【17】**Conclusion**\n\n【18】Longer breastfeeding duration is protective against several diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer, diabetes, and heart problems. Inadequate breastfeeding leads to the development of maternal health problems. To summarize, lactating women who have a longer breastfeeding duration have a substantially lower risk of mortality.\n\n【19】Article Resources\n\n【20】*   NCBI-Breastfeeding and maternal health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4670483/\n*   NCBI-Suboptimal breastfeeding in the United States: Maternal and pediatric health outcomes and costs  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6866210/\n*   Breastfeeding  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Despite the decline in gastric cancer cases over the past decades, it remains one of the most common and deadly cancers. The high death rate of gastric cancer can be attributed to the late initial diagnosis. Gastric dysplasia (the presence of abnormal cells within a tissue) is a premalignant (before cancer) lesion and the final stage in gastric carcinogenesis (cancer formation). It is a marker of an increased probability or risk of malignant change in the stomach. Its clinical importance was underestimated before its association with gastric cancer. Hence, early identification, management, and follow-up of gastric dysplasia are essential for the detection and prevention of gastric cancer.\n\n【2】What Are the Clinical Features and Course of Dysplasia in the Stomach?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The prevalence of gastric dysplasia is about four percent in Western countries and 20 percent in developing countries. Patients with gastric dysplasia are male and younger than gastric cancer patients. Gastric dysplasia lesions can be found anywhere in the stomach. Gastric dysplasia is low-grade (LGD; mild abnormal features) and high-grade (HGD; severe abnormal features).\n\n【4】Both low grade dysplasia and high grade dysplasia can progress to cancer. Hence, the risk of malignant change increases with the grade of dysplasia. However, the real risk of progression for dysplasia remains unclear. Various studies have demonstrated that patients with high grade dysplasia are at high risk of progression to carcinoma. The rate of malignant change of high grade dysplasia is about 60 to 85 percent over four years. Low grade dysplasia has a lower risk of cancer progression as compared to high grade dysplasia. Moreover, low grade dysplasia has been documented to regress in about 75 percent of cases.\n\n【5】Related Topics\n\n【6】* * *\n\n【7】What is the significance of an elevated CA-19 tumor marker?\n\n【8】Chronic Lung Disease and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【9】Does low-grade dysplasia require frequent follow-up?\n\n【10】What Are the Conditions That Lead to Gastric Dysplasia?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Many stomach diseases and lesions contain dysplastic contents. However, the clinically important ones are listed below.\n\n【12】*   **Atrophic Gastritis (AG):** AG is a chronic inflammatory condition and thinning of the stomach lining. The main features are inflammation, atrophy (decrease in size) of gastric glands, and metaplasia (altered cell type). These changes are more commonly found in the antrum (part of the stomach). Patients with atrophic gastritis are at increased risk of cancer. However, the correct risk measurement is undetermined.\n    \n*   **Gastric (Peptic) Ulcers:** Peptic ulcers (stomach sores) occur in the stomach lining. The incidence of cancer developing in a peptic ulcer is debated for many years. There are two essential criteria for the diagnosis: definite evidence of a pre-existing ulcer and malignant change at the edge of the ulcer. Furthermore, it is essential to remember that chronic (long-standing) ulcers and cancer may coexist in the stomach.\n    \n*   **Pernicious Anemia (PA):** PA is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes a deficiency in vitamin B12 absorption, resulting in B12 deficiency and anemia. Gastric cancer is three to four times more common in patients with PA than in the general population. Despite being less common, pernicious anemia is a classic risk factor for gastric cancer.\n    \n*   **Gastric Polyps:** Polypoid lesions of the stomach (masses of cells) have malignant potential. Polypoid lesions showing dysplasia (called adenomas) have a significant capacity for malignant change. Most gastric adenomas develop based on atrophic gastritis and metaplasia.\n    \n\n【13】How Is the Diagnosis of Dysplasia in the Stomach Made?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Mostly, gastric dysplasia is asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during screening examinations. Hence, the two modalities for gastric cancer screening are upper endoscopy and contrast radiography.\n\n【15】*   **Endoscopic Gastric Cancer Screening:** Endoscopy is a non-surgical technique used to examine the digestive tract. Gastric cancer screening is done in countries with high rates of gastric cancer. Recently, a study reported a 30 percent reduction in gastric cancer deaths via endoscopic screening. Further, various studies suggest the best cost-effective strategy for detecting early gastric cancer as endoscopy. Also, endoscopy is more sensitive (a positive case) and specific (a negative case) than barium radiographic studies.\n    \n*   **Barium Swallow:** The barium swallow study is a contrast-enhanced radiographic study used to assess the structural characteristics of the esophagus and stomach. Barium radiography can identify malignant gastric ulcers, infiltrating lesions, and early gastric cancers. In gastric dysplasia and early gastric cancer, the response of a barium study is about 14 percent. The barium swallow is non-invasive and requires only radiographic capability and a contrast medium. Hence, it is useful despite the current wide availability of computed tomography (CT).\n    \n\n【16】How Is Dysplasia in the Stomach Managed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Factors designing management guidelines include understanding the biological process. As a result, recent molecular studies support the microscopic assessment that gastric dysplasia is a cancerous lesion. In addition, follow-up studies have also established risks and time frames for the development of gastric cancer.\n\n【18】High-grade dysplasia lesions require endoscopic resection (a minimally invasive surgery for removing gastric dysplasia and cancer using an endoscope) due to the potential for cancer progression and the coexistence of cancer. Hence, endoscopic resection can be curative. Furthermore, with advances in endoscopic localization and staging of cancer, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) can offer a non-surgical cure. EMR removes precancerous, early-stage cancer, or other abnormal lesions from the stomach. However, modern interventional endoscopic procedures are not available outside specialist centers. Hence, their treatment role and availability need to be defined.\n\n【19】In contrast, few guidelines regarding the management of low-grade dysplasia are available. Low-grade dysplasia has a lower risk of malignant transformation. Therefore, some investigators recommend yearly endoscopic surveillance with repeat biopsy (removal of stomach tissue) for low-grade dysplasia. Still, repeated endoscopic examination with biopsy can impose a physical, psychological, and financial burden on the patient. However, endoscopic resection is less invasive than surgery. Endoscopic treatment or surgical treatment is recommended for high-grade dysplasia. In addition, endoscopic treatment or follow-up is recommended for low-grade dysplasia. The choice of treatment depends on the size of the lesion, depth of invasion, and other factors (patient age and comorbidities).\n\n【20】Endoscopically unclear lesions should undergo follow-up within one year after diagnosis. In addition, endoscopic resection should be considered for patients only with endoscopically defined high-grade dysplasia. Moreover, the guidelines highlight that the absence of dysplasia during follow-up biopsies does not exclude the progression to cancer. Finally, a thorough evaluation of the entire stomach should be done, and any abnormalities biopsied.\n\n【21】**Conclusion**\n\n【22】The importance of gastric dysplasia is stressed because of its close association with gastric cancer development. However, despite the latest clinical data and use of upper endoscopy, challenges persist regarding diagnosis and management. Due to the significant diagnostic discrepancies between biopsy and endoscopic resection, the latter should be considered for the diagnosis and management of gastric dysplasia. Further, the frequency of the follow-up is recommended every three to 12 months during the first year.\n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Diagnosis and management of gastric dysplasia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773732/\n*   Gastric epithelial dysplasia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1727726/\n*   Precancerous conditions and epithelial dysplasia in the stomach.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1146204/\n*   Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of gastric dysplasia and early cancer: Current evidence and what the future may hold  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8384753/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is mainly found to be responsible for causing pneumococcal infections, digestive tract infections, and common flu symptoms in human beings. Medical researchers have mainly identified four genotypes since the discovery of the bocavirus in human beings which include HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4. The genotype HBoV1 was first isolated from the secretions of the respiratory tract by scientists. Other strains of the virus were primarily found in stool specimens.\n\n【2】Human bocavirus is mainly seen in children worldwide. Bocavirus is often found in the respiratory secretions of sick children along with other respiratory viruses. Bocavirus may cause infections on its own or may worsen other viral infections. It can mostly cause disease in individuals suffering from underlying lung defects or having poor immunity.\n\n【3】**What Is the Structure of Bocavirus?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】Bocavirus is a very small, nonenveloped single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus. It belongs to the family of Parvoviridae viruses. There are four main genes labeled according to their functional properties. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is responsible for the transcription of genes. It is a DNA-binding protein. NP1 is also a nonstructural protein. It is a protein with unknown functional properties. The other two proteins are capsid proteins which include viral protein 1 (VP1) and viral protein 2 (VP2).\n\n【5】How Does Bocavirus Infection Spread?\n------------------------------------\n\n【6】Most infections caused by bocavirus are pneumococcal and associated with the genome HBoV1. The disease symptoms are commonly seen in pediatric patients between the age group of 6 to 24 months. Adults may also get infected by bocavirus but the symptoms are much less likely evident. The virus is mainly transmitted from the patient’s nose, throat, and mouth via respiratory secretions. Bocaviruses can also be transmitted by the stool of the infected person having a gastrointestinal infection but it is less common.\n\n【7】What Is the Incubation Period for Bocavirus?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The incubation period for bocavirus is not known. Asymptomatic children may shed the bocavirus for several weeks. Therefore, it is not possible to determine when a sick patient gets infected with the virus. Hence, the incubation period cannot be determined. The contagious period of bocavirus is not yet clear. Both healthy and sick people can shed bocavirus on and off for several weeks in pneumococcal secretions.\n\n【9】Related Topics\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】My 4 month old baby is suffering from loose motion even after having Cefixime.

Most often, the prodromal symptoms appear as a cold and cough accompanied by high temperature, and a flowy or running nose. Diarrhea may also occur in patients suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. Wheezing sounds while breathing and bronchiolitis (chest infection) may also be reported by patients. This can further progress to pneumonia.\n\n【19】Breathlessness (dyspnea), bluish discoloration of the skin and lips (cyanosis), and low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are other signs and symptoms experienced by people in serious conditions.\n\n【20】How to Diagnose a Bocavirus Infection?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【21】Healthcare professionals usually diagnose bocavirus infection by carrying out polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) in nose or throat specimens, coughed-up phlegm, or in stool specimens. Mostly, it is done for research purposes only by healthcare researchers.\n\n【22】Polymerain chain reaction testing for viruses in respiratory secretions is not easily available in clinics or even in well-equipped hospitals. These tests are extremely sensitive and costly. Therefore, healthcare professionals usually do not order PCR testing except in serious life-threatening conditions where the diagnosis is unclear.\n\n【23】What Is the Treatment for a Bocavirus Infection?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The treatment for bocavirus infection is usually supportive at this particular time. No known antiviral treatment is helpful for this viral infection to date. Over-the-counter drugs and medicines may be used by the patients to lower fever and treat sore throat. A healthcare professional may usually suggest drinking lots of fluids, taking plenty of rest, and preventing the disease from spreading by staying in an isolated room until the symptoms disappear. There are no home remedies to treat bocavirus infection. Only over-the-counter medicines and supportive therapy is available to date.\n\n【25】**How Long a Bocavirus Infection Can Last?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Not enough information is available on bocavirus by scientific researchers to determine how long the infection can last in human beings. It is usually seen that the symptoms can last for almost a week. It may also last for as long as a typical pneumococcal viral infection usually lasts. In some cases, the infection may last for several weeks also.\n\n【27】**What Is the Prognosis of Bocavirus Infection?**\n\n【28】The prognosis is mostly good for most bocavirus infections in humans. However, people with a poor or weak immune response or suffering from chronic lung diseases can develop complications from the bocavirus.\n\n【29】How to Prevent a Bocavirus Infection?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【30】Young children that are exposed to group childcare have a high chance of acquiring the viral infection. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent the transmission of the virus in these children. Good personal hygiene along with clean surroundings helps to limit the spread of bocavirus in infants, young children, and adults. The children should be taught to sneeze or cough into a tissue or handkerchief. They should also be instructed to frequently use hand sanitizer and wash their hands using handwash once they come home. The eating and drinking utensils should not be shared in group meetings.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】Bocavirus is a newly discovered viral infection commonly found in young children and can cause respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infections. The infection usually spread through coughing or sneezing. There is no proper treatment for the infection. Only supportive care is available. In rare cases, the infectious disease can become fatal. So it is important to consult a physician as soon as you develop the infection. Various measures need to be taken to prevent the disease from spreading in young children. More research is required to establish proper diagnostic and treatment aids for this viral infection.\n\n【33】Article Resources\n\n【34】*   Human Bocavirus Infections in Hospitalized Children and Adults  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600186/\n*   Human bocavirus: Current knowledge and future challenges  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075545/\n*   Persistence of Human Bocavirus 1 in Tonsillar Germinal Centers and Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Infection  \n    https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.03132-20", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

When your body loses control over maintaining the temperature, it could pull you to the emergency room, making you suffer a heat stroke. It usually results from prolonged heat exposure and working under heavy temperatures. When the body heat increases rapidly, our body loses its control, and the sweat mechanism fails to support, leading to this medical emergency.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Heat Stroke?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】The reason for a heat stroke, without any confusion, is anything that does not let the body cool itself.\n\n【4】**Working Under the Sun for a Longer Period:** People who work outdoors under the sun suffer heat strokes often. As the heat exposure is continuous, even when our body tries to cope and cool itself, it fails, leading to heat stroke. They are common in the elderly, and people suffering from long-term medical conditions, otherwise weak people. It is called a non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS).\n\n【5】**Increased Physical Exertion in a Hot Climate:** This primarily affects younger individuals who get involved in strenuous exercises in hot climates, as it increases the body temperature. Certain people survive and cope with hot temperatures well, whereas some have difficulty coping; the latter are the most prone to heat stroke. This type of heat stroke is named exertional heat stroke (EHS).\n\n【6】Apart from these two, other certain factors that trigger heat stroke, such as,\n\n【7】*   Wearing multiple layers of clothing.\n    \n*   Wearing winter clothes during summer or in humid regions.\n    \n*   Insufficient hydration in the body.\n    \n*   Alcohol abuse, infection, sepsis (body reaction to an infection that accidentally damages its tissue), etc.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Common Illnesses During Summer\n    \n    Aspirin - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n    \n    Fever: a Friend or Foe\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of a Heat Stroke?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Suffering a heat stroke shows up as the following symptoms such as;\n\n【10】*   A peak in the body temperature, which is usually above 103 ℉.\n    \n*   Hot, red, and flushed skin.\n    \n*   Rapid pulse and heartbeat.\n    \n*   Fast breathing.\n    \n*   Nausea.\n    \n*   Confusion, slurred speech, continuous irritation, disorientation, etc.\n    \n*   Headache, dizziness, followed by fainting, and loss of consciousness.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Common Risk Factors for Heat Stroke?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   **Older Adults:** The incidence of heat stroke is more common among the elderly who live and work under the intense sun in villages and those who live in less ventilated homes in cities.\n    \n*   **Certain Habits:** Experts state that alcohol and sun are a dangerous mix. Habits such as alcohol abuse increase the risk of heat stroke. Alcohol tends to slow down the gland called the hypothalamus (a brain part), which regulates body temperature. Also, it is a diuretic that helps the body remove its water content, which proves its absence of role in heat stroke.\n    \n*   **Hot Temperatures:** Working under the hot sun or increased physical exertion can increase the risk of heat strokes. Sports activities, military training, etc., could cause heat stroke in younger adults.\n    \n*   **Absence of Air Conditioning:** Air conditioners efficiently manage hot climates; their absence worsens the room's temperature, increasing the risk of heat strokes.\n    \n*   **Medications:** Some medications, such as antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, antidepressants, etc., can keep your body far from hydration, causing heat stroke.\n    \n*   **Medical Conditions:** Certain underlying diseases involving the heart, lungs, and other organs, being obese, and having a previous history of heat strokes can increase the risk of heat stroke.\n    \n\n【13】What Is First-aid for Heat Stroke?\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Heat stroke that prolongs for more than half an hour is an emergency and needs medical intervention immediately.\n    \n*   Call for an ambulance and stay with the person suffering a heat stroke.\n    \n*   Move the person experiencing heat stroke to a cool and shady area.\n    \n*   Refrain from giving them anything to drink.\n    \n*   Aid the patient to cool down the body temperature by using cold towels and giving them a cold bath.\n    \n*   Avail the patient with free air or use a fan to provide air.\n    \n*   If the person is young and has suffered heat stroke due to strenuous exercise, placing ice on different body parts and immersing them in ice-cold water helps. But ice water is contraindicated in older patients, children, and those with chronic diseases.\n    \n*   Remove or change thick clothing to minimize body heat.\n    \n\n【15】How To Prevent a Heat Stroke?\n-----------------------------\n\n【16】Surviving summers efficiently itself can reduce the risk and prevent heat stroke. The various preventive measures for heat stroke include;\n\n【17】*   Drink plenty of fluids such as water and fresh juices to keep the body hydrated. Avoid liquids rich in sugar.\n    \n*   Wear appropriate clothing such as; lightweight, thin clothes, minimize the layers or, if possible, wear clothes made of breathable fabrics.\n    \n*   Apply sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30+. Make sure to apply sunscreen on the other body parts and not just the face.\n    \n*   Wear sunglasses.\n    \n*   If any of the symptoms mentioned earlier start to show up, make sure to move to a shady place before the symptoms worsen.\n    \n*   Schedule the outdoor activities and game practices to early mornings or late evenings.\n    \n*   Do not stay in confined spaces such as rooms without proper ventilation or locked cars for an extended period.\n    \n*   Avoid hot, heavy, and spicy meals. Eat foods that minimize body heat and keep you hydrated for hours.\n    \n*   Try staying in air-conditioned rooms during the peak heat hours.\n    \n*   Caffeine and alcohol intake makes the body lose more water and worsens the condition. So, avoiding both would be a great help.\n    \n*   If you cannot tolerate a hot climate, try to stay away from such areas.\n    \n*   Take cold or normal water baths and avoid hot water baths during summers.\n    \n\n【18】What Are the Complications Associated With Heat Stroke?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Heat stroke can be life-threatening if necessary care is not provided. It can affect various vital organs, including the heart, lungs, kidney, brain, etc. Doctors recommend taking a few blood tests, urine tests, kidney function tests, etc., to rule out dehydration and treat accordingly. If the treatment is delayed or not sought, it can lead to death.\n\n【20】**Conclusion:**\n\n【21】Though framed as a medical emergency, heat stroke can be managed easily using conservative management and home care when diagnosed right. If susceptible to heat strokes, taking the necessary precautions during summers helps bid bye to heat strokes. The precautions to be taken are easy and helpful in various other ways.\n\n【22】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【23】* * *\n\n【24】#### **1.**\n\n【25】#### **How to Manage a Heat Stroke?**\n\n【26】The treatment objective for heat stroke is to minimize the body temperature using various cooling techniques such as;  \n\\- Shift the person to a shady or a cool place.  \n\\- Immerse the whole body in cold water.  \n\\- Pack the body with a cold blanket or ice packs.  \n\\- Spray or splash ice water onto the body and provide proper ventilation by using a fan.  \n\\- If the symptoms do not subside in 30 minutes or so, seek medical help immediately.\n\n【27】#### **2.**\n\n【28】#### **What Is the Healing Period for a Heat Stroke?**\n\n【29】Recovery from a heat stroke entirely depends on the severity of heat stroke and the involvement of the internal organs. The treatment prognosis varies with the severity. For minimal symptoms and no internal damage, it takes one to two days of hospitalization. Whereas, in cases of severe heat stroke with organ involvement, it can take up to a year.\n\n【30】#### **3.**\n\n【31】#### **How Does a Heat Stroke Vary From Heat Exhaustion?**\n\n【32】\\- Though both these conditions are caused due to heat, heat stroke is a medical emergency in which the internal body temperature exceeds the normal range, while heat exhaustion happens due to excessive loss of the body’s water and salt through sweat as a result of which heat exhaustion is mostly accompanied by dehydration.  \n\\- Heat stroke requires immediate medical support, whereas heat exhaustion can be mostly managed with home care.  \n\\- The most important difference in treating both these conditions is that a person going through heat exhaustion should be provided water and fluids, whereas, in heat stroke, it is strictly not advisable.\n\n【33】#### **4.**\n\n【34】#### **What Happens During a Heat Stroke?**\n\n【35】Heat stroke is a condition that is caused due to heat. In a heat stroke, the body fails to have control over its temperature, which leads to a shoot up in the body temperature and failure of the sweat mechanism, thereby causing symptoms such as rapid pulse and heartbeat, sudden rise in body temperature, rapid breathing, headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness, etc.\n\n【36】#### **5.**\n\n【37】#### **What Is the Major Cause of Heat Stroke?**\n\n【38】Heat strokes are more common when the temperature is hotter than usual, that is, in summers. The major cause of a heat stroke is body overheating due to continuous exposure to the sun for a longer period of time and over-exerting the body during hot temperatures.\n\n【39】#### **6.**\n\n【40】#### **Is It Safe to Give Water to a Person Experiencing Heat Stroke?**\n\n【41】No, it is not advisable to give water to a person experiencing a heat stroke as the water might accidentally enter the airways, thereby reaching the lungs, which could lead to complications.\n\n【42】#### **7.**\n\n【43】#### **How Far Can the Body Temperature Go in a Heat Stroke?**\n\n【44】The body temperature rises as high as 106 ℉ or more in less than 15 minutes or so in a person experiencing heat stroke.\n\n【45】#### **8.**\n\n【46】#### **How to Manage a Heat Stroke Headache?**\n\n【47】\\- Shift to a shady and cold place.  \n\\- Do cold compress.  \nThese can usually ease a heat stroke-related headache. But when severe medical help should be sought.\n\n【48】#### **9.**\n\n【49】#### **How to Identify Heat Stroke?**\n\n【50】Heat stroke can be ruled out by spotting the following signs and symptoms;  \n\\- High body temperature, probably more than 103 ℉.  \n\\- Rapid pulse and heartbeat.  \n\\- Sudden rise in body temperature.  \n\\- Rapid breathing.  \n\\- Headache.  \n\\- Nausea.  \n\\- Dizziness.  \n\\- Confusion.  \n\\- Slurred speech.  \n\\- Loss of consciousness, etc.\n\n【51】#### **10.**\n\n【52】#### **What Is the Emergency Care for a Heat Stroke?**\n\n【53】The emergency care for a person experiencing a heat stroke includes;  \n\\- Shift the person to a shady or a cool place.  \n\\- Call for an ambulance.  \n\\- Stay with the person.  \n\\- Immerse the whole body in cold water.  \n\\- Pack the body with a cold blanket or ice packs.  \n\\- Spray or splash ice water onto the body and provide proper ventilation by using a fan.  \n\\- Remove heavy or multiple layers of clothing.  \n\\- Monitor the person’s temperature, airway, breathing, etc.\n\n【54】Article Resources\n\n【55】*   Warning Signs and Symptoms of Heat-Related Illness  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/warning.html\n*   Heat Stress - Heat Related Illness  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#:~:text=Heat%20stroke%20is%20the%20most,is%20unable%20to%20cool%20down\n*   Heatstroke  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20353581", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "90cb5402-accf-4a44-8f37-94a17ecc2a23", "title": "Renal Glycosuria - Pathology, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Renal Glycosuria - Pathology, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The term glycosuria indicates the presence of simple sugars such as glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, etc., in the urine. Kidneys play an important role in filtering the blood through which the excess sugars, if present in the blood, will be eliminated through the urine. The renal tubules play an important role in reabsorbing the sugars as well as excreting them if they are in excess amounts. But in cases of diseases or disorders affecting the kidney, especially the tubules, it would affect normal functioning resulting in excessive excretion of sugar in the urine despite normal or low blood sugar levels. Renal glycosuria is one of the rare conditions.\n\n【2】What Is Renal Glycosuria?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Renal glycosuria is a rare condition that is characterized by the excessive excretion of sugar in the urine. Renal glycosuria can occur even though the blood glucose levels are normal or lower than the normal range.\n\n【4】**What Are the Other Terminologies Used to Define Renal Glycosuria?**\n\n【5】The other synonyms of renal glycosuria include:\n\n【6】*   Benign glycosuria.\n    \n*   Nondiabetic glycosuria.\n    \n*   Renal glucosuria.\n    \n*   Primary renal glycosuria.\n    \n*   Familial renal glycosuria.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Status Epilepticus in Children - Types, Causes, and Treatment\n    \n    Hypophosphatemia: Physiology, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment.\n    \n    Role of Food in Acid Peptic Disease\n    \n\n【7】**What Is the Epidemiology of Renal Glycosuria?**\n\n【8】It is estimated that it occurs in about 1 in 33,000 individuals among the general population. It does not show any gender discrimination affecting males and females equally. It is suggested to be more prevalent in conditions such as starvation and pregnancy. It can be inherited as both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns.\n\n【9】What Is the Difference Between Physiologic And Pathologic Glycosuria?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   **Physiologic Glycosuria:** It is a transient condition that is characterized by the excretion of sugar in the urine that occurs when a person consumes an excessive amount of carbohydrates. The presence of a small amount of glucose up to 0. 25 mg/ml in the random fresh urine is considered normal as it can occur due to overconsumption of carbohydrates or other physiological conditions.\n    \n*   **Pathologic Glycosuria:** It is characterized by the excessive excretion of sugar in the urine due to improper kidney function or other mechanisms that are involved in normal glucose metabolism and excretion. The diagnosis of pathologic glycosuria is made when there is more than 0. 25 mg/ml of glucose in the random fresh urine.\n    \n\n【11】What Is the Pathophysiology of Renal Glycosuria?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Kidneys play an important role in glucose reabsorption and excretion. The glomerulus filters the glucose present in the blood, which is then reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Usually, the renal tubules of the properly functioning kidneys would reabsorb almost all the glucose filtered by the glomeruli leaving less than 25 mg/dl of glucose in the urine. This capacity of the renal tubules to reabsorb the glucose filtered by the glomeruli and prevent its excretion in the urine is called the renal threshold.\n    \n*   When the amount of glucose filtered by the glomeruli exceeds the amount of glucose reabsorbed by the tubules, violating the renal threshold, the excessive unabsorbed glucose would be eliminated in the urine. This may occur due to two reasons, either due to the increased plasma sugar levels which occur in patients with diabetes mellitus or when the reabsorbing capacity of the renal tubules is affected due to any disease conditions affecting the kidneys.\n    \n\n【13】**What Is Transport Maximum for Glucose (TmG)?**\n\n【14】TmG is the maximum capacity or point at which the increase in the concentration of glucose would not result in its excretion in the urine. If this capacity or point is crossed, the glucose will be excreted in the urine. In healthy adults and children, this value ranges from 260 to 350 mg/minute.\n\n【15】What Are the Types of Renal Glycosuria?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】There are three subtypes of renal glycosuria; they are as follows:\n\n【17】*   Renal Glycosuria, Type A - Is characterized by a low renal threshold and reduced TmG.\n    \n*   Renal Glycosuria, Type B - Is characterized by a low renal threshold and normal TmG.\n    \n*   Renal Glycosuria, Type 0- Is characterized by the complete absence of renal tubular reabsorption.\n    \n\n【18】What Is the Etiology of Renal Glycosuria?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【19】The causes of renal glycosuria include:\n\n【20】*   **Membrane Transport Disorders -** These are usually inherited disorders affecting the transport of glucose across the cell membrane. These disorders commonly occur due to harmful genetic mutations affecting the membrane transport of glucose. In this condition, the body starts to recognize the low levels of glucose as normal and begins to excrete the glucose in the urine; hence the normal renal threshold is reduced to low levels.\n    \n*   **SLC5A2 Gene Mutation -** The renal sodium-glucose cotransporter gene is responsible for mediating the activity of sodium-glucose cotransporters SGLT1 and SGLT2. These are the membrane proteins that mediate the reabsorption of glucose from the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. Genetic mutations in the SLC5A2 gene would result in loss of function of the SGLT1 and SGLT2, resulting in impaired reabsorption of glucose by the renal tubules.\n    \n\n【21】What Are the Signs And Symptoms of Renal Glycosuria?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The majority of cases of renal glycosuria do not produce any apparent symptoms; only a few cases present with symptoms, and they are as follows:\n\n【23】*   Polyuria (increased urine output).\n    \n*   Polydipsia (excessive thirst).\n    \n*   Enuresis (involuntary urination).\n    \n*   Mild delays in growth and development during puberty.\n    \n*   Dehydration (loss of excess body fluid).\n    \n\n【24】How Is Renal Glycosuria Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】*   **History:** A thorough history of the symptoms should be collected from the patient as it provides a major clue in the diagnosis of the condition.\n    \n\n【26】*   **Urinalysis:**\n    \n    *   **Urine Sugar Estimation -** This would indicate the presence of excessive sugar in the urine to values more than 25 mg/dl.\n        \n\n【27】*   **Blood Test:**\n    \n    *   **Blood Sugar Levels -** This would indicate normal or low blood sugar levels.\n        \n\n【28】*   **Genetic Testing:**\n    \n    *   **SLC5A2 Genetic Studies -** This would indicate the mutation in the SLC5A2 gene.\n        \n\n【29】How Is Renal Glycosuria Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【30】*   There is no specific treatment for renal glycosuria as it does not produce any life-threatening issues.\n    \n*   The patients are advised to undergo routine urine tests to estimate their urine sugar levels and blood sugar levels.\n    \n*   The patients should be advised to check for diseases such as diabetes mellitus, which is one of the major reasons for glycosuria, and hypoglycemics should be prescribed to prevent further complications.\n    \n*   Genetic counseling - The affected person, as well as the family members, should be properly educated about the benign nature of the condition, and they should be reassured, as it would provide big mental support.\n    \n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Renal glycosuria is a rare disorder that is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern. This condition is marked by the excessive excretion of simple sugars in the urine. The genetic mutations in the SLC5A2 gene play an important role in the etiology of this condition. The prognosis of this condition is good as it runs a benign course. The health care providers advise the patient to undergo routine urine and blood tests to keep the condition in check and also to rule out other complications.\n\n【33】Article Resources\n\n【34】*   Renal Glycosuria  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/renal-glycosuria/\n*   Renal glycosuria  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7548/renal-glycosuria\n*   Physiology, Glycosuria  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557441/\n*   Renal glucosuria  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3153324/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8cf6ecbe-2a6c-45aa-b61f-4de6fc1f20ac", "title": "Labiaplasty Failures - An Overview", "text": "【0】Labiaplasty Failures - An Overview\nWhat Is Labiaplasty?\n--------------------\n\n【1】Labiaplasty is a surgical procedure that increases or decreases the size of the labia. In other words, the appearance of the labia can be improved by labiaplasty. In addition, the surgery may also be performed to reduce discomfort in the area and also enhance the confidence of the patient. It is a type of aesthetic or cosmetic genital surgery. ‘Plasty’ means modification. Labiaplasty, in simpler terms, is the modification of the labia.\n\n【2】What Is Labia?\n--------------\n\n【3】Vulva is the external part of the female genitalia. It includes the part called the labia. The skin folds found on the external genital opening are called the labia or the lips. It is made of two parts- labia majora and labia minora. The outer lip covered by the pubic hair is the labia majora, while the inner lip is called the labia minora. The appearance of the labia varies from one to another- smooth or wrinkled, long or short. The color may also vary from pinkish to brownish or brownish-black.\n\n【4】Why Is Labiaplasty Done?\n------------------------\n\n【5】People opt for labiaplasty for a variety of reasons:\n\n【6】*   To rectify enlarged labia due to vaginal birth, aging, hereditary or sexual activity.\n    \n*   To correct enlarged labia minora, which protrudes and causes physical discomfort. It will prevent the woman from wearing tight-fitting bottoms.\n    \n*   To increase self-confidence while participating in sexual activity.\n    \n*   To prevent infections and improve hygiene, excess tissue can increase the growth of infectious organisms.\n    \n*   To rectify asymmetric labia.\n    \n*   To increase the thickness of the labia.\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Different Types of Labiaplasty?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Labiaplasty may include the following procedures:\n\n【9】Related Topics\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】Innie vs Outie Vagina - Battle Within the Genitalia\n\n【12】Aesthetic Genital Surgeries - An Overview\n\n【13】Vaginal Rejuvenation - Types, Treatment, and Complications\n\n【14】*   **Labia Minora Procedure:** Labia minora procedure improves the appearance of the labia minora.\n    \n*   **Labia Majora Procedure:** Labia majora procedures are done to remove excess tissues or fat from the outer lips.\n    \n*   **Mons Pubis Procedure:** Mons pubis is the fatty tissue found over the pubic bone. By mons pubis procedure, excess fat will be removed from the area by liposuction. Excess fat deposits develop due to obesity, pregnancy, or vaginal birth.\n    \n*   **Clitoral Hood Reduction:** The pleasure center of the female reproductive system is the clitoris. By clitoral hood reduction, excess tissue will be removed to regain appearance and sensation.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Things to Take Into Consideration Before Labiaplasty?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Some things should be considered before undergoing the surgery. They are as follows:\n\n【17】*   Quitting smoking, as smoking can increase postoperative complications and may cause the failure of the surgery.\n    \n*   Managing weight and decreasing excess weight in case of obesity.\n    \n*   Discussing with the doctor about the medications that the patient is already taking.\n    \n*   Discussing medical conditions and hospitalization history.\n    \n\n【18】How Is Labiaplasty Performed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】The different labiaplasty techniques are:\n\n【20】*   **Edge Trim Technique:** This is the most commonly used procedure by surgeons, where the excess tissues from the labia minora will be removed, and the end will be sutured with soluble materials. The procedure will make the labia minora even with the labia majora.\n    \n*   **Wedge Technique:** In this technique, a partial thickness wedge will be removed from the inner side of the thickest portion of the labia minora. The submucosa of the tissues beneath the mucous membrane should be left intact. This helps in preserving the wrinkled edge of the vagina, making it look natural.\n    \n*   **De-epithelization Technique:** With this technique, the lining tissue of the labia will be removed.\n    \n*   **Enlargement Procedure:** This technique is done to make the labia enlarged in its size. For this, tissue or fat will be taken from a different body part by a process called liposuction. This fat tissue will be injected into the labia majora.\n    \n\n【21】**Risks Associated With Labiaplasty:**\n\n【22】There are risks associated with labiaplasty procedures. They are:\n\n【23】*   **Asymmetry:** Even if the procedure aims to improve the appearance, the result may not be achieved. In some cases, the lips may get asymmetrical in their size.\n    \n*   **Infection:** The surgical area can get infected, and the wound may develop scarring.\n    \n*   **Bleeding:** There are chances of excessive bleeding and hematoma.\n    \n*   **Discomfort:** The treated area may become extremely painful or swollen. If infected, these symptoms get even worse.\n    \n*   **Over Correction**: Overcorrection happens when excess removal of fat or tissue is done during the procedure. This may also lead to negative outcomes.\n    \n*   **Altered Sensation:** When a vascular injury takes place during the surgery, the sensation gets affected. The person may either experience a decreased sensation or numbness.\n    \n*   **Painful Sex:** Labiaplasty can cause sexual intercourse to be painful and hard in the future.\n    \n*   **Delayed Wound Healing:** This may be due to reasons like poor post-operative care, systemic conditions, or infections.\n    \n\n【24】How to Manage Discomfort After Labiaplasty?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   Over-the-counter medications like Acetaminophen help in decreasing discomforts like pain and swelling.\n    \n*   If the discomforts are severe, it is essential to consult the doctor.\n    \n*   It is important to take the prescribed antibiotic medications to prevent or relieve infections.\n    \n*   Wearing loose-fitting clothes helps in the easy healing of the wound. This may also prevent infections.\n    \n*   It is necessary to pat the area dry intermittently to prevent infections.\n    \n*   Taking long showers should be avoided.\n    \n*   Performing strenuous activities or riding bikes or two-wheelers may exert more pressure on the area and should be avoided. Such activities can affect wound healing and can also increase bleeding.\n    \n*   The patient should not participate in sexual activities for a few days to weeks after the surgery.\n    \n*   No soap should be applied to wash the area. Instead, the wound can be gently washed with lukewarm water.\n    \n*   Chances of constipation are high post-operatively. Therefore, the diet should contain an adequate amount of fiber to relieve constipation.\n    \n*   It is necessary to consult the doctor in cases like severe bleeding, extreme pain, pus discharge, excessive swelling, and unmanageable constipation.\n    \n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】Labiaplasty is a cosmetic genital surgery done to improve the appearance of the genitalia and to reduce discomfort in the area. The procedure may improve the appearance and sensation but may also lead to complications or failures. It is also necessary to visit a surgeon who is experienced to improve the outcome of the procedure. Taking proper pre-operative care, carrying out the surgery in a hygienic way, and caring well during post-operative time help in decreasing the complications.\n\n【28】Article Resources\n\n【29】*   Cosmetic genital surgery - labiaplasty and phalloplasty Actions for this page  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/cosmetic-genital-surgery-labiaplasty-and-phalloplasty\n*   Labiaplasty  \n    https://plasticsurgery.org.au/procedures/surgical-procedures/labiaplasty/\n*   What is a labiaplasty and what does it involve?  \n    https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/what-is-a-labiaplasty-and-what-does-it-involve", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This enhances the release of acetylcholine, causing increased lower esophageal sphincter and gastric tone and accelerating gastric emptying.\n    \n\n【9】*   **For Migraine -** Metoclopramide antagonizes the dopamine D2 receptor and reduces nausea and vomiting in acute migraines.\n    \n*   **Post-radiotherapy** \\- The antiemetic is used to reduce nausea and vomiting after radiotherapy or chemotherapy (treatment after cancer).\n    \n\n【10】What Is the Onset of Action of Metoclopramide?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The onset of action of Metoclopramide may take one to three minutes following an intravenous dose. The medication may take up to 10 to 15 minutes following an intramuscular administration. Metoclopramide starts to act after 30 to 60 minutes when given orally. Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with an absorption rate of 84 %. The bioavailability of oral Metoclopramide is 40 %, and it has a high tissue distribution level. Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize the drug in the liver. About 85 % of the orally administered dose is eliminated in the urine. The mean elimination half-life of Metoclopramide ranges from five to six hours.\n\n【12】**Habit-Forming:**\n\n【13】Metoclopramide is an addictive drug and may cause withdrawal symptoms like dizziness, nervousness, or headache when stopped suddenly.\n\n【14】**Expiry Date:**\n\n【15】Avoid taking this medicine after it expires. Check for the expiry on the back of the medicine pack.\n\n【16】What Is the Dosage of Metoclopramide?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【17】How to Use Metoclopramide?\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Metoclopramide is available as a tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and a solution.

{"seq_id": "e09f32b6-1e49-4cfe-8dad-244b393058c1", "title": "Erythrocyanosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Erythrocyanosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Erythrocyanosis was first reported by Packers Weber in 1925. Erythrocyanosis is the cutaneous condition characterized as the reddish-blue discoloration of the skin due to cold exposure. The mottled discoloration is seen on the lower legs. Erythrocyanosis is most commonly seen in girls and young women and rarely seen among men. The reddish-blue discoloration is evident in the area above the malleolus. Erythrocyanosis also affects the upper arms, especially in the skin over the triceps region.\n\n【2】What Is Erythrocyanosis?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Erythrocyanosis is characterized as the reddish-blue discoloration of the lower legs, particularly on the posterior surface of the legs. Erythrocyanosis is mostly seen on the site with underlying thick fatty tissue. Mild forms of erythrocyanosis present on the legs are very common, but sometimes they lead to serious complications. The overlying skin is tense and erythematous. People with erythrocyanosis experience a painful itching sensation in the affected area. In a severe erythrocyanosis, nodules are enlarged and cause ulceration in addition to pain and itching. The reddish-blue discoloration is blanchable under pressure. Most erythrocyanosis occurs in women in fatty areas such as the legs, around the knee, buttocks, and sometimes in breasts.\n\n【4】What Are the Clinical Features of Erythrocyanosis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Erythrocyanosis is clinically present with reddish-blue discoloration on the skin, especially on the skin over the lower half of the legs and the area above the malleolus. Symptoms like pain, tenderness, and mottled or dusky discoloration are present.\n\n【6】Other features of erythrocyanosis are mentioned below,\n\n【7】*   Erythrocyanosis sometimes produces a clumsy and evident deformity.\n    \n*   The overlying skin is stippled with small red points and a keratinized focus in the center.\n    \n*   Over time the indurated nodules will appear on the subcutaneous tissue.\n    \n*   Circular plaques of about 1 to 2 cm in diameter are present.\n    \n*   A discrete induration, thin fibrous skin, inflammation, and a small ulcer with a tough adherent sloughed base are present.\n    \n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Erythrocyanosis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【9】Symptoms of erythrocyanosis usually last for 7-14 days. Various symptoms are seen. In the more severe form of erythrocyanosis, the patient is disturbed with intolerable pain, weight, and cold sensation in the leg, itching, and burning pain in combination with ulcers, thereby causing the patient to be unfit for work.\n\n【10】*   Reddish to purple discoloration of skin in lower legs.\n    \n*   Itching.\n    \n*   Burning sensation.\n    \n*   Pain and tenderness.\n    \n*   Affected skin shows blisters.\n    \n*   Sometimes skin shows ulcers.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    How will difference in PaO2 affect pneumonia patient?\n    \n*   Infection might occur.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Erythrocyanosis?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Erythrocyanosis is caused by vascular disturbance due to extreme cold exposure. Blood vessels are constricted due to the action of cold-causing the deficient venous return. Erythrocyanosis is also present due to systemic conditions that include endocrine dysfunction, tuberculosis, pituitary dysfunction, anterior poliomyelitis, neoplastic conditions, body weight, and other connective tissue disorders.\n\n【13】Causative factors for erythrocyanosis include,\n\n【14】*   Exposure to cold.\n    \n*   Very scanty clothing in cold weather.\n    \n*   Tuberculosis (Bazin's disease).\n    \n*   Endocrine dysfunction.\n    \n*   Thyroid dysfunction.\n    \n*   Parathyroid dysfunction.\n    \n*   Ovarian dysfunction.\n    \n*   Pituitary gland dysfunction.\n    \n*   Venous insufficiency.\n    \n*   Local infection.\n    \n*   Neoplasm.\n    \n*   Poliomyelitis.\n    \n*   Excess body weight.\n    \n\n【15】What Is the Diagnosis of Erythrocyanosis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【16】Erythrocyanosis is diagnosed with a history and physical examination. History of cold exposure and physical examination includes the location of reddish-blue discoloration in the lower half of the leg and the fatty area. Routine blood tests were found to be normal, including blood coagulation tests, blood biochemistry, and blood sedimentation rate. The antistreptolysin level is slightly elevated in some patients. A skin biopsy is done. Histopathological examination reveals the presence of lymphocytic infiltration in the upper epidermis, blood capillaries are dilated, swollen endothelial cells, thrombosis is present in capillaries, and erythrocytes extravasation. Blood capillaries are dilated in the dermis layer, and the perivascular layer is infiltrated with lymphocytes.\n\n【17】**Diagnostic Features of Erythrocyanosis Include:**\n\n【18】*   Proper history.\n    \n*   Physical examination.\n    \n*   Complete blood count.\n    \n*   Skin biopsy in severe cases.\n    \n\n【19】**Histopathological Findings Include:**\n\n【20】**Upper Epidermis:**\n\n【21】*   Lymphocytic infiltration.\n    \n*   Dilated blood capillaries.\n    \n*   Swelling in endothelial cells.\n    \n*   Thrombosis in blood capillaries.\n    \n*   Extravasation of erythrocytes.\n    \n\n【22】**Dermis:**\n\n【23】*   Dilated capillaries.\n    \n*   Perivascular layer:\n    \n*   Lymphocytic infiltration.\n    \n\n【24】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Erythrocyanosis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The clinical features of erythrocyanosis will mimic the following skin conditions. The differential diagnosis of erythrocyanosis is mentioned below.\n\n【26】*   Livedo reticularis.\n    \n*   Erythema induratum.\n    \n*   Erythromelalgia.\n    \n\n【27】What Are the Complications of Erythrocyanosis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Erythrocyanosis may lead to its severe form with complications. The complications in erythrocyanosis arise due to bursting the blisters and poor healing of the body.\n\n【29】The complications of erythrocyanosis are listed below.\n\n【30】*   Inflammation.\n    \n*   Severe pain.\n    \n*   Burning and itching sensation.\n    \n*   Ulceration.\n    \n*   Scarring.\n    \n\n【31】What Are the Treatments for Erythrocyanosis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Erythrocyanosis usually requires no specific treatment. Patients with the symptoms of erythrocyanosis will be improved with warm clothing. Excess body weight can be reduced with diet and exercise. Treatment is essential in the severe forms of erythrocyanosis presenting with pain, disability, and total incapacity. Satisfactory results are obtained with bilateral lumbar cord ganglionectomy. Beneficial effects are obtained from the calcium lactate and ultraviolet light baths.\n\n【33】Always keep your feet warm using woolen socks and footwear, and avoid rubbing or scratching the erythrocyanosis. Pain can be relieved with pain-relieving lotions and creams.\n\n【34】Some of the preventive measures for erythrocyanosis are pointed out below.\n\n【35】*   Soothing lotions such as calamine lotion can be applied to relieve pain.\n    \n*   Stimulate the blood circulation with limp elevation, exercise, and with diet.\n    \n*   Homeopathy and naturopathy remedies can also be recommended.\n    \n*   Diabetic patients and people with poor circulatory disorders can visit general physicians to prevent risk.\n    \n\n【36】Some preventive methods are used at home to avoid the triggers of erythrocyanosis and improve blood circulation in cold weather conditions.\n\n【37】The preventive measures are followed below.\n\n【38】*   House and workplace can be done with moisture-proofing.\n    \n*   Stay active.\n    \n*   Regular exercises are helpful.\n    \n*   Weight should be reduced.\n    \n*   Consumption of foods to keep the body warm and improve blood circulation includes cayenne pepper, pomegranate, leafy greens, and eating bananas.\n    \n*   Drink ginger tea.\n    \n*   Eat oats.\n    \n*   Eat red meat, sweet potatoes, and squash.\n    \n*   Drink plenty of water and take citrus fruits.\n    \n*   Avoid alcohol.\n    \n*   Quit smoking.\n    \n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Erythrocyanosis is reddish-purple skin discoloration, especially on the lower legs. The body's reaction toward extreme cold weather causes the condition, which usually requires no treatment. Lifestyle modifications improve blood circulation through physical activity, warm layered clothes, and reducing body weight. In severe cases, visit the general physician. However, Erythrocyanosis is not a life-threatening condition. A healthy lifestyle and a nutritious diet will prevent the disease.\n\n【41】Article Resources\n\n【42】*   Erythrocyanosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2458365/\n*   Reddish-Violet, Reticular Discoloration on the Legs  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2012/0501/p907.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The antiplatelet drugs make platelets less sticky and also inhibit clot formation. These drugs are divided into oral and parenteral agents. Aspirin was the first antiplatelet drug and is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The oral agents are subdivided on the basis of their mechanism of action.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of Antiplatelets?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Antiplatelets are most commonly prescribed in people with the following medical conditions:\n\n【4】*   People who have a history of heart attack or warning signs of a possible heart attack in the future.\n    \n*   It is prescribed in people with unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, or those who have received a stent during percutaneous coronary intervention.\n    \n*   Antiplatelets are used to prevent stroke or transient ischemic attacks.\n    \n*   The drug is recommended for people who are undergoing angioplasty with or without stenting. It prevents clots from forming inside the stents.\n    \n*   Antiplatelets are the second choice for primary as well as secondary prevention of heart diseases in people allergic to aspirin or who cannot tolerate aspirin.\n    \n*   Clopidogrel is mostly used in place of aspirin for people who have narrowing of the coronary arteries or have stents inserted.\n    \n*   The drug is also used after heart bypass or valve replacement surgery.\n    \n*   Antiplatelets are used after bypass graft surgery that uses a man-made graft performed on the arteries below the knee.\n    \n\n【5】How Do Antiplatelets Work?\n--------------------------\n\n【6】Antiplatelets are classified based on the mechanism of action -\n\n【7】1.  Platelet aggregation inhibitors such as Aspirin and related cyclooxygenase inhibitors work by irreversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) activity in the prostaglandin's synthetic pathways and blocking the formation of thromboxane.\n    \n2.  Oral thienopyridines such as Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor, Ticlopidine, and Prasugrel selectively inhibit adenosine diphosphate-induced (ADP) platelet aggregation.\n    \n3.  Glycoprotein platelet inhibitors such as Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban. These work by inhibiting glycoprotein receptors on platelets and decreasing platelet aggregation and are used for short-term therapy.\n    \n4.  Dipyridamole has vasodilating properties and inhibits the platelet cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. They block the uptake of adenosine by the platelets, which also increases cyclic AMP.\n    \n5.  Cilostazol acts by reducing the smooth muscle cell hyperproliferation and initial hyperplasia after an injury to the endothelium.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Vilazodone Hydrochloride - Uses, Warning Signs, and Precautions\n    \n    Why Does Thrombocythemia Occur?\n    \n    Baby Aspirin - Uses, Dosage, Warnings, and Interactions\n    \n\n【8】How Are Antiplatelets Taken?\n----------------------------\n\n【9】Antiplatelets can be administered by oral, rectal, or intravenous routes. They should not be taken on an empty stomach. They are available in different strengths and come in pill form. The medicines can be taken with or without food and are taken once a day, simultaneously each day. The concomitant use of Omeprazole and Esomeprazole should be avoided while taking antiplatelets\n\n【10】What Is the Dosage of Antiplatelets?\n------------------------------------\n\n【11】**Missed Dose:**\n\n【12】If you forget to take a dose of antiplatelets, it is advised to take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take double the dose as it may increase the risk of side effects.\n\n【13】Can We Use Antiplatelets and Anticoagulants Together?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Yes. The combination of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelets alone for the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes. However, it increases the risk of bleeding.\n\n【15】**Overdose:**\n\n【16】Taking more than 150 mg/kg of body weight of antiplatelets can be life-threatening and sometimes fatal. The patients will need monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding and the development of metabolic derangements like acidosis.\n\n【17】What Precautions Should Be Taken When Taking Antiplatelets?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding -** Antiplatelets should be taken with caution during the last two weeks of pregnancy as they may cause bleeding problems in the baby or mother before and after delivery.

Under normal circumstances, this force is essential for the blood to circulate well in the body, but if it rises above the normal value, it is called hypertension.\n\n【2】Hypertension or high blood pressure remains one of the most common ailments that affect a majority of the population today. The daily stress, abnormal routines, reduced and poor quality of sleep, stress associated with smoking and alcohol consumption, low levels of activity, an increasingly prevalent sedentary life, and of course, consumption of salt and fat-rich commercial foods do nothing to keep the blood pressure of the average healthy worker normal.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of High Blood Pressure?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【4】High blood pressure usually causes very vague symptoms. However, it is interesting to note that even among patients who develop some vague symptoms, very few seek medical attention. Most patients attribute the symptom to an ongoing process, work pressure, or otherwise and never get to visit a healthcare professional. For the information of the readers, most of the patients have non-specific symptoms like mild headache or heaviness of the head, sweating, generalized discomfort, breathlessness, chest heaviness, vertigo, and so forth.\n\n【5】Among the patients who visit a medical practitioner, high blood pressure is almost always detected on the very first visit. Most of these patients are usually advised to take medicine for hypertension sooner or later. Unfortunately, many of these patients, at some stage, interrupt the intake of these medicines, and some do not start the medicines at all.\n\n【6】What Are the Misconceptions about Anti-Hypertensive Pills?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Over a while, many excuses, which are misconceptions, have been heard by medical practitioners. Sharing at this moment a few that I have heard in my period of patient management:\n\n【8】Related Topics\n\n【9】* * *\n\n【10】Hypertension and Skipping Anti-Hypertensive Pills - A Small Step Towards a Big Mistake\n\n【11】Can headache occur as a side effect of BP medicine?\n\n【12】My blood pressure is erratic. Please help.\n\n【13】*   If medication for blood pressure is started, it has to be taken all through life and can never be stopped.\n    \n*   All blood medications have serious side effects and should therefore be avoided.\n    \n*   They cause a lot of abdominal discomfort or other abdominal symptoms.\n    \n*   Anti-hypertensive medications can cause impotence.\n    \n*   I was feeling absolutely normal. Therefore I skipped the medicine.\n    \n*   I had the blood pressure checked after taking the pill. It was normal. So I stopped the pills.\n    \n*   The blood pressure was not fully controlled despite medicines. The medicines were ineffective. So I stopped taking the medicines.\n    \n*   I decided to try only lifestyle modification measures. If it does not help in, say, one month, then I will consider medicines.\n    \n*   I went to a holy place, and a godman told me that God cures all. So, I stopped the medicines.\n    \n\n【14】Health practitioners would have probably heard many more unique excuses.\n\n【15】What Happens if One Avoids Anti-Hypertensive Pills?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The fact remains that the blood pressure medicines should be taken on a regular basis as advised, and they should be stopped, or any dosage change or the medicine change is done only by a certified medical practitioner. While lifestyle modifications are always the preferred method of controlling blood pressure, it should be realized that sometimes, one has to start medications and then later stop medicines when the alternative methods like relaxation techniques, weight loss measures and regular exercise, restricted salt intake, etc. start showing their effect. Almost every practitioner would have experienced a non-compliant patient (a patient who avoids medicines). Almost every patient has met a doctor who tells him to avoid skipping treatment.\n\n【17】The reasons why it is so important not to skip pills are,\n\n【18】*   Failure to take anti-hypertensive pills is essentially a dangerous decision on the part of the patient. The patients should realize that they are putting themselves at unnecessary risk. The risk of getting a serious illness, some of which are not only irreversible but also require long-term treatment, remains high. The diseases include a long list of disabling conditions. The most common is perhaps stroke.\n    \n*   A stroke frequently occurs in hypertensive patients. It occurs when they have an intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding within the skull). In most patients, the most common cause of bleeding is non-compliance to the anti-hypertensive medicines. The associated morbidity and mortality are also high.\n    \n*   Another associated condition due to uncontrolled high blood pressure is acute coronary syndrome. The person is at increased risk. Hypertension and coronary artery disease share similar risk factors, like obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, dyslipidemia (abnormal fat deposits), etc.\n    \n*   Renal failure, frequently a cause of hypertension, may also be caused by the disease.\n    \n\n【19】It suffices to say that hypertension, a silent killer, should not be taken lightly. Do have your blood pressure checked today. No age group is safe. And please adhere to the medications.\n\n【20】What Are the Tips to Help One Stay On a Daily Dosage Schedule?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Some people do not want to avoid medications but may forget to take the medications due to messy or inconvenient drugs. Sometimes, the cost of the drugs may make one avoid practicing a daily dosage schedule. The following are some ways to make wise choices to help stick to the medication schedule.\n\n【22】*   There are various medications with different formulas like pills, liquids, and sprays. When you do not like to swallow pills, ask for a different available option.\n    \n*   If it is hard to visit the pharmacy once a month, an online doctor's prescription refill may be a good option. This will ensure treating the condition without having to visit a local doctor in-person.\n    \n*   It is easier to remember to take medicine when it needs to be taken just once a day. Ask the doctor about dosage choices or other decisions that can help to take the prescription drugs.\n    \n*   It may be easier for the patient to take one pill that packs two or more medications in it. Some of the high blood pressure medicines come in triple combinations that help the patients to take the medicines in a single dose.\n    \n\n【23】Article Resources\n\n【24】*   Skipping blood pressure pills may raise heart failure risk  \n    https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hypertension-meds-idUSKCN0QU23R20150825\n*   Skipping blood pressure meds can prove deadly  \n    https://www.dispatch.com/article/20140223/NEWS/302239780\n*   High Blood Pressure Medicines  \n    https://familydoctor.org/high-blood-pressure-medicines/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a progressive neurological disorder. The muscle contractions cannot be controlled as it results due to muscle spasms around the eye. There are other minor causes that can make your eyes twitch like myokymia.\n\n【2】### Points to Remember:\n\n【3】*   This condition rarely runs in families.\n    \n*   It is believed to originate in the motor nerves of the brain, but the exact cause is still not known.\n    \n*   It can be triggered by stress, fatigue, dry eyes, eye strain, and some medications.\n    \n\n【4】What Causes Blepharospasm?\n--------------------------\n\n【5】The cause of most cases of blepharospasm is not known, but there are many hypotheses that explain the possible causes. Some of the possible causes are:\n\n【6】*   **Dry eyes and light sensitivity** - Some patients have these symptoms before developing blepharospasm. But most patients did not have any eye problems previously.\n    \n*   **Certain drugs** - Medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease and hormone replacement therapy can induce blepharospasm. It can also be a withdrawal symptom of benzodiazepines.\n    \n*   Abnormal functioning of the basal ganglia of the brain.\n    \n*   It is also associated with conditions like dystonia and multiple sclerosis.\n    \n*   It can also result from a concussion from a head injury.\n    \n*   Eye injury or trauma.\n    \n*   Environmental factors can trigger this condition.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Nephropathic Cystinosis - Types, Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS)\n    \n    Nocturnal Paroxysmal Dystonia - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Blepharospasm?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【8】The signs and symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   Excessive blinking due to spasm of the eye muscles.\n    \n*   Sometimes, the twitches are so strong that it results in eyelid closure for minutes to hours.\n    \n*   Involuntary twitches or contractions of the muscles surrounding the eye.\n    \n*   Eye dryness.\n    \n*   Eye irritation.\n    \n*   Light sensitivity.\n    \n\n【10】The symptoms become obvious when the person is tired or upset. Initially, the symptoms may be felt in one eye only, but as it progresses, both the eyes get involved. The symptoms appear only when the patient is awake, and a good night’s sleep helps delay the onset of symptoms the next day.\n\n【11】In advanced cases, the patient experiences severe spasms, making it difficult to open their eyes. Repeated attacks make the person functionally blind, as the patient cannot open the eyes and see even after having normal eyesight.\n\n【12】Most people suffering from blepharospasm also develop symptoms of dystonia in other parts of the body like neck, face, and mouth, eventually.\n\n【13】How Is Blepharospasm Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】Blepharospasm is diagnosed clinically by a neurologist or ophthalmologist. There is no specific test to diagnose this condition, and diagnosis is made by ruling out all other causes of eye twitches. After a complete medical and physical examination, the doctor will rule out the following conditions before diagnosing the condition:\n\n【15】*   Myokymia.\n    \n*   Eye problems.\n    \n*   Meige syndrome.\n    \n*   Parkinson’s disease.\n    \n*   Tourette’s syndrome.\n    \n*   Hemifacial spasm.\n    \n*   Focal seizures.\n    \n*   Brain injury or tumor.\n    \n\n【16】How Is Blepharospasm Treated?\n-----------------------------\n\n【17】There is no cure for this condition, but treatment can reduce the symptoms. The treatment options include:\n\n【18】*   **Medicines** - Anticholinergics, tranquilizers, and botulinum toxin are used. But, it results in a lot of side effects and is not prescribed commonly. Nowadays, Mosapride is being used in the treatment, which is a safer and economical option.\n    \n\n【19】*   **Botox injection** - Injecting Botulinum toxin is the preferred treatment option, as it induces localized paralysis. This injection is administered every 3 months. Most patients respond well to Botox injection and lead an almost normal life. For some, the effectiveness reduces after years of use.\n    \n\n【20】*   **Surgery** - If the symptoms are not relieved with the help of medicines or botox, then surgery is done. During surgery, the muscles responsible for closing the eyelid (protractor myectomy) are removed.\n    \n\n【21】*   **Sensorimotor retraining** - Series of sensorimotor training techniques include exercises to improve neuroplasticity, which will help the brain heal itself and eliminate dystonic movements.\n    \n\n【22】*   **Sensory trick** - A new device is used to apply pressure to the temple region, which helps patients open their eyes.\n    \n\n【23】What Are the Home Remedies for Blepharospasm?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】You can manage the symptoms by:\n\n【25】*   Wearing protective sunglasses.\n    \n*   Using lubricating eye drops.\n    \n*   Applying hot or cold compression to the eyes and surrounding areas.\n    \n*   Keep using the facial muscles to whistle, sing, and talk.\n    \n\n【26】What Are the Other Common Causes of Eyelid Twitches?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Eyelid twitches can be due to:\n\n【28】*   Eye strain.\n    \n*   Eye irritation.\n    \n*   Sleep problems.\n    \n*   Tiredness.\n    \n*   Too much stress.\n    \n*   Exertion.\n    \n*   Side effects of some medicine.\n    \n*   Alcohol or tobacco use.\n    \n\n【29】What Are the Other Serious Conditions That Can Cause Eyelid Twitches?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Everybody experiences eye twitching at some point. But rarely, it can be due to severe underlying condition like:\n\n【31】*   **Bell’s palsy or facial palsy** - results in one-sided paralysis of the face.\n    \n*   **Dystonia** - results in unexpected and involuntary muscle spasms anywhere in the body.\n    \n*   **Multiple sclerosis (MS)** - it is a disorder that causes cognitive and movement problems and muscle weakness.\n    \n*   **Parkinson’s disease** - results in involuntary tremors in the limbs, muscle stiffness, and balance problems.\n    \n*   **Tourette syndrome** - results in involuntary movement and verbal tics.\n    \n\n【32】Blepharospasm is commonly seen in middle-aged women. The exact cause is not known, but genetic, environmental, and other factors seem to play a role. There is no cure for this disease as of now, but to know more ways to relieve symptoms, consult a doctor online.\n\n【33】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【34】* * *\n\n【35】#### **1.**\n\n【36】#### **What are the most common causes of blepharospasm?**\n\n【37】Dry eyes, light sensitivity, certain medicines, head injury or concussion, and eye injury are believed to be the possible causes of this condition. However, the extract cause is still not known.\n\n【38】#### **2.**\n\n【39】#### **Is it possible to cure blepharospasm?**\n\n【40】As of now, there is no known cure for blepharospasm. The eye twitches can be managed with the help of various medicines and Botox injections. If no other treatment option helps, then the muscle responsible for closing the eyelid is surgically cut.\n\n【41】#### **3.**\n\n【42】#### **How long does blepharospasm last?**\n\n【43】Eye twitches can last for a few seconds to minutes to weeks. In some cases, the muscle contraction are so strong that it might make the eyelid close the eyes shut.\n\n【44】#### **4.**\n\n【45】#### **Why is my lower eyelid twitching?**\n\n【46】Lower eyelid twitches are most commonly indicates that your eyes are stressed or strained, you are tired, or consuming a lot of caffeine. But if these twitches do not get better in a week, then it can be a neurological problem.\n\n【47】#### **5.**\n\n【48】#### **What causes eyebrow twitching?**\n\n【49】Some of the known causes of eyebrow twitching are excessive caffeine, eyestrain, magnesium deficiency, some antipsychotic and diuretic medications, allergies, stress, and alcohol abuse. In rare cases, it can be due to underlying conditions such as Parkinson’s disease or Tourette syndrome.\n\n【50】#### **6.**\n\n【51】#### **Is eye twitching a sign of a brain tumor?**\n\n【52】Brain tumor as a cause for eye twitching is uncommon.

If the injury remains unrecognized, it can lead to preventable traumatic death. Spleen is the body's most vascular (rich in blood vessels) organ. Thus the injuries affecting the organ generally affect the arteries and lead to hemoperitoneum. The splenic injuries are recognizable because the bleeding is mostly intraperitoneal (inside the peritoneum). The treatment of choice in cases of injuries is salvaging the spleen instead of removing it because of its immunological functions. The injuries of the spleen are traced easily with a computed tomography scan.\n\n【2】What Are the Functions of the Spleen?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】The spleen is a small organ inside the left rib cage above the stomach. The size of the spleen is similar to an avocado in an adult. The spleen is a major part of the lymphatic system, which is an important part of the body's immune system. The functions of the spleen include storage of blood, formation of white blood cells and antibodies, which helps to strengthen the immune system, maintenance of fluid levels in the body, filtration of blood by removing the cellular waste (dead cells) and production of antibodies for the protection of the body from infections.\n\n【4】What Causes Splenic Injury?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】The spleen is generally injured when the trauma involves the upper left abdomen or the lower left chest region. It is most commonly affected by trauma because of its juxtaposition in the upper left abdomen to the 9th, 10th, and 11th rib.\n\n【6】Some of the conditions which can lead to splenic injury are:\n\n【7】*   Blunt trauma is like a blow to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n    \n*   Indirect trauma generally occurs while treating any organ besides the spleen or performing an endoscopy or colonoscopy. This type of injury can damage the outer splenic capsule.\n    \n*   Penetrating trauma in which there is direct injury to the spleen. One example is gunshot wounds, which comprise almost 7 to 9% of penetrating traumas of the abdomen.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Aneurysm - Causes, Symptoms, Treatments and Prevention Methods\n    \n    Pancreatic Pseudoaneurysm - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n    \n    Acanthocytosis- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   **Road Accidents**: These are the most common changes of splenic injury, which may involve a blunt blow to the spleen.\n    \n\n【8】How Common Are Splenic Injuries?\n--------------------------------\n\n【9】Splenic injuries are the most common abdominal traumas, with almost 25 % of cases every year. It has no specific gender prevalence; it can affect anyone. However, out of all the causes, blunt trauma is the most common cause of splenic injury.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Splenic Injury?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   The most common reason to inquire is trauma to the left rib cage or upper left abdomen region. Although in every case, there doesn't need to be a history of trauma.\n    \n*   The symptoms include abdominal pain (especially in the upper left region), abdominal distension, reduced blood pressure or hypotension, and tenderness of the abdominal region.\n    \n*   In some rare cases, there can be pain in the left shoulder region due to diaphragmatic irritation. This phenomenon is known as Kehr's sign.\n    \n*   In trauma cases, there are external signs such as lacerations, abrasions, or contusions.\n    \n*   Some of the cases also witness pleuritic left-sided pain in the chest.\n    \n\n【12】What Are the Points Important for Physical Examination in Splenic Injury Cases?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   The most common reason behind splenic injuries is trauma. However, it is not the only reason in all cases. Suppose there is trauma in the left upper chest region. In that case, it is advised to look for external injuries such as lacerations, abrasions, or contusions, which can help evaluate the trauma's intensity.\n    \n*   It is important to ask for a history of splenectomy or any surgery around the spleen. The doctors also investigate other liver or portal vein diseases with the help of anticoagulants.\n    \n*   It is important to inquire if there are fractures in the lower rib region on the left side, as splenic injury can occur. In adults with lower rib fractures, approximately 20% of cases have associated splenic injury.\n    \n*   In children, even with a history of blown-out trauma, there might be no fractures as the chest wall has plasticity characteristics, but there might be a chance of internal injuries, which could be splenic.\n    \n\n【14】How to Evaluate Splenic Injuries?\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】Some of the adjuncts which can be used to locate the splenic injury are:\n\n【16】*   **Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST)**: This examination can quickly identify the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. This test is useful in cases of hemodynamically unstable patients. There are four acoustic windows in the examination, perihepatic, pericardiac, pelvic, and perisplenic. The test is positive when there is a black rim or anechoic band around the spleen. This test is advised in cases of intraperitoneal bleeding, which is not always necessary for splenic injury. In approximately 25% of cases of spleen injuries, there is no intraperitoneal hemorrhage.\n    \n*   **Computed Tomography**: The CT scan (computed tomography) helps to diagnose disruption in solid organs, such as it helps to trace abnormal splenic parenchyma, free intra-abdominal blood, and hematoma. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is used to evaluate the density difference between the splenic parenchyma and hematoma.\n    \n\n【17】What Is the Spleen Organ Injury Scale?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【18】Based on the computed tomography findings, the splenic injuries are classified into different grades:\n\n【19】*   **Grade 1**: Laceration involving less than 1 cm of parenchymal depth with hematoma is less than 10% surface area.\n    \n*   **Grade 2**: Presence of hematoma and subcapsular in about 10% to 50% of surface area, with lacerations in 1 to 3 cm of parenchymal depth that does not involve trabecular vessels.\n    \n*   **Grade 3**: Hematoma in more than 50% of surface area with subcapsular, intraparenchymal hematoma with more than 5 cm diameter and lacerations greater than 3 cm in depth.\n    \n*   **Grade 4:** Lacerations that involve segmental or hilar vessels that produce major devascularization up to 25%.\n    \n*   **Grade 5**: Laceration, which completely shattered the spleen, and major devascularization.\n    \n\n【20】What Is the Treatment for Splenic Injuries?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【21】*   The initial step in managing splenic injury includes following the trauma's ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). The assessment of circulation is done by checking the possibility of bleeding in patients with blunt trauma.\n    \n*   Injuries in which the bleeding has stopped can be managed without splenectomy (spleen removal). However, there are chances of delayed hemorrhages in such cases.\n    \n*   **Nonoperative Treatment of Splenic Injury**: The aim of the treatment of splenic injuries is maximizing salvage therapy. In children, it is the treatment of choice in most cases. Approximately 80 % of cases can be treated by nonoperative technique, but the patient's condition should be hemodynamically stable without any sign of peritonitis.\n    \n*   **Operative Management:** The cases of ongoing bleeding or the ones which require more than two units of blood are considered for the operative approach. The conditions which are indications for an operative approach are hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, intra-abdominal injuries associated with the spleen, and pseudoaneurysm formation.\n    \n*   **Embolization**: It requires a vascular interventionist and splenic embolization. It is advised in cases of grade 3 or splenic injuries. However, some embolization complications include devascularization of about 25 % of the spleen and recurrence of hemorrhage or abscess.\n    \n\n【22】**Conclusion:**\n\n【23】Splenic injuries are considered one of the most common abdominal injuries, as trauma can easily affect them. Spleen is the most vascularized organ of the body, and the basic symptom of splenic injury is bleeding. The injuries are divided into five grades depending on the intensity of damage caused to the spleen. The causes vary from different types of trauma to surgical accidents. The treatment is necessary because the spleen is an important part of the lymphatic system (which is a part of the immune system).\n\n【24】Article Resources\n\n【25】*   Splenic Injury  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441993/\n*   Splenic trauma  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/splenic-trauma\n*   Splenic Injury, Blunt, Selective Nonoperative Management  \n    https://www.east.org/education-career-development/practice-management-guidelines/details/splenic-injury-blunt-selective-nonoperative-management-of\n*   Blunt Splenic Trauma  \n    https://www.aast.org/resources-detail/8764001f-b3b2-425e-89c5-5284d417de1e", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "93611228-5f7a-4b4b-a311-a672a9eac62c", "title": "Bladder Neck Dysfunction - Symptoms, Complications, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Bladder Neck Dysfunction - Symptoms, Complications, and Treatment\nWhat Is Bladder Neck Dysfunction?\n---------------------------------\n\n【1】The urinary bladder is one of the most crucial organs of the urinary system. It is a balloon-like structure connected to the kidneys on one end and the urethra on the other. The ureters are tube-like structures that connect the urinary bladder to the kidneys. The urinary bladder receives urine from the ureters. The urethra forms a connecting link between the urinary bladder and the outside world. The urine is drained from the urinary tract through the urethra. The junction where the urinary bladder meets the urethra is known as the bladder neck. It consists of muscles that contract and relax to facilitate urine drainage.\n\n【2】However, the problem arises when the bladder neck does not function well or is blocked and inhibits urine flow. The urine might flow back to the kidneys, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections. It is commonly seen in men above 50 years of age and needs to be treated at the earliest.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Bladder Neck Dysfunction?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】If the bladder neck is blocked or fails to function, the patient experiences problems related to the urinary tract. The causes of bladder neck dysfunction have been described below:\n\n【5】1.  **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia** - The prostate gland is one of the most important organs of the male reproductive system. It is located near the neck of the urinary bladder. The condition in which the gland becomes enlarged is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia. The urethra mainly traverses through the middle portion of the prostate. The bladder outlet narrows if the gland becomes enlarged or swollen, resulting in restricted urine flow.\n    \n2.  **Prolapsed Bladder** - One of the most common causes of bladder neck obstruction in females. The condition in which the bladder slips into the vagina is known as bladder prolapse. It mainly occurs when the vaginal wall becomes weak due to menopause, vaginal delivery, and multiple pregnancies.\n    \n3.  **Presence of Scar Tissues** \\- Scar tissue forms in the bladder or the urethra as a side-effect of radiation treatment and prostate surgery. These tissues block the neck of the bladder and make urination difficult.\n    \n4.  **Stress Urinary Incontinence Surgery** - The urine leakage before the person reaches the toilet is known as urinary incontinence. It is treated surgically by bladder neck suspension and sling surgery. The bladder neck might get damaged during the surgery resulting in severe problems in the urinary tract.\n    \n5.  **Presence of Cysts and Tumors** - A tumor is a mass formed due to uncontrolled cell division. On the other hand, cysts are multiple fluid-filled sacs that form anywhere in the body. Tumors in the rectum, vagina, and urethra might block the bladder neck as the urinary bladder is located close to these organs.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Sexual Dysfunction and Chronic Genital Pain: An Overview\n    \n    Stem Cell Therapy for Chronic Bladder Ischemia\n    \n    Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n6.  **Urethral Stricture** - It is a condition in which the urethra becomes narrow. Urethral stricture blocks urine flow from the bladder and increases the risk of urinary tract infections.\n    \n7.  **Constipation** - Constipation is when the stools become hard and cannot pass through the body. These hard stools put pressure on the bladder neck, making it difficult for the muscles to work and drain the urine to the urethra.\n    \n8.  **Congenital Defects** - Bladder neck dysfunction can also be present by birth due to defects in the urinary bladder or the surrounding structures.\n    \n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Bladder Neck Dysfunction?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Bladder neck dysfunction makes it difficult for the urinary bladder to drain urine into the urethra. The following signs and symptoms are seen in bladder neck dysfunction:\n\n【8】*   Difficulty in starting the flow of urine.\n    \n*   The patient cannot urinate completely, even after getting a strong urge.\n    \n*   The presence of pain in the lower back and abdominal region is commonly seen.\n    \n*   Nocturia, or the urge to pass urine at night, occurs frequently.\n    \n*   The patient rushes to the toilet frequently but cannot empty the bladder at once.\n    \n\n【9】What Methods Are Used to Diagnose Bladder Neck Dysfunction?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The patient presents with similar symptoms in bladder neck dysfunction, urinary tract infections, and other conditions that affect the urinary system. The methods used to diagnose bladder neck dysfunctions have been described below:\n\n【11】1.  **Blood Tests** \\- Blood test helps the physician check the infections in the body.\n    \n2.  **Urine Culture** \\- The patient collects urine in a container or a sterile bag provided by the hospital. The urine sample is left unattended for a few days to allow the bacteria to grow. If bacterial growth is rapid, a urinary tract infection can be suspected.\n    \n3.  **Cystoscopy** - It is one of the most effective methods used to diagnose bladder-neck dysfunction. A cystoscope is a small instrument with a camera that allows one to view the inner lining of the urinary system.\n    \n4.  **Renal and Bladder Ultrasound** - In this procedure, sound waves are sent to the kidney, and images of the kidney, ureters, and urinary bladder are obtained. The doctor looks at the images on the computer. This image will give him an idea about the presence of stones, tumors, wounds, or anything that leads to the blockage of the urinary system.\n    \n5.  **Video Urodynamics** - It is an imaging test used to detect urinary bladder problems. The doctor initiates the procedure by inserting a tube called a catheter into the urethra. Next, the contrast material or a dye is injected into the bladder through the catheter. X-rays are taken as the bladder becomes full. The patient is asked to urinate, and the X-rays are taken again. This test helps to observe bladder neck dysfunction and how the bladder works when it is obstructed.\n    \n\n【12】How Is Bladder Neck Dysfunction Managed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【13】Bladder neck dysfunction can be treated with medications and surgery. The treatment option depends upon the cause and the severity of the condition. Both the surgical and non-surgical methods have been described below:\n\n【14】*   **Antibiotics** - Prazosin and Phenoxybenzamine are mainly used to treat bladder neck dysfunction. They are alpha-blockers that work to relax the muscles of the urinary bladder. As the bladder muscles are relaxed, the urine flows out of the bladder smoothly.\n    \n*   **Self-Catheterization** - As the name suggests, the procedure is performed by the patient. Self-catheterization is also known as clean intermittent catheterization and helps the patient to pass urine when he finds it difficult to urinate. Finally, the urine drains out of the body, and the catheter is removed. The procedure needs to be repeated several times during the day.\n    \n*   **Surgery** - Surgical intervention is required when the medications and self-catheterization methods fail to resolve the condition. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. First, a small cut or an incision is made in the bladder neck. Next, a tube known as a resectoscope is inserted into the urinary bladder. It contains a camera that helps to view the neck of the bladder. It also contains a tool that uses an electric current to remove the tissue blocking the bladder neck.\n    \n\n【15】What Are the Complications of Bladder Neck Dysfunction?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】If the bladder neck dysfunction is left untreated for a long time, the bladder becomes weak permanently. The complications of bladder neck obstruction are listed below:\n\n【17】1.  The risk of urinary tract infections increases because the urine remains in the body and becomes a potential source of bacterial infection.\n    \n2.  If the bladder becomes weak, a pouch known as a bladder diverticula forms in the urinary bladder.\n    \n3.  Hydronephrosis, or the swelling of the kidneys, occurs because of the pressure exerted by the urine. As a result, the kidneys get damaged permanently.\n    \n4.  The person might experience urinary incontinence (leakage of urine) for a prolonged period as bladder control is lost.\n    \n\n【18】**Conclusion:**\n\n【19】Bladder neck dysfunction is when the urine does not flow freely through the bladder as the muscles are not working properly. Bladder neck dysfunction is not life-threatening but requires treatment at the earliest. It is because the bladder becomes weak if the condition is left untreated for a long. There are no home remedies available to cure bladder neck dysfunction. However, some medications relax the bladder muscles and allow the passage of urine. Surgical intervention is rarely required when the medications and self-catheterization methods fail to achieve the desired results. Hence, the patient must not worry about the condition and consult the doctor at the earliest to avoid complications.\n\n【20】Article Resources\n\n【21】*   Primary Bladder Neck Obstruction in Men and Women  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477631/\n*   LOWER URINARY TRACT OBSTRUCTION  \n    https://www.fetalhealthfoundation.org/fetal-syndromes/lower-urinary-tract-obstruction/\n*   Bladder Outlet Obstruction  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15181-bladder-outlet-obstruction\n*   Primary bladder neck dysfunction: an overlooked entity in children  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15717972/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "87b8a171-f3fc-40f1-b77b-911493744b41", "title": "Anemia of Acute Blood Loss - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Anemia of Acute Blood Loss - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Blood loss causes anemia, in which the body lacks healthy red blood cells by two main mechanisms. The direct depletion of red blood cells and extended blood loss result in reduced oxygen supply to the body tissues. It will slowly decrease iron stores, eventually resulting in iron deficiency. Having anemia means that you have low hemoglobin, which can make you weak. Posthemorrhagic anemia accompanies acute blood loss. This can be external (after trauma or obstetric hemorrhage) or internal (from bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, fracture of the spleen, fracture of an ectopic pregnancy, or hemorrhage).\n\n【2】What Is Anemia?\n---------------\n\n【3】Anemia is a result of either a lesser than normal amount of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), the amount of hemoglobin (Hgb), or the volume of packed RBCs (hematocrit). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a level of hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women.\n\n【4】Anemia classified as either acute or chronic:\n\n【5】*   Acute anemia occurs when there is a sudden drop in RBCs resulting from hemolysis or acute hemorrhage.\n    \n*   Chronic anemia is a gradual decline in RBCs, and causes include iron or other nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and other causes.\n    \n\n【6】What Is Anemia of Acute Blood Loss?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【7】Acute anemia is seen when there is an instant drop in RBCs, causing excessive loss than the production itself, most often by hemolysis or acute hemorrhage.\n\n【8】Pathophysiologic Stages:\n\n【9】1.  At the start, hypovolemia produces a threat to organs like the brain and the kidneys, affecting loss of consciousness and kidney failure. During this stage, the blood count will not show anemia because the hemoglobin concentration is not disturbed.\n    \n2.  Next, as an emergency response, the release of vasopressin and other peptides, and the body will shift fluid from the outside to the inside, resulting in hemodilution (diluted blood); thus, the hypovolemia gradually converts to anemia. This stage of anemia will depict the amount of blood lost.\n    \n3.  Provided bleeding is arrested, the bone marrow response will gradually improve anemia, and the reticulocyte count and erythropoietin levels will be elevated.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Megaloblastic Anemia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Can anemia cause an increase in HbA1c level?\n    \n    Hemolytic Anemia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n\n【10】What Causes Anemia of Acute Blood Loss?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【11】The major role in life-threatening acute anemia is a sudden drop in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This may occur with or without a reduction in the total volume. It is seen that an acute drop in hemoglobin to a level of 7-8 g/dL is symptomatic, whereas levels of 4 to 5 g/dL may be tolerated in chronic anemia, as the body can gradually replace the loss of intravascular volume. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common and could be due to blood loss but may occasionally be due to poor absorption of iron.\n\n【12】Some life-threatening causes are as follows:\n\n【13】*   Trauma.\n    \n*   Immense upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage.\n    \n*   Punctured ectopic pregnancy.\n    \n*   Punctured aneurysm.\n    \n*   Distribution intravascular coagulation.\n    \n\n【14】1\\. **Excessive Bleeding** : The most common cause of acute anemia is excessive bleeding. When blood is drained, the body recompense by extracting the water from tissues outside tissue in an attempt to maintain the blood vessels filled, making it diluted. In due course, an increment of red blood cells may resolve the anemia. However, continued bleeding reduces the iron in the body, so the bone marrow is not able to increase the production of new red blood cells to replace those lost.\n\n【15】2. **Rapid Blood Loss**: The symptoms develop quickly and are severe as a result of the sudden loss of blood due to an injury, surgery, childbirth, or a ruptured blood vessel. Losing a huge amount of blood suddenly causes:\n\n【16】*   Fall in blood pressure as the amount of fluid left in the blood vessels is insufficient.\n    \n*   Reduction in oxygen supply of the body. This could lead to heart issues.\n    \n\n【17】3\\. **Chronic Blood Loss**: This is more common, such as that from nosebleeds and hemorrhoids, which are obvious, but small amounts of bleeding may not be noticed. This type of blood loss is known as occult (hidden). A significant amount of blood loss can happen over a large period.\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Anemia of Acute Blood Loss?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Symptoms are varied depending on mild to severe, such as fatigue, weakness, pale or yellowish skin color, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and cold extremities.\n\n【20】Further depends upon how much blood is lost and how rapidly blood is lost. The symptoms can be the following.\n\n【21】*   When the blood loss is rapid, over some hours or less, dropping just one-third of the blood can be fatal. Weakness upon sitting or standing after a period of lying down (orthostatic hypotension) is seen with rapid blood loss.\n    \n*   When the blood loss is slower, over weeks or longer, the loss of up to two-thirds of the blood volume may cause only fatigue and weakness or no symptoms at all if you drink enough fluids.\n    \n*   You may notice black, dark stools if you have bleeding from the stomach or small intestine. Bleeding from the kidneys or bladder may result in urine discoloration.\n    \n*   Women may notice long, heavier-than-usual menstrual periods.\n    \n\n【22】How to Diagnose Anemia of Acute Blood Loss?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   Blood tests.\n    \n*   Sometimes imaging or endoscopy is recommended.\n    \n*   Stool and urine are tested for blood to identify the source of injury, along with imaging or endoscopy.\n    \n*   Blood samples should be typed and cross-matched.\n    \n*   Complete blood count (CBC) to check the hemoglobin and hematocrit.\n    \n\n【24】In an actively bleeding patient, the hematocrit level on initial presentation could be normal.\n\n【25】How Is Anemia of Acute Blood Loss Treated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【26】1\\. **Initial Management:**\n\n【27】*   Evaluate ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation).\n    \n*   Prioritize any life-threatening conditions immediately.\n    \n*   Supplement oxygen.\n    \n*   Obtaining two large-bore intravenous (IV) lines.\n    \n*   IV fluid resuscitation.\n    \n*   Apply direct pressure to any bleeding spot to secure it.\n    \n\n【28】2. **Treatment:**\n\n【29】*   By arresting profuse blood loss, the source of the bleeding must be found and stopped. A blood transfusion may be required.\n    \n*   Supplementing iron, which is required to produce red blood cells, is lost as a result of bleeding. Iron is supplemented through tablets or intravenously.\n    \n*   All treatment for anemia depends on its underlying cause.\n    \n*   Other nutritional anemias, such as folate or vitamin B-12 deficiency, may result from a poor diet or from an inability to absorb them.\n    \n\n【30】Is Anemia Preventable?\n----------------------\n\n【31】Most forms of anemia cannot be prevented, but eating healthy foods can help you avoid and manage both iron and vitamin deficiency anemia. Especially those with high levels of iron (dark green leafy vegetables), vitamin B12 (meat), and folic acid (citrus juices). A daily multivitamin will also help prevent nutritional anemias; however, older adults should not take supplements unless instructed by their physicians.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Acute anemia occurs when there is a sharp drop in RBCs, hemolysis, or hemorrhage. The patients have to be admitted to the hospitals, prioritize the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation), and start rejuvenation. Send a blood sample to check for type and to detect other abnormalities; Initial management involves supplemental oxygen, obtaining IV access, intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation, and applying direct pressure to a bleeding spot.

It continuously moves blood throughout the body, providing oxygenated blood and nutrients to the other organs while also returning the deoxygenated blood to the lungs. A muscular organ, the heart has four chambers, namely atria (upper two chambers) and ventricles (lower two chambers), with one of each present on either side of the heart. The atria helps the ventricle fully load up before it ejects the blood away from the heart.\n\n【2】What Is the Right Ventricle and What Are Its Functions?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The right ventricle is the right lower chamber of the heart. It is a semilunar or crescent-shaped chamber (seen on the transverse section of the heart) and is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs through the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk, otherwise known as the pulmonary artery, is a blood vessel arising from the base of the right lower heart chamber, splitting into the right and left pulmonary arteries. It then carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it gets oxygenated. The right ventricle wall is thin as it pumps blood only to the lungs, whereas the left ventricle wall is much thicker because it has high pressure as it pumps blood to the entire body via the aorta. An interventricular septum separates both the right and left ventricles.\n\n【4】**What Is Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a medical condition in which the stroke volume increases even if there is an increased right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume. In simple words, it means an increase in the volume of blood pumped out of the left ventricle (LV) during each heart contraction (systole), even when there is an increase in the amount of blood within the ventricles when the heart contracts.\n\n【6】Is Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction the Same as a Right Ventricular (RV) Failure?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】A right ventricular (RV) dysfunction differs from a right ventricular (RV) failure. In a right ventricular (RV) failure, the stroke volume does not compensate or increase when there is an increase in the end-diastolic volume.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】A right ventricular (RV) dysfunction can elicit the following symptoms:\n\n【10】*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n    \n*   Chest pain.\n    \n*   Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Patients With COVID-19 at Higher Risk of Venous Thromboembolism- Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n    Cardiovascular Anesthesia - Significance and Test Procedures\n    \n    Sinus Venosus Atrial Septal Defect- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n    \n*   Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of fingertips and lips).\n    \n*   Swelling of the lower extremities (especially ankles and feet).\n    \n*   Lightheadedness.\n    \n*   Unusual fatigue or tiredness.\n    \n*   Fatigue and episodes of fainting during exercise or strenuous activity.\n    \n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction begins with an injury or stress to the tissues of the heart (myocardium). It can be conceptualized as a problem of poor contractility, pressure, volume overload, or a combination of the three. There are numerous causes for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, such as:\n\n【13】*   **Chronic Left-Sided Heart Failure** \\- A heart condition in which the left heart fails to efficiently pump blood to the body.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Hypertension** - A pulmonary hypertension is a critical condition wherein the pressure within the blood vessels associated with the heart and lungs is abnormally high.\n    \n*   **Pulmonary Emboli** - A condition in which the blood vessel in the lungs gets blocked, usually by a blood clot.\n    \n*   **Tricuspid Regurgitation** - A valvular heart disease wherein the valve present between the upper and lower right chambers of the heart fails to close properly.\n    \n*   **Hypoventilation** \\- Otherwise known as respiratory depression, it is a condition wherein an individual is unable to breathe properly, necessitating respiratory gas exchange.\n    \n*   **Tetralogy of Fallot** \\- A congenital heart disease characterized by four different forms of defects.\n    \n*   **Transposition of the Great Arteries** - A condition of the blood vessels associated with the heart, characterized by the switching in their anatomical positions.\n    \n*   **Ebstein’s Anomaly** - A type of congenital heart disorder associated with the tricuspid valve.\n    \n*   **Eisenmenger Syndrome** \\- A Eisenmenger syndrome is a syndrome that is characteristic of inefficient and improper blood flow in the lungs and heart.\n    \n\n【14】How Is Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Along with physical examination, several methods are available to assess the functioning of the right ventricle, such as:\n\n【16】*   **Cardiovascular Resonance Imaging (CMR):** Also referred to as the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test, is the standard gold test for the evaluation of the right ventricle. Magnetic and radio waves create detailed images of the heart and its associated structures.\n    \n\n【17】*   **Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG):** ECG is a rapid and painless test that assesses different heart conditions by recording electrical signals from the heart. Having multiple electrodes (otherwise known as tiny sensors) stuck to different parts of the body, recording the electrical conduction within the heart, which helps identify the extra heartbeats and helps locate the origin of the extra heartbeat too.\n    \n\n【18】*   **Cardiac Catheterization:** Cardiac catheterization or a traditional angiogram, has been a gold standard test for assessing the health of a human heart. It is an invasive technique that involves passing a catheter into the blood vessels (arteries). At times, doctors may advise a ‘contrast angiography.’ It consists of the use of a special dye, which is injected for the amplification of the images.\n    \n\n【19】*   **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE):** A test that helps examine the heart’s irregularities and associated structures with the help of ultrasound.\n    \n\n【20】*   **Stress Test:** A stress test is used for the analysis of the heart’s response when it is functioning at its peak, for instance, during an intense level of activity. It is done using an electrocardiogram and exercise devices such as a stationary bike.\n    \n\n【21】*   **Cardiac CT-Scan or Cardiac Computed Tomography Scan:** A non-invasive diagnostic imaging procedure that shows detailed images of the heart and its associated structures, such as blood vessels and valves. It gives more comprehensive scans when compared to those of traditional angiograms. Doctors may sometimes advise a ‘contrast cardiac CT scan.\n    \n\n【22】How Is a Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction Treated?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Management of a right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is done in several stages and is an amalgamation of percutaneous intervention for treatable causes, physical rehabilitation, and drug therapy. In the most severe cases, surgical intervention to place devices that aids proper functioning of the heart, or heart transplantation can also be done.\n\n【24】The main treatment goals are:\n\n【25】*   **To Increase the Contractility of the (RV) Right Ventricle** \\- This is done with the help of medications, increased oxygen supply, and exercise training.\n    \n\n【26】*   **Decrease the Volume Overload** - Medications such as Aldosterone, loop diuretics, etc., help to do so. Surgical interventions include the closure of the shunts.\n    \n\n【27】*   **Decrease the Right Ventricular (RV) Pressure Overload** \\- In severe cases, it can be managed by a procedure called ‘balloon dilation atrial septostomy (BDAS).’\n    \n\n【28】**What Are the Complications Associated With Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】If not treated, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction can lead to right ventricular (RV) failure (either eventually over the years or acutely). Right ventricular (RV) failure eventually leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a condition in which the right ventricle does not function properly, leading to further complications. It can be caused due to various reasons and has a good prognosis if intervened timely. it can be easily diagnosed through various methods such as ECG and cardiac CT scan. Certain medications helps in increasing the oxygen supply. proper care and regular checkups helps in bettering this condition.\n\n【32】Article Resources\n\n【33】*   Right ventricular failure  \n    https://www.escardio.org/Journals/E-Journal-of-Cardiology-Practice/Volume-14/Right-ventricular-failure\n*   Diagnosis and treatment of right ventricular dysfunction in congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7666946/", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It arises from the tedious stress of the extensor muscles and tendons during repetitive movements of the forearm and the wrist. These kinds of repetitive movements result in fatigue of the forearm, which leads to overloading of the tendon. This, in turn, causes pain and inflammation of the tendon called tendonitis. Further, it leads to a degenerative condition called tendinosis, which altogether results in tendon tearing.\n\n【2】Who Is Prone to Get Tennis Elbow or Lateral Epicondylitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Despite its name, this condition is more commonly associated with work-related repetitive elbow and wrist movements like washing clothes, wringing clothes, hammering, and carpentry than in tennis players. It is seen in people who vigorously do repetitive actions that use the forearm, hands, or wrist. The following are the group of people who are predisposed to tennis elbow:\n\n【4】*   Fencers.\n    \n*   Golfers.\n    \n*   Baseball players.\n    \n*   Squash players.\n    \n*   Bowlers.\n    \n*   Racquetball and pickleball players.\n    \n*   Butchers.\n    \n*   Manicurists.\n    \n*   Chefs.\n    \n*   Cleaners.\n    \n    Related Topics\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    Please tell some medication for elbow pain.\n    \n    An Unusual Cause For Refractory Lateral Elbow Pain\n    \n    Experiencing numbness and pain after elbow fracture treatment.

However, later stages usually require intervention in the form of steroid injection and then surgical treatment.\n\n【11】1\\. **Rest:** Giving adequate rest to the tendons aids in healing.\n\n【12】2\\. **Medications:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Naproxen and Ibuprofen help in reducing the pain and inflammation associated with lateral epicondylitis.\n\n【13】3\\. **Steroid Injections:** Corticosteroids are injected into the site of pain, which helps in relieving pain and inflammation. Ultrasound-guided steroid injections are given to a few individuals to determine the exact location of the injection site.\n\n【14】4\\. **Braces:** A counterforce brace can be worn to relieve the tension exerted on the muscles and tendons.\n\n【15】5\\. **Physical Therapy:** Physiotherapy exercises help in strengthening the muscles of the forearm and help in enhancing the grip. Ultrasound, massage, and muscle-stimulation techniques help reduce pain and inflammation and improve function.\n\n【16】6\\. **Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy:** With the help of this therapy, the scar tissue is broken down, leading to improved blood flow to the area of damage.\n\n【17】7\\. **Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy:** In this therapy, a little amount of blood is taken with the help of PRP injection, platelets are removed, and the concentrated platelets are injected with the help of an ultrasound.\n\n【18】8\\. **Minimally Invasive Tenotomy:** It is a minimally invasive procedure in which the degenerative tendon tissue is hydro-resected with the help of a needle device.\n\n【19】If the non-surgical therapies do not help, arthroscopic surgery, tendon repair, or tendon debridement is recommended. It takes around four to six months to recover from surgery.\n\n【20】How Is the Prognosis of Lateral Epicondylitis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Lateral epicondylitis is usually treated by non-surgical therapies in about 95% of people, and the symptoms typically subside in a period of six to 18 months. However, few might require surgery. After surgery, recovery of symptoms usually occurs in one year\n\n【22】How Can We Prevent Lateral Epicondylitis or Tennis Elbow?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   Warm-up before starting work by stretching wrists and arms.\n    \n*   Wear elbow braces.\n    \n*   Do not push hard with pain.\n    \n*   Strengthen wrist and forearm muscles by lifting weights.\n    \n\n【24】At times, certain unusual conditions of the lateral aspect of the elbow can mimic or co-exist with a tennis elbow and can cause refractory pain.\n\n【25】**Chronic Non-responsive Lateral Elbow Pain:**\n\n【26】The use of Duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in chronic refractory elbow pain, which does not respond to any other non-surgical and surgical therapies, is under study.\n\n【27】Here is a case report of a young female who had chronic non-responsive lateral elbow pain.\n\n【28】*   A 32-year old female, who is a household worker, presented with chronic pain in the lateral aspect of the left elbow that had not responded to repeated attempts at conservative treatment (rest, ice, and analgesics) and steroid injections.\n    \n\n【29】*   Her clinical examination, which included 10 degrees of flexion deformity (difficulty to straighten elbow fully), raised suspicion of intra-articular (joint) pathology.\n    \n\n【30】*   An MRI of the elbow revealed soft tissue growth in the humeroradial joint (elbow joint).\n    \n\n【31】*   A minor incision surgery was performed to expose the humeroradial joint through the Kocher approach.\n    \n\n【32】*   Humeroradial synovial plica (extension of the synovial fold) was identified and excised.\n    \n\n【33】*   A release of the extensor muscle origin was also performed to address the tennis elbow.\n    \n\n【34】*   The postoperative recovery of the patient was terrific, and her pain and movements improved.\n    \n\n【35】This report describes an unusual cause of lateral elbow pain that could be missed during the management of refractory tennis elbow.\n\n【36】This stresses the need for clinical suspicion and adequate assessment in such refractory patients to provide early functional improvement and pain relief.\n\n【37】Consult an orthopedician online for queries regarding chronic elbow pain --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/orthopaedician-and-traumatologist\n\n【38】Article Resources\n\n【39】*   refractory lateral epicondylitis  \n    https://www.science.gov/topicpages/r/refractory+lateral+epicondylitis\n*   Chronic lateral epicondylitis: challenges and solutions  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214594/\n*   Evaluation of Elbow Pain in Adults  \n    https://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0415/p649.html", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
