One of the most important ions is calcium. Calcium ions maintain various functions like muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and blood coagulation. The parathyroid hormone maintains the level of calcium ions. Any problem regarding this hormone is responsible for an imbalance in calcium ion functioning. Autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism or autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is one such disorder that disrupts the functioning of the parathyroid hormone and is responsible for calcium imbalance.\n\n【2】What Is Hypoparathyroidism?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】The parathyroid gland is one of the most important glands of the human body. This gland is located just behind the thyroid gland at the bottom of the neck. Chief cells of the parathyroid gland produce parathyroid hormone. This hormone plays a crucial role in calcium ion balance. In the kidney, this hormone is responsible for increased calcium ions reabsorption and decreased phosphate ions absorption. In the bone, this hormone is associated with the differentiation of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (cells associated with bone resorption). As s result, the release of the calcium ion from the bone is regulated. Parathyroid hormone synthesizes vitamin D and the absorption of calcium ions from the small intestine. The hypofunction of the parathyroid gland is known as hypoparathyroidism. Various conditions like surgical excision of the parathyroid glands, auto-immune diseases, and metabolic disorders can cause this. The genetic cause of hypoparathyroidism is known as isolated familial hypoparathyroidism. Autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism belongs to this group only.\n\n【4】What Is Autosomal Dominant Hypoparathyroidism?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism has three types: dominant, recessive, and X-linked trait. It is a rare condition that affects only 1 in 1000000 individuals. The dominant type of hypoparathyroidism can be divided into three types. These are:\n\n【6】**1\\. Autosomal-Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1** \\- This is caused by abnormal signaling of the CASR gene on chromosome 3q21. This mutation causes suppression of the secretion of parathyroid hormone. In this condition, the serum calcium level is low. But the level of phosphate in the blood remains high. The amount of calcium excreted from urine also increased in this condition. Another variation of this condition is Bartter syndrome type V. In this condition, the serum calcium level is also low. Additionally, serum potassium and magnesium levels remain low in this condition. This condition leads to metabolic alkalosis, which disrupts the body's acid-base balance.\n\n【7】**2\\. Autosomal-Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 2** - This is caused by the mutation of the alpha subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding protein G11 on chromosome 19p13. This mutation causes disruption of signaling to the PTH and CASR gene. Another type of this condition is caused by a mutation of glial cells missing-2 gene or GCM2 gene on chromosome 6p24.2. These genes are responsible for the development and functioning of the parathyroid gland. As a result of the mutation, the development and functioning of the gland are impaired.\n\n【8】**3\\. Autosomal-Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 3:** This is caused by a mutation of the P2S1 gene. This gene is associated with the regulation of CASR gene functioning. Mutation of the PTH gene is responsible for another type of familial hypoparathyroidism. This mutation disrupts the protein chain formation of the parathyroid hormone. Thus, defective formation of the parathyroid hormone takes place.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Sipple Syndrome - Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma - Types, Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Medullary Sponge Kidney - Pathogenesis, Etiology, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【14】What Is the Mechanism of Autosomal Dominant Hypoparathyroidism?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The main cause of familial hypocalciuric autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism is the inactivation of calcium-sensing receptors (CASR). These receptors are G-protein coupled glycoproteins that detect the level of calcium in the blood. It is expressed in tissues like kidneys, skeletal muscles, and parathyroid glands. This gene regulates the ion channels and maintains various functions like chemotaxis, proliferation, and differentiation. Through these actions, it maintains the calcium balance.\n\n【16】*   This gene maintains the release of the parathyroid hormone and the proliferation of the chief cells.\n\n【17】*   In the kidneys, this gene is present in the basolateral membrane of the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (u-shaped part of the nephron). Here it is responsible for the reabsorption of calcium and inhibits phosphate reabsorption.\n\n【18】*   Also, these genes activate vitamin D, which is responsible for calcium absorption.\n\n【19】*   In the bones, these genes are expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts and cause calcium release from the bone.\n\n【20】CASR maintains the parathyroid gland's set point for the secretion of parathyroid hormone. In the autosomal dominant type 1, the mutation causes decreased secretion of the parathyroid hormone and alteration of this set point. As a result, the excretion of calcium through urine is increased. Mutation of protein G11 is responsible for improper signaling to the CASR and disrupts its function. GCM2 genes are responsible for various functions and the development of the parathyroid gland. Mutation of these causes impaired DNA binding of the cells and loss of nuclear localization (a type of cellular signal). This causes decreased secretion of parathyroid hormone.\n\n【21】What Are the Clinical Features of Autosomal Dominant Hypoparathyroidism?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Patients develop mild symptoms in these cases. These are:\n\n【23】*   Mild fatigue and weakness.\n\n【24】*   Difficulty in movement, a history of frequent headaches, pain in the joints, and muscle pain.\n\n【25】*   Abdominal cramps.\n\n【26】*   Polyuria or increased volume of the urine.\n\n【27】*   Polydipsia or increased urge of thrust.\n\n【28】*   Developmental delays and temporary skeletal structures can be found. This is mainly seen in type 2 conditions.\n\n【29】On examination following things can be diagnosed:\n\n【30】*   **Chondrocalcinosis** - Deposition of calcium crystals in the cartilage, which causes cartilage mineralization.\n\n【31】*   **Osteomalacia** \\- The increased softness of the bones characterized by the presence of a small fracture line.\n\n【32】*   **Renal Stones** - Renal stones and calcification are common in type 1 conditions. In severe cases, renal failure can be observed.\n\n【33】How to Treat of Autosomal Dominant Hypoparathyroidism?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】If the patient is asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. For moderate to severely symptomatic cases following treatment is observed:\n\n【35】*   The application of thiazide diuretics lowers urinary calcium.\n\n【36】*   Injection of parathyroid hormone can also be given to check the calcium level.\n\n【37】*   Molecule allosteric modulators of the CASR, like Cinacalcet, help to activate CASR.\n\n【38】*   Vitamin D supplements can be given.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Autosomal dominant hypothyroidism is an extremely rare condition. This condition affects the secretion of parathyroid hormone levels and alters the calcium ion balance in the body. As a result, neuromuscular problems are noticed. In severe cases, renal failure may occur. Early diagnosis of pathological conditions can help cure this condition.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   National library of medicine - Physiology, Parathyroid  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482510/\n*   National library of medicine - Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (Hypoparathyroidism) Types 1 and 2  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5067375/\n*   Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c9cac894-5536-4fdf-95aa-c78a9c52883e", "title": "Pheochromocytoma - Prevalence, Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Pheochromocytoma - Prevalence, Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment\nWhat Is Pheochromocytoma?\n-------------------------\n\n【1】Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland. It is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that grows from chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. It results in increased secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and dopamine. These hormones are collectively called catecholamines. These hormones regulate heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. Most pheochromocytomas are benign, and they do not spread to other parts of the body. Only about ten percent of the pheochromocytomas turn malignant. About 80 % to 85 % of pheochromocytomas grow in the inner layer of the adrenal gland (adrenal medulla). And about 15 to 20 % develop outside of this area in the chest, heart, abdomen, pelvis, bladder, the base of the skull, etc. and are called paragangliomas.\n\n【2】How Common Is Pheochromocytoma?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】Most cases of pheochromocytomas affect people who are between 30 to 50 years of age. It is a rare condition, estimated to be occurring in only about eight in one million people. However, this ratio may be different because many pheochromocytoma cases go undiagnosed.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Pheochromocytoma?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Some patients with pheochromocytoma may be asymptomatic (do not develop or show any symptoms). However, hypertension, which can suddenly occur in 45 % of patients, is known to be a prominent symptom. These paroxysmal attacks may happen due to palpation of the tumor, posture change, massage, anesthesia, emotional trauma, abdominal compression, etc. These attacks may last from a few minutes to hours, and they often show a set of symptoms that include:\n\n【6】*   Increased blood pressure.\n\n【7】*   Increased palpitation of the heart.\n\n【8】*   Headaches.\n\n【9】*   Profuse sweating.\n\n【10】These symptoms occur due to excessive secretion of certain hormones known as catecholamines.\n\n【11】Other symptoms of pheochromocytoma are:\n\n【12】*   Chest pain.\n\n【13】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【14】*   Nausea or vomiting.\n\n【15】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【16】*   Epigastric pain.\n\n【17】*   Visual disturbance.\n\n【18】*   Constipation.\n\n【19】*   Pale skin.\n\n【20】*   Weight loss.\n\n【21】*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea).\n\n【22】*   Seizures.\n\n【23】*   Abnormally rapid breathing (tachypnea).\n\n【24】*   Diabetes.\n\n【25】*   Loss of sleep (insomnia).\n\n【26】*   Anxiety attacks.\n\n【27】What Causes Pheochromocytoma?\n-----------------------------\n\n【28】The exact cause of pheochromocytoma is unknown. Most cases occur sporadically for unknown reasons, but about 35 % of the total cases arise due to genetic changes to specific genes. Scientists have reported mutations in about 20 different genes that may lead to pheochromocytoma. In other cases, pheochromocytomas occur as part of a genetic syndrome, a disorder in which pheochromocytomas are secondary, along with other endocrine neoplasia.\n\n【29】Who Is More Affected by Pheochromocytoma?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【30】Pheochromocytomas affect males and females equally, and they may affect people at any age. However, the tumor occurs mainly between 30 to 50 years of age. And approximately ten percent of the total number of cases occur in children. Because most pheochromocytomas are undiagnosed, it is challenging to determine the incidence of the disease. In addition, people with rare inherited disorders are at a higher risk of pheochromocytoma, and tumors associated with these conditions are also more likely to be cancerous. Examples of such inherited diseases include:\n\n【31】*   **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2**\\- It is a hereditary condition that is primarily associated with three types of tumors which are medullary thyroid tumors, parathyroid tumors, and pheochromocytomas.\n\n【32】*   **Von-Hippel Lindau Disease**\\- It is an inherited disorder that results in the development of tumors and cysts in different parts of the body.\n\n【33】*   **Neurofibromatosis**\\- It is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to develop in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.\n\n【34】*   **Hereditary Paragangliomas Syndrome-** It is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of tumors called paragangliomas found in the paraganglia.\n\n【35】Does Pheochromocytoma Run in Families?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【36】About 25 % to 35 % of the total pheochromocytoma cases can be inherited, which means they are passed on from parents to children. In addition, some inherited pheochromocytomas may be associated with genetic variations like endocrine neoplasia, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, etc.\n\n【37】How Is Pheochromocytoma Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【38】Pheochromocytomas may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Therefore, a diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms cannot be 100 % accurate. However, a detailed study of the patient’s history is significant and a thorough clinical evaluation. Hence, the following test should be performed and symptoms evaluated.\n\n【39】1.  **Check for Paroxysmal Attacks**\\- Symptoms are episodic, and they may occur from several times a day to only a couple of times a month. On the other hand, paroxysmal attacks are intensified symptoms that last for a short period. The characteristic signs of a paroxysmal attack are high blood pressure, profuse sweating, irregular heartbeat, and headaches.\n\n【40】2.  **Laboratory Analysis of Blood or Urine**\\- Blood and urine analysis can easily confirm a diagnosis of a secreting pheochromocytoma by the increased levels of catecholamines or their metabolites in the blood or urine sample of the patient.\n\n【41】3.  **Imaging Tests**\\- Computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed to determine the location and size of the tumor. They also check if the tumor has spread to other body parts. Lobenguan I 123 injections and Gallium 68 Dotatate are imaging agents for detecting rare endocrine tumors in children.\n\n【42】4.  **Other Tests**\\- Other tests may include; adrenal biopsy, glucose test, metanephrine blood tests, abdominal positron emission tomography (PET) scan, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintiscan, etc.\n\n【43】How Is Pheochromocytoma Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【44】The treatment procedures for pheochromocytoma are determined by numerous factors; tumor size, tumor location, whether the tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous, if the tumor is localized or has spread to other body parts, patient’s age and health, etc. Therefore, the potential risks, side effects, and long-term effects on a patient’s health should be discussed beforehand. Treatment options include:\n\n【45】*   **Medications**\\- Symptomatic relief is given with the help of medicines such as alpha-blockers and beta-blockers to control high blood pressure during a paroxysmal attack. In cases where surgery cannot be done, medication is again used to control the high levels of hormones in the blood and manage their effect.\n\n【46】*   **Surgery-** It is generally the primary treatment modality for pheochromocytomas. Many cases are successfully treated by surgically removing the tumor from the patient’s body. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the most common surgical procedure. A small incision is made in the abdomen, a laparoscope is inserted, and the tumor is removed. Before surgery, the patient’s blood pressure and other vitals should be normalized with drugs.\n\n【47】*   **Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy**\\- Radiation and chemotherapy are done in patients where the tumor is cancerous and has spread to other body parts. However, these treatments are not very effective in treating the tumor.\n\n【48】What Is the Prognosis of Pheochromocytoma?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【49】The prognosis of the disease depends on the following factors:\n\n【50】1.  Location of the tumor.\n\n【51】2.  If the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.\n\n【52】3.  How much of the tumor has been surgically removed from the body.\n\n【53】Patients with small pheochromocytomas that have not spread to other body parts have a 95 % chance of a successful five-year survival rate. Patients with recurrent tumors or tumors that have spread to other body parts have a five-year survival rate of up to 60 %. People treated for pheochromocytomas should regularly see a doctor and get their testing done to ensure the tumor has not recurred.\n\n【54】**Conclusion:**\n\n【55】Pheochromocytomas are rare adrenal gland tumors that result in over secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Clinical symptoms like paroxysmal attacks characterize the condition. The tumor may affect men and women equally and affect people of any age. The state is often inherited. A timely diagnosis and treatment can help manage the tumor and prevent it from getting cancerous.\n\n【56】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【57】* * *\n\n【58】#### **1.**删除换行**What Triggers Pheochromocytoma Episodes?**\n\n【59】Pheochromocytoma-related symptom episodes can happen at any time. They may be triggered by:  \n\\- Physical exercise.  \n\\- Physical injury and pain.  \n\\- Anxiety or tension.  \n\\- Consuming coffee.  \n\\- Medical procedures like surgery or anesthesia.  \n\\- Consuming tyramine-rich foods, such as cheese, chocolate, dried meats, and red wine  \n\\- Urination in those who have a paraganglioma in the bladder.  \n\\- Childbirth.\n\n【60】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Hallmark Sign to Suspect Pheochromocytoma?**\n\n【61】Hypertension is the primary catecholamine-related symptom that leads doctors to suspect pheochromocytoma. There are four blood pressure patterns that are related to hypertension. Normotension, paroxysmal hypertension, sustained hypertension and sustained hypertension with paroxysms.\n\n【62】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Classic Clinical Manifestations of Pheochromocytoma?**\n\n【63】Pheochromocytoma typically manifests as episodes of hypertension and adrenergic symptoms, such as the classic triad of sweating, episodic headache, and tachycardia. However, pheochromocytoma symptoms can be persistent, sporadic, or both, and they can also worsen. Activities, environmental factors, foods high in tyramine, a compound that affects blood pressure, and medications can all cause these spells.\n\n【64】#### **4.**删除换行**Can Pheochromocytoma Subside on Its Own?**\n\n【65】Pheochromocytoma is an uncommon adrenal gland tumor that does not subside on its own. The symptoms typically include pallor, flushing, tremors, headaches, and sweating, but they can have highly variable spells with unique symptoms each time. If a pheochromocytoma is left untreated, other body systems may suffer severe or life-threatening damage.\n\n【66】#### **5.**删除换行**Can a Blood Test Diagnose Pheochromocytoma?**\n\n【67】Increased levels of catecholamines or their metabolites in the patient's blood or urine sample can easily confirm the diagnosis of a secreting pheochromocytoma. The diagnosis of pheochromocytomas based on clinical signs and symptoms is not always accurate. However, a thorough clinical evaluation and a thorough study of the patient's history are important.\n\n【68】#### **6.**删除换行**Who Is at Risk of Contracting Pheochromocytoma?**\n\n【69】Pheochromocytomas can affect anyone at any age and affect both men and women equally. However, the tumor mostly affects people in their 30s to 50s. Additionally, children account for about 10 % of all cases. Most pheochromocytomas go undiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate the disease's prevalence. Additionally, pheochromocytoma is more common in people with rare inherited disorders, and tumors linked to these conditions are more likely to be cancerous.\n\n【70】#### **7.**删除换行**What Causes Pheochromocytoma?**\n\n【71】Pheochromocytoma's precise cause is unknown. Most cases are sporadic for unknown reasons, but genetic changes to particular genes bring on about 35 % of all cases. About 20 different genes have been reported to have mutations that may cause pheochromocytoma. In other instances, pheochromocytomas develop as a genetic syndrome, a condition in which they develop secondarily to other endocrine neoplasia.  \n   \n \n\n【72】#### **8.**删除换行**Can Pheochromocytomas Be Malignant?**\n\n【73】A pheochromocytoma is a rare, typically benign (noncancerous) tumor that appears in the adrenal gland. However, pheochromocytomas are malignant in at least 10 % of cases. If a pheochromocytoma is left untreated, other body systems may suffer serious or life-threatening damage.\n\n【74】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Origin of the Name “Pheochromocytoma”?**\n\n【75】Pheochromocytoma refers to the color tumor cells take on when stained with chromium salts; phios means dusky, chroma means color, and cytoma means tumor in Greek. It is a rare adrenal gland tumor. The symptoms typically include pallor, flushing, tremors, headaches, and sweating, but they can have extremely variable spells with unique symptoms each time.\n\n【76】#### **10.**删除换行**Can Pheochromocytoma Affect Sleep?**\n\n【77】Yes, pheochromocytoma can cause insomnia or loss of sleep. The other symptoms include Increased appetite, loss of weight, elevated blood pressure, abdominal pain, disrupted vision, constipation, pale skin, breathing difficulty (dyspnea), seizures, tachypnea, etc. which can be constant or sporadic.\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pheochromocytoma  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-endocrine-tumor/pheochromocytoma\n*   Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/pheochromocytoma/\n*   NIH: Medical management of pheochromocytoma: Role of the endocrinologist  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230088/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is done in patients with vestibular disorders. It involves a series of exercises done so as to improve the symptoms of vestibular disorder, such as dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, and falls. A customized exercise plan is made to assess the laboratory findings, clinical assessment, and other tests performed. This exercise plan will vary from patient to patient on the severity of the symptoms and on the age of the patient.\n\n【2】The recovery from the disease will vary and depend upon activity level, pain, and other medical conditions. For people with a vestibular disorder, there is no permanent treatment, but this exercise will help the body get adjusted to it. This is because the brain will learn to use the other senses, like vision and body sense, to compensate for the deficient vestibular system. For most people, the compensation will happen on its own over time, but for some people, this will not happen, and in such people, vestibular rehabilitation will help to overcome this.\n\n【3】What Are the Indications for Vestibular Rehabilitation?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Vestibular rehabilitation is indicated in patients with dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's syndrome, imbalance, vertigo, neck-related dizziness, stroke, brain injury, and migraines.\n\n【5】The symptoms which can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation are:\n\n【6】*   Imbalance and need to take support while walking so as not to fall.\n\n【7】*   Neck stiffness and pain.\n\n【8】*   Vertigo (the feeling that the environment around is spinning).\n\n【9】*   Generalized dizziness.\n\n【10】*   Frequent falls.\n\n【11】*   Headache.\n\n【12】For rehabilitation, the following are assessed:\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Immediate Prosthetic Rehabilitation in Implant Dentistry</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Vestibular Disorders - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment Maneuvers</u>\n\n【18】*   The way you walk (gait).\n\n【19】*   Visual stability and mobility.\n\n【20】*   Neck mobility and neck and arm strength.\n\n【21】*   Positional testing.\n\n【22】*   Inner exam.\n\n【23】*   Balance.\n\n【24】*   Leg strength/ flexibility.\n\n【25】After the evaluation, a treatment plan is made. The objective of the treatment is to limit the symptom so that it does not affect the day-to-day living of the patients and reduce the risk of falling and hence, improve the quality of life.\n\n【26】What Are the Types of Exercises Included in Vestibular Rehabilitation?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Depending on the vestibular-related problem, there are three principal methods of exercise, they are:\n\n【28】*   Habituation.\n\n【29】*   Gaze stabilization.\n\n【30】*   Balance training.\n\n【31】**1) Habituation Exercise**\n\n【32】Habituation exercises are designed to treat patients with dizziness upon sudden movement. Habituation exercises are aimed at addressing the dizziness caused due to self-motion or visual stimuli. This exercise is indicated in patients who feel dizzy upon sudden head movements, like when they suddenly bend or look upwards. This is appropriate for patients who complain of increased dizziness in visually stimulating environments like shopping malls and grocery shops when watching tv and when walking over patterned floors or shiny carpets and shiny floors. The goal of this exercise is to reduce dizziness through repeated exposure to the causative factors. What they do in these exercises is to provoke the patient's symptoms of dizziness. Over time the brain learns to adjust to the stimuli.\n\n【33】**2) Gaze Stabilization**\n\n【34】The objective of this exercise is to improve eye stability on stationary objects while the head is moving. It will help to control eye movements. These patients will feel like the world appears to bounce or jump around when trying to identify the objects in the environment.\n\n【35】The therapist will make you do the following exercises in order to assess the patient and to decide which exercise suits the patient.\n\n【36】*   Look straight and fix your eye on an alphabet at eye level in front of you.\n\n【37】*   Turn your head side to side, keeping your eyes stable on the alphabet, increase the speed of your head movement and slow down when you feel too dizzy.\n\n【38】*   Repeating the exercises for a longer time brings on mild to moderate symptoms; on repeated doing, the time duration till the symptom appears will increase. Gradually the patient will be able to do it three to five times per day.\n\n【39】**3) Balance Training Exercises**\n\n【40】Balance training exercises are done to improve steadiness so that patients can lead normal lives. Exercises are designed so as to address the underlying different balance problems. The aim of these exercises is to improve the patients' stability while walking and to reduce fall risks. For patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), this type of exercise is not suitable as these exercises will not resolve this condition.\n\n【41】What to Expect From Vestibular Rehabilitation?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The vestibular rehabilitation therapy is done on an outpatient basis. The patient is consulted by a licensed physical therapist. Prior to the treatment, detailed case history is taken, and other assessments are done. Also, the therapist will take the details of how the condition is affecting the daily living of the patient. Other than that, they will collect information about medications, hearing or vision problems, and other medical conditions. Depending upon all these factors, exercises are custom-designed for each patient. Expected vestibular rehabilitation outcomes include:\n\n【43】*   Decreased risk of falling.\n\n【44】*   Decreased dizziness.\n\n【45】*   Improved balance.\n\n【46】*   Improved ability to stabilize the vision.\n\n【47】*   Increased confidence in maintaining balance while walking or doing other activities.\n\n【48】*   Improved neck movements and reduced symptoms.\n\n【49】How Successful Is Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Vestibular rehabilitation therapy has good outcomes for patients suffering from vestibular disorders. Sometimes vestibular rehabilitation is the only treatment required, and in some other cases, it might be advised pre or post-surgery. Patients who follow the instructions given by the therapist in a proper way seem to have good results on balance and dizziness problems.\n\n【51】What Factors Can Impact the Recovery?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【52】For patients undergoing vestibular rehabilitation, various factors can impact the results. The following is discussed below:\n\n【53】*   For patients with progressive vestibular disorders like multiple sclerosis, migraine, and Meniere's syndrome, success with VR is difficult as compensation can be difficult to achieve.\n\n【54】*   Whether one or both the ear is affected.\n\n【55】*   The problem lies within the vestibular part of the brain rather than the vestibular part of the ear.\n\n【56】*   Sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【57】*   Pain.\n\n【58】*   Presence of other medical conditions.\n\n【59】*   Certain medications.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**\n\n【61】Vestibular rehabilitation is a set of exercises that are advised for patients having vestibular-related problems. These exercises are designed by a specially trained vestibular physical therapist. These exercises advised are specifically designed for each patient according to the condition suffering and also depend upon the patient's other conditions. These patients suffering from dizziness and balance-related problems will learn to get adjusted and have a better quality of life.\n\n【62】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【63】* * *\n\n【64】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Vestibular Problems?**\n\n【65】Vertigo and dizziness are the two symptoms of vestibular problems. The symptoms include disorientation, blurred vision, and spinning sensations. Less common symptoms include anxiety, fear, nausea, vomiting, and arrhythmia.\n\n【66】#### **2.**删除换行**What Differentiates Vertigo From Vestibular Balance Disorder?**\n\n【67】Vertigo is a symptom of vestibular balance disorder, and it feels like spinning due to loss of vestibular balance control. In contrast, vestibular balance disorder arises as a result of infection or injury to the inner ear.\n\n【68】#### **3.**删除换行**What Causes Vestibular Balance Disorders?**\n\n【69】Vestibular disorders affect orientation and balance. Factors that affect vestibular balance include infections, certain medications, traumatic injury to the brain, poor circulation in the ear, and calcium debris in the semicircular canals. The other factors include aging, genetics, and environmental problems.\n\n【70】#### **4.**删除换行**What Does Vestibular Rehabilitation Include?**\n\n【71】Vestibular rehabilitation involves exercises depending on the vestibular-related problem. The exercises include habituation, gaze stabilization, and balance training. The exercises are designed to treat patients with dizziness, improve eye stability on stationary objects while the head is moving, and improve steadiness so patients can lead normal lives.\n\n【72】#### **5.**删除换行**How To Perform Vestibular Rehabilitation?**\n\n【73】Vestibular rehabilitation involves three types of exercises depending on the cause.   \n  - Habituation exercise is indicated in patients who feel dizzy upon sudden head movements, like when they suddenly bend or look upwards. This is appropriate for patients who complain of increased dizziness in visually stimulating environments like shopping malls and grocery shops when watching Tv and walking over patterned floors or shiny carpets and shiny floors. In these exercises, the therapist provokes the patient's symptoms of dizziness, and over time the brain learns to adjust to the stimuli.  \n\\- The gaze stabilization exercise involves the following steps:  \n  - Look straight and fix your eye on an alphabet at eye level in front of you.  \n  - Turn your head side to side, keeping your eyes stable on the alphabet, increase the speed of your head movement and slow down when you feel too dizzy.  \n  - Repeating the exercises for a longer time brings on mild to moderate symptoms; on repeated doing, the time duration till the symptom appears will increase. - Gradually the patient will be able to do it three to five times per day.  \n  - Balance training exercises are done to improve steadiness so that patients can lead normal lives. Exercises are designed to address the underlying different balance problems. The aim of these exercises is to improve the patients' stability while walking and to reduce fall risks.\n\n【74】#### **6.**删除换行**Do Vestibular Problems Cause Tiredness?**\n\n【75】The symptoms of vestibular balance disorders include fatigue, poor concentration, nausea, hearing loss, and ringing in the ear.  The vestibular nerve sends sensory messages to the brain and maintains the body's posture and balance. Swelling or trauma to the vestibular nerve can cause dizziness and vertigo. One might also feel tired.\n\n【76】#### **7.**删除换行**Is Vestibular Rehabilitation Efficacious?**\n\n【77】Vestibular rehabilitation focuses on treating the symptoms of vestibular disorders such as dizziness, vertigo, gaze instability, imbalance, visual disturbances, and falls. There is evidence that proves vestibular rehabilitation is effective in improving the quality of life in patients with vestibular disturbances. Visual rehabilitation also treats secondary symptoms such as decreased stamina, muscle, joint stiffness, and worsening of the previous symptoms.\n\n【78】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is The Time Taken for Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy to Work?**\n\n【79】Vestibular rehabilitation therapy has good outcomes for patients suffering from vestibular disorders. Sometimes vestibular rehabilitation is the only treatment required, and in some other cases, it might be advised pre or post-surgery. Patients who follow the instructions properly given by the therapist have good results with balance and dizziness problems within 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n【80】#### **9.**删除换行**Why Do I Suffer From Dizziness After Vestibular Therapy?**\n\n【81】Vestibular rehabilitation involves adapting the brain to new patterns to resolve vestibular balance disorders' symptoms. After doing the vestibular exercise, the brain attempts to adapt to it, and hence, many people may suffer from increased but manageable dizziness and fatigue. Sometimes, vestibular exercises can affect the neck causing neck problems and can make you feel worse.\n\n【82】#### **10.**删除换行**Can Vestibular Exercises Be Overdone?**\n\n【83】Vestibular rehabilitation exercises can cause manageable nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. As these exercises affect the brain, one should not overdo them. Also, the span of exercises depends on the severity of dizziness. So, it must not be overdone.\n\n【84】#### **11.**删除换行**How Is Living With Vestibular Disorders?**\n\n【85】People with vestibular disorders can easily fatigue in a crowded environment, so they must avoid bright lights, altitude changes, and rapid movements. People with ear infections suffer from altitude changes, so flights must be avoided for traveling. People with vestibular disorders also suffer from vision problems, so powerful and progressive lenses should be avoided.\n\n【86】#### **12.**删除换行**Can You Do Vestibular Therapy at Home?**\n\n【87】Vestibular exercises are prescribed based on the diagnosis and severity of the condition by the occupational therapist. Home-based exercises help treat vestibular balance disorders. Therefore, home-based exercises must be done as and when prescribed by the therapist.\n\n【88】#### **13.**删除换行**How to Relax a Vestibular Nerve?**\n\n【89】The vestibular nerve can be calmed down by vestibular suppressing drugs, which are not to be taken for more than three days. These drugs include Diazepam, Lorazepam, and Meclizine. These drugs reduce dizziness and are not recommended for long-term use.\n\n【90】#### **14.**删除换行**What Are the Effects of Vestibular Disorder on the Eyes?**\n\n【91】A common problem associated with vestibular disorder is a vision problem. People with visual disturbances cannot focus on a particular object. They have spinning sensations called vertigo, vision bounce or oscillopsia, and double vision or diplopia. To treat vision problems, the first approach must be made to treat the type of vestibular disorder. The treatment generally involves medication, physical therapy, or surgery.\n\n【92】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【93】无关删除-1:<u>*   Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy: Review of Indications, Mechanisms, and Key Exercises  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259492/\n*   Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT)  \n    https://vestibular.org/article/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/vestibular-rehabilitation-therapy-vrt/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Favus is a severe chronic inflammatory dermatophyte fungal infection caused by Trichophyton schoenleinii. It is a kind of tinea capitis found worldwide. Currently, it is seen in some areas of Asia and Africa. Trichophyton violaceum or Microsporum species may also cause favus. Favus is seen as yellow saucer-shaped crusts consisting of scales around hair follicles, severe hair loss, and scarring causes psychosocial problems. It may also infect the bare skin and nails.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Favus?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Tinea Capitis Favosa**\n\n【4】    *   Favus is the severe form of tinea capitis. It has a subtle course without an acute phase, leading to the diagnosis delay. In most cases, favus starts as folliculocentric erythemato-squamous areas. If these areas are removed, they progress to a cup-shaped yellow crust on the scalp with dull gray hair with underlying erythema called scutulum. As the disease progresses, many scutula fuse, covering more than one-third of the scalp. The infected hair will fall out, causing extensive permanent alopecia, atrophy, and scarring.\n\n【5】    *   Affected skin smells with a mousy odour or cheesy. Secondary bacterial infections may cause pus formation and lymph node enlargement.\n\n【6】*   **Favus of the Bare Skin**\n\n【7】    *   Tinea favosa of the bare skin and nails are seen only in 7 % of cases. Clinically, the favus of the bare skin presents as papulovesicular and/or papulosquamous circinate eruptions with typically evident scutula. The crusts may be large and multiple, commonly affecting the scrotum. Skin atrophy may be observed in affected areas.\n\n【8】*   **Onychomycosis Favosa**\n\n【9】    *   2.4 % of cases of favus showed nail involvement. Individuals are infected when they accidentally hurt their fingernails when epilating an infected scalp. Favus of fingernails was the major source of scalp reinfection when patients were treated by radiotherapy.\n\n【10】*   **Generalized Favus**\n\n【11】    *   Generalized favus is rare, representing only 0.1 % of tinea favosa cases. It is seen in poor and rural areas. Clinical presentations include mucous involvement, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, keratitis, and endophthalmitis.\n\n【12】*   **Atypical Presentation**\n\n【13】    *   Atypical scutula favus includes pityroid, impetiginous, follicular, papyroid, and psoriasiform forms without alopecia. The atypical presentations have a delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【14】Some other forms of favus are:\n\n【15】*   **Favus pityroides:** Mimics dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n\n【16】*   **Favus papyroides:** Small spot on the scalp covered by a delicate substance.\n\n【17】*   **Favus psoriasiformis:** Psoriasis\\-imitating favus.\n\n【18】*   **Favus impetigoides:** Yellow crusts that imitate impetigo lesions.\n\n【19】*   **Favus follicularis:** Cone-shaped wax-colored bumps around the hair follicles.\n\n【20】*   **Favus herpetiformis:** Round, red, scaling plaques with small papules, pustles, vesicles, and crusts found on the trunk and extremities.\n\n【21】What Causes Favus?\n------------------\n\n【22】Trichophyton schoenleinii is the cause of 95 % of favus cases.\n\n【23】Rarely occurring species include:\n\n【24】*   **Zoophilic species -** Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton verrucosum.\n\n【25】*   **Geophilic species -** Microsporum gypseum.\n\n【26】*   **Anthropophilic species -** Trichophyton violaceum.\n\n【27】Who Does Favus Affect?\n----------------------\n\n【28】Favus affects both males and females of all age groups. But the higher incidence is seen in the following groups.\n\n【29】*   **Boys -** Shorter hair allows easy entry for circulating spores.\n\n【30】*   **Menopausal women -** As the blood estrogen levels decrease, sebaceous glands shrink.\n\n【31】What Are the Clinical Features of Favus?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Favus is characterized by yellow cup-shaped crusts (scutula) that group together, forming a honeycomb pattern. Each crust surrounds a hair strand, which pierces the center and pokes out. There are three stages in favus based on its severity.\n\n【33】They are,\n\n【34】*   **Stage 1:** Red and inflamed areas around the hair follicles on the scalp. Hair stays intact.\n\n【35】*   **Stage 2:** Yellow cup-shaped crusts (scutula) and hair start to fall out.\n\n【36】*   **Stage 3:** One-third of the scalp is affected with widespread hair loss, atrophy, and scarring.\n\n【37】The scutula forms dense plaques that often harbor secondary bacterial infection. Removal of the plaques leaves a red, swollen, moist base.\n\n【38】What Is the Test to Diagnose Favus?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【39】Favus is diagnosed with the following tests:\n\n【40】1.  Skin scraping.\n\n【41】2.  Direct microscopic examination.\n\n【42】3.  Fungal culture.\n\n【43】4.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is an alternate test when fungal culture is unsuccessful.\n\n【44】How Is Favus Treated?\n---------------------\n\n【45】Favus treatment involves oral, topical antifungal agents and local therapies.\n\n【46】*   **Systemic Treatment:**\n\n【47】    *   Griseofulvin is effective for Trichophyton schoenleinii infection. Oral Terbinafine, Itraconazole or Fluconazole is also prescribed. Due to the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of Griseofulvin, newer antifungal drugs like Terbinafine and Azoles are recommended.\n\n【48】*   **Topical Agents:**\n\n【49】    *   Additionally, topical agents like 2% Ketoconazole or Isoconazole and 2.5% Selenium sulfide shampoos may be helpful. These shampoos, foam gel, lotion, and spray are applied twice a day.\n\n【50】*   **Local Treatment:**\n\n【51】    *   Remove the debris and crusts from the scalp and clean the scalp regularly.\n\n【52】    *   Cut off hair around the alopecia patches.\n\n【53】    *   Nail involvement requires more prolonged therapy.\n\n【54】Repeated negative fungal cultures confirm the success of therapy.\n\n【55】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Favus?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【56】The differential diagnosis of scalp favus is similar to that of tinea capitis. Similar other lesions include:\n\n【57】*   **Amiantacea tinea -** Is a red and itchy scalp in which a thick, adherent scale infiltrates and surrounds the base of scalp hairs.\n\n【58】*   **Kerion celsi -** An acute inflammatory process caused by the host response to a fungal ringworm infection of the hair follicles of the scalp.\n\n【59】*   **Impetigo -** Bacterial infection affecting the superficial skin.\n\n【60】*   **Sarcoidosis -** A disease characterized by the growth of small collections of inflammatory cells in any part of the body.\n\n【61】*   Squamous cell carcinoma involving the skin.\n\n【62】*   **Seborrheic dermatitis –** Not seen in children before puberty.\n\n【63】*   Psoriasis is not common in children, in whom favus is most prevalent; psoriasis involves the occipital scalp and/or other skin or nail involvement.\n\n【64】*   Atopic dermatitis is a universal disorder involving the flexural body parts in school children.\n\n【65】*   **Lichen planopilaris –** An unusual condition causing scarring alopecia, associated with lichen planus on areas of the skin or mucosa.\n\n【66】*   **Discoid lupus erythematosus –** An extremely unusual condition in children involving areas of the head and neck and associated with sun sensitivity.\n\n【67】*   **Folliculitis decalvans –** A form of purulent scarring.\n\n【68】*   **Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia –** A form of scarring alopecia most common in middle-aged women with a history of chemical or thermal hair straightening.\n\n【69】What Are the Risk Factors for Favus?\n------------------------------------\n\n【70】The risk factors of favus include:\n\n【71】*   Sharing towels, clothing, combs, and hairbrushes from infected persons.\n\n【72】*   Poverty.\n\n【73】*   Poor hygiene and malnutrition.\n\n【74】*   Little access to health care.\n\n【75】*   Overcrowding.\n\n【76】*   Immunocompromised patients.\n\n【77】*   Virulence of the specific dermatophyte.\n\n【78】What Are the Complications of Favus?\n------------------------------------\n\n【79】*   Permanent alopecia.\n\n【80】*   Stigmatization.\n\n【81】*   Disfigurement.\n\n【82】*   Side effects of treatment.\n\n【83】*   Social withdrawal.\n\n【84】*   Psychological impairment in children.\n\n【85】**Conclusion:**\n\n【86】Favus is a severe clinical type of tinea capitis. It is a chronic mutilating disease with profound familial and social implications. The treatment outcome varies depending on the stage at which the condition is diagnosed. With early diagnosis and proper therapeutic management, favus can be cured without consequences. However, late treatment leads to the ultimate scarring hair loss in all clinical presentations.\n\n【87】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【88】* * *\n\n【89】#### **1.**删除换行**How Is Favus Treated?**\n\n【90】Favus treatment involves oral, topical antifungal agents and local therapies. Griseofulvin is the treatment of choice and is effective for Trichophyton schoenleinii infection. Additionally, topical agents like 2 % Ketoconazole or Isoconazole and 2.5 % Selenium sulfide shampoos may help treat favus.\n\n【91】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Favus Contagious?**\n\n【92】Favus is a severe chronic inflammatory dermatophyte fungal infection caused by Trichophyton schoenleinii. Favus is seen as yellow saucer-shaped crusts consisting of scales around hair follicles; severe hair loss and scarring cause psychosocial problems. It may also infect the bare skin and nails. And it is not highly contagious but still can be transmitted through contacts with infected surfaces and individuals.\n\n【93】#### **3.**删除换行**What Causative Agent Causes Favus?**\n\n【94】Trichophyton schoenleinii is the cause of 95 % of favus cases. Rarely occurring species include:  \n - Zoophilic species - Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton verrucosum.  \n - Geophilic species - Microsporum gypseum.  \n - Anthropophilic species - Trichophyton violaceum.\n\n【95】#### **4.**删除换行**Is It a Favus Ringworm?**\n\n【96】Favus is the severe form of tinea capitis. It has a subtle course without an acute phase, leading to the diagnosis delay. Tinea capitis is a fungal skin infection affecting the skin and hair. The causative agent is the scalp ringworm.\n\n【97】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is Alopecia Caused By?**\n\n【98】Hair loss or alopecia is a common condition faced by people of all ages. There are various causes of hair loss. Endocrine disorders and subsequent hormone imbalances can cause hair loss. Hypothyroidism is the most common cause of alopecia.\n\n【99】#### **6.**删除换行**Can Alopecia Be Cured?**\n\n【100】Treatment of hair loss depends on the cause of hair loss. Hence, a detailed evaluation is necessary in case of hair loss. Minoxidil is the first line of treatment in androgenetic alopecia. This medicine increases the blood supply to hair follicles and promotes hair growth. In addition, hair nutrient pills such as biotin and zinc are essential for hair growth.\n\n【101】#### **7.**删除换行**Does Stress Cause Alopecia?**\n\n【102】Telogen effluvium is a stress-induced hair loss. Hair loss will be seen after two to three months of stressful episodes. Stress can be physical stress (illness, malaria, typhoid, surgeries, excessive bleeding, crash diet, after childbirth) or mental stress (exams, grief, depression). Usually, 10 % of hair will be under the telogen (resting) phase.\n\n【103】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Alopecia a Nutritional Deficiency?**\n\n【104】Nutritional alopecia is caused by nutritional deficiency. Protein-energy malnutrition, deficiency in zinc, biotin, essential fatty acid, malabsorption syndromes, and anemia can cause hair loss.\n\n【105】#### **9.**删除换行**What Are the Three Types of Alopecia?**\n\n【106】Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also called patterned alopecia, is seen in both men and women. It is a hormonal, progressive condition with genetic influence. Factors that cause telogen effluvium can be stress, hormonal changes medications and other underlying medical issues. Hair loss will be seen after two to three months of stressful episodes. Alopecia areata is characterized by Smooth “patchy” hair loss; it can affect scalp hair, eyebrow, beard, and mustache.\n\n【107】#### **10.**删除换行**What Does Alopecia Look Like?**\n\n【108】In men, hair loss will be seen on both sides of the temporal scalp and over the vertex (center of the scalp). In addition, men will notice hair fall, delayed hair growth, thinning of hair diameter, visibility of scalp skin, initially over frontal area and vertex. Male pattern baldness can also be seen in women presenting as baldness over the frontal scalp and vertex.\n\n【109】#### **11.**删除换行**What Causes Alopecia in Females?**\n\n【110】In women, the pattern of hair loss is different from men. Here they notice thinning of hair, visibility of scalp limited to the central scalp, around the parting line. Trichotillomania is a condition that is more common in women than in men. There will be an unintentional yet conscious pulling of one’s hair. It is an impulse control disorder.\n\n【111】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【112】无关删除-1:<u>*   Favus  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/favus\n*   Favus  \n    https://europepmc.org/article/nbk/nbk559024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A specialized doctor who performs image-guided procedures is called an interventional radiologist.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Equipment Needed for Interventional Radiology?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Interventional radiology usually requires:\n\n【4】*   **Guided Wire -** Guided wire is used to guide the catheters. It is inserted into the hollow needle at the target site of diagnosis or treatment.\n\n【5】*   **Puncture Needles -** A puncture needle provides a way for the catheter through the skin into the blood vessels.\n\n【6】*   **Catheter -** A catheter is a flexible, thin, hollow tube inserted into the blood vessels.\n\n【7】*   **Stent -** A small metal tube connected to the end of the catheter to be placed into the narrowed blood vessels.\n\n【8】*   **Deflated Balloons -** Deflated balloons are connected to the end of the catheter and are placed in the blood vessels, which will be removed after dilatation of the blood vessels by inflation.\n\n【9】*   **Coils -** Coils are usually made of titanium used to stop the blood flow by creating a blood clot.\n\n【10】What Are the Imaging Techniques Used in Interventional Radiology?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   X-rays such as fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT).\n\n【12】*   Ultrasound.\n\n【13】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【14】What Are the Types of Interventional Radiology?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Interventional radiology is widely used in many diagnostic and treatment procedures.\n\n【16】Based on their use, it is classified into:\n\n【17】*   Diagnostic, interventional radiology.\n\n【18】*   Therapeutic interventional radiology.\n\n【19】**1) Diagnostic Interventional Radiology:**\n\n【20】Diagnostic IR is used in the detection of various abnormalities in the body. This procedure involves the image-guided biopsy for diagnosis or administering contrast material into the body for the detection of structural and functional abnormalities of hollow structures.\n\n【21】*   **Angiography:** Angiography is an imaging technique in which a catheter is placed through a small cut into the artery. After that, the contrast agent is injected through the catheter, and a series of X-rays are taken as the contrast agent passes through the blood vessels.\n\n【22】*   **Biopsy:** The biopsy is a diagnostic procedure in which imaging techniques are used to guide the process of collecting sample tissues from the body, which will be later viewed under a microscope.\n\n【23】**2) Therapeutic Interventional Radiology:**\n\n【24】*   **Balloon Angioplasty and Stent Placement:** This procedure is used to treat narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into the arteries through a small opening under the guidance of an imaging technique. The catheter has a deflated balloon with or without a stent at its end. Then the balloon is inflated at the blocked area, which makes the artery enlarged, and sometimes the stent is placed in the artery to hold the artery open, which improves blood flow.\n\n【25】*   **Embolization:** Embolization is a medical procedure that uses gelatin sponges or beads (embolic agents) to block the blood vessels.\n\n【26】*   **Uterine Fibroid Embolization:** In this procedure, under the guidance of an X-ray, usually fluoroscopy (X-ray video), they insert a catheter through the skin incision into the artery in the groin or wrist and advance it to the uterine artery. Small plastic or gelatin particles called embolic agents (polyvinyl alcohol \\[PVA\\] will be injected into the blood vessels that supply uterine fibroids. These particles block the tiny blood vessels supplying fibroids and make the fibroids shrink and die. This procedure is done in both the right and left uterine arteries through the same incision.\n\n【27】*   **Chemoembolization:** Chemoembolization, also known as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), has a contrast material (a special dye) injected into the catheter to locate the tumor site. Later, a mixture of anti-cancer medicine and embolic agents is injected into the catheter placed in the artery that supplies the tumor. This procedure blocks the blood vessels supplying the tumor.\n\n【28】*   **Cryoablation:** During this procedure, a thin needle called a cryoprobe is inserted through the skin directly into the cancer site. After that, the liquid nitrogen or argon gas is pumped into the probe, which freezes the cancer cells and destroys them.\n\n【29】*   **Vertebroplasty:** Vertebroplasty is a procedure in which a hollow tube called a trocar is inserted from the skin incision through the spinal muscles to the fractured vertebra. After that, the orthopedic cement is injected into the broken site, which will fix them.\n\n【30】*   **Gastrostomy:** For the gastrostomy procedure, two minor cuts are placed on the belly. A laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts, and through the other cut, a gastrostomy or G tube (feeding tube) is inserted into the stomach, which provides nutrition.\n\n【31】*   **Radiofrequency Ablation:** This procedure uses a probe that is inserted through the catheter under the guidance of an imaging technique, from which heat is generated by radio waves that kill the cancer cells.\n\n【32】*   **Inferior Vena Cava Filter:** For IVC placement, a catheter is passed through the small cut to the target area. After this, an IVC filter (a small metal filter) is placed in the blood vessel, which stops the blood clot from reaching the heart and lungs.\n\n【33】*   **TIPS:** TIPS, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, is a medical procedure that uses image guidance for the placement of a stent which creates a connection between the portal vein and hepatic vein.\n\n【34】*   **Percutaneous Nephrostomy:** During the percutaneous nephrostomy procedure, a catheter is placed directly into the kidney to drain the urine temporarily. This procedure is done for a person with a blocked ureter.\n\n【35】*   **Percutaneous Abscess Drainage:** This is a medical procedure used to drain the infected fluid from the body. Under image guidance, a catheter is passed through the skin into the abscess to drain the fluid.\n\n【36】*   **Endovenous Laser Treatment:** Endovenous laser ablation is a procedure used to treat varicose veins (enlarged veins of legs and feet). During endovenous laser ablation, a catheter is inserted into the affected veins, and a laser is passed through the tube, which generates heat and burns the cells of the abnormal veins.\n\n【37】*   **Cholecystostomy:** Cholecystectomy is the surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder. In cholecystostomy, a thin, flexible tube with a small camera at its end called a laparoscope is inserted through the small incision. Under the guidance of a laparoscope, the affected gallbladder is removed.\n\n【38】What Are the Benefits of Interventional Radiology?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   The cost of therapeutic interventional radiology is less when compared to open surgical procedures.\n\n【40】*   Risks with interventional radiology are less when compared to other surgeries.\n\n【41】*   This procedure is more rapid and painless than other surgical procedures.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Interventional radiology procedures are advances in medicine that often replaces open surgical procedures. This minimally invasive procedure involves less blood loss and thus plays an important role in bloodless medicine. Interventional radiology procedures usually require local anesthesia or sedation. Hence, it does not often require hospitalization. The recovery time in interventional radiological procedures is shorter.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diagnostic and interventional radiology: an update  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7944668/\n*   Professions in Interventional Radiology  \n    https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/professions-interventional-radiology\n*   Imaging and radiology  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007451.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Voyeurism is when people are sexually aroused by watching them indulge in sexual activities while unaware of it. While some people enjoy the act, some may be traumatized after observations of voyeurism. However, most people do not report significant emotional harm due to their voyeuristic experience.\n\n【2】Though, people with voyeuristic behavior often become concerned that their compulsive need to spy on others indicates that they may be repressing the impulse to watch people engage in sexual acts; or that their feelings about watching other people having sex make them deviant. Repeated uncontrolled behavior turns the condition into a disorder.\n\n【3】What Is Voyeuristic Disorder?\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Voyeuristic disorder is a psychological condition that causes sufferers to develop an uncontrollable desire to watch other people in the act of being intimate, like when they are sleeping or having sex. It involves secretly observing (the act of looking at someone without their knowledge or consent) others without their permission, usually while naked or engaged in sexual activity.\n\n【5】According to a study with 60 college men concluded that 54 percent had voyeuristic fantasies and 42 percent had tried voyeurism (spying, peeping, or watching someone indulge in sexual behaviors, peeping when someone is taking a bath or changing clothes without their consent), suggesting that the idea more easily arouses young adults.\n\n【6】Though men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with voyeurism, this does not mean women do not suffer from the disorder. Some studies also concluded that about five percent of men and two percent of women experience this condition.\n\n【7】What Causes Voyeuristic Disorder?\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】The disorder can be due to any number of factors, including:\n\n【9】*   Watching someone spy on others while they were growing up.\n\n【10】*   Being bullied or harassed by others.\n\n【11】*   Peers performing the same act.\n\n【12】*   Trying to find out if someone else is seeing something that you are not.\n\n【13】*   Being aroused by the idea of someone else being aroused.\n\n【14】*   Excessive consumption of alcohol and drugs is also associated with voyeuristic behaviors.\n\n【15】*   Hypersexuality (sex addiction).\n\n【16】*   People who are suffering from OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder).\n\n【17】*   Abnormal sexual drive.\n\n【18】*   Mental health conditions like depression.\n\n【19】*   Early childhood trauma or history of child sexual abuse.\n\n【20】*   Incidences of watching someone undress or have sex accidentally in the past.\n\n【21】*   Overwatching of pornographic content.\n\n【22】*   History of paraphilic disorder or sexual disorders in the past.\n\n【23】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Voyeuristic Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】1\\. Strong and persistent sexual interest or urges to spy on people indulging in sexual intercourse without their consent.\n\n【25】2\\. Many people enjoy voyeurism, merely watching and being aroused by another person performing a sexual act. But this is not considered as voyeuristic disorder or voyeurism. Voyeurists (people who exhibit voyeuristic behaviors) will typically not engage in sexual activity with the person they observe.\n\n【26】3\\. Excessive voyeuristic thoughts make people distressed and unable to function or act on their urges.\n\n【27】4\\. Some alarming concerns include the following:\n\n【28】*   Violating privacy norms in other people’s homes.\n\n【29】*   Watch a person performing sexual activities without their consent.\n\n【30】*   Non-consented filming or photographing another person without their permission.\n\n【31】*   Entering an area illegally to watch people (trespass or peep in bedroom windows).\n\n【32】*   Using binoculars to watch people without their consent.\n\n【33】*   Feeling guilty after engaging in these behaviors.\n\n【34】*   Unable to get satisfied or sexually aroused without watching others.\n\n【35】*   Cannot resist voyeuristic activities even if it is affecting mental health.\n\n【36】What Is the Voyeuristic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】A qualified medical doctor (psychologist) or a licensed therapist only is eligible to confirm the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorders. Therapists diagnose the condition and conclude a person is suffering from voyeuristic disorder; only if the person feels distressed or is unable to function due to voyeuristic thoughts.\n\n【38】Diagnosis for the voyeuristic disorder is made when:\n\n【39】*   There are recurrent episodes of sexual arousal by watching a person undressed, changing clothes, or engaging in sexual activities without their consent.\n\n【40】*   These sexual urges and fantasies impair normal functioning and affect the daily activities in their lives (voyeuristic disorder psychology).\n\n【41】*   A person finds indulging in sexual conversations interesting and often indulges in dirty talking.\n\n【42】*   A person cannot divert sexual thoughts and urges, causing severe frustration and distress.\n\n【43】*   The disorder has been present for more than six months.\n\n【44】*   A person must also be at least 18 years old before being diagnosed with the voyeuristic disorder to rule out genuine sexual curiosity in children.\n\n【45】How to Treat Voyeuristic Disorder?\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】Voyeuristic disorders, just like other paraphilic disorders, can be treated with a combination of medications, psychological therapies, a combination of both, and by adopting healthy activities.\n\n【47】**1\\. Medications -**\n\n【48】*   Medications like serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Fluoxetine and Escitalopram are used to suppress impulsive behaviors.\n\n【49】*   Drugs to reduce testosterone levels in the body, such as Leuprolide acetate, are also given to reduce sexual urges.\n\n【50】*   Reduced testosterone levels also reduce the sex drive, reducing the frequency of voyeuristic behavior.\n\n【51】**2\\. Psychotherapy -** Therapists and psychiatrists usually use psychotherapy mechanisms to help the person become more aware of his doings and prevent him from doing something regretful and offensive in nature.\n\n【52】**3\\. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy -** This method is adopted to make the person understand why these behaviors are socially unacceptable and help cope with their sexual urges. It also helps in understanding the root cause of these behaviors.\n\n【53】**4\\. Coping Mechanisms -** Recognizing the condition and knowing that one needs help is the first step towards coping with the voyeuristic disorder. One should not feel ashamed of seeking help from loved ones and family members or friends. Conscious efforts to control the urges and self-reminders of the consequences are another way to cope with the disorder.\n\n【54】**5\\. Practicing Sexual Abstinence -** Refraining from indulging in sexual activities or taking a break from sexual activities could help divert unhealthy thoughts and reduce the symptoms of voyeuristic disorder.\n\n【55】**6\\. Limit or Quit Watching Pornographic Content -** Limiting watching pornographic content also reduces sexual urges and keeps the mind healthy.\n\n【56】**7\\. Adopting Healthy Habits -** Exposing oneself to various other activities like exercising, meditation, yoga, focusing on professional work, and indulging in hobby classes could help divert the mind from voyeuristic thoughts and sexual activities.\n\n【57】**Conclusion:**\n\n【58】It is essential to remember that this disorder involves an invasion of privacy. The consequences of this behavior can be detrimental and considered an offense. In conclusion, there are some tangible and intangible effects of voyeurism. While the tangible effects include humiliation, arrests, and fines, the intangible effects refer to the psychological well-being of the person suffering from it. People should recognize and adopt early intervention (self-control and professional treatment) on the occurrence of the first incidence itself. This also prevents undesired impacts on the individual and society.\n\n【59】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【60】* * *\n\n【61】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Hypersexuality a Paraphilia?**\n\n【62】Hypersexuality or compulsive sexual behavior is a disorder that causes sexual addiction.

In most cases, this loss of protein is because of abnormalities in lymphatic flow. The lymphatic system plays an important role in the immune system and in the delivery of nutrients to the body. The lymphatic system absorbs the excess watery fluid (lymph) containing the proteins, cells, electrolytes, and other substances from the organs and returns it to the bloodstream. In a normal healthy body, the lymphatic channels from the liver and mesentery (which attach the intestines to the abdominal wall) drain towards the thoracic duct, which is the main lymphatic vessel draining the lymph. In the case of protein-losing enteropathy, the channels originating in the liver and connecting to the intestine or originating in the intestine flow in the opposite direction, causing leaks in the intestinal wall. There is no way the body can absorb the spilled lymphatic fluid.\n\n【2】What Is Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Protein-losing enteropathy is a condition in which excess loss of proteins occurs through the gastrointestinal tract due to different etiologies. In the bloodstream, albumin is the protein that exists in the highest concentration. Albumin is made by the liver and a large amount of it is lost due to protein-losing enteropathy. The functions of albumin include transporting hormones and water retention in the bloodstream.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Diarrhea.\n*   Edema (swelling of tissues).\n*   Bloating.\n*   Pain in the abdomen.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n*   Feeding intolerance refers to the inability to consume or digest food without experiencing discomfort or illness.\n*   Problems with tissue healing.\n*   Ascites (excess fluid trapped in the abdomen).\n*   Pericardial and pleural effusions (excess fluid around the heart).\n*   Hypoproteinemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body).\n*   Severe malnutrition.\n*   Hypocalcemia (low calcium in the body).\n*   Lymphocyte deficiency indicates a shortage of lymphocytes, which are a specific type of white blood cell.\n*   Susceptibility to infection.\n\n【6】What Is the Pathophysiology of Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Protein-losing enteropathy occurs when the loss of proteins through the digestive tract is more than the synthesis of proteins by the body. Generally, the proteins entering the gut are degraded into amino acids and reabsorbed. The mucosal permeability increases in conditions causing erosions and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in excessive leakage of proteins into the intestine and poor reabsorption, leading to hypoproteinemia. There is an increased leak of lymph fluid into the gastrointestinal tract in conditions causing increased lymphatic pressure and lymphatic obstruction, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and protein loss.\n\n【8】What Is the Etiology of Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】There are three main groups of disorders that can cause excess protein loss in stools. They are:\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Aortic Valve Atresia - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>**Primary Erosive or Ulcerative Gastrointestinal Disorders** \\- This includes gastrointestinal malignancies, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), Clostridium difficile colitis, carcinoid syndrome, any erosions or ulcers of the stomach or duodenum and graft versus host disease.</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>**Non-Erosive or Non-Ulcerative Gastrointestinal Disorders** - This includes celiac disease, tropical sprue, amyloidosis, cutaneous burns, bacterial overgrowth, Whipple disease, collagenous colitis, mixed connective tissue disease, menetrier disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), parasitic intestinal infections, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</u>\n\n【15】**Disorders Causing Increased Interstitial Pressure or Lymphatic Obstruction** \\- This includes right-sided heart failure, congenital heart disease, cirrhosis with portal hypertension gastropathy, hepatic venous outflow obstruction, primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, constrictive pericarditis, Fontan procedure for single ventricle, mesenteric tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, lymph enteric fistula, retroperitoneal fibrosis, thoracic duct obstruction, and lymphoma.\n\n【16】How to Diagnose Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy is suspected in patients with hypoproteinemia once the other alternative causes such as chronic liver disease, severe malnutrition, or nephrotic syndrome have been ruled out. The diagnostic tests recommended include:\n\n【18】**Blood Tests -** The blood tests are done to check for levels of the specific protein, albumin. If the level of albumin is found low, then the stool test is done.\n\n【19】**Stool Tests** - This test is done to check for levels of protein alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) in the stool. The presence of A1AT in the stool is a primary and important clue for the diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy as it is not normally absorbed or secreted into the intestine. If the results show high levels of A1AT in the stool, then it is more likely that the loss of proteins is more.\n\n【20】**Radioactive Albumin Test** - In this test, radioactively labeled albumin is given to the patient, and the way it is cleared from the body is monitored. This test is done if the stool test is inconclusive.\n\n【21】**Imaging Tests** - This includes tests such as X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. These tests are done to find out the underlying disease causing protein-losing enteropathy.\n\n【22】**Endoscopy and Biopsy** - Endoscopy involves the utilization of an endoscope, which is a slender and flexible tube equipped with a light and camera, to examine the gastrointestinal tract for potential diseases and, if necessary, obtain a tissue sample from the affected region. The extracted tissue sample is forwarded to a laboratory for the purpose of pathological testing, commonly referred to as a biopsy.\n\n【23】What Are the Treatment Options for Protein-Losing Enteropathy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The primary objective in treating protein-losing enteropathy is to restore protein levels in the body and address the root cause of the condition. The treatment option includes:\n\n【25】1) **Diet -**\n\n【26】*   Adding dietary supplements to the routine.\n*   Modifying diet so as to eat more food that is high in protein and low in fat.\n*   Intravenous infusion of protein is done under medical supervision.\n\n【27】2) **Medical Care** - This focuses on treating the underlying cause of protein-losing enteropathy. Medications like steroids and diuretics are the first line of treatment as they can reduce the inflammation associated with the condition. For example, the patient with intestinal parasites is treated with appropriate medication for the infestation, and the patient with congestive heart failure is treated with diuretics and digitalis.\n\n【28】3) **Surgical Care** \\- Surgery is suggested for menetrier disease (giant hypertrophic gastropathy) and localized lymphatic obstruction. In these cases, lymphovenous anastomosis (affected lymph vessels are connected to a nearby vein to bypass the damaged area) proves to be beneficial. Embolization surgery to plug holes in the duodenum is used in case the cause involves lymph fluid entering the intestine.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】Protein-losing enteropathy is characterized by a significant depletion of serum protein within the intestine. The complications of this condition depend on the underlying cause. The treatment focuses on increasing the level of protein in the body and treating the underlying cause. If there is successful management of the underlying cause, it can lead to the complete resolution of protein-losing enteropathy.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Protein-losing Enteropathy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542283/\n*   Protein losing enteropathy: comprehensive review of the mechanistic association with clinical and subclinical disease states  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5522668/\n*   Protein-losing Enteropathy  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194423/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Since it causes meningococcal meningitis, which affects up to 20 percent of people with meningococcemia, this bacterium is mostly known for this. Bacteremia can develop in up to 75 percent of people with meningococcal meningitis.\n\n【2】Numerous bacteria, including Streptococcus B, Streptococcus A, or Staphylococci, can result in bloodstream infections or septicemia. In addition, other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or leptospirosis, can also cause meningitis. Compared to these other bacteria, Neisseria Meningitidis is more easily communicable between individuals and causes a swiftly progressing, serious form of illness (fulminant meningococcemia). Although there have been cases of meningococcemia in all age groups, older children and teenagers often have the highest infection rates. Even if they are immunized, complement immune system deficiencies and the use of complement inhibitors like Eculizumab put people at increased risk for developing severe meningococcal disease.\n\n【3】Up to 15 percent of cases of meningococcal disease also result in pneumonia, although bacterial arthritis, otitis media or middle ear infection, and other diseases also occur far less frequently.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Meningococcemia?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Following initial contact with the germs, meningococcal illness symptoms may not appear for two to ten days. Anyone exhibiting early symptoms should seek medical attention right away because the condition can swiftly turn fatal. Meningococcal illness first manifests as flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n【6】*   Fatigue (feeling tired).\n\n【7】*   Chills.\n\n【8】*   Fever.\n\n【9】*   An ache in the muscles or joints and cold hands.\n\n【10】*   Irritability.\n\n【11】*   Fast breathing and vomiting.\n\n【12】Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and laryngitis are all early symptoms of throat infections at this stage as the bacteria bursts through the lining layers at the back of the throat. Within hours, the most recognizable symptom of meningococcemia appears. When a glass or any object is pressed on the skin, a hemorrhagic rash develops that does not change color or disappear. However, not everyone gets rash. Additional signs in infants include a protruding fontanelle (soft spot) and a limp demeanor.\n\n【13】What Causes Meningococcemia?\n----------------------------\n\n【14】The meningococci bacteria (Neisseria meningitidis), which are gram-negative diplococci bacteria, are what cause meningococcemia. The strains A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z, 29 E, and W135 are some of the groups of this bacteria that cause the disease in diverse ways. These groups can be detected by analyzing the patient's blood, skin rash scrapings, and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Due to the cultures' slow growth, testing could take up to five days.\n\n【15】Typically, a carrier transmits the bacterium, leading to infection. The carrier's nose or throat is where the bacteria live naturally, and they can transfer the infection through the air or through close contact. If the carrier is not identified and treated, it may continue to spread the infection for several weeks or months.\n\n【16】How to Diagnose Meningococcemia?\n--------------------------------\n\n【17】Meningococcemia may be suspected based on the patient's medical history and physical examination, but laboratory testing is necessary for a conclusive diagnosis. Patients should begin treatment right away without holding off because the condition can advance quickly. When diagnosing meningococcal infection,\n\n【18】*   Medical personnels culture Neisseria meningitides from blood cultures. Most of the time, the bacteria multiply within one to two days, and Neisseria meningitides may be distinguished from other bacteria using biochemical techniques.\n\n【19】*   The typical double kidney bean look of the bacterium (Diplococcus) can also be seen in stained samples of the growth, albeit additional biochemical tests are required to confirm the identification of the organism.\n\n【20】*   Medical practitioners conduct tests to assess which antibiotics are likely to kill the bacteria once it has grown on a culture media (susceptibility testing), as there has been documented evidence of enhanced resistance to a number of antibiotics.\n\n【21】*   Skin biopsies taken from the rash, in some cases, can be used to identify the organisms under a microscope; however, this is challenging, and a negative result is not a reliable way to rule out meningococcemia.\n\n【22】*   Although they created the test for spinal fluid, researchers have used a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) laboratory test to find Neisseria meningitides in blood. The limitations of PCR include the inability to assess the susceptibility of the bacteria to certain drugs and the fact that not all hospital laboratories offer the test.\n\n【23】How to Treat Meningococcemia?\n-----------------------------\n\n【24】Meningococcemia requires rapid medical attention. In order to prevent the bacteria from spreading, one may be held in an isolation room after being admitted to the hospital.\n\n【25】*   Antibiotics will be injected into the vein to start treating the illness. Patients might also get fluids through intravenous (IV) means.\n\n【26】*   Other therapies are dependent on the symptoms patients experience. Patients will get oxygen if they have trouble breathing. They will almost certainly be prescribed medicine if their blood pressure drops too low. One drug used to treat low blood pressure is Fludrocortisone, and the other is Midodrine.\n\n【27】Bleeding disorders may result from meningococcemia. The doctor might administer platelet replacement medication if this happens. The doctor might, in some circumstances, decide to administer prophylactic antibiotics to the close contact of patients, even if they are asymptomatic so that they might not get sick from the infected individuals. Rifampin, Ciprofloxacin, or Ceftriaxone may be prescribed as well.\n\n【28】How to Prevent Meningococcemia?\n-------------------------------\n\n【29】*   The dangers of infection can be reduced by practicing good hygiene. This entails properly cleaning the hands as well as protecting the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.\n\n【30】*   By staying away from people who are coughing, sneezing, or otherwise exhibiting symptoms of illness, one can also help lower their risk of infection. Do not exchange personal items with sick folks. This implies refraining from sharing anything that comes in contact with the mouth until it has been well-cleaned.\n\n【31】*   The doctor might advise taking prophylactic antibiotics if a person comes into contact with an infected person. This will lessen their risk of contracting the illness.\n\n【32】*   The physician could advise that one gets vaccinated. People who are more likely to contract an infection, such as teenagers, college students, or those who are going to move into a shared living arrangement for the first time, should get vaccinated.\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】Blood poisoning of a serious nature is meningococcemia. Meningococcemia can cause physical, neurological, and psychological problems in some persons. It is brought on by bacteria that harm blood arteries, preventing oxygen from reaching vital organs and tissues. This can result in damage to the skin and tissue-organ failure, etc. Meningococcemia patients can recover fully, provided the infection is identified and treated with antibiotics quickly by medical professionals.\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>*   Meningococcemia  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/meningococcemia/?filter=ovr-ds-resources\n*   Meningococcal septicemia (aka meningococcemia)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/symptoms.html\n*   Meningococcemia  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/meningococcemia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The parasite may be transmitted through contaminated food or water. The most common symptom is diarrhea. Cases of cystoisosporiasis are seen throughout the world. However, the infection occurs more commonly in subtropical and tropical regions. This coccidian parasite is widely distributed in the cosmopolitan world and is frequently found in India, Africa, South East Asia, Central America, and South America. This infection is generally associated with autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States. Cystoisosporiasis is the primary autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in around 2 to 3 % of patients from South Africa. In South America, 10 %of patients with chronic diarrhea with autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have cystoisosporiasis. In Haiti, with autoimmune deficiency syndrome patients (AIDS), 7 to 20 % with chronic diarrhea have cystoisosporiasis.\n\n【2】Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients and other immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk for chronic infection. Preventive measures should be adopted to avoid the infection.\n\n【3】What Is the Causative Agent of Cystoisosporiasis?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】It is caused by the microscopic parasite Cystoisospora belli which was earlier known as Isospora belli (a protozoan parasite). It is an opportunistic infection (which occurs in immunocompromised individuals). The infection majorly affects the small intestine and grows in the cell cytoplasm of the epithelial cells.\n\n【5】What Is the Lifecycle Of Cystoisosporiasis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The oocysts of Cystoisosporiasis belli are shed in the feces of infected individuals and sporulate outside the host to become infective. However, the life cycle of Cystoisospora belli is completed in human beings. The maturation process is completed in around two days but occurs more quickly under certain conditions. The parasite, after ingestion, reaches the enterocytes in the small intestine. Immature oocysts are finally produced and later shed in the stool.\n\n【7】How Is Cystoisosporiasis Transmitted?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【8】Cystoisosporiasis is usually transmitted indirectly through food or water contaminated with infected feces. The immature parasites are transmitted from the shed feces of an infected person. To mature, the parasite requires around two days in the environment to infect another person. However, sometimes the parasite may multiply within a day. Oral or anal contact with an infected person leads to the spread of the disease.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Cystoisosporiasis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The most common clinical feature is non-bloody, watery diarrhea, and the following symptoms occur:\n\n【11】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【12】*   Cramping.\n\n【13】*   Anorexia (an eating disorder characterized by fear of weight gain leading to low body weight and food restriction).\n\n【14】*   Nausea.\n\n【15】*   Vomiting.\n\n【16】*   Low-grade fever.\n\n【17】In immunocompromised patients, diarrhea can be prolonged, causing severe dehydration and hypokalemia (low potassium level in blood) due to electrolyte imbalance. In addition, malabsorption and weight loss are also present. In certain cases, cholangiopathy (damage to bile ducts caused by insufficient blood flow) and reactive arthritis (joint pain caused by an infection in another part of the body) are also reported.\n\n【18】How Is Cystoisosporiasis Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【19】The parasites that cause cystoisosporiasis are tiny organisms that cannot be observed under a microscope. To diagnose the infection, stool or fecal samples are examined under a microscope. Usually, the infection is diagnosed by identifying the oocysts of Cystoisospora belli (23 to 36 micrometers by 12 to 17 micrometers) in fecal samples. These oocysts may be shed at a low level and intermittently, even in patients with severe diarrhea. Multiple samples may be required to find the parasite and reach the exact diagnosis.\n\n【20】Other sensitive methods, like modified acid-fast techniques and ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy, can be used on which these oocysts stain bright red and show autofluorescence, respectively. Infection can also be diagnosed by identifying these oocysts in duodenal mucus or in the intestinal biopsy.\n\n【21】In postmortem examinations of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-infected patients, extraintestinal infection, like the lymph nodes, biliary tract, spleen, and liver, has also been reported.\n\n【22】How Can Cystoisosporiasis Be Prevented?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】The infection can be prevented by\n\n【24】*   Avoid food and water that may be contaminated with stool.\n\n【25】*   Maintaining good personal hygiene also helps to prevent infection.\n\n【26】*   Hands should be washed with soap and warm water after using the washrooms, changing diapers, and handling food items.\n\n【27】*   Children should understand the importance of washing their hands properly before eating.\n\n【28】In some cases, chemoprophylaxis with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has lowered the incidence of this infection. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, daily Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole was protective against cystoisosporiasis in patients with early stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In another study, it was reported the incidence of this infection decreased after the massive introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), except in patients with CD4 counts of less than 50 cells per cubic millimeter.\n\n【29】Research has revealed that the prevalence of cystoisosporiasis was lower in patients with versus without a history of pneumocystis pneumonia (indirect evidence of a protective effect from the use of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis pneumonia).\n\n【30】How Is Cystoisosporiasis Infection Treated?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   Generally, antibiotics are prescribed for the treatment of cystoisosporiasis.The treatment usually involves trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also known as Bactrim, Septra, or Cotrim). Alternative antibiotics are prescribed to patients with sulfa allergy or when there is a failure in the treatment.\n\n【32】*   Plenty of fluids should be administered to patients with diarrhea. Taking proper rest is also advised.\n\n【33】*   Clinically the infection is managed by the administration of electrolytes to dehydrated patients and nutritional supplements to malnourished patients.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】The exact incidence of this infection in human beings is still unknown. The cases of Cystoisospora belli infection have been documented as the cause of diarrheal illness in daycare centers and mental institutions. It has been regarded as traveler’s diarrhea in endemic areas.\n\n【36】Cystoisosporiasis belli infection is distinctly rare among immunocompetent individuals. In the United States, cystoisosporiasis is commonly associated with 0.2 to 3 % of autoimmune disorder syndrome (AIDS) patients.\n\n【37】However, the rate has decreased since the use of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Pneumocystis pneumonia. The cases of cystoisosporiasis have been documented in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and recipients of kidney and liver transplants.\n\n【38】In developing countries, approximately 8 to 40 % of patients with autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are infected with this infection.\n\n【39】Cystoisosporiasis affects individuals of all ages but can cause a more severe infection in infants and young children, with an increased risk of dehydration. There is no gender predilection for this infection has been recorded.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cystoisosporiasis FAQs  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cystoisospora/faqs.html\n*   Isosporiasis (Cystoisosporiasis)  \n    https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-pediatric-opportunistic-infections/isosporiasis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This is a physical sign of disturbances in the cutaneous blood flow. Livedo reticularis occurs with a variety of physiological and pathological factors. Dark bluish discoloration of the skin in livedo reticularis is due to the reduced blood flow and low oxygen level at the skin peripheries. The characteristic features of livedo reticularis can be either transient or persistent.\n\n【2】What Is Livedo Reticularis?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Livedo reticularis is the reddish-blue skin discoloration in a net-like or lace-like pattern. The term livedo indicates the violet discoloration of the skin due to disturbances in the blood supply. Reticularis refers to a net-like or lace-like pattern of cyanotic discoloration. Livedo reticularis occurs in various conditions, including both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Young and middle-aged women are most prone to affect by livedo reticularis.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Livedo Reticularis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Based on the duration of the livedo, called the violet discoloration pattern, and the temperature, the livedo reticularis is divided into four types. The four types of livedo reticularis are physiologic livedo reticularis, primary livedo reticularis, Idiopathic livedo reticularis, Amantadine induced livedo reticularis.\n\n【6】**Physiologic Livedo Reticularis:** also known as cutis marmorata. This type of livedo reticularis occurs due to exposure to cold temperature; blood supply is disturbed by the excess cold temperature resulting in cyanotic discoloration of the skin. The symptoms will get resolved with an increase in temperature. Young women are mostly affected by physiologic livedo reticularis. The most commonly affected area is the leg.\n\n【7】**Primary Livedo Reticularis**: It is a benign form of livedo reticularis with discoloration of the skin with unknown cause. Idiopathic livedo reticularis is the early stage of Sneddon syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, or APS. Amantadine-induced livedo reticularis: livedo reticularis is caused by amantadine. The catecholamines provoke arteriolar vasospasm.\n\n【8】Other varieties of livedo reticularis include,\n\n【9】**Cutis Marmorata Telangiectatica Congenita or CMTC:** It is the congenital form of livedo reticularis. Features are persistent.\n\n【10】**Livedo Racemosa**: It is a persistent and generalized variety of livedo reticularis.\n\n【11】**Secondary Livedo Reticularis**: Livedo reticularis is caused due to underlying systemic diseases.\n\n【12】What Does Livedo Reticularis Look Like?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】Livedo reticularis is characterized as the reddish-blue discoloration of the skin with a net-like or lace-like cyanotic pattern. Features can be either transient or persistent. In physiologic livedo reticularis, symptoms are seen due to the decreased temperature, which gets resolved in warming. The livedo reticularis affect the legs; sometimes, the trunk and buttocks will also get affected. Livedo racemosa has irregular macules with an annular pattern. Symptoms like tingling and numbness are present in cutis marmorata. Infants and young to middle-aged women are more prone to affect by cutis marmorata.\n\n【14】**What Causes Livedo Reticularis?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】The various physiologic and pathological processes that impair the blood supply of the skin cause cyanotic discoloration of the skin. An increased proportion of deoxygenated hemoglobin causes the livid coloration of the skin in livedo reticularis. In cutis marmorata, peripheral vasospasm occurs due to cold exposure. The cause of the idiopathic and primary type of livedo reticularis is unknown. vasospasm, thrombosis, and hyperviscosity cause pathologic skin changes in livedo racemose. In antiphospholipid syndrome, hypoxia and hypercoagulability cause livid skin changes. Certain medications such as Amantadine and other conditions like livedoid vasculopathy, primary fibromyalgia, and congenital hypogammaglobulinemia cause livedo reticularis.\n\n【16】What Are the Conditions Associated With Livedo Reticularis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Cold exposure causes the cutis marmorata. Secondary livedo reticularis occurs due to the underlying conditions and disease. It is also stated that nutritional inefficiency can also cause livedo reticularis. Pellagra is the condition associated with secondary livedo reticularis.\n\n【18】Several other conditions associated with livedo reticularis are mentioned below.\n\n【19】**Congenital Conditions :**\n\n【20】*   Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita or CMTC.\n\n【21】*   Vasculitis.\n\n【22】*   Transplacental transient.\n\n【23】**Hematological and Hypercoagulability Condition:**\n\n【24】*   Antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n【25】*   Sneddon's syndrome.\n\n【26】*   Cryoglobulinemia.\n\n【27】*   Multiple myeloma.\n\n【28】*   Cold agglutinin.\n\n【29】*   Polycythemia vera.\n\n【30】*   Deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【31】**Autoimmune Disorders:**\n\n【32】*   Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【33】*   Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.\n\n【34】*   Wegener's granulomatosis.\n\n【35】*   Takayasu arteritis. Large vessel vasculitis.\n\n【36】**Neoplastic Conditions:**\n\n【37】*   Renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【38】*   Inflammatory breast cancer.\n\n【39】**Lymphoma:**\n\n【40】*   Mycosis fungoides.\n\n【41】**Connective Tissue Disorders:**\n\n【42】*   Dermatomyositis.\n\n【43】*   Systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【44】*   Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n【45】*   Systemic sclerosis.\n\n【46】**Infective Patients:**\n\n【47】*   Hepatitis C.\n\n【48】*   Brucella.\n\n【49】*   Syphilis.\n\n【50】*   Endocarditis.\n\n【51】*   Rheumatic fever.\n\n【52】**Neurological Disorders:**\n\n【53】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n\n【54】*   Pernicious anemia.\n\n【55】*   Poliomyelitis.\n\n【56】**Medications:**\n\n【57】*   Amantadine.\n\n【58】*   Minocycline.\n\n【59】*   Quinidine.\n\n【60】*   Bismuth.\n\n【61】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Livedo Reticularis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】Signs and symptoms of livedo reticularis are similar to other dermal disorders. Therefore, the comparison of livedo reticularis with similar conditions helps in proper diagnosis and aids in the differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of livedo reticularis is pointed out below.\n\n【63】*   Erythema ab igne.\n\n【64】*   Reticulated erythematous mucinosis.\n\n【65】*   Poikiloderma.\n\n【66】*   Mycosis fungoides.\n\n【67】*   Dermatomyositis.\n\n【68】What Is the Histopathology of Livedo Reticularis?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【69】In physiologic livedo reticularis, there is no change in the histopathology findings. Symptoms will get resolved with an increase in temperature. Other histopathological findings include calciphylaxis (calcium deposits inside the blood vessel), monoclonal cryoglobulinemia (eosinophilic plugging), cholesterol emboli, and oxalosis (crystal deposition) is present. Affected arterioles will show these changes. Histopathological findings are observed with the large elliptical biopsy taken from the center of the affected net pattern to the normal discolored area.\n\n【70】How to Diagnose Livedo Reticularis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【71】Livedo reticularis is diagnosed with a detailed history and physical examination. The history of the patients must include the location, exacerbation of symptoms and alleviating factors, symptoms duration, and skin changes. Personal and family history is also taken for any systemic diseases. A general systemic examination is also done. Medical history is also obtained for renal failure, and the patient's drug history is also considered. Laboratory findings should be correlated with personal and physical examinations. Skin biopsies are useful in diagnosing livedo reticularis. Multiple biopsies are made to improve the quality of diagnosis. Wedge biopsy or large punch cut biopsy is useful.\n\n【72】Diagnosis for livedo reticularis includes those mentioned below.\n\n【73】*   A detailed history of the patient.\n\n【74】*   Proper physical examination:\n\n【75】*   Location.\n\n【76】*   Symptoms.\n\n【77】*   Alleviating factors.\n\n【78】*   Duration of systems.\n\n【79】*   Skin changes.\n\n【80】*   Personal history.\n\n【81】*   Family history.\n\n【82】*   Skin biopsy:\n\n【83】*   Multiple biopsies,\n\n【84】*   Wedge biopsy.\n\n【85】*   Large punch cut biopsy.\n\n【86】What Is the Treatment of Livedo Reticularis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【87】Livedo reticularis, due to exposure to cold, requires no treatment. Warming is required to resolve the symptoms in cutis marmorata. Vasodilator therapy is advised to improve the cosmesis. For secondary livedo reticularis with underlying systemic conditions, Treatment for the underlying disease is required. Medications include anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, immunosuppressants, Pentoxifylline, Danazol, and tissue plasminogen activators can be advised. Hypoxic conditions can be advised with livedoid vasculopathy, hyperbaric oxygen and psoralen, and ultraviolet light A or PUVA therapy.\n\n【88】**Conclusion**\n\n【89】Livedo reticularis is a cutaneous condition that is challenging to diagnose. Primary livedo reticularis due to cold exposure usually needs no treatment. Avoiding exposure to cold conditions can be suggested to prevent physiological livedo reticularis. Behavior modification and limp elevation are helpful in symptomatic patients. However, in secondary livedo reticularis, the underlying disease is treated to resolve the symptoms of livedo reticularis.\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>*   Livedo reticularis: A review of the literature  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594389/\n*   Livedo reticularis  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/livedo-reticularis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It has a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. Ophthalmoplegia is the weakness of the eye muscles, and ataxia consists of coordination, balance, and speech disorders. WE is different from Korsakoff syndrome. It is because Korsakoff syndrome is a late manifestation of WE. However, both can occur together.\n\n【2】What Is the Etiology of Wernicke's Encephalopathy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The most frequent trigger of WE is an acute infection. However, various causes and predisposing factors can cause WE.\n\n【4】1.  **Thiamine Deficiency:** Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency is implicated in WE. The most important cause of thiamine deficiency is a high-carbohydrate diet. Thiamine is an essential nutrient required by the brain for energy production. Thiamine deficiency affects the active brain regions. The most affected part is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus regulates temperature, appetite, emotions, and growth.\n\n【5】2.  **Chronic Alcoholism:** Alcohol reduces the absorption of thiamine from the intestine. Further, it diminishes thiamine stores in the liver and affects the enzyme that converts thiamine into an active state. Chronic alcohol consumption does not lead to WE if dietary thiamine intake is optimum. However, it may induce thiamine deficiency through genetic predisposition, thiamine transport problems, and excessive requirements for alcohol metabolism.\n\n【6】3.  **Malnutrition:** Starvation, eating disorders (for example, anorexia), and prolonged vomiting (vomiting during pregnancy) can precipitate WE. In addition, chronic disorders, such as cancer, AIDS, stomach, and kidney disorders may also cause WE.\n\n【7】How Common Is Wernicke's Encephalopathy?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【8】The incidence of WE is higher in developing countries such as India. There is a slight male predominance. But there is no ethnic predisposition.\n\n【9】What Are the Clinical Features of Wernicke's Encephalopathy?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The cardinal features of WE include eye abnormalities, movement disorders, and altered mental status.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Beriberi- Vitamin B1 Deficiency</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Opsoclonus - Clinical Manifestations, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Refeeding Syndrome - Causes, Prevalence, Complications, and Treatment</u>\n\n【16】1.  **Eye Abnormalities:** The hallmark sign of WE is eye abnormalities. Double vision and rapid involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) are encountered. Cranial nerves such as oculomotor (III), abducens (VI), and vestibular nerve (VIII) are also involved. Oculomotor nerve paralysis leads to ophthalmoplegia. Pupillary weakness, drooping of the eyelids, and unequal pupil size (anisocoria) are less common.\n\n【17】2.  **Movement Disorders:** Gait (walking manner of a person) ataxia is a significant finding in WE patients. WE patients have a slow walk with a broad-based gait. Patients are unable to walk in advanced cases.\n\n【18】3.  **Encephalopathy:** Encephalopathy encompasses confusion, disorientation, lethargy, inattentiveness, drowsiness, and indifference. WE affect many nerves. Hence, it causes arms and legs weakness. The sense of self-movement, force, and body position (proprioception) is also decreased. Later, there is hyperthermia (increased body temperature) and hypotension (low blood pressure). Seizures and progressive hearing loss follow. Advanced stages of the acute phase lead to coma and death.\n\n【19】How Is Wernicke's Encephalopathy Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The WE diagnosis involves a thorough patient history and a dedicated physical examination. A person’s nutrition and daily drinking habits identify long-term alcohol abuse. The clinical diagnosis of WE is achieved through two of the following: dietary deficiency, eye signs, cerebellar signs, and an altered mental state. Other investigations include:\n\n【21】**Thiamine Deficiency Tests:** Whole blood thiamine testing is superior to available alternative tests for assessing thiamine status. Serum thiamine testing has poor sensitivity and specificity.\n\n【22】*   **Erythrocyte Transketolase Levels:** It measures thiamine availability for red blood cells (erythrocytes).\n\n【23】*   **Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry:** It measures the active form of thiamine (thiamine diphosphate, TDP). It is the most sensitive, specific, and precise method to check the thiamine nutritional status.\n\n【24】**Neuroimaging:** Neuroimaging findings may improve early diagnosis of WE.\n\n【25】*   **Computed Tomography (CT):** CT can detect edematous (fluid-filled) lesions. CT can ascertain cerebral cortex, frontal lobe, and cerebellum lesions.\n\n【26】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** The specificity of MRI is 93 percent in revealing WE. Various advancements in MRI are helpful in early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Hence, MRI is a valuable and preferred imaging modality for WE in clinical settings.\n\n【27】*   **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: EEG rules out status epilepticus as the cause of coma and altered mental status.\n\n【28】Laboratory studies such as a complete blood count, serum glucose levels, liver function tests, ammonia levels, toxic drug screening, and serum electrolyte tests (sodium and calcium alterations) exclude other causes.\n\n【29】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Wernicke's Encephalopathy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】The WE are reversible. Therefore, the early diagnosis of WE permits treatment. It can also improve the patient's nutritional, metabolic, and neurological status. However, there are certain conditions that should be distinguished from WE for better management. The differential diagnosis of WE includes:\n\n【31】1.  **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE):** Severe liver disease precipitates HE. Liver involvement differentiates HE from WE.\n\n【32】2.  **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS):** AWS occurs when a person suddenly stops drinking alcohol. The symptoms depend upon the time since alcohol is stopped. Delirium tremens start about three days after alcohol withdrawal. The characteristics are confusion, high blood pressure, heavy sweating, fever, and a pounding heartbeat.\n\n【33】3.  **Stroke:** It is brain damage caused by an interruption of blood flow. Hence, it is a medical emergency.\n\n【34】4.  **Psychosis:** Psychosis is a mental disorder. A psychosis patient experiences hallucinations or delusions.\n\n【35】5.  **Closed-Head Injury:** Closed-head injury can cause brain damage. It includes concussion, contusion, and intracranial hematoma (blood collection).\n\n【36】6.  **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH):** NPH is a brain condition in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulates in the brain.\n\n【37】How Is Wernicke's Encephalopathy Treated?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【38】The WE is an emergency requiring immediate intervention. Emergency attention is important in these conditions. The acute and chronic phases of the disease are also managed through different approaches.\n\n【39】1.  **Emergency Phase:** Very little thiamine is required (2 milligrams, mg) to reverse WE symptoms. Intravenous (into the vein) is preferred over intramuscular (into the muscle) administration. Thiamine has a short half-life. Therefore, multiple doses are required. The preferred intravenous dose is 500 mg twice or thrice daily.\n\n【40】2.  **Inpatient Care:** A patient is admitted with suspected or confirmed WE to an inpatient internal medicine or neurology department.\n\n【41】3.  **Outpatient Care:** Malnourished patients need thiamine supplementation. Patients with chronic alcoholism must be referred for counseling. Further, alcohol withdrawal monitoring is mandatory.\n\n【42】WE is a serious condition with extensive disabilities. Some patients do not exhibit any improvement. Therefore, mental deficits persist in many cases. Unfortunately, they develop Korsakoff’s psychosis. Complications include neurological injury, ataxia, Korsakoff’s syndrome, heart failure, and lactic acidosis (excessive lactic acid accumulation in the body).\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Early detection of WE is challenging. Further, the high rate of underdiagnosis of WE is due to the varied clinical presentations. The management of WE is difficult and requires a team approach. Close communication between the team members and the patient is vital to ensuring a high standard of treatment. Furthermore, consultation with the endocrinologist, psychiatrist, and neurologist is paramount.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- Wernicke Encephalopathy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470344/\n*   Medilineplus: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000771.htm\n*   Rarediseases: Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/#symptoms\n*   NIH- Neuroimaging of Wernicke's Encephalopathy and Korsakoff's Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728174/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a1db27b5-564c-4f26-b99d-f9f4e12ad658", "title": "Zika Virus", "text": "【0】How Does the Zika Virus Spread?\n-------------------------------\n\n【1】According to the center for disease and prevention control (CDC), the Zika virus is a viral pathogen that spreads through the bite of infected Aedes mosquito species, i.e. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The mosquitoes spread the Zika virus bite both in the day and night times. The symptoms of this infection are also very mild or sometimes even asymptomatic.\n\n【2】It may also be a part of the viral life cycle of this pathogen that the person infected once with the Zika virus may transfer the infection to another mosquito (humans acting as a carrier) that in turn gets infected and spreads the infection to other people by the bite. Monsoon makes the Aedes mosquito vectors a particularly favorable season to proliferate. That is the main reason why surveillance should be carried out in rural as well as urban areas across all the Indian states, particularly in Kerala and Karnataka as of now.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of the Zika Virus?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】The incubation period of Zika virus asper the WHO is between 3 to 14 days, with the symptoms lasting anywhere between the 2nd to the 7th day. The mains symptoms present in an individual affected by the Zika virus are:\n\n【5】*   Fever.\n\n【6】*   Rashes.\n\n【7】*   Headache.\n\n【8】*   Joint pains.\n\n【9】*   Muscle pains (maybe sudden).\n\n【10】*   Red eyes or conjunctivitis.\n\n【11】What Are the Complications of the Zika Virus?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【12】According to the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals affected by Zika rarely notice any observable symptoms enough to be hospitalized. Death due to Zika is also rare, as per the CDC. But the complications of this viral infection are definitely fatal as it can pass from the mother to the fetus in pregnancy and can also pass via sexual transmission.\n\n【13】1.  For pregnant women infected by Zika, the transmission of the viral pathogen to the fetus can cause microcephaly (the baby's head is smaller in size compared to other babies) and other birth defects or preterm or stillbirth.\n\n【14】2.  The possibility of Zika spreading through blood transfusions are very likely, according to the CDC, but not evidential or confirmed till now.\n\n【15】3.  The infection also has a neurological impact on children and young adults (increased reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome, an uncommon disease of the nervous system, neuropathy).\n\n【16】Epidemiologists and Public health experts say that the Zika virus does not usually transmit through contact or droplets (aerosols and air). All viruses also usually undergo multiple mutations to keep multiplying, so it is safer to follow appropriate COVID behavior in these times to be prepared to face the different viral mutants in the environment.\n\n【17】What Are the Preventive Measures Against Zika Virus?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The best way to prevent disease transmission is by being aware of the pathogenesis and how the virus spreads (i.e. by a bite from an infected mosquito, sexual transmission from an infected person, or from an infected mother to the fetus) and by following appropriate COVID behavior. However, there is no vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection.\n\n【19】1.  Take steps firstly to control mosquitoes both inside and outside your house.\n\n【20】2.  Keep the windows and door screens preferably closed if you suspect places contaminated by mosquitoes outside your house.\n\n【21】3.  Wear long-sleeved clothes and long pants preferably.\n\n【22】4.  If homes or rooms are not air-conditioned or if you are sleeping outdoors, then sleep under mosquito bed nets only.\n\n【23】5.  Treat the clothing and your gear with permethrin, or buy only pretreated items.\n\n【24】6.  Use insect repellants but only those that are registered under the EPA (environmental protection agency) and follow the product label instructions and safety guidelines.\n\n【25】7.  In the case of young babies or infants, mosquito netting can be used to cover them in their cribs, strollers, or carriers, so the baby is protected from mosquito bites.\n\n【26】8.  Sexual contact with an infected person should be avoided or prevented.\n\n【27】Other than following these common preventive measures, the waste management authorities, local bodies, and citizens can make an impact to prevent the spread of Zika from a community point of view in the times where COVID infections worsen the possibility of an individual's health status.\n\n【28】1.  Public body responsibility or local authorities should collect samples from the suspected cases and send them to the institutes of virology or the respective laboratories for testing and surveillance in rural and urban areas.\n\n【29】2.  In pregnant women, the serum samples should be sent for lab tests if microcephaly of the fetus is detected in ultrasound scanning.\n\n【30】3.  Solid wastes should never be disposed of in domestic or residential areas either by the waste management authorities or responsible citizens as it will be a breeding ground in monsoon times for Aedes mosquitoes.\n\n【31】4.  Biologic control at the household, community levels are of utmost importance by vector management surveillance of mosquito larvae by the local waste management body or authorities.\n\n【32】How Is the Zika Virus Infection Managed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】As there is no specific management or treatment line for a person infected by Zika, the first thing to do if you suspect an infection in yourself or your family members would be to report to a physician and follow their line of management or strategy as indicated individually.\n\n【34】1.  The physician or healthcare provider can be contacted further for additional medications and supplements to boost your immune system.\n\n【35】2.  Acetaminophen is usually given for relieving fever and pain. However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or Aspirin should never be taken for Zika virus treatment. Always confer with your physician or healthcare provider about the appropriate medication (in case your physician suspects you have a dengue infection).\n\n【36】3.  Prevent dehydration by drinking lots of water and getting plenty of rest.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:**\n\n【38】Zika virus infection in a COVID scenario is definitely a cause of major concern. Zika virus infection contracted via the bite of Aedes mosquitoes is considered non-fatal and also not life-threatening. It does not usually require hospitalization unless the symptoms of the infection worsen. However, the complications posed in pregnant women, young adults, and infants are risky to live, and preventive measures to control the Zika virus infection on an individual, family, and community basis is the need of the hour.\n\n【39】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【40】* * *\n\n【41】#### **1.**删除换行**How Does Zika Virus Get Transmitted?**\n\n【42】Zika virus infection spreads to humans through infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bites.

It may or may not be associated with abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Increased bowel frequency is defined as three or more loose, watery stools in 24 hours or at least 200 grams of feces per day. Bacterial gastroenteritis can be bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. The symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. The cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are generally self-limiting, which means it can stop itself. However, some supportive management and antibiotic therapy can cure the disease.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The cause of gastroenteritis can be bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic. However, this article is about the bacterial cause of gastroenteritis. The most common causative agents are adenovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus. Besides these viruses, bacterias causing gastroenteritis are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Clostridium perfringens. Bacteria are responsible for more severe cases of gastroenteritis than other pathogens. Some other bacteria causing the infection are Campylobacter and nontyphoidal Salmonella.\n\n【4】What Is the Epidemiology of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Bacterial gastroenteritis is one of the most common diseases around the world. It is associated with almost 1.5 to 2.5 million death cases per year. One of the most common diseases affecting children below five years, approximately more than four billion children are affected by the disease every year.\n\n【6】What Is the Classification of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Depending on the duration of symptoms, gastroenteritis can be classified into the following categories:\n\n【8】*   **Acute Gastroenteritis:** 14 days or less than the duration of symptoms.\n\n【9】*   **Persistent Gastroenteritis:** Symptoms visible for more than 14 days but not exceeding 30 days.\n\n【10】*   **Chronic Gastroenteritis:** Duration of symptoms lasts for more than 30 days.\n\n【11】*   **Recurrent Gastroenteritis:** Recurrence of diarrhea after every seven days of no signs.\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The signs presented by patients of bacterial gastroenteritis are:\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Does diarrhea take time to heal in children?</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Burning Diarrhea - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Evaluation of Febrile Infants - Fever in Newborns</u>\n\n【19】*   **Diarrhea:** Watery or loose stool with or without the presence of bloodstains.\n\n【20】*   **Nausea:** The feeling of vomiting and stomach discomfort.\n\n【21】*   **Vomiting:** Forceful throwing up of the contents of the stomach.\n\n【22】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【23】*   **Fever:** Increased body temperature, suggesting an aggressive organism as the causative agent.\n\n【24】*   Dehydration due to excessive diarrhea.\n\n【25】In severe cases, the following symptoms are observed:\n\n【26】1.  **Dry Mucous Membranes:** Xerostomia or dry mouth can occur due to excess water loss from the body (dehydration).\n\n【27】2.  **Decrease in Elasticity of the Skin:** It does not easily come to its original shape if the skin is stretched and pulled.\n\n【28】3.  **Tachycardia:** Increase in heart rate with almost 100 beats per minute.\n\n【29】4.  **Bloody Stools:** Inflammation of the stomach lining and intestine can cause ulcers due to mucosal abrasion of the gut wall.\n\n【30】5.  **Hypotension:** Decreased blood pressure.\n\n【31】6.  **Orthostasis:** A normal physiological reaction of the sympathetic system to overcome a fall in blood pressure when a person was lying down and assumed back to an upright position.\n\n【32】How to Evaluate Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Thorough medical history and physical examination are the first steps in evaluating the disease. Physical examination presents tenderness in the abdomen.\n\n【34】*   A serum electrolyte panel is indicated to check for abnormal electrolyte levels in severe fluid volume loss cases.\n\n【35】*   With the help of blood tests, though a complete blood test cannot help differentiate between bacterial causes and other causes, it can help evaluate the severity and other complications. Such as, in cases of bacterial invasion and pseudomembranous colitis, there is an increase in white blood cell count.\n\n【36】*   Blood testing is advised to diagnose bacterial pathogens in cases with excessive dehydration and volume loss, severe abdominal pain, pregnancy, elder individuals above 70 years of age, and immunocompromised patients. A stool culture can help identify three common bacteria - Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella.\n\n【37】*   In cases of bloody diarrhea, additional testing for Shiga toxin and leukocytes in feces is done to look for enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC).\n\n【38】What Is the Treatment of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   **Antibiotic Therapy:** In bacterial gastroenteritis, especially in Shiga toxin-producing E.coli, antibiotics should be advised. Azithromycin or Fluoroquinolones can be advised in severe cases like greater than six to seven stools in a day and fever, cases of elderly people (above 70 years), and mucus or blood in the stool. In pregnant women, the drug of choice is Ampicillin. It is also stated by the recent guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention that oral Vancomycin or Fidaxomicin should be advised in nonsevere cases and Metronidazole for severe cases of bacterial gastroenteritis.\n\n【40】*   **Supportive Management:** It includes rehydration in cases of dehydration. The preferable route is oral administration. If there are difficulties in oral rehydration, the intravenous route is used. The fluid intake should be slow, and in small amounts, as fast consumption can worsen nausea. Easy-to-digest food like bananas, rice, toast, and chicken should be started. Consumption of caffeine and alcohol should be avoided.\n\n【41】*   **Symptomatic Therapy:** Loperamide is advised in cases of afebrile and non-bloody diarrhea.\n\n【42】Which Diseases Are Similar to Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】The most similar diseases to bacterial gastroenteritis are viral or fungal manifestations of gastroenteritis.\n\n【44】*   **Crohn’s Disease:** This is a non-curing inflammatory disease of the bowel causing severe diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, fatigue, and malnutrition.\n\n【45】*   **Microscopic Colitis:** Inflammation of the large intestine (colon) causes persistent watery and loose diarrhea. As the name suggests, the disease is diagnosed only after a microscopic view of the colon.\n\n【46】*   **Lactose Intolerance:** Difficulty digesting lactose (sugar) in the milk can cause issues such as gas, diarrhea, and bloating after consuming dairy products.\n\n【47】*   **Pseudomembranous Colitis:** Clostridium difficile causes swelling and inflammation of the colon (large intestine). This infection is common after antibiotic usage and causes diarrhea.\n\n【48】*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome:** A common chronic disorder of the large intestine is showing symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or both of these.\n\n【49】*   **Celiac Disease:** Also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac sprue. It is an immune reaction of the body towards gluten found in barley, wheat, and rye. The classic symptom of the disease is diarrhea, followed by fatigue, bloating, and anemia (low blood count).\n\n【50】*   **Malabsorption Syndrome:** Disorders of the small intestine in which the intestine is not capable of absorbing enough nutrients leading to diarrhea, weight loss, and effects on other organs such as the brain, bones, liver, and nervous system.\n\n【51】*   **Acute HIV Infection:** HIV is characterized by suppressing the body's immune system, thus increasing the chances of gastrointestinal infections and inflammations. The most common infections could cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and digestive issues.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications of Bacterial Gastroenteritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Dehydration and electrolyte depletion are the common complications seen in almost all cases.\n\n【54】*   Transformation of acute gastroenteritis into chronic diarrhea leads to lactose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.\n\n【55】*   **Enteric Fever:** Also known as typhoid fever, is an infection caused by Salmonella typhi.\n\n【56】*   **Septicemia:** Infection of blood by bacteria is known as septicemia or sepsis. It is one of the most extreme responses of the body to an infection. According to the organism involved, the death rate in cases of septic shock is as high as 50 %.\n\n【57】*   **Guillain-Barre Syndrome:** A rare disorder where the body's immune system attacks its nerves. The symptoms start with tingling and weakness in the upper and lower limbs leading to paralysis of the whole body.\n\n【58】*   **Reactive Arthritis:** Swelling and joint pain triggered by an infection in other parts of the body such as the intestines, urinary tract, or genitals. In cases of gastroenteritis by Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Yersinia, there are chances of reactive arthritis.\n\n【59】**Conclusion:**\n\n【60】Bacterial gastroenteritis is bowel inflammation that causes diarrhea due to increased bowel movements. The infection can be viral, fungal, or parasitic as well. Other symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. There can be dehydration due to excessive fluid loss from the body in some cases. In these cases, the administration of fluids either orally or intravenously is done. The treatment starts with antibiotic therapy, followed by supportive therapy.\n\n【61】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【62】* * *\n\n【63】#### **1.**删除换行**How Long Can You Have Bacterial Gastroenteritis?**\n\n【64】Bacterial gastroenteritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tissues. It may last around one to three days. However, severe infection may last for weeks and cause serious complications if left untreated. Consult the physician when symptoms appear.\n\n【65】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Quickest Approach to Treat Gastroenteritis?**\n\n【66】   \nGastroenteritis pain can be relieved by taking Paracetamol. In addition, intake of plain foods such as soup, bread, pasta, and rice would help. Plenty of fluid intake is also necessary if the individual is dehydrated. Although home remedies could help, seeking help from a physician is advisable once the symptoms appear.\n\n【67】#### **3.**删除换行**How Is Bacterial Gastroenteritis Treated?**\n\n【68】Mild cases of bacterial gastroenteritis heal on their own without treatment. However, the individual has to drink plenty of water to compensate for water lost due to vomiting and diarrhea. Some patients require antibiotic coverage for a week to recover. Severe cases can lead to dehydration, kidney disease, neurological problems, and even death if not treated.\n\n【69】#### **4.**删除换行**Which Antibiotic Is Most Effective for Bacterial Gastroenteritis?**\n\n【70】   \nAmpicillin is found to be the most effective antibiotic for treating bacterial gastroenteritis. Sulfamethoxazole, Fluoroquinolones, and Cephalosporins are also a few effective alternatives. In addition to antibiotics, fluid and electrolyte replacements are also necessary for early recovery.\n\n【71】#### **5.**删除换行**Does Gastroenteritis Spread Easily?**\n\n【72】   \nGastroenteritis is the inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tissues caused by bacteria and viruses. They are found to spread quickly if proper hygiene is not maintained. Hence, specific hygienic measures like washing hands would help prevent the spreading of or contracting the disease.\n\n【73】#### **6.**删除换行**How Can You Distinguish Between Gastroenteritis and Food Poisoning?**\n\n【74】   \nFood poisoning is an illness caused by contaminated food, where symptoms occur within a few hours or weeks of exposure to foodborne or waterborne pathogenic organisms. However, gastroenteritis is caused due to bacteria or viruses, and the incubation period may be around 24 to 72 hours.\n\n【75】#### **7.**删除换行**How Can You Distinguish Between Bacterial and Viral Gastroenteritis?**\n\n【76】Gastroenteritis can be identified as bacterial or viral through its symptoms. For example, bacterial gastroenteritis leads to diarrhea with blood and mucus. In contrast, viral gastroenteritis causes watery diarrhea with no mucus and blood. Hence medical history, physical examination, and stool tests can distinguish between bacteria or viruses.\n\n【77】#### **8.**删除换行**What Distinguishes Gastroenteritis From Gastritis?**\n\n【78】Gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach lining alone, caused due to infection and excessive alcohol intake. It can lead to indigestion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. In contrast, gastroenteritis is the inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tissues caused by bacteria and viruses. It can lead to nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, and a low-grade fever.\n\n【79】#### **9.**删除换行**How Long Does Gastroenteritis Take To Develop?**\n\n【80】Gastroenteritis can be found symptomatic within 24 hours of the entry of the infectious organism. However, some cases present symptoms as early as one hour or as long as 60 days. The primary symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, sometimes with blood.\n\n【81】#### **10.**删除换行**Can Stress Lead To Gastroenteritis?**\n\n【82】Stress cannot directly cause gastroenteritis, but it can aggravate the symptoms. However, certain studies suggest that a stressful life is a reason for the onset and exacerbation of the symptoms. They can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms like loss of appetite, cramping, bloating, and inflammation.\n\n【83】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【84】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bacterial Gastroenteritis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513295/\n*   Bacterial Gastroenteritis  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/bacterial-gastroenteritis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The root is made up of two hard tissues, enamel and dentin, and the root has dentin and cementum. The center of the tooth (root canal) consists of soft pulp, which contains the nerves and blood vessels. A fracture can include enamel, dentin, cementum, or pulp.\n\n【2】_source : wilkdental_\n\n【3】What Is a Fractured or Cracked Tooth?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】While chewing on hard foods, a tooth can fracture or crack. It is also commonly seen in people who grind their teeth at night, play contact sports, or it can occur spontaneously in older adults. It is one of the commonest tooth condition that results in tooth loss.\n\n【5】There are various treatment options available to save a cracked tooth. Unlike a broken bone, a fractured tooth will never be 100 % healed even after treatment, but getting it treated will prevent further damage and spread of infection.\n\n【6】You can protect your teeth by maintaining good oral hygiene, avoid biting on hard foods, and wearing a mouthguard. In most cases, the crack can be seen, but sometimes if the fracture is along the length of the tooth, it is impossible to see them with the naked eye. If you cannot see the fracture, certain symptoms like pain while chewing or sudden sensitivity to hot and cold can be signs of it.\n\n【7】Very small fractures are difficult to diagnose, as it might not cause any symptoms except for pain that occurs on and off. Prompt treatment should be sought after because if left untreated, it can cause severe pain, infection, and tooth loss.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Tooth Fracture?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【9】### The types of tooth fracture are:\n\n【10】1.  **Craze lines** - They are minute cracks in the enamel of a tooth. They usually do not result in any pain and need no treatment.\n\n【11】2.  **Fractured cusp** - It is the fracture of the pointy part of the biting surface of a tooth (cusp). It commonly occurs around a tooth filling and does not involve the pulp. As a result, it does not result in much pain.\n\n【12】3.  **Cracked tooth** - This type of fracture runs vertical and usually extends into the gum line. If the fracture has not reached the gum line (incomplete crown fracture), the prognosis is good. But the tooth might have to be extracted of the crack extends into the gum line (incomplete crown-root fracture).\n\n【13】4.  **Split tooth** - It is when the two fractured segments can be separated. Depending on the extent of fracture, the dentist might save one segment of the tooth or extract the entire tooth.\n\n【14】5.  **Vertical root fracture** - Here, the fracture starts below the gum line and then travels up. It does not cause any symptoms until the tooth gets infected. Usually, such teeth need to be extracted.\n\n【15】_source : microendocenter_\n\n【16】What Are the Causes of Tooth Fracture?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】The common causes of a tooth fracture are:\n\n【18】*   Bitting on hard food items.\n\n【19】*   Grinding the teeth at night (bruxism).\n\n【20】*   Increasing age (above 50 years).\n\n【21】*   A tooth that has a large dental filling, as it weakens the tooth.\n\n【22】*   Injury to the chin or jaw during road traffic accidents, contact sports, fall, etc.\n\n【23】*   Eating something very cold immediately after eating something hot might cause fractures due to temperature change.\n\n【24】*   Root fractures are commonly seen in people with gum diseases.\n\n【25】What Are the Symptoms of Tooth Fracture?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【26】Most people do not have any symptoms. Craze lines do not cause any symptoms and do not require treatment. Severe cases results in the following symptoms:\n\n【27】*   Pain while chewing or biting.\n\n【28】*   Pain occurs on and off.\n\n【29】*   Swollen gums.\n\n【30】*   Tooth sensitivity to sweet foods.\n\n【31】*   Tooth feels sensitive to hot and cold foods.\n\n【32】How Is a Tooth Fracture Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Most of the time, a minor tooth fracture is accidentally diagnosed in an x-ray taken for some other condition. Sometimes fractures do not show up in an x-ray also, this is due to the angle at which the x-ray was taken and the type of fracture.\n\n【34】A dentist will take a complete medical and dental history, and ask you if you chew a lot of hard food or grind your teeth at night. If needed, the dentist might use a magnifying lens or dental dye to look for any cracks.\n\n【35】Your dentist might also ask you to bite on something hard. You might have pain when you release your bite if your tooth is cracked.\n\n【36】What Are the Treatment Options for Tooth Fracture?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Depending on your symptoms, location and size of the fracture, various treatment options are available. Your dentist might suggest one of the following treatment modalities:\n\n【38】1) **Bonding or dental filling** - If the fracture does not involve the pulp or dentin, the dentist fills the crack using tooth-colored composite resin. In this method, the doctor will etch the surface to make it rough, so the bonding material adheres to the tooth. Then the tooth-colored resin is used to build the fractured part of the tooth, and the material is hardened using ultraviolet light.\n\n【39】2) **Dental crown or cap** - When the fracture involves the dentin or a lot of tooth portion is lost, then a dental crown or cap is used to cover the damaged tooth. It is tooth-shaped and can be made from metal, metal and ceramic, or all ceramic. It is fitted over the fractured tooth and makes is functionally and aesthetically better. The dentist will first cut the tooth to make space for the dental crown and make an impression, which is sent to the lab. The lab will fabricate the crown depending on the patient’s bite and tooth color.\n\n【40】3) **Root canal treatment** - If the crack is extensive and it involves the pulp or if it has resulted in the infection of the pulp, then root canal treatment is necessary. Here, the infected pulp in the root canal is removed and the root canal is shaped and prepared. Then the root canal is filled with a biocompatible material and a dental crown is placed on the tooth to increase strength and appearance.\n\n【41】4) **Extraction** - Your dentist will extract the tooth only if the tooth is damaged beyond repair.\n\n【42】Craze lines and other hairline cracks in the enamel do not cause any symptoms and need no treatment.\n\n【43】What Are the Complications of Tooth Fracture?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The complications of a fractured tooth are:\n\n【45】*   Pain on biting.\n\n【46】*   Gums swelling.\n\n【47】*   Tooth sensitivity.\n\n【48】*   Bad breath.\n\n【49】*   Swollen glands in the neck.\n\n【50】*   Fever.\n\n【51】To prevent this condition, avoid biting on hard foods, maintain good oral hygiene, and ask your dentist for a mouthguard. For more information, consult a dentist online.\n\n【52】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【53】* * *\n\n【54】#### **1.**删除换行**Can a Fractured Tooth Be Saved?**\n\n【55】If the fracture has been extended only until the tooth’s pulp, the tooth can be treated with the help of a root canal procedure, and a crown can be used to protect the crack from spreading further. However, if the crack has extended below the gums already, it is no longer treatable, and the tooth can’t be saved, and it should be extracted.\n\n【56】#### **2.**删除换行**Can a Fractured Tooth Heal on Its Own?**\n\n【57】Yes, a fractured tooth can heal on its own, provided the fracture is minimal. It includes those fractures that involve only the outer levels of the tooth. This self-healing process of a tooth is called remineralization. Severe forms of fractures cannot be healed.\n\n【58】#### **3.**删除换行**How Do You Know If Your Tooth Is Fractured?**\n\n【59】The following are the signs and symptoms of a fractured tooth.  \n\\- Pain when chewing or biting, especially when the person releases the bite.  \n\\- Extreme sensitivity to heat, cold, or sweet foods.  \n\\- Pain that comes and goes but is rarely progressive.  \n\\- Swelling of the gum and redness, particularly around the affected tooth.\n\n【60】#### **4.**删除换行**What Do Dentists Do for a Fractured Tooth?**\n\n【61】Most fractured teeth can be repaired by the reattachment of the broken piece of tooth enamel or by bonding an artificial tooth-colored filling or an artificial crown in place. It can also be treated by using a root canal procedure.\n\n【62】#### **5.**删除换行**How Long Will a Fractured Tooth Last?**\n\n【63】A fracture can be repaired surgically by a dentist, but a fractured tooth cannot be healed completely. It can be restored aesthetically. But, immediate treatment provides the best chance of saving the individual’s fractured tooth and preventing infection that can lead to further damage.\n\n【64】#### **6.**删除换行**Is a Cracked Tooth an Emergency?**\n\n【65】Usually, a broken or fractured tooth is not a dental emergency. It is an emergency only when the patient is experiencing excruciating pain or profuse bleeding. A trauma caused by accidents might cause skull fractures also along with teeth fracture, so in those cases, the patient should immediately seek medical care.\n\n【66】#### **7.**删除换行**What Happens If You Leave a Broken Tooth Untreated?**\n\n【67】If the tooth fracture is very minimal, involving only the crown region, it usually does not cause any complications. But, when it consists of the gums or the other associated facial structures, patients may have severe pain, and infections might develop. The infections could be so severe that it can even spread to the brain known as meningitis.\n\n【68】#### **8.**删除换行**Can an X-ray Show a Fractured Tooth?**\n\n【69】X-rays commonly do not elicit the small fractures that are known to cause cracked tooth syndrome. Only if the fractures are wide enough, they might be shown up as shadows in the X-ray. Sometimes a special dye might be frequently used to stain the affected tooth temporarily, and look if it is fractured or not.\n\n【70】#### **9.**删除换行**Does a Cracked Tooth Need a Crown?**\n\n【71】If a tooth that is fractured is causing pain, it is a very serious condition, and it usually requires a crown. The fracture in a cracked tooth will not heal like other bones in the body. Vertical cracks in the tooth that travels up to the gums will require a full-coverage crown.\n\n【72】#### **10.**删除换行**What Does a Cracked Tooth Look Like?**\n\n【73】A fractured tooth can be easily visible if it is wide. In those cases, there can be additional symptoms like severe pain, swelling of the gums, redness, visible bleeding, etc. Still, if the fracture is minimal, most patients fail to notice it immediately. They notice it later only when there is some difficulty in their mastication.\n\n【74】#### **11.**删除换行**How Can I Fix a Cracked Tooth at Home?**\n\n【75】The following are certain ways you can provide the necessary first aid to a fractured tooth at home. It is important for you to understand that it is not the definitive cure, and once the first aid is done, you should seek medical care immediately.  \n\\- If your whole tooth is fractured and falls off with the root intact, try to place it in a small container with milk and rush to the dentist.  \n\\- If the remaining tooth apart from the fractured piece has a sharp edge, you can cover it with things like chewing gum, gauze, or wax.  \n\\- If you are experiencing excruciating pain, try taking over-the-counter pain relievers.\n\n【76】#### **12.**删除换行**How Serious Is a Cracked Tooth?**\n\n【77】If a cracked tooth is left untreated, it might get into severe complications. It can cause severe infections that are capable of spreading to the surrounding structures. It can especially spread to the brain and cause meningitis. Sometimes, a cracked tooth can be easily treated by a dentist, but permanent damage to the tooth can occur when it is not treated.\n\n【78】#### **13.**删除换行**How Painful Is a Cracked Tooth?**\n\n【79】Teeth injuries are usually very painful. The pain can limit the affected person’s routine activities like eating, speaking, and sleeping. The affected part of the face can also be severely swollen and red that it is apparently visible. It is because of the increased number of sensory nerve supplies to the teeth.\n\n【80】#### **14.**删除换行**How Can I Temporarily Fix a Broken Tooth?**\n\n【81】The following are some ways how you can temporarily fix a broken tooth.  \n\\- If the tooth pain is so severe, take Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, or any other over-the-counter pain medicines.  \n\\- If the fracture has caused a sharp or jagged edge on the affected tooth, cover it gently with a piece of wax paraffin or any sugarless chewing gum, since sugars can increase sensitivity and aggravate the pain. This also prevents the fractured teeth from cutting your tongue or any parts of your oral cavity.  \nIf you have to eat, then go for soft foods and sugarless drinks alone.  \nAfter temporarily fixing the fractured tooth, always seek immediate medical care to prevent permanent damage.\n\n【82】#### **15.**删除换行**How to Fix a Cracked Tooth Naturally?**\n\n【83】If the fractured tooth seems dirty, rinse it only with milk or a saline solution. It is necessary to keep it back into its empty socket in your mouth as early as possible and rush to a dentist. Do not use water or alcohol to rinse the fractured piece of tooth. You can also fix a broken tooth by biting clean material such as cotton cloth or a wet tea bag. This will help in holding the teeth in its place.\n\n【84】#### **16.**删除换行**Can You Live With a Fractured Tooth?**\n\n【85】Yes, a fractured tooth is not a life-threatening condition. People can lead their healthy lives by treating it with a root canal procedure or removing it surgically.\n\n【86】#### **17.**删除换行**What Is the Classification of Fractures?**\n\n【87】There are five classes of fracture according to Bennet’s classification of tooth fractures. Those are as follows:  \nClass I – Traumatized tooth without coronal or  \nroot fracture.  \na) A tooth from the alveolus.  \nb) Tooth subluxated in the alveolus.  \nClass II – Coronal fracture.  \na) Involving enamel.  \nb) Involving enamel and dentin.  \nClass III – Coronal fracture with pulpal exposure.  \nClass IV – Root fracture.  \na) Without coronal fracture.  \nb) With coronal fracture.  \nClass V – Avulsion of the tooth.\n\n【88】#### **18.**删除换行**Can a Root Canal Cause a Fractured Tooth?**\n\n【89】Yes, sometimes, an excess pressure applied on a tooth during root canal procedure may cause a fracture. After a root canal treatment, usually, the teeth become very brittle, and they are more susceptible to cracked tooth syndrome than normal teeth.\n\n【90】#### **19.**删除换行**What Happens If a Root Canal Tooth Cracks?**\n\n【91】A fracture in a root canal tooth is also considered the same as a normal fracture. If the fracture is extended beneath the gums, it can be treated.\n\n【92】#### **20.**删除换行**What Is the Best Treatment for a Broken Tooth?**\n\n【93】The treatment of broken teeth usually depends on the severity and depth of the fracture. It will also depend on the comorbidities of the patient like diabetes, which are risk factors to certain modes of treatment. The following are specific methods of treating a broken tooth.  \n\\- Crown.  \n\\- Veneers.  \n\\- Dental implant.  \n\\- Bonding.  \n\\- Root canal.  \n\\- Dental filling.  \n\\- Dental sealants.\n\n【94】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【95】无关删除-1:<u>*   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439863/  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439863/\n*   https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/Dental-injuries-tooth-loss  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/Dental-injuries-tooth-loss\n*   https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/763458-overview  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/763458-overview</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d8fa945a-4a3e-4f67-8cec-319cac7ee4bc", "title": "Why Does Thrombocythemia Occur?", "text": "【0】Why Does Thrombocythemia Occur?\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Thrombocythemia is a condition in which the blood contains an abnormally high number of platelets or thrombocytes. The blood is formed in the bone marrow that produces hematopoietic cells. It is a kind of myeloproliferative disorder. It is also known as essential thrombocythemia or primary thrombocythemia. Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic condition with no known treatment. This condition can cause feeling of tiredness and dizziness, headaches, and vision changes. It also raises the potential for blood clots. Treatment may not be needed in case of a mild illness. If the symptoms are severe, then an antiplatelet drug may be needed, blood thinners, or both. In any given year, less than one in 100,000 persons are diagnosed with ET, with women being the most affected.\n\n【2】What Gives Rise to Thrombocythemia?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】*   The main cause of thrombocythemia is the excessive production of platelets by the bone marrow. Inside the bone is a spongy tissue called bone marrow. This tissue consists of hematopoietic cells, which are early progenitor cells that can differentiate into other cell types.\n\n【4】*   In the case of platelets, progenitor cells differentiate into megakaryocytes responsible for the production of platelets. Essential thrombocythemia is a genetic mutation that occurs somewhere along the JANUS KINASE 2 gene, also known as JAK2 or cell signaling pathways.\n\n【5】*   Normally, the kidneys and liver produce a small hormone called thrombopoietin that binds to receptors on hematopoietic cells when it binds to these cells to activate the JAK2 gene to make, divide, and mature into megakaryocytes and platelets. In addition, cells can develop mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL, or in the protein chaperone, calreticulin or CALR.\n\n【6】*   Now when there is a gene mutation in CALR. The signaling pathway remains active at all times, meaning that platelets continue to be produced even in the absence of thrombopoietin. However, there are lots of platelets being produced. Many of them end up deformed; they are large and irregularly shaped.\n\n【7】*   As a result of excessive proteins, increased platelet counts result in an increased chance of creating blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, lungs, and even areas where clots do not form, such as the abdomen.\n\n【8】*   It is not common for this condition to occur. There is the possibility of inheritance. Thrombocythemia is a genetic disorder.\n\n【9】*   Von Willebrand disease is another cause of bleeding in persons with extremely high platelet counts. This disease has an impact on how blood clots form.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms and Indicators of Thrombocythemia?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Symptoms of thrombocythemia may include:\n\n【12】*   Headaches.\n\n【13】*   Tinnitus and loss of vision.\n\n【14】*   Fatigue.\n\n【15】*   Dizziness.\n\n【16】*   A clot in an artery or vein usually develops in the hands, feet, and brain.\n\n【17】*   Bleeding after surgery or injury.\n\n【18】*   Difficulty in concentrating.\n\n【19】*   Chest pain and bone pain.\n\n【20】*   Bloody stools.\n\n【21】*   Heavy periods in women.\n\n【22】*   Numbness of the hands and feet.\n\n【23】*   Erythromelalgia (redness, warmth, and pain in the hands and feet.)\n\n【24】*   Blood clots in arteries and veins, most often in hands, feet, and brain.\n\n【25】*   Bruising or bleeding from the nose, gums, and GI (gastrointestinal) tract.\n\n【26】How to Diagnose Thrombocythemia?\n--------------------------------\n\n【27】*   CBC (Complete Blood Count): The results of this test determine the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood.\n\n【28】*   Blood Smears: They are viewed through a microscope to determine the number of blood cells in a sample.\n\n【29】*   Bone Marrow Aspiration or Biopsy: This is a test that determines how healthy the bone marrow is.\n\n【30】*   Genetic: This test looks for changes or mutations in genes that control the body's production of platelets.\n\n【31】How Is Thrombocythemia Prevented and Treated?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Treatment is determined by the degree of the symptoms, age, and overall health. In addition, the severity of the condition will determine the treatment. In general, treatment is done to ease symptoms and prevent blood clots. The treatments include the following:\n\n【33】*   Low-Dose Aspirin -This treatment is for people who are at risk of blood clots.\n\n【34】*   Chemotherapy -This treatment is usually given through pills, injections, or combinations of both. The oral chemotherapy medication Hydroxyurea or Anagrelide may be administered in combination with the injection of Interferon Alpha.\n\n【35】*   Plateletpheresis - Through this procedure, platelets are removed from the blood. This procedure is rarely required for this condition.\n\n【36】*   Radioactive Phosphorus (32P) - Radioactive phosphorus is a rarely used treatment where the medication is injected into the veins. As a result of this act, the production of platelets will be brought down to normal levels for a longer period.\n\n【37】What Are Thrombocythemia-Related Complications?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【38】If not treated, thrombocythemia can lead to a variety of life-threatening consequences, including:\n\n【39】*   Heart problems.\n\n【40】*   Strokes.\n\n【41】*   Enlarged spleen or spleen dysfunctions.\n\n【42】*   Blood clots.\n\n【43】*   Pregnancy complications in women.\n\n【44】*   Gastrointestinal (GI) problems.\n\n【45】*   It may also lead to cancers.\n\n【46】*   Gout (a kind of arthritis characterized by significant joint pain, redness, and tenderness.).\n\n【47】What Is the Prognosis and How Do To Live With Thrombocythemia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Patients with essential thrombocythemia have roughly the same life expectancy as the general population. Living with thrombocythemia can be challenging. However, patients can manage it by following a few guidelines to help regulate it.\n\n【49】*   Avoid smoking; it may increase the risk for blood clots.\n\n【50】*   Monitor other health conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\n【51】*   Checkups and blood tests are necessary on a regular basis.\n\n【52】*   Making a few lifestyle modifications to gain control and reduce the difficulties.\n\n【53】*   Keep a record of any new signs and symptoms and notify the doctor.\n\n【54】*   There is a lot of help out there to maintain a better lifestyle.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】Conclusively, thrombocythemia is a slowly progressing illness in which the bone marrow generates an abnormally large number of platelets and is not caused by other medical disorders. Also known as essential thrombocythemia. It is often caused by a genetic mutation that can occur at any point in a person's life. Most of the time, it is discovered accidentally during a regular blood test done for another problem. Medication that lowers the platelet count is used for therapy. This is common among older people. A person with ET can live a long and healthy life with excellent health.\n\n【57】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【58】* * *\n\n【59】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Thrombocythemia Serious?**\n\n【60】Thrombocythemia causes increased platelet production, which may lead to the following complications:  \n\\- Blood clots in the brain.  \n\\- Blood clotting in the heart.  \n\\- Myelofibrosis.  \n\\- Acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\n【61】#### **2.**删除换行**How to Treat Thrombocythemia?**\n\n【62】The treatment of thrombocythemia depends on the severity of symptoms, patient’s age, and medical history. It includes:  \n\\- Chemotherapy - Medications such as Hydroxyurea and Interferon alpha are provided either in pill form or injections.  \n\\- Radioactive phosphorus.  \n\\- Plateletpheresis.\n\n【63】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Causes of Thrombocythemia?**\n\n【64】Various factors may lead to thrombocythemia:  \n\\- Bone marrow abnormalities result in excess platelet production.  \n\\- Genetic defects.  \n\\- Other conditions like anemia or infection may also lead to increased platelet production, termed secondary thrombocytosis.\n\n【65】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Thrombocythemia Considered Cancer?**\n\n【66】Thrombocythemia is characterized by excessive and abnormal platelet production that results in blood clots (thrombus) in the blood vessels. The disease also belongs to the class of blood cancer called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The myeloproliferative neoplasm results in abnormal functioning of the bone marrow cells. Therefore, thrombocythemia is considered a type of blood cancer.\n\n【67】#### **5.**删除换行**How Do Thrombocytosis and Thrombocythemia Differ?**\n\n【68】Both thrombocytosis and thrombocythemia refer to platelet disorders. However, they differ as follows:  \n\\- Thrombocytosis, also referred to as reactive thrombocytosis, occurs due to underlying medical conditions.  \n\\- Thrombocythemia, also known as essential thrombocythemia, occurs due to bone marrow defects and not underlying systemic disorders.  \n\\- They both cause increased platelet production.\n\n【69】#### **6.**删除换行**Does Myelofibrosis Cause Thrombocytosis?**\n\n【70】Myelofibrosis causes abnormal functioning of the bone marrow cells that results in decreased production of blood-forming cells such as platelets, red blood cells, etc. Therefore, it may cause the following conditions:  \n\\- Anemia (decreased red blood cells).  \n\\- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  \n\\- Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen).  \nTherefore myelofibrosis does not cause thrombocytosis (increased platelet production).\n\n【71】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is Severe Thrombocytopenia?**\n\n【72】The decrease in platelet count is considered thrombocytopenia; when the count is less than 50,000 per microliter, the condition is termed severe thrombocytopenia. The affected individuals may have the following risk:  \n\\- Blood loss.  \n\\- Intracranial hemorrhage.  \n\\- Bleeding may also occur within the digestive tract.\n\n【73】#### **8.**删除换行**What Platelet Count Is Considered Thrombocytopenia?**\n\n【74】Thrombocytopenia is a disorder of the blood-forming cells. Every individual has a platelet count of 150,000 to 450,000 per mL of blood. However, the ranges may differ in men and women. When the level falls below 150,000 platelets per mL (microliter), then it is considered thrombocytopenia. It may cause the following symptoms:  \n\\- Easy bruising.  \n\\- Nosebleeds.  \n\\- Fatigue.  \n\\- Excessive bleeding from cuts.\n\n【75】#### **9.**删除换行**Are Thrombocythemia and Myelofibrosis the Same?**\n\n【76】Thrombocythemia is considered a myeloproliferative disease, as bone marrow defects lead to decreased platelet production. In addition, the complications of thrombocythemia include:  \n\\- Myelofibrosis is a bone marrow neoplasm causing abnormal production of blood-forming cells such as platelets, RBCs (red blood cells), and WBCs (white blood cells).  \n\\- Acute myeloid leukemia.  \nTherefore, thrombocythemia is associated with myelofibrosis.\n\n【77】#### **10.**删除换行**Can I Acquire Thrombocythemia?**\n\n【78】Thrombocythemia is not hereditary, but an individual may acquire it due to genetic changes (mutations). The mutations that occur in JAK2 and CALR genes are responsible for causing essential thrombocythemia. Due to mutations in JAK2 and CALR genes, there is increased production of thrombocytes (platelets), leading to thrombocythemia.\n\n【79】#### **11.**删除换行**Is Thrombocythemia Termed a Blood Disorder?**\n\n【80】Yes, thrombocythemia is considered an uncommon blood disorder. It results in increased platelet (thrombocyte) production causing blood clots. There are various factors involved in causing thrombocythemia; however, the genetic mutations in JAK2 and CALR genes are the most common cause. The individual affected with thrombocythemia may have the following symptoms:  \n\\- Fatigue.  \n\\- Dizziness.  \n\\- Bleeding from the nose.  \n\\- Abdominal pain.  \n\\- Blood clots in legs, other body organs, etc.\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>*   Thrombocythemia  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/thrombocythemia\n*   Thrombocythemia  \n    https://bloodcancer.org.uk/understanding-blood-cancer/essential-thrombocythaemia-et/\n*   Thrombocythemia  \n    https://www.lls.org/myeloproliferative-neoplasms/essential-thrombocythemia\n*   Thrombocythemia  \n    https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/blood-cancer/essential-thrombocythaemia-et\n*   Thrombocythemia  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/essential-thrombocythemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20361064</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Women visit a doctor, nurse, or midwife throughout their pregnancy for checkups. Prenatal care is crucial for maintaining the health of the pregnant woman. A healthcare professional comprising the doctor, nurse, or midwife will monitor an unborn child's growth and perform regular tests to help identify and solve any potential issues. These routine visits are also a good opportunity to ask additional questions regarding pregnancy and the delivery of the unborn child.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Trimesters of Pregnancy?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Nine months of pregnancy is divided into three phases as follows:\n\n【4】*   **First Trimester -** The duration from the first month of pregnancy to the third month.\n\n【5】*   **Second Trimester -** The duration from the fourth to the sixth month of pregnancy.\n\n【6】*   **Third Trimester -** The duration from the seventh month of pregnancy till the child's birth.\n\n【7】When Should Women Begin Scheduling Prenatal Care Appointments?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Women can begin prenatal treatment as soon as they find out they are pregnant. The optimum time to see a doctor is before a woman gets pregnant; this process is referred to as pre-pregnancy care or preconception planning. Prenatal visits should start right away after the pregnancy is confirmed.\n\n【9】What Are the First-trimester Appointments for Prenatal Care?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Prenatal treatment during the first trimester involves blood testing, a physical examination, and discussions about life. An essential component of a healthy pregnancy is prenatal care. Here are the things to anticipate during the first few prenatal appointments, regardless of whether a person selects a family doctor, obstetrician, midwife, or group prenatal care.\n\n【11】**1\\. The Initial Visit**: Women should make their first prenatal appointment as soon as they know about pregnancy. Doctors allocate time during the initial visit to review medical history and discuss any risk factors or pregnancy-related issues. This will enable the doctor to provide the best treatment for the mother and the unborn child. In addition, a doctor will inquire about the following:\n\n【12】*   Monthly cycle, gynecological history, and previous pregnancies.\n\n【13】*   Exposure to potentially harmful substances.\n\n【14】*   The intake of any over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements.\n\n【15】*   Consumption of coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.\n\n【16】*   Travel history to regions where malaria, tuberculosis, pox, or other infectious diseases are prevalent.\n\n【17】**2) Due Date:** It is crucial to determine the due date or anticipated delivery date. It enables the doctor to monitor both the development of the unborn child and the progress of the pregnancy. The doctor will use the beginning of the last period, plus seven days, and go back three months to predict the day the woman will give birth. The due date is calculated as 40 weeks post the first day of the last period. The doctor can use a prenatal ultrasound to determine the day. The ultrasound is typically utilized to determine the due date if the difference between the date determined using the last period and the date determined using an early ultrasound is more than seven days.\n\n【18】**3) Physical Examination of the Body:** A doctor will take weight, height, and body mass index measurements to determine how much weight women need to acquire for a healthy pregnancy. The doctor may perform a physical examination, including a breast and pelvic exam. Depending on the circumstances, thyroid, lung, and heart tests may be asked to be performed.\n\n【19】**4\\. Laboratory Tests:** The following tests are required during the first trimester:\n\n【20】*   Blood tests may be performed during the initial prenatal visit to determine the blood type and Rh status. Rh factor, a protein on the surface of red blood cells, is a hereditary feature.\n\n【21】*   Check hemoglobin level. Red blood cells have the iron-rich protein hemoglobin, which enables the cells to transport oxygen from the lungs to other body regions. Carbon dioxide is also transported to the lungs by hemoglobin from other body parts. Anemia is indicated by low hemoglobin or a low level of red blood cells. Being pregnant may be impacted by anemia, which can make women extremely exhausted.\n\n【22】*   Verification of resistance to certain infections. This often includes varicella and rubella.\n\n【23】*   Check for exposure to more infections. The doctor may advise blood tests to look for diseases like hepatitis B, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)-causing virus.\n\n【24】*   A urine sample may also be examined for indications of a bladder infection or urinary tract infection.\n\n【25】**5) Tests for Fetal Concern:** Prenatal tests can reveal important details about the unborn child's health. These include blood or ultrasound testing for fetal genetic issues like Down syndrome.\n\n【26】**6) Lifestyle Concerns:** The doctor may speak about the value of prenatal vitamins and nutrition. They may inquire about travel while pregnant, vaccines, dental care, exercise, sex, and other lifestyle-related concerns.\n\n【27】**7) Pregnancy Discomfort:** Initially, the body may change. Women can have painful, swollen breasts. Morning sickness, or nausea with or without vomiting, is another typical symptom. If morning sickness is severe, consultation with the doctor is important.\n\n【28】**8) Additional First Trimester Visits:** The subsequent prenatal appointments, typically made every four weeks throughout the first trimester, can be shorter than the initial one. For example, a small gadget called a Doppler bounces sound waves off to the baby's heart so that a person can hear the baby's heartbeat before the end of the first trimester, around 12 weeks to 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【29】What Is Second Trimester Prenatal Care?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】A restored sense of well-being is common throughout the second trimester. Usually, morning sickness starts to subside. Women start to sense the baby's movement. The abdomen becomes more apparent. The doctor may arrange prenatal appointments every four weeks on average during the second trimester. Also, routine laboratory tests are done to check for the baby's growth.\n\n【31】What to Anticipate During Appointments of the Second Trimester?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】**1) Review the fundamentals:**\n\n【33】*   The doctor will weigh and check blood pressure. The patient can verbalize any concerns if present.\n\n【34】*   Watch the child's development.\n\n【35】*   The healthcare professional determines the unborn child's size by measuring the distance between the pubic bone and fundal height (the top of the uterus). This measurement in centimeters usually corresponds to the number of weeks a woman has been pregnant, plus or minus 2 cm after 20 weeks.\n\n【36】*   Audible heartbeats. The baby's heartbeat should be heard. A Doppler device may detect the unborn child's heartbeat during second-trimester checkups.\n\n【37】*   Check the fetal movement. When women start to feel flutters or kicks, tell the doctor about it. Remember that mothers experience various motions at different times and that movement is generally unanticipated during pregnancy. Flutters may be felt for the first time during weeks 18 and 20 of pregnancy.\n\n【38】*   Additionally, inquire with the doctor about any immunizations women may require.\n\n【39】**2\\. Prenatal Testing:** Pregnant women require several prenatal screenings or tests throughout the second trimester.\n\n【40】**3\\. DNA Analysis:** Blood tests to check for chromosomal or genetic disorders such as spina bifida or Down syndrome. If the results are alarming, the doctor will advise a diagnostic procedure, usually an amniocentesis. A sample of the fluid that surrounds and shields a developing fetus during pregnancy is taken from the uterus during amniocentesis and tested.\n\n【41】**4) Pregnancy Ultrasound:** Fetal ultrasound is an imaging test that creates images of a developing child inside the womb using high-frequency sound waves. A thorough ultrasound can assist medical professionals in assessing fetal anatomy. It may also provide the chance to determine the infant's gender.\n\n【42】**5) Blood Test:** During 24 weeks to 28 weeks of pregnancy, blood tests may be conducted to evaluate blood count and iron levels and to check for diabetes, which can develop during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).\n\n【43】What Are the Third Trimester Appointments for Prenatal Care?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Prenatal care during the third trimester may include vaginal examinations to check the baby's position. In addition, the third trimester includes continued health checkups along with the following:\n\n【45】1.  **Regular Checkup** \\- The doctor will ask about symptoms like contractions, bleeding, or fluid leakage. The doctor will monitor blood pressure, weight increase, and the heartbeat and movements of the unborn child.\n\n【46】2.  **Movement of Baby** - The doctor may advise tracking how often women feel the baby move each day to be informed if the baby stops moving around as often.\n\n【47】3.  **Immunization** - Additionally, women should discuss with the doctor any immunizations required, such as the TDAP (tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) vaccine and the flu shot. The ideal time to administer the TDAP vaccine is between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【48】4.  **Obtain a Group B Strep Test** \\- Throughout the third trimester, anticipate being examined for group B streptococcus (GBS). Adults typically have no symptoms from the common bacterium GBS, which is frequently carried in the bowels or lower genital tract. However, infants exposed to GBS following vaginal delivery may develop life-threatening symptoms. The doctor will swab the lower vagina and anal area to check for GBS. A lab test will be conducted on the sample.\n\n【49】5.  **Verify the Infant's Posture** \\- A doctor checks to ensure the baby is lying head-first in the uterus as the delivery date draws closer. Suppose the baby is lying rump-first (frank breech) or feet-first (complete breech) after week 36 of pregnancy. In that case, a healthcare professional will manually move the baby into a head-first position while applying pressure to the abdomen. A skilled physician often performs this with the supervision of ultrasound. A doctor will discuss a C-section if the baby continues to be in the breech position.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Prenatal care is essential throughout pregnancy for the mother and the developing fetus. Prenatal sessions are a great opportunity for the family and the mother to ask questions and get answers. A doctor should be contacted in case of any problems. The peace of mind comes from knowing support is available. However trivial or unimportant, the concern should be shared with the healthcare professional frankly.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pregnancy week by week  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20044882\n*   What is prenatal care and why is it important?  \n    https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/pregnancy/conditioninfo/prenatal-care\n*   Prenatal Care  \n    https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/prenatal-care</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "21244650-121c-4dc5-a667-2e591f7b72d9", "title": "Atovaquone Oral Suspension - Uses, Side Effects, Warnings, and Precautions", "text": "【0】Atovaquone Oral Suspension - Uses, Side Effects, Warnings, and Precautions\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Atovaquone oral suspension is an antimicrobial agent used to prevent or treat a serious type of lung infection called Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Atovaquone is a medication that helps to stop the symptoms of infection such as fever, cough, tiredness, and shortness of breath. Atovaquone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999.\n\n【2】What Is the Clinical Use of Atovaquone?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Atovaquone oral solution is a quinone antimicrobial drug that is indicated for:\n\n【4】*   Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in adults and children aged 13 years and above who are unable to tolerate Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【5】*   Treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in adults and children aged 13 years and above who are unable to tolerate Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【6】**Dosage and Administration-**\n\n【7】Atovaquone is supplied in foil pouches and bottles-\n\n【8】*   For the prevention of PCP, 1,500 milligrams (10 milliliters) of Atovaquone once a day with food is used.\n\n【9】*   For the treatment of PCP, 750 milligrams (5 milliliters) of Atovaquone twice a day with food for 21 days is used.\n\n【10】What Are the Warnings and Precautions of Atovaquone?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   **Risk of Limited Oral Absorption-** Absorption of Atovaquone oral suspension is limited, but it can be significantly increased when the drug is administered with food. Failure to administer Atovaquone oral suspension with food can result in lower plasma concentrations, limiting the response to therapy. In this case, therapy with other agents should be considered in patients who have difficulty taking Atovaquone oral suspension with food or in patients who have gastrointestinal disorders that may limit the absorption of oral medications.\n\n【12】*   **Hepatotoxicity-** Cholestatic hepatitis, fatal liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported in patients treated with Atovaquone.\n\n【13】**Drug Interactions-**\n\n【14】*   **Rifampin or Rifabutin-** Concomitant administration of Rifampin or Rifabutin and Atovaquone oral suspension is known to reduce its concentrations; hence, it is not recommended to be used at the same time.\n\n【15】*   **Tetracycline-** Concomitant administration of Tetracycline and Atovaquone oral suspension have been associated with reduced plasma concentrations.\n\n【16】*   **Metoclopramide-** Metoclopramide can reduce the bioavailability of Atovaquone, and hence it should be used only if other antiemetics are not available.\n\n【17】*   **Indinavir-** Consequesant administration of Indinavir and Atovaquone did not change Indinavir's steady-state AUC (area under the curve) and Cmax (maximum concentration), yet they resulted in a decreased C-trough (concentration reached by a drug right before the next dose is given) of Indinavir. Therefore, caution must be taken while administering Atovaquone oral suspension with Indinavir due to the decreased trough concentrations of Indinavir. Patients should be monitored for potential loss of efficacy of Indinavir in cases where coadministration with Atovaquone oral suspension is necessary.\n\n【18】**Use In Specific Populations-**\n\n【19】*   **Pregnancy-** Insufficient data is available to evaluate the use of Atovaquone in pregnant women to identify the risk for miscarriage, major birth defects, and adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV infected with PCP are more prone to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Atovaquone given orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause any fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to three times and 0.5 times, respectively.\n\n【20】*   **Lactation-** Currently, no data is available on the presence of Atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or milk production. Atovaquone was found in rat milk when lactating rats were given Atovaquone orally. If a drug is present in animal milk, it will likely be present in human milk as well. Because of the chances for HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission to HIV-negative infants, mothers with HIV-1 should not breastfeed if they are taking Atovaquone for the prevention or treatment of PCP.\n\n【21】*   **Pediatric Use-** The safety and effectiveness of Atovaquone in children have not been evaluated yet.\n\n【22】*   **Geriatric Use-** No sufficient information is available to evaluate the difference between effectiveness in older and younger patients.\n\n【23】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【24】What Is Pneumocystis Pneumonia?\n-------------------------------\n\n【25】Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a serious type of infection that is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Most people who are affected by PCP have a medical condition that weakens their immune system, like HIV, or take medicines (corticosteroids) that lower their body’s ability to fight germs and recover from the sickness. The symptoms of PCP include fever, chills, cough, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and tiredness. Currently, no vaccines are available to prevent PCP, but it is managed with medications.\n\n【26】Why Is Atovaquone Prescribed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】Atovaquone is used for treating Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in teenagers and adults. Atovaquone is also used for preventing pneumonia in teenagers and adults who cannot take any other medication that is used for preventing pneumonia. Atovaquone comes under a class of medications known as antiprotozoal agents and works by stopping the growth of certain types of protozoa that are responsible for causing pneumonia.\n\n【28】How Should Atovaquone Be Used?\n------------------------------\n\n【29】Atovaquone comes in a liquid form to be taken by mouth. When Atovaquone is used for treating pneumonia, it is taken with meals twice daily for 21 days. When Atovaquone is used for preventing pneumonia, it is taken once daily with a meal.\n\n【30】*   Patients are advised to take Atovaquone at the same time every day and follow the directions given on the prescription label or ask the doctor or pharmacist to explain any part that is not understandable.\n\n【31】*   Atovaquone should be taken exactly as directed. It should not be taken more or less or more often than prescribed by the doctor.\n\n【32】*   If the medication is in a bottle, shake the bottle gently each time before using it to mix the medication evenly. A dose-measuring spoon or a cup can be used to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose.\n\n【33】*   If the medication is in a packet, drink the medication directly from the packet or pour the medication into a dosing spoon or cup.\n\n【34】*   Take this medication as written in the prescription. It should not be stopped early, even if it is being used to treat pneumonia and the patient feels better already. If a patient stops taking Atovaquone too soon or skips the doses, the infection may not be completely treated, and the patient may not be protected from future infections.\n\n【35】*   If a patient has pneumonia, they may also be prone to other types of lung infections, and Atovaquone will not treat these infections. A doctor may prescribe other antibiotics to take along with this medication.\n\n【36】**Other Uses-**\n\n【37】Atovaquone is also used along with other medications to treat babesiosis (an infectious disease carried by ticks).\n\n【38】What Special Precautions Should Be Followed for Atovaquone?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   If a patient is allergic to Atovaquone, or any of the ingredients present in Atovaquone suspension, it should be informed to the doctor.\n\n【40】*   All the prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and or any herbal products taken by the patient should be informed to the doctor.\n\n【41】*   It is important to mention medications like Rifabutin or Rifampin because the doctor may need to change the doses of medications or monitor the patient carefully for side effects.\n\n【42】*   If a patient has or has ever had stomach or intestinal disorders or liver disease, then it should be informed to the doctor.\n\n【43】*   If a patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning for pregnancy, then it should be informed to the doctor. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking Atovaquone, contact a doctor immediately.\n\n【44】**What Special Dietary Instructions Should Be Followed?**\n\n【45】Unless a doctor advises otherwise, continue the normal diet.\n\n【46】**What Should Be Done if a Dose Is Missed?**\n\n【47】The patient should take the missed dose as soon as they remember it. However, the missed dose can be skipped if it is almost time for the next dose. Take only a partial dose to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【48】What Side Effects Can Atovaquone Cause?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   Nausea.\n\n【50】*   Vomiting.\n\n【51】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【52】*   Headache.\n\n【53】*   Dizziness.\n\n【54】*   Anxiety.\n\n【55】*   Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\n【56】*   Fever.\n\n【57】*   Rash.\n\n【58】*   Hives.\n\n【59】*   Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, mouth, or throat.\n\n【60】*   Difficulty breathing or swallowing.\n\n【61】*   Hoarseness or throat tightness.\n\n【62】**Storage and Disposal-**\n\n【63】*   The medication should be kept in a cool and dry area and away from sunlight.\n\n【64】*   Unneeded medication should be disposed of.\n\n【65】*   The medication should not be flushed down the toilet instead, contact the local garbage recycling department to dispose of the medication.\n\n【66】What Should Be Done in Case of Overdose?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【67】In case of an overdose, contact the poison control hotline immediately. If the patient has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or cannot be awakened, they should be immediately rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\n【68】**Other Information-**\n\n【69】*   Any medication should only be taken by the person it is prescribed for and not shared with other people.\n\n【70】*   The patient should keep a written list of all the prescription and nonprescription drugs they are taking, and it should be brought in each appointment with a doctor.\n\n【71】*   The list should always be carried in case of emergencies.\n\n【72】For Doctors:\n------------\n\n【73】**Indications-**\n\n【74】*   **Prevention of Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia-** Atovaquone oral suspension is indicated for preventing pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and above) who cannot tolerate Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【75】*   **Treatment of Mild-To-Moderate Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP)-** Atovaquone oral suspension is indicated for treating mild-to-moderate PCP in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and above) who cannot tolerate Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【76】**Limitations of Use:**\n\n【77】Clinical experience with Atovaquone for the treatment of PCP has been limited to patients with mild-to-moderate PCP. Treatment for severe episodes of PCP with Atovaquone has not been studied yet. Atovaquone's efficacy in patients failing therapy with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has also not been studied.\n\n【78】**Dosage and Administration:**\n\n【79】*   **Dosage For the Prevention of PCP-** The recommended oral dosage is 1,500 milligrams (10 milliliters) once a day, administered with food.\n\n【80】*   **Dosage For the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate PCP-** The recommended oral dosage is 750 milligrams (5 milliliters) twice a day, administered with food for 21 days.\n\n【81】**Important Administration Instructions:**\n\n【82】*   Atovaquone oral suspension should be administered with food to avoid low plasma concentrations that limit response to the therapy.\n\n【83】*   Open each five milliliters pouch by folding along the dotted line and tearing it open at a horizontal slit as directed by the arrow on the pouch.\n\n【84】*   For a five milliliters dose, take the entire contents either by placing directly into the mouth or by dispensing into a dosing spoon (5 milliliters) or a cup before administration by the mouth.\n\n【85】*   For a ten-milliliter dose, take the contents of two pouches.\n\n【86】*   Gently shake the medication bottle before administering the recommended dosage.\n\n【87】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n\n【88】Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic drug closely resembling ubiquinone’s structure. The inhibitory effect of Atovaquone can be compared to that of Ubiquinone; it can selectively affect mitochondrial electron transport and parallel processes such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pyrimidine biosynthesis in Atovaquone-responsive parasites. Cytochrome bc1 complex is a highly discriminating molecular target for Atovaquone in plasmodia. No significant risk is present for myelosuppression associated with Atovaquone, which makes it a beneficial therapeutic agent for recipients of bone marrow transplantation.\n\n【89】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【90】The mechanism of action against Pneumocystis carinii has not been studied fully. In Plasmodium species, the site of action is the cytochrome bc1 complex. Numerous metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain through Ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by Atovaquone will indirectly inhibit these enzymes. The metabolic effects of the blockade can include inhibition of nucleic acid and ATP synthesis. Atovaquone has also shown good in vitro activity against Toxoplasma gondii.\n\n【91】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【92】*   **Absorption-**The bioavailability of Atovaquone is variable and low and is highly dependent on the formulation and diet. The bioavailability of the suspension increases two-fold when taken with meals. When given with food, the bioavailability is approximately 47 percent. Without food, bioavailability becomes 23 percent.\n\n【93】*   **The Volume of Distribution-** 0.60 to 0.17 liters per kilogram.\n\n【94】*   **Protein Binding-** Atovaquone is vividly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 99.9 percent) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 micrograms per milliliter.\n\n【95】*   **Metabolism-** Some evidence suggests limited metabolism with Atovaquone.\n\n【96】*   **Route of Elimination-**The half-life of Atovaquone is long because of the presumed enterohepatic cycling and fecal elimination. There was little or no excretion of Atovaquone found in the urine (less than 0.6 percent).\n\n【97】*   **Half-life-** 2.2 to 3.2 days.\n\n【98】*   **Clearance-** 10.4 to 5.5 milliliters per minute.\n\n【99】**Storage and Handling:**\n\n【100】The medication should be stored at 15 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius. Do not freeze the medication.\n\n【101】**Contraindications-** Atovaquone oral suspension is contraindicated in patients who develop or have a history of hypersensitivity reactions such as bronchospasm, angioedema, throat tightness, or urticaria with respect to Atovaquone or any other components present in Atovaquone oral suspension.\n\n【102】**Clinical Trial-**\n\n【103】In two clinical trials, Atovaquone oral suspension was compared with Dapsone or aerosolized Pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescents (13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP and unable to tolerate Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【104】*   In the Dapsone trial, the patients were given Atovaquone oral suspension (1500 milligrams once daily) for six months. Among patients taking neither Dapsone nor Atovaquone at enrollment, adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 43 percent of patients treated with Dapsone and 20 percent of patients treated with Atovaquone oral suspension. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more frequently reported in patients treated with Atovaquone oral suspension.\n\n【105】*   In the Pentamidine trial, patients were given Atovaquone oral suspension once daily (750 milligrams or 1,500 milligrams) or received aerosolized Pentamidine 300 milligrams every four weeks for six months. The adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of dosing in patients receiving Atovaquone oral suspension of 1,500 milligrams once daily were rash (six percent), diarrhea (four percent), and nausea (three percent). The adverse reaction requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving aerosolized Pentamidine was bronchospasm (two percent).\n\n【106】**Adverse Effects-**\n\n【107】**1\\. More Than Ten Percent-**\n\n【108】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【109】*   Cough.\n\n【110】*   Depression.\n\n【111】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【112】*   Dyspnea.\n\n【113】*   Fever.\n\n【114】*   Headache.\n\n【115】*   Infection.\n\n【116】*   Insomnia.\n\n【117】*   Myalgia.\n\n【118】*   Nausea.\n\n【119】*   Rash.\n\n【120】*   Rhinitis.\n\n【121】*   Vomiting.\n\n【122】*   Weakness.\n\n【123】**2\\. Between One to Ten Percent-**\n\n【124】*   Amylase increased.\n\n【125】*   Anemia.\n\n【126】*   Anorexia.\n\n【127】*   Anxiety.\n\n【128】*   BUN (blood urea nitrogen) or creatinine increased.\n\n【129】*   Constipation.\n\n【130】*   Dyspepsia.\n\n【131】*   Dizziness.\n\n【132】*   Hyperglycemia.\n\n【133】*   Hypoglycemia.\n\n【134】*   Hyponatremia.\n\n【135】*   Liver enzymes elevated.\n\n【136】*   Neutropenia.\n\n【137】*   Pruritus.\n\n【138】*   Oral moniliasis.\n\n【139】*   Taste perversion.\n\n【140】**Non-Clinical Toxicology-**\n\n【141】Carcinogenicity studies in rats were found negative, but 24-month studies in mice (dosed with 50, 100, or 200 milligrams per kilogram per day) showed a treatment-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma at all doses tested, which correlated with the average steady-state plasma concentrations (1.4 to 3.6 times) in humans during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone was found to be negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and the cultured human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was found in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\n\n【142】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【143】无关删除-1:<u>*   atovaquone suspension  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2008/020500s010lbl.pdf\n*   ATOVAQUONE suspension  \n    https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=2445304e-4b4e-4358-b098-31f3c49c52ef\n*   Atovaquone  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a693003.html\n*   Atovaquone  \n    https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Atovaquone</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

As a result, bacteria, viruses, and other pathogen toxins are released into the blood or tissues. Sepsis is otherwise called blood poisoning. Hepatobiliary sepsis is an infection spreading to the biliary tract. Hepatobiliary sepsis is a life-threatening condition that often results in death.\n\n【2】What Is Hepatobiliary Sepsis?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Hepatobiliary sepsis is a grave condition that rapidly progresses and leads to serious complications, often resulting in death. Hepatobiliary sepsis is an infection that spreads to the biliary tract. Biliary tract sepsis is a severe disease. The liver, gallbladder, and bile duct form the biliary system. Bile is secreted by the liver and transported by the biliary duct. The biliary tract is responsible for bile transportation. Sepsis is the most common cause of multi-organ failure. It is the body's inflammatory response against the pathogen's toxin.\n\n【4】The following condition characterizes sepsis:\n\n【5】*   Hypertension (low blood pressure) below 100 mmHg.\n\n【6】*   Altered mental status.\n\n【7】*   Respiratory rate more than or equal to 22 breaths per minute.\n\n【8】What Causes Hepatobiliary Sepsis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【9】Proliferating clusters of bacteria resulting in infection are responsible for causing infection (sepsis). Any obstruction in the biliary tract due to infections or other causes can result in hepatobiliary sepsis. Infection within the biliary system can also lead to sepsis. Sometimes, an infection from the lungs or other organs can travel to the biliary tract, obstructing the excretion of the liver and resulting in infection. The following conditions cause hepatobiliary sepsis:\n\n【10】*   Gall bladder stones (deposition of hard material).\n\n【11】*   Cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct).\n\n【12】*   Cholestatic disease (a condition characterized by impaired bile flow).\n\n【13】*   Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).\n\n【14】*   Biliary cirrhosis (prolonged bile duct obstruction).\n\n【15】*   Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder).\n\n【16】*   Choledocholithiasis (stones in the common bile duct).\n\n【17】*   Carcinoma of the gall bladder (gallbladder cancer).\n\n【18】*   Cholangiocarcinoma (a condition in which a tumor can arise anywhere in the biliary tree).\n\n【19】*   Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder - a condition in which hyperplasia (enlargement or growth of tissue or organ) of the muscle and the mucosa of the gallbladder occurs.\n\n【20】*   Liver cell damage.\n\n【21】*   Surgery of gallbladder disease.\n\n【22】*   Surgery of liver disease.\n\n【23】*   Fibrosis of the portal tract of the liver.\n\n【24】*   Immunocompromised patients, such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or tuberculosis, are susceptible to the broad spectrum of infectious microorganisms.\n\n【25】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hepatobiliary Sepsis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The following are the symptoms of hepatobiliary sepsis:\n\n【27】*   High fever.\n\n【28】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【29】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【30】*   Severe abdominal pain.\n\n【31】*   Pain in the shoulder.\n\n【32】*   Jaundice.\n\n【33】*   Generalized itching.\n\n【34】*   Lethargy.\n\n【35】*   Weakness.\n\n【36】*   Confusion.\n\n【37】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【38】*   Profuse sweating.\n\n【39】*   Headache.\n\n【40】*   Myalgia (muscle pain).\n\n【41】*   Arthralgia (joint pain).\n\n【42】*   Irritability.\n\n【43】*   Depression.\n\n【44】*   Fatigue.\n\n【45】*   Weight loss.\n\n【46】*   Hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\n\n【47】*   Mild splenomegaly (spleen enlargement).\n\n【48】The following are the signs of hepatobiliary sepsis:\n\n【49】*   Hypertension (low blood pressure) below 100 mmHg.\n\n【50】*   Altered mental status.\n\n【51】*   Respiratory rate more than or equal to 22 breaths per minute.\n\n【52】*   Jaundice.\n\n【53】*   Pale stools.\n\n【54】*   Dark urine.\n\n【55】*   Low urine output.\n\n【56】How Is Hepatobiliary Sepsis Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【57】Hepatobiliary sepsis is a condition that warrants immediate medical attention, and they need to be hospitalized. Hepatobiliary sepsis causes serious complications like multi-organ failure. Hepatobiliary sepsis can be diagnosed by physical examination, medical history of the patient, and investigations. The following methods help diagnose hepatobiliary sepsis:\n\n【58】*   **Physical Examination -** A doctor can feel tenderness in the liver or abdomen on physical examination. Doctors can check for signs of jaundice, such as yellowing of skin, eyes, mucosa, and nails. The doctor can check for vitals to detect the location of the infection. The signs of sepsis can be found by examining vitals such as the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen level.\n\n【59】*   **Medical History -** The patient should be quizzed thoroughly on medical history and surgery as it could provide vital information regarding exposure to bacteria, a list of medications, or any habit or practice responsible for worsening the condition. Adequate attention should be paid to risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to tuberculosis, and underlying immune status, which helps diagnose sepsis's cause while eliciting medical history.\n\n【60】*   **Blood Tests -** A routine blood test helps diagnose the infection. The white blood cells count increases in case of an infection. Elevation in serum bilirubin level indicates jaundice, a common feature of liver disease.\n\n【61】*   **Urine Test -** Urine culture can also help in detecting the infection. Low urine output is a common symptom seen in sepsis.\n\n【62】*   **Ultrasound -** This technique allows visualization of the organ in the abdomen. Ultrasound can help measure the liver's size and help assess the adjacent organs affected by hepatomegaly.\n\n【63】*   **Computed Tomography Scan (CT Scan) -** A CT scan of the chest and the abdomen with contrast is a high-yield test for sepsis. CT scan can help in detecting the course and location of the infection.\n\n【64】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** This technique helps obtain higher-resolution images of the abdomen.\n\n【65】How Is Hepatobiliary Sepsis Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【66】The treatment of hepatobiliary sepsis depends upon the underlying cause of sepsis and the history of prior infection. The treatment aims to control sepsis as it results in the deterioration of the patient's quality of life. The treatment is dependent upon hemorrhage or low cardiac output.\n\n【67】The following general measures should be taken to control sepsis:\n\n【68】*   Early resuscitation can be done by following the sepsis six rule-\n\n【69】    *   Deliver high-flow oxygen.\n    *   Take blood culture.\n    *   Start intravenous fluid replacement.\n    *   Administer intravenous antibiotics.\n    *   Measure serum lactate and send full blood count.\n    *   Note the accurate measurement of urine output.\n*   Red cell transfusion should be done to increase hemoglobin concentration in the patient.\n\n【70】*   Early intubation (artificial ventilation) is recommended to reduce oxygen demand in severe cases.\n\n【71】*   Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered immediately after suspected sepsis. The choice of antibiotic depends upon the patient's resistance, source of infection, and risk factors. First and second-generation cephalosporins (Cephalothin, Cephazolin, Cefamandole) can be administered.\n\n【72】*   Medicines such as Dobutamine or Adrenaline can improve cardiac output in severe cases.\n\n【73】*   Calcium should be replaced if ionized calcium is low.\n\n【74】**Conclusion**\n\n【75】Hepatobiliary sepsis is a critical condition requiring urgent medical attention. Early source control of sepsis is recommended as soon as physiological stability is established. Early source control requires accurate diagnosis, urgent investigation, and proper treatment. A broad-spectrum antibiotic should be administered as soon as possible without delay, as treatment is associated with a five to ten percent increase in mortality rate. Hepatobiliary sepsis could progress to a life-threatening condition if not diagnosed earlier. However, drainage of sepsis with good medical therapy can help improve this condition in one to three days with an eventual positive resolution.\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hepatobiliary complications of sepsis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1047057/\n*   \\[Management of sepsis of the biliary tract: indications to surgical treatment\\]  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18250622/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The origin of energy for a cell is glucose; due to metabolic disturbance cell does not get energy in the form of glucose instead of the availability of glucose. People with various socioeconomic statuses and racial and ethnic minorities received varied care and treatments needed to cure the disease. These are just two ways that health disparities impact the disease.\n\n【2】Is Diabetes a Health Disparity?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The population in the backward areas with low socioeconomic status, such as the homeless population, can be very vulnerable to health disparities, especially when receiving quality healthcare to treat a chronic illness such as diabetes. Almost 10 percent of the United States. The population has diabetes; It can become even more difficult to have a chronic illness such as diabetes and to receive the correct treatment and nourishing foods for the body.\n\n【4】Most homeless shelters accept and distribute non-perishable food, which can be high in salt and problematic to individuals with diabetes and can lead to hypertension. The local organization homeless helping this specific organization will accept these donations to distribute to the population in hopes of improving the health of the homeless; this solution aims at the community level of the social-ecological model because this, as a whole, improves the health communication plan.\n\n【5】What Are the Health Disparities Among Racial/Ethnic Groups That Exist in Diabetes?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Diabetes is one of the seventh leading causes of death, accounting for more than 80 % of the mortality rate among blacks and other minority populations. The chances of getting diabetes are 33 % higher in Black and minority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom than in white populations.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Diabetes - How to Live Healthy</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Diabetes and Periodontitis</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Diabetes and Its Liver-Related (Hepatic) Complications</u>\n\n【12】The higher chance of getting diabetes in the different racial and ethnic groups is due to the amount of fat deposition in the middle region (abdomen) of the body, that is, the waist and the fat which is disposited is the visceral fat, poor access to the healthcare system, a variable environmental condition in different geographical area and the environmental conditions play a very important role in the development of diabetes.\n\n【13】The other most important risk factor which leads to diabetes mellitus is obesity (overweight), sedimentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activities, and stress. Effective management is necessary for improved outcomes for people with diabetes. Racial and ethnic differences can also act as roadblocks to efficient disease management.\n\n【14】1.  The ability of members to afford their prescription costs.\n\n【15】2.  **Awareness:** Understanding available treatments, the healthcare system, and the importance of adherence.\n\n【16】3.  **Accessibility:** The convenience of receiving healthcare and treatment needs through available sources and vicinity to those services.\n\n【17】4.  **Trust:** The level of security and assurance patients have in their access to healthcare.\n\n【18】The chances of complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, and dyslipidemia are also higher in black and minority ethnic groups in the UK than in white populations. This inequality in the distribution of the disease and its complication is due to unequal access to care, including testing (HbA1c) and the line of treatment.\n\n【19】What Are the Programs Targeting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Many governments and non-government organizations are working worldwide to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes mellitus. The National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP), overseen by the CDC, is a collaboration of public and private organizations that provides an affordable, evidence-based program for lifestyle modification to assist persons with prediabetes in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes. Participants in the program learn how to choose healthier foods, get more exercise, and develop coping mechanisms for difficulties and stress while working with a certified lifestyle coach. These alterations to their way of life can reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes by up to 58 % (71% for those over 60).\n\n【21】Even though the lifestyle modification program is accessible everywhere, enrollment among particular populations with a significant risk of developing type 2 is low.\n\n【22】CDC assists national organizations in launching and maintaining programs in locales with limited resources that address health disparities to boost participation among these populations. Telehealth is one of them, which plays an important role in providing access to healthcare despite the distance.\n\n【23】Telehealth can improve access to and participation in the National DPP lifestyle modification program. The training can be delivered in places with restricted access using telehealth technology like phones, smartphone apps, laptops, and videos. Telehealth is now a viable option for addressing the barriers preventing certain individuals from registering in the program due to recent technological advancements.\n\n【24】Telehealth has the following benefits:\n\n【25】1.  More people can participate in telehealth programs than in conventional in-person programs.\n\n【26】2.  Access for those who live in rural regions or other regions with limited resources is improved by telehealth technology, which is less constrained by time and distance restrictions.\n\n【27】**Conclusion:**\n\n【28】This chronic disease affects our body's metabolic system and the disparity in health due to diversity in the environment and socioeconomic status worldwide, which affects eating habits and leads to more complications in blacks. The different surroundings may cause diabetes discrepancies between races that African Americans and whites experience regarding health risks. To overcome this major issue, many organizations have come to a plan.\n\n【29】Early testing (HbA1c), prompt treatment, regular follow-up, good lifestyle, and good eating habits will help the population get over the disease. As soon as one feels any of the symptoms mentioned above or have any genetic history, then, without any delay, connect with the doctor and get the testing and treatment done without further delay; it will prevent from landing into complications.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diabetes Health Disparities  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367214/\n*   HealthEquityNow  \n    https://diabetes.org/healthequitynow\n*   Advancing Health Equity  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/health-equity/index.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "216dc11d-cbf0-4a55-9193-9a6a930474e2", "title": "Venogram - Uses, Types, and Procedure", "text": "【0】Venogram - Uses, Types, and Procedure\n**Introduction**:\n\n【1】A venogram is also called venography or phlebography, which uses a contrast agent and X-rays to visualize the veins in the body. This is commonly used in the diagnosis of venous abnormalities in the legs. This procedure uses contrast material to determine the flow of blood in the veins. The iodine-based solution is used as a contrast material in this procedure.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of a Venogram?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】A venogram is commonly used for the following purposes:\n\n【4】*   Determine the status of the venous system.\n\n【5】*   Deep venous thrombosis (formation of blood clots inside the deep veins).\n\n【6】*   Congenital vein problems.\n\n【7】*   Guiding tools in treatments such as placement of a stent in a vein.\n\n【8】*   Helps in finding the suitable vein for bypass (veins from part of the body are attached to the coronary artery near the area of blockage).\n\n【9】*   Detects varicose veins (swelling and twisting of the veins under the surface of the skin).\n\n【10】*   Used to find the cause of unexplained pain in the legs.\n\n【11】How To Prepare for Venography?\n------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Before the procedure, a consent form has to be signed.\n\n【13】*   Avoid eating four to six hours before the procedure.\n\n【14】*   Keep the doctor informed about any medical conditions, surgical history, and medicines consumed on a regular basis.\n\n【15】*   Inform the doctor regarding any allergic reactions to contrast material during the previous procedure.\n\n【16】How Is the Venogram Procedure Performed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   For the venogram procedure, the physician may instruct to remove the clothes and wear a hospital gown and may ask to lie on the procedure table.\n\n【18】*   Local anesthesia is given in the area where the needle will be inserted. They will put a mark on the parts of the body to locate the pulses. This procedure is often done on the leg.\n\n【19】*   The nurse will clean the feet to make them sterile and insert the intravenous(IV) line or insert them into the veins of other parts of the body which they are going to look at. Saline water may be passed through the IV line to check for any blockages before injecting the contrast material. Then, they will inject the contrast material (a special dye) into the vein. A warmth is felt when the dye passes through the body.\n\n【20】*   A tourniquet (tight band) is put on the part of the body, such as the arms or thigh, which makes the flow of contrast materials easily into deep veins on the part of the body to be visualized.\n\n【21】*   Using fluoroscopy, X-ray images are taken when the contrast material passes through the legs and lower body. Patients might be asked to hold their breath at varying times for a few seconds to get better images. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be required sometimes to get detailed information on the blood clot and blockage inside the veins. Finally, the nurse will place a dressing over the puncture site.\n\n【22】This procedure usually takes about 30 minutes to one hour to complete. Regular activities and diet can be continued after the procedure. Avoid lifting heavy weights as it may strain the body or do aggressive exercises for five days after the procedure. Tell the physician if there is any discharge from the puncture site. Kindly drink plenty of water after the procedure to flush out the contrast material from the body.\n\n【23】What Are the Types of Venography?\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】*   **Ascending Venogram**: In ascending venography, the tourniquets are placed just above the ankle and below the knee, which occludes the superficial system and directs the flow into deep veins. The catheter is inserted into the peripheral vein on the dorsum of the foot. In this procedure, 40 ccs of contrast material is injected. It is commonly used to locate deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【25】*   **Descending Venogram**: Descending venography is a less frequently done procedure. In this procedure, a tube is inserted into the femoral vein at the groin. It is used to detect the function of the deep vein walls.\n\n【26】*   **Upper Extremity Venogram**: This procedure is used to locate blood clots or abnormalities in the veins of the neck and arms. In upper extremity venography, the needle is inserted at the cubital vein at the elbow. It requires a low osmolar contrast medium of 300mgI/ml.\n\n【27】*   **Inferior Vena - Cavography**: Inferior vena - cavography is used to determine the function of the inferior vena cava, which brings blood to the heart. 40 ml of contrast materials are injected in this procedure.\n\n【28】What Are the Limitations of Venograms?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   Diabetic patients who are taking Metformin or related medicines are advised to stop taking them 48 hours after the procedure as drugs may interact with contrast dye which causes metabolic acidosis (increased buildup of acid in the body).\n\n【30】*   Radiation exposure in pregnant women causes birth defects in the fetus in the womb.\n\n【31】*   Injection of contrast material in patients with diabetes and kidney disorders may worsen their condition. According to the American Academy of Family physicians, 0.1 to 13 percent of patients who had contrast material during the procedure might get kidney failure.\n\n【32】*   Patients with severe swelling in the legs make the veins difficult to locate and visualize during the scan.\n\n【33】*   Patients with congestive heart failure (a condition in which heart muscles do not pump the blood well) and pulmonary hypertension (a condition in which high blood pressure in the arteries carries blood to the lungs).\n\n【34】What Are the Risks of Venography?\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】The venography procedure involves some level of risk. The common risks are as follows:\n\n【36】*   Swelling and infection at the injection site.\n\n【37】*   Fever.\n\n【38】*   Allergic reactions to contrast material. They are:\n\n【39】    *   Headache.\n\n【40】    *   Itching.\n\n【41】    *   Nausea (urge to vomit) and vomiting.\n\n【42】    *   Skin rashes.\n\n【43】Some of the severe symptoms of contrast materials are :\n\n【44】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【45】*   Rapid heart rate.\n\n【46】*   Low blood pressure.\n\n【47】*   Swelling of the body parts.\n\n【48】What Are the Treatment Options for Venous Compression?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】When the area of compression is found in the venogram, it may be treated by the following treatment procedures:\n\n【50】*   **Venoplasty** \\- A medical procedure used to treat narrow veins. In this procedure, under local anesthesia, a special tube called a catheter with a balloon at the end is inserted into the veins. Once the balloon is placed near the narrowed position, the doctors will inflate the balloon, which stretches the narrowed veins. This procedure improves venous blood flow.\n\n【51】*   **Venous Stent** \\- Under the guidance of the imaging technique, the stent (tiny, expandable tube) is placed in the narrowed veins through the catheter.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**:\n\n【53】A venogram is the gold-standard diagnostic tool for deep venous thrombosis. It is an effective imaging technique that can distinguish the blood clot in veins from venous obstruction. A venogram is a minimally invasive procedure in which radiation exposure is minimal. This procedure does not require hospitalization.\n\n【54】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【55】* * *\n\n【56】#### **1.**删除换行**What Type of Venogram Dye Is Used?**\n\n【57】Typically, a standard X-ray cannot reveal veins; hence, a venogram enables your doctor to visualize the veins with the help of an injecting substance called contrast dye or material, an iodine-based dye highly required for examining the blood flow on the veins under X-ray.\n\n【58】#### **2.**删除换行**At Which Place Is Venogram Performed?**\n\n【59】An x-ray or interventional radiological department of a hospital performs venograms. A needle is inserted into a vein of the foot by the medical professional. Through the needle, an intravenous (IV) line is placed. This line allows the contrast dye to enter the vein. The leg or foot might be tied with a tourniquet to allow the dye to reach the deeper veins.\n\n【60】#### **3.**删除换行**Do Venograms Count as Surgery?**\n\n【61】Venograms are generally safe procedures or minimally invasive techniques with minimal bleeding; therefore, no hospitalization is required. Hence it is not similar to open surgery. Although some patients can have adverse effects like pain or discomfort as the needle is placed into the vein or if the vein needs to be inserted deeper into the vein.\n\n【62】#### **4.**删除换行**What Distinguishes a Venogram From an Angiogram?**\n\n【63】Both procedures are performed in the radiology department of the hospital. However,  angiograms use x-ray images and special or contrast dye to check for blockages or narrowing of arteries that might obstruct the blood flow through the body. Whereas venogram assesses the blood flows within the vein using contrast material or dye injected into the vein. It is used to evaluate the varicose veins before surgery.\n\n【64】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Process of a Venogram?**\n\n【65】A venogram is a test where a contrast dye, an iodine-based dye, is injected into the veins. The pictorial representation of the vein is produced using a procedure known as fluoroscopy; a video of the blood flowing inside a specific body region is examined using an x-ray and dyes.\n\n【66】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) Venogram?**\n\n【67】A contrast material or iodine-based dye is injected into the blood vessels. It is followed by a CT (computed tomography) scan to assess blood vessels of the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, or other parts of your body. This aids in the evaluation of diseases or associated disorders, such as aneurysms (plaque accumulation within the artery) or blockages, blood clots, injury, and tumors of the vessels.\n\n【68】#### **7.**删除换行**Does an MRI Refer to a Venogram?**\n\n【69】Diagnostic imaging with several techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV). The MRV, like the MRI, doesn't utilize radiation to create images but provides a sharper picture of what's happening within the body. The MRV is particularly made to inspect your blood vessels. At the same time, MRI examines your organs, tissues, and skeletal system.\n\n【70】#### **8.**删除换行**Does an MRI Refer to an Ultrasound?**\n\n【71】Venous ultrasonography is more precise in finding blood clots in the veins of the thigh down to the knee using sound waves. Ionizing radiation is not used in ultrasound. In contrast, venography uses contrast material or dye injected into the vein, followed by radiation to assess blood flow within the vein.\n\n【72】#### **9.**删除换行**How Is Portal Venography Done?**\n\n【73】From a peripheral vein, an open-end opaque catheter is introduced across the right atrium and lodged into a hepatic vein.  Pressure is recorded, and the catheter is removed from the wedge by about 1 cm,  to evaluate alteration or decrease in pressure. Then, 20 ccs of sodium diatrizoate are injected forcefully by hand, and cyclic imaging is done. A No. 10 Cournand or No. 280 polyethylene catheter and 40 to 50 cc of contrast material have been used on humans.\n\n【74】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is Portal Venography?**\n\n【75】The invasive and non-invasive techniques to evaluate the portal venous system reveals important details on the portal venous system carrying capillary blood from the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen to the liver. physiology, and collateral circulation. The injection is administered directly into the portal vein during surgery or the splenic pulp (the red pulp of the spleen is composed of connective tissue), which requires direct operative exposure. The second method cannot be used to visualize the intrahepatic portal system in patients who have undergone splenectomy or in the presence of a spleen or portal vein blockage, high portal pressure, or flow reversal.\n\n【76】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is Iliac Venography?**\n\n【77】A minimally invasive treatment is used to examine and evaluate the condition of the veins in the legs using X-ray equipment and a contrast dye. It is widely used in diagnosing deep vein thrombosis, congenital vein abnormalities, and blood clots and determining the etiology of pain and swelling in the leg.\n\n【78】#### **12.**删除换行**A Venous Doppler Procedure: What Is It?**\n\n【79】A diagnostic procedure is performed to examine the blood flow of the major veins in the legs, rarely in the arms, using ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves that echo off the body). This examination reveals any blood clot or thrombus formation related to venous obstruction.\n\n【80】#### **13.**删除换行**When MRV Is Indicated?**\n\n【81】The MRV evaluates blood flow and finds harmful anomalies like blood clots. It is used to detect deep thrombosis in the veins, abnormal brain blood flow, and the vein's structural abnormalities. Additionally, an MRV can aid in evaluating conditions such as intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus (abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles or deep within the brain) with normal pressure that might result in neurological symptoms (NPH).\n\n【82】#### **14.**删除换行**Does a Fluoroscopy Refer to a Venogram?**\n\n【83】Fluoroscopy converts x-rays into video images. The vein pictures were captured on videotape with online fluoroscopic monitoring. Then the images were enhanced using an image processor to produce satisfactory venograms, which aid in the definite diagnosis of blood flow abnormality of the vein.\n\n【84】#### **15.**删除换行**What Is the Adverse Effect of a Venogram?**\n\n【85】Venogram is the safest procedure, although some adverse effects of venograms involve   \n - Pain or discomfort.  \n - Rashes, itching, redness, pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting in reaction to the x-ray dye.  \n - Infection at the target site where the needle got injected.  \n - Vein damage after insertion of a needle.  \n - Pulmonary embolism.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   The role of emergency venography in the diagnosis and management of deep venous thrombosis.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2448265/\n*   Venogram  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007283.htm\n*   Venography  \n    https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/venography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The condition is life-threatening as it interferes with the baby's normal intestinal function and feeding. Intestinal atresia usually affects the intestines but can cause obstruction or atresia in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the symptoms, occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment of jejunoileal atresia mainly depend upon the infected site. The condition is prevalent in females and males but can occur only in one in every 1500 live births.\n\n【2】What Are the Symptoms of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The symptoms are jejunoileal atresia are as follows:\n\n【4】*   Abdominal swelling.\n\n【5】*   Difficulty in feeding.\n\n【6】*   Reduced bowel movement.\n\n【7】*   Vomiting bile fluid.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The different types of jejunoileal atresia are as follows:\n\n【10】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type I** - In this type of atresia, a web-like membrane is formed inside the intestine when the baby is developing in the uterus. The condition causes blockage in the intestine by the membrane formation, but the intestines' length remains unaffected.\n\n【11】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type II** - In this case, the length of the intestine is regular. Still, the dilated section develops a blind end connected to the smaller segment of the intestine via scar tissue.\n\n【12】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type III** - In this type, a flaw or defect in the intestinal blood supply separates the two bling ends. The condition significantly reduces the length of the small intestine, which further causes short-gut syndrome or long-term nutritional deficiencies.\n\n【13】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type IV** - In this type, the intestine length is significantly reduced due to multiple blockages in the intestinal sections.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Jejunooileal atresia occurs due to the following reasons:\n\n【16】*   An inherited genetic defect such as familial multiple intestinal atresias.\n\n【17】*   Vascular accidents cause the insufficient blood supply to the developing fetus’s intestine. This defect causes loss of functionality due to ischemia in the different segments of the small intestine.\n\n【18】*   Some researchers have also linked cocaine and cigarette smoking during pregnancy to jejunoileal atresia.\n\n【19】How Is Jejunoileal Atresia Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Jejunoileal Artesia is diagnosed in the following ways:\n\n【21】**1\\. Prenatal Diagnosis** - This type of diagnosis is done mainly during the third trimester of the pregnancy with the help of prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal diagnosis of a mother is performed due to the high risk of developing congenital disabilities in newborns with intestinal atresia to eliminate the following conditions:\n\n【22】*   Esophageal atresia.\n\n【23】*   Congenital heart diseases.\n\n【24】*   Down syndrome.\n\n【25】*   Annular pancreas (pancreas does not form properly due to a congenital disability).\n\n【26】*   Genitourinary malformations.\n\n【27】*   Bowel rotational abnormalities.\n\n【28】**2\\. Postnatal Diagnosis** - This is the diagnosis done after the birth of a baby. Newborns with jejunoileal atresia vomit frequently; therefore, some specific diagnostic procedures rule out congenital disabilities. These include:\n\n【29】*   **Lower Gastrointestinal (GI) X-Ray** - It helps to investigate the small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In the procedure, a radio-opaque contrast media is administered through the rectum to form a thin lining around the intestine. This helps in the clear view of the internal body structures with minute details of obstruction and strictures.\n\n【30】*   **Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) X-Ray** - The diagnosis helps to investigate the duodenum and pylorus by using barium as a contrast medium, which is given through the mouth for a clear view of the structures inside the body.\n\n【31】*   **Abdominal X-Ray** - This helps to take images of the internal structure of the newborn’s abdomen for diagnosis.\n\n【32】*   **Echocardiogram (ECG)** - It helps to detect any congenital heart defects in the newborn. In babies, jejunoileal or intestinal atresia conditions can be fatal, leading to complications such as congenital heart defects.\n\n【33】*   **Abdominal Ultrasound** - This non-invasion diagnostic procedure uses sound waves to view the functionality of the internal organs. Abdominal ultrasound or USG detects the abnormalities in the abdomen related to jejunoileal atresia symptoms.\n\n【34】How Is Jejunoileal Atresia Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】Jejunoileal atresia does not have any prenatal treatment options available. The doctor can treat the condition in newborns only with surgical intervention after birth. The surgery depends upon the location and nature of the jejunoileal atresia or blockage. Thus, the treatment is carried out in the following ways:\n\n【36】**1\\. Stabilization of the Baby**\n\n【37】*   A nasogastric tube is inserted into the stomach through the nose to empty the accumulated gases and stomach contents under negative pressure to prevent aspiration and vomiting in the baby.\n\n【38】*   Intravenous nutritional supply is provided to the newborn.\n\n【39】*   Also, some blood tests and X-ray procedures are done during this pre-surgical phase of the treatment procedure.\n\n【40】**2\\. Surgery**\n\n【41】*   The surgery is mainly laparoscopic or open surgery. In a laparoscopic procedure, multiple small incisions are given along the intestine to insert instruments and a camera. While in open surgery, a single large incision is made in the abdomen, and the affected part of the intestine is removed. Then, the ends are sutured again to maintain continuity.\n\n【42】*   The surgery is performed under general anesthesia to avoid discomfort or pain for the baby.\n\n【43】*   Sometimes, a doctor creates an opening or a stoma in the abdomen if the intestines take longer to heal. The stoma helps to collect the feces temporarily in the colostomy bag until it passes through the anus.\n\n【44】**3\\. Post-Surgical Care** - The baby’s stay can be up to one to three weeks post-surgery to monitor the vitals continuously. Also, the nutritional supply is continued with a nasogastric tube unless the baby starts taking food through the oral cavity or mouth. Post-surgical follow-ups are scheduled after discharge to assess a baby's general well-being and growth parameters.\n\n【45】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Jejunoileal Atresia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】*   Internal hernia.\n\n【47】*   Colonic atresia.\n\n【48】*   Meconium ileus.\n\n【49】*   Congenital small left colon syndrome.\n\n【50】*   Intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus.\n\n【51】*   Hirschsprung disease.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications Associated With Jejunoileal Atresia?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Postoperative sepsis can occur in 5 % to 8 % of cases.\n\n【54】*   An anatomic leak occurs in 5 % to 7 % of cases.\n\n【55】*   Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs due to feeding abnormalities, prolonged hospital stays, and increased infection rates.\n\n【56】*   Adhesive bowel syndrome.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】Jejunoileal atresia is a rare condition of intestinal obstruction in newborns, which can be fatal in some cases if not detected initially. However, advanced surgical techniques, nutritional support, pediatric anesthesia, intensive care units, and post-operative care for neonates have increased the survival rates in newborns with intestinal atresia.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ileal Atresia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557400/\n*   Jejunoileal Atresia: Factors Affecting the Outcome and Long-term Sequelae  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761993/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In addition, its use in cosmetology is trending due to technological advancements. However, like any therapy with pros and cons, laser therapy also showcases specific effects on the body due to excessive exposure to high-energy lasers.\n\n【2】How Do Lasers Work?\n-------------------\n\n【3】The lasers work on the skin through a process called photothermolysis. The laser, with a particular wavelength depending on the skin color being treated, is exposed to the skin, which causes the lysis of skin cells in the area by generating heat. Various lasers are used for different skin conditions to choose the correct wavelength of the laser beam for the procedure.\n\n【4】What Are the Uses of Lasers in Cosmetology?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are several types of lasers used for various applications, such as,\n\n【6】*   To treat fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n【7】*   Skin tightening.\n\n【8】*   To treat pigmented lesions.\n\n【9】*   To treat vascular lesions.\n\n【10】*   To treat precancerous lesions.\n\n【11】*   Tattoo removal.\n\n【12】*   Hair removal.\n\n【13】*   To treat acne and acne scars.\n\n【14】How Do Lasers Damage the Skin?\n------------------------------\n\n【15】The skin has a greater surface area than the eye, and the chance of laser exposure is more. This is because the most penetrating wavelength of light is 700 to 1200 nm. Therefore, during the application, a feeling of heat is experienced in the area, preventing injury. However, skin damage is not considered more significant as the effects are temporary. But it is not the same in the case of high-powered lasers.\n\n【16】**Epidermal Effects:**\n\n【17】*   The micro-injuries caused during laser tattoo removal and laser resurfacing should be taken proper care of, if not would lead to scarring, infection, and erythema.\n\n【18】*   Following laser therapy using carbon dioxide and erbium lasers for facial rejuvenation would lead to complications such as pain, infections, erythema, scarring, delayed healing, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, contact dermatitis, and vascular proliferation.\n\n【19】*   Pulsed dye laser therapy would lead to adverse effects such as pain, crusting, purpura, dermatitis, scarring, and blisters.\n\n【20】**Effects on Cell Function:** The organelle that shows the early effects of laser radiation is the mitochondria. Changes in the mitochondria would lead to a series of events in the cells leading to the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and enzyme activation. In addition, it causes increased proliferation of cells, migration of cells, and production of growth factors and inflammatory mediators. These events would eventually lead to the dysregulation of cell functions. Furthermore, it also alters cellular metabolism.\n\n【21】**Thermal Effects:**\n\n【22】*   A high-energy laser beam exposed for an extended time would lead to thermal burns.\n\n【23】*   Carbon dioxide and infrared lasers most commonly result in thermal burns as they can penetrate the skin deeper.\n\n【24】*   The degree of burns is of three types, the first degree shows reddening of the skin, the second degree shows blistering, and the third-degree shows charring of the skin.\n\n【25】*   Thermal burns are commonly encountered in photosensitive individuals or under medications that induce photosensitivity.\n\n【26】*   Thermal damage caused by high-powered lasers can lead to necrosis of the site by the denaturation of protein and collagen.\n\n【27】What Are the Effects of Exposure to High-Energy Lasers?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The complications of laser radiation can be short-term, medium-term, and long-term.\n\n【29】**Short-Term Complications**\n\n【30】*   **Erythema:** Redness at the site may appear immediately after the procedure, which resolves in an hour or a day. But in the case of non-ablative and ablative skin resurfacing, the redness may persist for a week or so. Individuals with sensitive skin are more prone to redness of the skin.\n\n【31】*   **Edema:** Similar to erythema, swelling takes a long time to resolve after a skin resurfacing procedure. Localized edema is noticed in treating areas above the eyebrow and below the eyes. The edematous area might worsen after two days of the procedure. Edema is often seen after full-face treatments with pulsed-dye lasers.\n\n【32】*   **Infection:** Skin infections after a skin laser treatment are common. So most dermatologists would recommend an oral antibiotic after the treatment. Susceptibility to infection is the main reason for avoiding laser treatment in immunosuppressed individuals. In addition, there are chances of recurrence of herpes simplex infection if the individual undergoing laser treatment has a recent history of herpes infection.\n\n【33】**Medium-Term Complications**\n\n【34】*   **Hyperpigmentation:** Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is the most common immediate complication after laser exposure. It is more common in dark-skinned individuals. The hyperpigmented areas can be treated using bleaching creams and sunscreens. But later, the pigmented areas will recede completely or might leave a line of demarcation.\n\n【35】*   **Hypopigmentation:** The appearance of hypopigmented areas is less common after laser treatment. It can be due to severe injury to melanocytes. The standard procedures leading to hypopigmentation are carbon dioxide resurfacing, dermabrasion, and chemical peels. In some cases, it can resolve entirely, but in some, it can be permanent.\n\n【36】*   **Burns:** During an ablative laser resurfacing procedure, burns are common. The best way to treat it is the application of ice on the area, steroids, and emollient application.\n\n【37】**Long-Term Complications**\n\n【38】*   **Indentation:** Textural abnormalities after laser application can sometimes resolve but, in some cases, can form deep indentations. They most commonly occur in areas around the eyes and forehead. Sometimes, an indentation may be more profound than minimally invasive methods cannot treat.\n\n【39】*   **Scarring:** The ablation of skin during the procedure can lead to the proliferation of stem cells to compensate for the lost keratinocytes, which is the main reason for scarring. If the scars are small, you can hide them with makeup. However, if the scars are large, then a series of pulsed-dye lasers will be required to diminish the scar.\n\n【40】*   **Ocular Damage:** Laser exposure can lead to ocular injuries damaging the cornea, retina, and vitreous humor. It can be minimized by proper protection before starting the procedure.\n\n【41】Who Is Not Indicated for the Use of Lasers in Cosmetology?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The use of lasers for cosmetology procedures is not indicated if there are any of the following conditions.\n\n【43】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【44】*   Lactation.\n\n【45】*   Skin lesions.\n\n【46】*   Diabetes Mellitus.\n\n【47】*   Hypertension.\n\n【48】*   Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【49】*   Chronic renal failure.\n\n【50】*   Low blood clotting.\n\n【51】*   Mental illness.\n\n【52】*   Under any antibiotics.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】To avoid disappointment in the individual after laser therapy due to its complications, the individual should be explained the benefits, risks, and difficulties that might result from treatment. And before opting for the treatment, it is better to measure the balance between the benefits and side effects of the procedure to avoid unnecessary complications.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Evaluation of Laser Effects on the Human Body After Laser Therapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7008747/\n*   Lasers and optical radiation  \n    https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241540834\n*   Complications of lasers and light treatments  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22515672/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "9b68fef2-d18a-4a2a-89d4-edf72e727068", "title": "Lansoprazole - The Long-Term and Well Tolerated Therapy for GERD", "text": "【0】Lansoprazole - The Long-Term and Well Tolerated Therapy for GERD\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces the amount of acid produced by the stomach. The drug is used to treat ulcers in the stomach lining or intestine. The drug is used alone or may be combined with other medicines to treat heartburn caused due to backflow of acid from the stomach. It helps to prevent ulcer formation in adults who have already had ulcers or have had an injury of the esophagus and also decreases the risk of developing ulcers in people taking anti-inflammatory drugs. Lansoprazole is available only on a doctor’s prescription and is a delayed-release medication to prevent its breakdown by stomach acid and release in the intestine. The proton pump inhibitor is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat active ulcers (gastric and duodenal). It also treats erosive reflux esophagitis and gastroesophageal disease.\n\n【2】How Does Lansoprazole Work?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Lansoprazole is a prodrug, meaning that these proton pump inhibitors require gastric acid secretion to be converted to sulfenamide or sulfenic acid. Once activated, it reacts with cysteine residues on the parietal H+ and K+ ATPase enzymes. This ability to bind covalently to their targets provides a prolonged inhibition of acid secretion. Therefore, the drug is taken before a meal to control daytime gastric acidity.\n\n【4】**Uses:**\n\n【5】Lansoprazole is indicated for the following:\n\n【6】*   The proton pump inhibitor is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for short-term treatment of active gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers (soreness that occurs inside the stomach lining or the first part of the small intestine).\n\n【7】*   The drug relieves symptoms of heartburn (burning in the center of the chest that may involve the neck and throat and worsens on lying down) and indigestion.\n\n【8】*   It is used to treat symptoms of erosive reflux esophagitis (inflammation of the esophageal mucosa) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a state in which the acid flows back from the stomach causing heartburn (burning feeling in the chest) and may injury the esophagus in adults and children above one year of age.\n\n【9】*   The proton pump inhibitor helps to treat ulcers on the lining of the stomach and intestine and decreases ulcer formation in people taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【10】*   Lansoprazole is prescribed to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a digestive disorder or condition that causes the stomach to produce too much gastric acid resulting in tumor growth in the pancreas or the upper part of the small intestine).\n\n【11】*   Lansoprazole effectively eradicates H. pylori infection when combined with other medications, such as Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin, in triple therapy or with Amoxicillin alone in dual therapy.\n\n【12】**Limitations:**\n\n【13】*   Long-term therapy with Lansoprazole can increase the risk of developing stomach cancer.\n\n【14】*   Taking Lansoprazole for more than one year can increase the chances of specific side effects, such as bone fractures, especially in people with osteoporosis and vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【15】**Dosage Restrictions:**\n\n【16】1. **Route of Administration -** Oral.\n\n【17】2. **Dosage Strengths -**\n\n【18】*   Delayed-release capsules.\n\n【19】*   15 milligrams.\n\n【20】*   30 milligrams.\n\n【21】*   Oral-disintegrating tablets.\n\n【22】*   15 milligrams.\n\n【23】*   30 milligrams.\n\n【24】*   Oral suspension.\n\n【25】*   3 millimole / milliliter.\n\n【26】3\\. **Dosage Forms -**\n\n【27】*   Fifteen milligrams of Lansoprazole capsules are opaque, hard gelatin, pink and green colored with “15” imprinted.\n\n【28】*   Thirty milligrams Lansoprazole capsules are opaque hard gelatin, pink and black colored with “30” imprinted.\n\n【29】*   Fifteen milligrams of Lansoprazole tablets are uncoated, orange to dark brown colored with a “15” imprint.\n\n【30】*   Thirty milligrams Lansoprazole tablets are uncoated, orange to dark brown colored with “30” imprinted.\n\n【31】The recommended dose is 30 milligrams, taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\n\n【32】**Special Considerations**\n\n【33】*   **Pregnancy -** Lansoprazole should be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, as it may be associated with congenital disabilities.\n\n【34】*   **Lactation -** There are no adequate studies to determine infant risk while using Lansoprazole during breastfeeding.\n\n【35】*   **Pediatric Patients -** Lansoprazole is not recommended for children younger than one year of age. The drug may be given to toddlers only if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n【36】*   **Geriatric Patients -** Long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole is related to an increased risk of hip, spine, or wrist fractures in adults over 65.\n\n【37】*   **Renal Impairment -** People with renal impairment are more likely to develop kidney damage or failure when given Lansoprazole in the long term.\n\n【38】*   **Hepatic Impairment -** The use of Lansoprazole in patients with hepatic impairment is associated with high mortality and increased risk of hepatic decompensation that may require hospitalization. It is recommended to reduce the dose by 50% when given to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.\n\n【39】**Warnings and Contraindications:**\n\n【40】**Contraindications**\n\n【41】Lansoprazole is contraindicated in the following cases:\n\n【42】*   **Pregnancy -** Recent studies suggest that using Lansoprazole in pregnancy can increase the risk of congenital disabilities, and the therapy should be stopped if contemplating pregnancy.\n\n【43】*   **Hypersensitivity -** Lansoprazole is contraindicated in people who have known allergic reactions to the drug or its constituents. It is likely to exacerbate the condition.\n\n【44】*   **Colitis -** Rarely have patients reported colitis (colon inflammation) in patients taking this drug. Hence, the drug must be discontinued for severe or persistent diarrhea symptoms.\n\n【45】**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n【46】*   **Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) -** Studies suggest that using proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole may be linked with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. It is usually observed in hospitalized patients. Close monitoring is recommended in patients with diarrhea and those taking antibacterial therapy.\n\n【47】*   **Liver Disease -** The liver primarily metabolizes Lansoprazole. Adjustment in the dose must be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n【48】*   **Bone Fractures -** Observational studies have shown that long-term use of Lansoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related hip, spine, or wrist fractures. These patients should be given low doses of Lansoprazole and treated for a short duration.\n\n【49】*   **Hypomagnesemia -** Treatment with proton pump inhibitors for more than three months can cause symptomatic and asymptomatic hypomagnesemia (an electrolyte disturbance caused when serum magnesium levels are lower than 1.46 mg/dl in the blood). Therefore, these patients should be monitored for severe events such as tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias.\n\n【50】*   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency -** Long-term treatment with Lansoprazole may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin and vitamin B 12 deficiency. Taking large amounts of Proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. This should be considered if clinical symptoms are observed.\n\n【51】For Patients\n------------\n\n【52】What Is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Gastroesophageal reflux is a severe and long-lasting condition in which the stomach contents move up into the esophagus (a muscular tube that carries food and liquid from the throat to the stomach). It is associated with symptoms such as\n\n【54】*   Chest pain, usually in the middle of the chest and radiating to the back.\n\n【55】*   Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia).\n\n【56】*   Coughing.\n\n【57】*   Sore throat.\n\n【58】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【59】Long-lasting and untreated GERD can permanently damage the esophagus and Barrett’s esophagus (a condition in which the lower portion of the esophagus is damaged due to overexposure to stomach acid).\n\n【60】Why Is Lansoprazole Prescribed for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that helps lower the stomach's amount of acid. Proton pumps are enzymes found in the stomach lining and help make acid to digest food. Proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole prevent the proton pumps from working properly and reduce acid production. The drug is effective within two to three days and may take up to four weeks to work properly.\n\n【62】**Facts One Should Know About Lansoprazole:**\n\n【63】*   Lansoprazole is to be given once, preferably in the morning, and may be taken twice a day in cases of severe illness.\n\n【64】*   The drug is available both over-the-counter and with a doctor’s prescription.\n\n【65】*   Lansoprazole works best at least 30 minutes before a meal or snack.\n\n【66】*   Long-term therapy with Lansoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures (osteoporosis occurs when the new bone is not created after the loss of old bone).\n\n【67】*   Lansoprazole may increase the risk of severe diarrhea associated with symptoms such as stomach pain, fever, and watery diarrhea.\n\n【68】How Should One Take Lansoprazole?\n---------------------------------\n\n【69】*   Lansoprazole is available as a tablet and capsule to be taken by mouth.\n\n【70】*   It is taken once a day, usually in the morning, and works best when taken before meals.\n\n【71】*   The drug should be taken at the same time each day.\n\n【72】*   Lansoprazole is usually started on a low dose of 15 milligrams and is gradually increased for severe cases.\n\n【73】*   Lansoprazole may be taken twice daily for 14 days when combined with other medications to eliminate Helicobacter pylori.\n\n【74】*   It may take more than two weeks to show the full benefits of the drug.\n\n【75】*   Only stop the medicine suddenly after talking to the doctor.\n\n【76】*   Do not break or chew the orally disintegrating tablets. Instead, the capsule is swallowed with a glass of water or milk.\n\n【77】What Should the Patient Discuss With His Doctor Before Beginning Lansoprazole Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【78】*   **Allergies** \\- Inform the physician if one has ever had an allergic reaction to Lansoprazole or other ingredients in the formulation. Symptoms may include rash, face swelling, throat tightness, or troubled breathing.\n\n【79】*   **Medical History -** The patient must always inform the treating doctor of his illnesses, such as diabetes, bronchospastic diseases, myocardial infarction, and impaired renal or hepatic function.\n\n【80】*   **Drug History -** Always give the treating doctor a complete list of the prescription and non-prescription medications that one may be taking, including any herbal supplements, nutritional supplements, and vitamins.\n\n【81】*   **Pregnancy -** If one is pregnant or planning to get pregnant any time soon, it is essential to inform the doctor. The use of Lansoprazole may harm the fetus and the mother. Using Lansoprazole during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of developing congenital disabilities if one gets pregnant while on Lansoprazole; inform the doctor as soon as one finds out.\n\n【82】*   **Lactation -** The doctor must know if one is breastfeeding. The possibility of Lansoprazole passing into the breastmilk is unknown. However, it is likely to pass in small amounts to the baby.\n\n【83】*   **Older Adults -** Prolonged use and high doses may increase the risk of bone fractures. Therefore, the doctor may prescribe low doses of Lansoprazole for treatment and for a short time.\n\n【84】**Safety of Lansoprazole:**\n\n【85】*   Long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related hip, wrist, or spine fractures.\n\n【86】*   Prolonged use may cause hypomagnesemia (an electrolyte disturbance caused due to low levels of serum magnesium in the blood).\n\n【87】**Effectiveness of Lansoprazole:**\n\n【88】*   There is no significant difference in the clinical effectiveness of other proton pump inhibitors, such as Omeprazole or Pantoprazole, in relieving heartburn symptoms and regurgitation.\n\n【89】*   The drug starts to work within two to three days and may take up to four weeks to completely control the acid symptoms.\n\n【90】**Side Effects Patient Can Expect With Lansoprazole:**\n\n【91】The common side effects that occur with the use of Lansoprazole are as follows:\n\n【92】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【93】*   Constipation.\n\n【94】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【95】*   Headache.\n\n【96】*   Feeling sick.\n\n【97】*   Itchy skin rashes.\n\n【98】*   Dry mouth or throat.\n\n【99】*   Nausea.\n\n【100】The severe side effects may include,\n\n【101】*   Chest pain.\n\n【102】*   Fast or irregular heart rate.\n\n【103】*   Watery or bloody diarrhea.\n\n【104】*   Jerky muscle movements.\n\n【105】*   Confusion.\n\n【106】*   Feeling jittery.\n\n【107】*   Seizures.\n\n【108】Can One Stop Taking Lansoprazole Without the Doctor's Consent?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【109】*   Patients should never stop taking Lansoprazole without first talking to their doctor. Consult the physician or visit the emergency room if one experiences any side effects that require immediate attention.\n\n【110】*   Do not skip the dose or stop taking Lansoprazole suddenly. This can worsen the condition or make the symptoms return. Instead, the doctor will instruct on how to taper the dose gradually.\n\n【111】*   Stopping proton pump inhibitors can cause rebound acid hypersecretion and lead to the appearance of symptoms such as indigestion, heartburn, or regurgitation (a condition when digestive fluids and undigested food rise from the esophagus into the mouth).\n\n【112】**Dietary Restrictions to Consider When Taking Lansoprazole:**\n\n【113】The patient may continue to follow the regular diet unless the doctor asks to change it. No dietary restrictions are needed. The drug is taken 30 minutes before having meals. This helps the body to absorb the drug and makes the drug more effective.\n\n【114】*   **Caffeine-Containing Foods -** Avoid taking caffeine-containing food items and beverages such as tea, coffee, and chocolates while taking Lansoprazole. Caffeine can decrease the effectiveness of the drug.\n\n【115】*   **Fatty and Spicy Foods -** Try to eat small meals at once. Eat more often and avoid eating fatty and spicy foods.\n\n【116】*   **Acidic Foods -** Foods and drinks such as apples, lemons, grapefruit, oranges, tomatoes, cola, and energy drinks can worsen the symptoms of GERD and heartburn and should be avoided.\n\n【117】**Storage of Lansoprazole:**\n\n【118】*   Store Lansoprazole at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light.\n\n【119】*   Lansoprazole tablets should be stored in the original packaging or container with a tightly closed lid.\n\n【120】*   Keep this drug far from the reach of children and pets.\n\n【121】**Disposal of Lansoprazole:**\n\n【122】*   Lansoprazole should not be disposed of by flushing or throwing it out with regular garbage.\n\n【123】*   One may dispose of Lansoprazole through the local medicine take-back program, which one can access or learn more about through the local pharmacist.\n\n【124】*   Ask the local pharmacist about other drug disposal options if the person cannot access a medicine take-back program.\n\n【125】**Overdose:**\n\n【126】*   In one of the reported cases, an individual had consumed almost 600 mg of Lansoprazole for more than a year, although there were no specific side effects.\n\n【127】*   If a person overdoses, contact a doctor immediately and do not take another tablet until the doctor tells you what to do.\n\n【128】*   Contact the doctor immediately if a person experiences severe abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.\n\n【129】*   The drug is not usually eliminated with hemodialysis. So, in case of emergency, gastric emptying is performed. It is a procedure to induce vomiting in a patient, remove all the particles in the stomach and cleanse it thoroughly. In rare cases, charcoal may be administered if recommended.\n\n【130】*   Overdosing may cause a rare but cutaneous severe reaction called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TENS), characterized by blistering and peeling of the skin.\n\n【131】For Doctor\n----------\n\n【132】**Indications:**\n\n【133】Lansoprazole is indicated for the following purposes:\n\n【134】*   It is indicated for short-term treatment for healing and symptom relief of active duodenal ulcers and active benign gastric ulcers.\n\n【135】*   It is used for short-term treatment to heal all grades of erosive esophagitis and helps maintain healing.\n\n【136】*   The drug may be prescribed for treating pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n\n【137】*   Lansoprazole helps to reduce the risk of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) associated with gastric ulcers in patients with documented gastric ulcers. It is also used to heal NSAID-associated ulcers.\n\n【138】**Pharmacology of Lansoprazole:**\n\n【139】**Description:**\n\n【140】*   Lansoprazole is a white to brownish-white odorless crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in dimethylformamide, soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and insoluble in water.\n\n【141】*   It is stable when exposed to light for up to two months.\n\n【142】*   Lansoprazole is a member of benzimidazole with selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor activity.\n\n【143】**Components:**\n\n【144】1\\. Active Ingredients\n\n【145】*   Lansoprazole.\n\n【146】2\\. Inactive Ingredients\n\n【147】*   Sugar sphere.\n\n【148】*   Sucrose.\n\n【149】*   Methacrylic acid copolymer.\n\n【150】*   Hydroxypropyl cellulose.\n\n【151】*   Starch.\n\n【152】*   Magnesium carbonate.\n\n【153】*   Talc.\n\n【154】*   Polyethylene glycol.\n\n【155】*   Titanium dioxide.\n\n【156】*   Polysorbate 80.\n\n【157】*   Colloidal silicon dioxide.\n\n【158】**Clinical Pharmacology:**\n\n【159】**Mechanism of Action**\n\n【160】Lansoprazole is an antisecretory compound called substituted benzimidazoles. These compounds suppress gastric secretion by specific inhibition of the H+ and K+ ATPase enzymes at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Lansoprazole blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-dependent and inhibits the stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus.\n\n【161】**Pharmacodynamics**\n\n【162】After oral administration, Lansoprazole significantly decreases the basal acid output and increases the mean gastric pH.\n\n【163】**Initial Dose -** Increased gastric pH is seen within one to two hours of 30 mg of Lansoprazole and two to three hours with 15 mg of Lansoprazole.\n\n【164】**Multiple Dose -** Increased gastric pH was seen within the first hour after a dose of 30 mg Lansoprazole and within one to two hours after a dose of 15 mg Lansoprazole.\n\n【165】**Pharmacokinetics**\n\n【166】*   **Mean Cmax-** 1.7 hours after oral dosing and absolute bioavailability are over 80 %.\n\n【167】*   **Median Tmax-** The presence of food diminishes by 50 % to 70 %.\n\n【168】\\[Cmax- Maximum concentration achieved by a drug in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or target organ after administration of a dose\\]\n\n【169】\\[Tmax- Time taken for a drug to reach maximum concentration after administration of a dose\\]\n\n【170】**Pharmacokinetic Changes** \\- The dose is to be adjusted to individual requirements due to variations in the rate of metabolism.\n\n【171】A. **Distribution**\n\n【172】*   Steady-state Plasma Levels - 0.05 to 5.0 microgram per milliliter.\n\n【173】*   Time to Approach Steady-state Levels - 1.7 hours.\n\n【174】*   Binding to Plasma Proteins- 97 %.\n\n【175】**B. Metabolism**\n\n【176】The liver mainly metabolizes Lansoprazole with enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.\n\n【177】*   **Metabolic Processes-** 5-Hydroxylated sulfinyl and sulfone derivatives of Lansoprazole.\n\n【178】*   **Active Metabolites -** Cyclic sulfenamide and disulfide metabolites.\n\n【179】*   **Inactive Metabolites -** Sulphide and hydroxylated sulphone\n\n【180】**C. Elimination**\n\n【181】**After Oral Administration -**\n\n【182】*   30% of the dose is excreted in the urine.\n\n【183】*   70% is excreted in the feces.\n\n【184】*   The acid inhibitory effect lasts - 24 hours.\n\n【185】*   Time is taken to return to normal levels - Two weeks.\n\n【186】*   Mean Elimination Half-Life- Less than two hours.\n\n【187】**Special Considerations:**\n\n【188】*   **Hepatic Impairment-** Lansoprazole elimination half-life is significantly prolonged in patients with hepatic disease and may show abnormal liver function tests with Lansoprazole use. Therefore, these patients may require a dose reduction of the proton pump inhibitor.\n\n【189】*   **Bone Fractures -** Always use proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole cautiously in patients with a risk of bone fractures or osteoporosis. Daily high doses of Lansoprazole increased the fracture risk in patients 50 years of age and older. Therefore, close monitoring of their bone status and adequate vitamin D and calcium supplementation must be ensured.\n\n【190】*   **Hypokalemia -and Hypocalcemia -** Caution must be observed while using Lansoprazole in patients with pre-existing risk of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels) and hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels). Prolonged therapy with Lansoprazole requires monitoring of calcium and potassium levels and should be discontinued if symptoms arise.\n\n【191】*   **Infants -** The safety and efficacy of Lansoprazole have not been established in neonates or infants and should be administered cautiously.\n\n【192】**Drug Interactions:**\n\n【193】*   **Erlotinib -** Lansoprazole decreases levels of Erlotinib by altering its solubility and reducing its bioavailability. Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors such as Lansoprazole with Erlotinib should be avoided.\n\n【194】*   **Mavacameten -** Lansoprazole with Mavacantem increases the drug's effect by affecting the hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. The CYP2C19 inhibitors increase systemic exposure to Mavantem. As a result, it may cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.\n\n【195】*   **Nelfinavir -** Lansoprazole with Nelfinavir is contraindicated as their combination may lead to loss of virologic response of Nelfinavir and develop resistance.\n\n【196】*   **Cabotegravir -** Concomitant use of Lansoprazole and Cabotegravir is contraindicated as it may lead to decreased absorption of the Cabotegravir (used in the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection) or resistance.\n\n【197】*   **Warfarin -** Combining Lansoprazole and Warfarin has been reported to show increased INR (International normalized ratio based on the prothrombin test). This can lead to abnormal bleeding.\n\n【198】*   **Tacrolimus -** Concomitant administration of Lansoprazole and Tacrolimus may increase whole blood levels, especially in transplant patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.\n\n【199】What Have Clinical Trials Shown Concerning Lansoprazole?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【200】**Aim of Trial 1:**\n\n【201】To study the safety and effectiveness of Lansoprazole in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia compared with Ranitidine therapy and with a placebo.\n\n【202】*   4 Two randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials of 901 patients with symptomatic reflux disease confirmed by endoscopy to be non-erosive.\n\n【203】*   15 mg to 30 mg Lansoprazole was given once a day; Ranitidine 150 mg was given twice a day; or placebo for eight weeks.\n\n【204】*   During the first four weeks - Significantly low percentages of night and day heartburn were seen with small amounts of antacid given for a few days, compared to patients treated with Ranitidine or a placebo.\n\n【205】*   No statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups.\n\n【206】**Results -** Lansoprazole therapy is more effective than standard dosages of Ranitidine or placebo in relieving the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\n【207】**Aim of Trial 2:**\n\n【208】To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lansoprazole in self-treating subjects with frequent nocturnal heartburn.\n\n【209】*   A total of 864 subjects with heartburn were randomized to double-blind treatment with Lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg or placebo each morning,\n\n【210】**End Point -** Percentages of night times without heartburn, percentage of 24-hour days without heartburn, and percentage of subjects without heartburn on day one were noted.\n\n【211】**Result -** Mean percentage of night times without heartburn was significantly greater with Lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg compared to placebo for both doses. In addition, the percentage of 24-hour days without heartburn and subjects without heartburn on day one were significantly more significant with Lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg compared to the placebo.\n\n【212】**Patient Counseling Information:**\n\n【213】**Administration Instructions**\n\n【214】*   Take Lansoprazole only as prescribed by the doctor.\n\n【215】*   Take the drug before food.\n\n【216】*   Swallow these tablets and do not crush, split, or chew them.\n\n【217】*   Do not stop taking Lansoprazole abruptly.\n\n【218】**Complications or Side Effects**\n\n【219】*   **Phenylketonuria -** Lansoprazole disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (an essential amino acid). Patients with phenylketonuria should be administered Lansoprazole cautiously as there may be build-up in the body.\n\n【220】*   **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus -** Treatment with Lansoprazole should be cautioned in patients who have had systemic lupus erythematosus in the past, as it may activate or exacerbate the condition.\n\n【221】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【222】无关删除-1:<u>*   NHS UK - Lansoprazole  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/lansoprazole/\n*   National Library of Education NIH - Lansoprazole  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548452/#:~:text\n*   NIH - Long-Term Efficacy of Lansoprazole in Preventing Relapse of Erosive Reflux Esophagitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702676/\n*   Pubmed Central - Lansoprazole  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3560577/\n*   Medicine net - Lansoprazole  \n    https://www.medicinenet.com/lansoprazole/article.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "edcb382d-9e7c-4cde-89b1-c5df172435de", "title": "Spastic Paraparesis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Spastic Paraparesis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Paraparesis is the partial inability to move the legs. Weakness of the hip and legs can also be seen in paraparesis. Paraplegia is different from paraparesis, and paraplegia usually refers to severe weakness and total inability to move legs. Spastic paraparesis is a group of disorders that has a common feature of weakness and stiffness of the muscles of the leg that is progressive.\n\n【2】What Is Spastic Paraparesis?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Spastic paraparesis is a group of rare neurologic disorders that cause gradual weakness accompanied by abnormal tightening of the leg muscles. Weakness of the muscles becomes worse over time. Spastic paraparesis can begin at any age and may affect both males and females equally. The hereditary form of spastic paraparesis was first described in 1883 by Strumpell, and later on, Lorrain added more details regarding the disorder. Hence spastic paraparesis is often known as Strumpell-Lorrain syndrome.\n\n【4】What Causes Spastic Paraparesis?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】The causes of spastic paraparesis are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis:**\n\n【7】The hereditary form of spastic paraparesis is caused due to abnormal genes and it may be passed on from parents to children. The faulty genes lead to the progressive damage of the spinal nerves which control movement and muscle tone of the lower body. Damage to these nerves results in gradual disability in leg movements. Even though most of the children with a family history of hereditary spastic paraparesis may be a carrier of the abnormal gene, all the children in the family do not develop this disease. In few cases, spastic paraparesis develop randomly due to genetic change without any family history of the disease.\n\n【8】*   **Tropical Spastic Paraparesis:**\n\n【9】Tropical spastic paraparesis is caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In tropical spastic paraparesis, the spinal cord is affected followed by immune system weakening that leads to muscle weakness and loss of sensation in the legs. The HTLV-1 virus can be transmitted from person to person through the following ways:\n\n【10】*   Unprotected sexual activity.\n\n【11】*   Breastfeeding.\n\n【12】*   Sharing infected needles among drug users.\n\n【13】*   Blood transfusions.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Spastic Paraparesis?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The symptoms of spastic paraparesis are as follows:\n\n【16】*   Gradual stiffening and weakening of the legs.\n\n【17】*   Leg cramps.\n\n【18】*   Difficulty in walking that leads to an increased risk of falling.\n\n【19】*   Fatigue.\n\n【20】*   Pain in the hands, feet, ankles, hip, and knee.\n\n【21】*   Loss of balance.\n\n【22】*   Difficulty in learning and remembering new things.\n\n【23】*   Pricking or burning sensation in the hands and feet.\n\n【24】*   Bowel and urinary dysfunction (experiencing the need to pee even when the bladder is not full).\n\n【25】*   Hearing or vision problems.\n\n【26】*   Absence of sensation in the feet.\n\n【27】*   Lack of coordination.\n\n【28】*   Ichthyosis (Scaly, dry, and thick skin over large areas of the body).\n\n【29】*   Seizures (uncontrolled sudden disturbances in the brain).\n\n【30】*   Back pain radiating to the legs.\n\n【31】*   Walking on the tip of the toes with the feet turned inwards.\n\n【32】How to Diagnose Spastic Paraparesis?\n------------------------------------\n\n【33】The methods used to diagnose spastic paraparesis are as follows:\n\n【34】*   **Medical History and Physical Examination:**\n\n【35】The doctor collects a detailed history of the patient regarding the symptoms like difficulty in walking and pain in the legs. In case of hereditary paraparesis, the doctor enquires about the family history to find out the presence of paraparesis among the family members. In the case of tropical spastic paraparesis, the doctor finds out the chances of exposure to HTLV-1 virus by asking the patient about sexual history and drug injections. The doctor also rules out the possibility of other diseases which cause similar symptoms.\n\n【36】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**\n\n【37】MRI is an imaging test that uses computer-generated radio waves and magnets to produce detailed images of the body's organs. MRI of the brain and spinal cord is useful in the diagnosis of spastic paraparesis as it helps to rule out the possibility of other disorders and also to find out the abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord. Specialized MRI techniques like diffusion tensor imaging help to detect nerve abnormalities in spastic paraparesis cases.\n\n【38】*   **Genetic Testing:**\n\n【39】Genetic testing is performed to find out the defective genes in patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis who have a family history of the disease. Genetic testing is often used to confirm the diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraparesis.\n\n【40】*   **Blood Tests and Lumbar Puncture:**\n\n【41】Blood tests and lumbar puncture (a test which is done by inserting a needle in the lower back region to obtain the cerebrospinal fluid present in the spinal cord) are useful in cases of tropical spastic paraparesis to find out the presence of HTLV-1 virus. Blood tests done to find out the number of cells present in the blood and serum electrolytes are useful to exclude the possibility of other disorders.\n\n【42】*   **Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies:**\n\n【43】Electromyography is used to measure the electrical activity of the muscle in response to nerve stimulation. Nerve conduction studies evaluate the speed of electrical signals that travel through the nerves, which makes the muscle react. Both these tests can be used to find out the disorders associated with muscle or nerve dysfunction and problems in signal transmission between nerves and muscles.\n\n【44】How to Treat Spastic Paraparesis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【45】The treatment measures of spastic paraparesis aim at relieving the symptoms experienced by the patients. The various methods used are as follows:\n\n【46】*   **Medications:**\n\n【47】Muscle-relaxing medications help in reducing the weakness and stiffness of the muscles, thereby improving the ability of the patient to walk. Medications to control bladder problems and reduce urinary urgency are given.\n\n【48】*   **Exercise:**\n\n【49】A regimen of regular physical exercise under the guidance of a physical therapist is recommended. The exercise programs often begin with low intensity and are formulated under the combined supervision of a neurologist and physical therapist. Exercise helps in maintaining cardiovascular fitness, reducing weakness and stiffness of the muscles, and improving the ability to walk thereby reducing the risk of falling.\n\n【50】*   **Occupational Therapy:**\n\n【51】Occupational therapy helps the patient to get adapted to the disability both mentally and physically. This therapy helps the patient to carry out the daily activities of life without any difficulties under the guidance of an occupational therapist.\n\n【52】*   **Orthotics:**\n\n【53】It is a custom-made shoe insert or ankle brace that is used in treating problems of the feet and ankle. In patients with spastic paraparesis, ankle-foot orthotics help to reduce the tendency of foot extension that causes toe dragging. Often ankle-foot orthotics are used in combination with medicines that reduce muscle stiffness.\n\n【54】**Conclusion:**\n\n【55】Spastic paraparesis is a serious condition that may become worse over time. Various studies regarding gene modification and gene transfer to treat spastic paraparesis are under research. Since these advanced treatment measures are under research, patients are often treated with the help of medications and a regular exercise routine. Hence early diagnosis and prompt treatment help the patient to get relief from the symptoms and lead a normal life.\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/hereditary-spastic-paraplegia/\n*   Management of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: A Systematic Review of the Literature  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349696/\n*   Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Overview  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1509/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3bb92037-e316-4476-a9d6-613c163e852c", "title": "Stress in a Broad Perspective - More Than Merely a Mental Illness!!", "text": "【0】Stress in a Broad Perspective - More Than Merely a Mental Illness!!\nWhat Do You Think Is Stress in Your Daily Life?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Stress is not just a mental illness. It is not merely a disease of your brain and does not always mean that you have a serious psychiatric disorder. It is a multifactorial disorder including general physical wellness, issues related to chronic diseases, and is very well researched and perfectly-being treated in internal medicine.\n\n【2】Many people feel stress as only a psychiatric illness, and because it is sometimes taken as a stigma if you go for a psychiatric evaluation, a huge number of patients remain undiagnosed and untreated for years. The new clinical approach introduced by modern science is to spread awareness amongst masses that stress has many aspects, and they should be encouraged to discuss the problems freely with their Primary Care Provider (PCP). He will screen the patient, and if needed, he may also refer the patient to an appropriate psychiatrist. But a major bulk of patients get counseling and proper treatment right by their PCP, and it also lessens the workload of mental illness hospitals and psychiatrists.\n\n【3】Most of us take stress as a part of our daily life and have become used to stress so much that we do not even know that we are sick. Chronic stress makes our inner self hollow by damaging our personality and soul. Stress has two forms:\n\n【4】**Healthy Stress:**\n\n【5】It is a positive and sparkling constituent needed to excel in life. If somebody has it, he is actually healthy. But the problem is when somebody loses this stress, it is the same as he has lost his self-respect and he is no more himself. To get this concept, I usually put an example to my patients:\n\n【6】Think of a student who has his final examination after one month, and he has no worries regarding that and is not preparing for that too. Now he is sick, actually. He should have 'healthy' examination stress enough to make him motivated to prepare for the examination.\n\n【7】**Unhealthy Stress:**\n\n【8】This is damaging, unnecessary, and devastating stress and makes us sick over time if not properly handled. This can be handled if it is diagnosed in the very beginning and the cause of stress is treated timely. Regular visits to your Primary Care Physician are necessary to keep things under control and get yourself screened for stress.\n\n【9】How Stressed Are You?\n---------------------\n\n【10】This is a very difficult question, and even a learned person cannot make up with a proper answer. I have devised a questionnaire for my patients, and they have to check the stresses they have in their life. When they take this filled-out questionnaire back to me, it makes the picture clear. Catharsis is the best way to take the fears out of our inner self and to diagnose how stressed we actually are. This questionnaire form below fulfills this purpose perfectly. You just have to read and mark against the one which applies to you right now. For your ease, I have put them into groups so that you may have a clear picture of how much stress you have from each mentioned category.\n\n【11】**Test Your Brain or Mental Wellness:**\n\n【12】*   Do you have problems with concentrating on important tasks of everyday life?\n\n【13】*   Do you have difficulty making life's important decisions easily without the help of others?\n\n【14】*   Do you think your life is of no worth?\n\n【15】*   Are you anxious mostly and have a flight of thoughts?\n\n【16】*   Are you a person who remains worried most of the time?\n\n【17】**Test Your Emotional Wellness:**\n\n【18】*   How is your mood most of the time? Do you lose temperament with just a simple ignition of something that happened around you, for example: Do you get irritable just with the simple mistake of someone at road traffic, no matter if it never was going to hurt you?\n\n【19】*   Can you relax whenever you have some time to do so?\n\n【20】*   Do you have control over your anger?\n\n【21】*   Do you think your life tasks have ended and there is nothing left to do anymore?\n\n【22】*   Do you feel you are lonely and/or do you like to remain lonely?\n\n【23】*   Have you felt depressed most of the time and almost never happy? Is there some worth of happiness in your life?\n\n【24】**Wellness and Your Behavior:**\n\n【25】*   Do you eat perfectly, not more or less?\n\n【26】*   How normal is your sleep, not more or less?\n\n【27】*   Do you feel happy while you are with others?\n\n【28】*   Are you willing and ready to take on the responsibilities of life?\n\n【29】*   Do you need to take the support of illicit drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes to relax?\n\n【30】*   How social are you?\n\n【31】**Physical Wellness of the Body:**\n\n【32】*   Do you have pains in most parts of the body?\n\n【33】*   Do you have chronic or acute diabetes, hypertension, thyroid, liver, or kidney disease?\n\n【34】*   Do you have gastrointestinal system issues like diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, stomach acidity, and heartburn?\n\n【35】*   Do you have asthma, COPD, or any other lung disorder?\n\n【36】*   Do you feel nauseated, dizzy, and have vertigo and loss of balance?\n\n【37】*   Do you have a loss of libido (sex drive)?\n\n【38】*   Do you have some issues with your vision?\n\n【39】*   Have you been diagnosed with migraines?\n\n【40】*   Do you get colds, flu, allergies, red and itchy eyes very easily?\n\n【41】*   Pain in the chest, irregular heartbeats, and/or can you feel your own heartbeats. Do you have a known cardiac issue?\n\n【42】What Are Stress-Related Disorders?\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】The following are stress-related disorders, they are,\n\n【44】1.  Acute stress reaction.\n\n【45】2.  Adjustment disorder.\n\n【46】3.  Post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n【47】**Acute Stress Disorder:**\n\n【48】Following a stressful event, such as a serious medical diagnosis or a major accident, some people develop a characteristic pattern of symptoms. These include,\n\n【49】1.  A sense of bewilderment.\n\n【50】2.  Anxiety.\n\n【51】3.  Anger.\n\n【52】4.  Depression.\n\n【53】5.  Altered activity.\n\n【54】6.  Withdrawal activity.\n\n【55】The symptoms are transient and usually resolve completely within a few days.\n\n【56】**Adjustment Disorder:**\n\n【57】A more common psychological response to a major stressor is a less severe but more prolonged emotional reaction. The predominant symptom is usually depression or anxiety, which is insufficiently persistent to merit a depressive or anxiety disorder diagnosis. There may also be anger, aggressive behavior, and associated excessive alcohol use. Symptoms develop within a month of the onset of the stress, and their duration and severity reflect the course of an underlying stressor.\n\n【58】Grief reactions are a particular type of adjustment disorder. They manifest as a brief period of emotional numbing, followed by a period of distress lasting several weeks, during which sorrow, tearfulness, sleep disturbances, loss of interest, and a sense of futility are common. Perceptual distortions may occur, including misinterpreting sounds as the dead person’s voice.\n\n【59】**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:**\n\n【60】It is a protracted response to a stressful event of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature. Examples of such events are,\n\n【61】*   Natural disasters.\n\n【62】*   Terrorist activity.\n\n【63】*   Serious accidents.\n\n【64】*   Witnessing violent deaths.\n\n【65】It may also occur after a distressing medical treatment. There is usually a delay ranging from a few days to several months between the traumatic event and the onset of symptoms. Typical symptoms are,\n\n【66】*   Recurrent intrusive memories of trauma (flashbacks).\n\n【67】*   Sleep disturbance.\n\n【68】*   Nightmares (usually traumatic events).\n\n【69】*   The patient awakes with anxiety.\n\n【70】*   Emotional blunting.\n\n【71】*   Symptoms of autonomic arousal.\n\n【72】*   Anxiety.\n\n【73】*   Depression.\n\n【74】Excessive use of alcohol and other drugs complicates the situation. The condition runs as a fluctuating course, with most patients recovering within 2 years. In a small proportion, the symptoms become chronic.\n\n【75】How Is Stress Managed?\n----------------------\n\n【76】*   Ongoing contact with and support from a doctor or other who can listen, reassure, explain and advise are often all that is needed.\n\n【77】*   Most patients do not require psychotropic medication, although benzodiazepines reduce arousal in acute stress reactions and can aid sleep in adjustment disorders.\n\n【78】*   Psychotherapy may be useful for patients with abnormal grief reactions.\n\n【79】*   Immediate counseling is needed for those who have survived a major trauma.\n\n【80】*   Counseling is important for people to overcome stress because it aims to provide,\n\n【81】1.  Support.\n\n【82】2.  Direct advice.\n\n【83】3.  Opportunity for emotional catharsis.\n\n【84】*   For people with post-traumatic stress disorder, structured psychological approaches are required, such as,\n\n【85】1.  Cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n【86】2.  Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\n【87】3.  Stress management.\n\n【88】*   Antidepressant drugs are moderately effective.\n\n【89】**Conclusion:**\n\n【90】If you have two or more of the above-mentioned symptoms, it is high time to get yourself checked by your PCP as there may be a serious medical illness or chronic disease disturbing your life routine and making you feel sick and stressed all the time.\n\n【91】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【92】* * *\n\n【93】#### **1.**删除换行**Are Stress and Illness Related?**\n\n【94】Chronic stress can depress the immune system of a person. When the immune system is weakened, the person is at a higher risk of developing an illness. On the contrary, short or acute stress can boost the immune system of a person. Therefore, stress and the immune system are related to each other.\n\n【95】#### **2.**删除换行**How Is Mental Illness Classified?**\n\n【96】Mental illness is broadly classified into two categories, any mental illness (AMI) and serious mental illness (SMI). AMI is defined as the change in the mental, behavioral or emotional nature of a person and it does not cause changes in overall livelihood. SMI on the other hand affects the day-to-day activities of a person.\n\n【97】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Stress Be Classified as Mental Illness?**\n\n【98】Stress is not directly classified as a mental illness. Stress, if chronic, can give rise to other mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Otitis media is a common infection caused by bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) and viruses (Adenovirus, Influenza virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza virus). Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia, effectively colonizes the nasopharynx and weakens the immune response. In addition, bacterial infection co-exists with viral pathogenesis rather than individual bacterial or viral infection. This further leads to the spread of infection to the middle ear.\n\n【2】What Is Pneumonia?\n------------------\n\n【3】Pneumonia is an infection that affects one or both lungs. The air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) are filled with fluid or pus, resulting in difficulty in breathing.\n\n【4】Types of pneumonia include:\n\n【5】*   **Bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia**.\n\n【6】*   **Walking pneumonia** \\- The individual is infected but can do daily activities.\n\n【7】*   **Chemical pneumonia** - It is caused by inhaling chemical fumes.\n\n【8】*   **Aspiration pneumonia** -It is caused by inhaling acid from the stomach, vomit, or food particles.\n\n【9】*   **Hospital-acquired** - Infection acquired during a stay in the hospital.\n\n【10】What Is Otitis Media?\n---------------------\n\n【11】Otitis media is a middle ear infection where fluid builds up and causes pain and swelling in the eardrum. Types include:\n\n【12】*   **Acute otitis media** - It is when the middle ear is infected and swollen with fluid build-up.\n\n【13】*   **Otitis media with effusion**\\- post-infection, some fluid remains inside and causes infection.\n\n【14】*   **Chronic otitis media** - accumulated fluid repeatedly returns to the middle ear and compromises hearing ability. Infection may or may not be present.\n\n【15】Why Does Pneumonia Affect the Middle Ear?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【16】The middle ear is between the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and the inner ear. The eustachian tube connects it to the upper throat (nasopharynx). This connection continues down to the middle throat (oropharynx), the lower throat (hypopharynx), the windpipe (trachea), and finally, the lungs. This interconnection causes the infection from the lungs to reach the middle ear.\n\n【17】How Does Pneumonia Cause Otitis Media?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【18】Persistent and recurrent infection results in colonization of the nasopharynx with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral infection co-exists and induces the adherence of bacteria to mucosal epithelial cells of the middle ear, which is close to the nasopharynx. This causes mucosal membrane inflammation, narrowing of the eustachian tube (ear canal), and reduced ventilation. Negative pressure is created, resulting in increased mucosal secretions that allow the growth of bacteria and viruses. As a result, the middle ear is filled with thick, amber-colored fluid and tympanic membrane retraction. In severe cases, perforation of the membrane can also occur.\n\n【19】**Who Gets It?**\n\n【20】Anyone can get both infections. But it is more common in children between 3 months - 3 years, and eight years of age. It also occurs in adults but is less common compared to infants and children. It also affects individuals with weak immune systems.\n\n【21】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【22】**Pneumonia:**\n\n【23】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>I have recurring otitis media.

The tests done for examination are:\n\n【69】*   **Pneumatic Otoscope** \\-An instrument used to observe the eardrum.\n\n【70】*   **Tympanometry -** To assess the movement of the eardrum. There will be slight or no movement if the eardrum is swollen.\n\n【71】*   **Acoustic Reflectometry** \\-Measures the sound reflected from the eardrum. More sound indicates high pressure in the eardrum because of fluid accumulation.\n\n【72】*   **Tympanocentesis** \\- A rare test in which the fluid is removed through a small tube to find the causative microorganisms.\n\n【73】What Are the Treatment Options?\n-------------------------------\n\n【74】**Pneumonia:**\n\n【75】Treatment is based on symptoms and severity. Mild pneumonia is manageable at home under the guidance of your doctor.\n\n【76】The following steps are advised:\n\n【77】*   Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen is prescribed to control fever.\n\n【78】*   Consuming plenty of liquids is essential for hydration.\n\n【79】*   Cough medicines should be taken only if your doctor advises you to do so.\n\n【80】*   Good rest is essential.\n\n【81】Severe cases are treated in a hospital setup,\n\n【82】*   Antibiotics: antibiotics are given only for bacterial pneumonia after the culture test. Systemic antibiotics are given.\n\n【83】*   Antivirals: to treat viral pneumonia.\n\n【84】*   Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen is given to reduce fever.\n\n【85】*   Cough medicines are not given unless it is essential because coughing evacuates sputum.\n\n【86】*   Nebulizer with Ventolin, ProAir, or Proventil to ease breathing.\n\n【87】*   Oxygen or a ventilator is used to ease breathing.\n\n【88】**Otitis Media:**\n\n【89】Ear infections settle within one to two weeks. The doctor will advise following management based on symptoms.\n\n【90】*   **Pain Medications** -the doctor will prescribe drugs like Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen to relieve pain.\n\n【91】*   **Ear Drops** - Anesthetic drops to relieve pain.\n\n【92】*   **Antibiotics** -Antibiotics are prescribed in the following cases;\n\n【93】    *   Age 6 months and above with moderate to severe pain or temperature 102.2 degrees.\n\n【94】    *   6-23 months with mild pain and fever of less than 102.2 degrees\n\n【95】    *   Twenty-four months and above with mild pain and fever less than 102.2 degrees.\n\n【96】*   **Ear Tubes** - A small hole is surgically created in the eardrum, and a tiny plastic or metal tube is placed to prevent fluid accumulation and ventilation. This is done in case of recurrent fluid build-up.\n\n【97】When to Consult a Doctor?\n-------------------------\n\n【98】Symptoms can be mild to severe. It is important to consult a physician if the symptoms are present for more than a day. Children and infants with the infection should be consulted to avoid severe illness. Individuals with fluid or blood discharge from the ear should immediately visit the doctor. It is essential to get proper treatment to prevent further progression.\n\n【99】**Conclusion**\n\n【100】Pneumonia and otitis media are common childhood diseases. Microorganisms are common in the nose and throat of children. They affect individuals with weak immunity. Doctors recommend vaccination for children and adults to protect them from pneumococcal diseases. Consult the doctor for early intervention and treatment.\n\n【101】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【102】* * *\n\n【103】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Pneumonia Cause a Middle Ear Infection?**\n\n【104】Streptococcus pneumonia can cause infection in the middle ear cavity through the eustachian tubes that connect the middle ear to the back of the throat and cause acute otitis media. In severe cases, it can also lead to hearing loss. This is more commonly seen in children after a respiratory tract infection such as flu or cold.\n\n【105】#### **2.**删除换行**How Does an Ear Infection Affect Our Lungs?**\n\n【106】The bacteria found in infected middle ears or sore throats are the same variety of organisms responsible for causing pneumonia, sinusitis, and other respiratory infections. This is more commonly seen during the winter and early spring.\n\n【107】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Different Forms of Otitis Media?**\n\n【108】There are four types of otitis media:  \n  - Acute Otitis Media - This type of infection occurs abruptly. It can cause swelling and redness due to the mucus trapped inside the ear.  \n\\- Otitis Media with Effusion - There is an accumulation of fluid and mucus in the middle ear after the initial infection subsides. The child may experience fullness and hearing loss.  \n\\- Chronic Otitis Media - In this type, the fluid or the mucus stays in the middle ear for a long period and may lead to hearing impairment.\n\n【109】#### **4.**删除换行**How Does Otitis Media Progress**\n\n【110】Otitis media is a complex inflammatory process following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. This involves the obstruction of the eustachian tube, causing a decrease in ventilation. This leads to an increase in negative pressure in the middle ear and mucosal secretions. The build-up of mucosal secretion serves to colonize bacteria and viral organisms in the middle ear. This is associated with frank purulence in the middle ear space and can be clinically observed.\n\n【111】#### **5.**删除换行**How Do We Classify Pneumonia as a Bacterial or Viral Disease?**\n\n【112】Pneumonia usually results from a bacterial infection affecting the upper respiratory tract. It is a serious infection that may involve one or both lungs. Streptococcus pneumonia is the most common type of bacteria causing Pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\n【113】#### **6.**删除换行**How Is Otitis Media Treated?**\n\n【114】Treatment of otitis media may depend on age, severity, and the nature of the infection. The most effective treatment for otitis media is using analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Antibiotics may be taken by mouth or as ear drops. In case of chronic infection, ear tubes (tympanostomy tubes) may drain the secretions out.\n\n【115】#### **7.**删除换行**How Is Otitis Media Diagnosed?**\n\n【116】An ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor can identify the ear infection using an otoscope. The healthcare provider can examine the middle ear for fluid accumulation using a special instrument, a pneumatic otoscope. Another test, known as tympanometry, can be used to check the air pressure in the middle ear. A hearing test performed by an audiologist can help to determine the possibility of hearing loss. It may be required to check the throat and the nasal passage for other signs of upper respiratory infections.\n\n【117】#### **8.**删除换行**Can We Leave Otitis Media Untreated?**\n\n【118】Untreated ear infections can cause several complications, such as  \n\\- Hearing Loss - Chronic infections can damage the ear's internal structures and cause significant loss of hearing.  \n\\- Delayed Speech and Language Skills - Impaired hearing due to damage to the ear can delay or affect speech development and clarity of language in children.  \n\\- Tear in the Drum - Long-lasting fluid in the middle ear can develop a tear in the eardrum in children. This may lead to hearing loss.  \n\\- Spread of Infection - Untreated infection can affect the adjacent mastoid bone (bone behind the ear). It may rarely extend the infection to the surrounding brain and spinal cord membranes.\n\n【119】#### **9.**删除换行**How Does Antibiotics Help in Treating Otitis Media?**\n\n【120】Antibiotics may be used to kill the bacteria and are used to treat ear infections that last for more than two to three days. The ear drops can be given directly into the ears. High doses of Amoxicillin are usually the first line of therapy for ear infections. The effect of antibiotics may be seen in two to three days.\n\n【121】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【122】无关删除-1:<u>*   Symptoms and Complications  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/about/symptoms-complications.html\n*   Pneumonia  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4471-pneumonia\n*   Ear Infection (Otitis Media)  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/otitis-media\n*   Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection)  \n    https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=otitis-media-middle-ear-infection-90-P02057\n*   Pneumonia  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a1542a0f-dce9-4ea7-88fb-4217de167523", "title": "Enoxaparin Sodium - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions", "text": "【0】Enoxaparin Sodium - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Enoxaparin is a medication that belongs to the blood-thinning group of drugs. It prevents blood clot formation in the veins of the legs in patients who are having surgeries such as hip or knee replacement, abdominal surgery, or those on bed rest. Enoxaparin sodium is often used in combination with other medications, such as Aspirin or Warfarin, to treat many conditions, such as blood clots and heart problems. The FDA approved Enoxaparin sodium in the year 1993 for medical use.\n\n【2】Enoxaparin sodium is approved for prophylaxis and treatment of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in which blood clots form in the veins (especially of the legs), leading to leg swelling and pain. In addition, Enoxaparin sodium is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of other conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, periprocedural anticoagulation, percutaneous coronary intervention, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction.\n\n【3】What Is Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】The blood can clot when it moves too slowly through the veins. Such blood clots can form in the veins in the body, especially in the legs. This condition is known as DVT or deep vein thrombosis. The most common sites of clots in veins include the lower leg, pelvis, and thigh, but they can occur in other body parts, also. DVT can lead to several health complications and can even be life-threatening. Thus, getting treated for DVT is important. Symptoms such as leg swelling (that comes and goes), pain in the leg on walking or standing, enlarged veins, and red, warm skin in the area are seen in DVT.\n\n【5】Sometimes, the blood clot can detach and enter the bloodstream. The loose blood clot can get lodged in the lungs' blood vessels, leading to a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism. This medical emergency presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up of blood, and increased heart rate. Thus, anticoagulant medications such as Enoxaparin sodium are initiated for DVT patients to prevent blood clot formation.\n\n【6】**For Doctors:**\n----------------\n\n【7】**FDA-Approved Indications:**\n\n【8】The low molecular weight heparin, Enoxaparin sodium, is approved for the following:\n\n【9】*   Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for patients undergoing surgeries such as hip or knee replacement and abdominal surgery and for patients with acute illness leading to restricted mobility.\n\n【10】*   Acute DVT treatment (outpatient treatment).\n\n【11】*   Prophylaxis of the ischemia-related complications of non-Q wave MI (myocardial infarction) and unstable angina.\n\n【12】*   Treatment of acute STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) that is managed with medical treatment or with percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【13】**Other Uses of Enoxaparin Sodium:**\n\n【14】*   Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n\n【15】*   Inpatient management of acute DVT with or without pulmonary embolism.\n\n【16】*   Prevention and management of venous thromboembolism that occurs secondary to malignancy.\n\n【17】*   Treatment for prosthetic valve thrombosis and VTE in pregnancy.\n\n【18】*   Prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolism and cerebral thromboembolism.\n\n【19】*   Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\n\n【20】*   Periprocedural anticoagulation.\n\n【21】What Is the Mechanism of Action?\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】As Enoxaparin sodium is a low molecular weight derivative of heparin, its mean molecular weight is 4000 to 5000 Daltons. It is usually administered intravenously and has a quick onset of action. Enoxaparin sodium is an anticoagulant (indirect) that binds to and activates antithrombin III to form a complex. This complex inactivates factor Xa (which is required for thrombin formation) irreversibly. Enoxaparin sodium has a lower molecular weight than heparin and a smaller chain length, so it has a better activity to inactivate factor Xa.\n\n【23】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【24】*   **Absorption:** Thepeak effect is usually four hours after administration. The anti-factor Xa activity is detected for up to 12 hours in plasma.\n\n【25】*   **Distribution:** 4.3 Liters (estimated by anti-factor Xa activity).\n\n【26】*   **Metabolism:** Enoxaparin sodium is metabolized (through desulfation and depolymerization) in the liver.\n\n【27】*   **Excretion:** Enoxaparin sodium is eliminated in urine (renal excretion). The elimination half-life is three to 4.5 hours after a single dose. The half-life increases to seven hours following repeated doses. The drug may accumulate in the kidney and increase the chance of bleeding in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【28】**Administration:**\n\n【29】About 90 percent of Enoxaparin sodium is available when administered subcutaneously. Thus, it has better bioavailability than heparin. When the drug is administered subcutaneously, it is given alternatively between the right or left posterolateral and anterolateral abdominal wall. Bruising may occur but can be prevented by not rubbing the subcutaneous injection site.\n\n【30】The drug can also be administered intravenously. Healthcare professionals must ensure that they do not mix or co-administer Enoxaparin sodium intravenous formulation (IV) with other medications. IV injection is usually administered during the percutaneous coronary intervention and at the time of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Normal saline or 5 percent dextrose water must be used to flush the port before administering Enoxaparin sodium. There are no topical forms of Enoxaparin sodium available. Administration of the drug into the muscles is avoided.\n\n【31】**Dosage:**\n\n【32】The dosage depends on the indications, renal or hepatic impairment, and the adverse events profile. One milligram of Enoxaparin sodium is equal to 100 units of anti-factor Xa activity.\n\n【33】1.  DVT Prophylaxis in Abdominal Surgery- 40 mg subcutaneous injection (once daily for up to 12 days).\n\n【34】2.  DVT Prophylaxis in Knee Replacement Surgery - 30 mg subcutaneous injection administered every 12 hours (up to 14 days).\n\n【35】3.  DVT Prophylaxis in Hip Replacement Surgery - 30 mg subcutaneous injection administered every 12 hours or 40 mg subcutaneous injection once daily (up to 14 days).\n\n【36】4.  DVT Prophylaxis in Medical Patients- 40 mg subcutaneous injection once daily for up to 14 days.\n\n【37】5.  Acute DVT (With or Without Pulmonary Embolism) Inpatient Treatment - 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection once daily for up to 17 days (administered with warfarin).\n\n【38】6.  Acute DVT Without Pulmonary Embolism Outpatient Treatment - 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection administered every 12 hours for up to 17 days (with warfarin).\n\n【39】7.  Non-Q-wave MI and Unstable Angina - 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection administered (with aspirin) once every 12 hours for two to eight days.\n\n【40】8.  Acute STEMI (In Patients Younger Than 75) - 30 mg single intravenous bolus and a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection every 12 hours for at least eight days (administered with aspirin).\n\n【41】9.  Acute STEMI (In Patients Older Than 75 Years of Age) - No intravenous bolus. 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneous injection administered every 12 hours for at least eight days (with aspirin).\n\n【42】What Is Its Use in Specific Patient Populations?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】*   **Patients With Hepatic Impairment:** According to a clinical trial, Enoxaparin sodium decreases hepatic decompensation and the rate of portal vein thrombosis. The drug also increases the probability of survival of the patients (with cirrhosis) by preventing microvascular thrombosis. However, there is an increased chance of bleeding while taking the drug in patients with liver cirrhosis and other comorbidities such as active cancer or hypertension. Thus, Enoxaparin sodium must be initiated with caution in patients with liver cirrhosis.\n\n【44】*   **Patients With Renal Impairment:** Increased bleeding tendency is seen in patients with renal impairment while taking Enoxaparin sodium. Enoxaparin sodium dose adjustment to 1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance lesser than 30 mL/min (severe renal impairment). No dose adjustment is required if the creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min.\n\n【45】*   **Geriatric Patients:** Older patients have an increased risk of bleeding, and care must be taken while initiating Enoxaparin sodium.\n\n【46】*   **Pregnancy**: Pregnant women are at a greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and it can often be life-threatening. Enoxaparin sodium is considered safe in pregnancy as it does not cross the placenta. For VTE prophylaxis, the administration of a 40 mg subcutaneous injection is recommended once daily. Administration of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours is recommended for therapeutic anticoagulation in pregnant women with acute thromboembolism or a recurrent thrombosis history.\n\n【47】*   **In Breastfeeding Mothers:** Administration of Enoxaparin sodium in doses up to 40 mg daily is considered safe and does not cause any adverse drug reactions in breastfed infants. There are no special precautions required for initiating Enoxaparin sodium in breastfeeding mothers. There is no evidence that Enoxaparin sodium is excreted into breast milk or absorbed by the infant's gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【48】*   **COVID-19 Considerations:** In patients critically ill due to COVID-19 (with or without venous thromboembolism), prophylaxis with Enoxaparin sodium is recommended. Higher-intensity anticoagulation with Enoxaparin sodium may be given to patients with a low risk of bleeding and a high thrombotic risk.\n\n【49】*   **In Patients With Low Weight:** The patients must be monitored and observed for signs of bleeding.\n\n【50】What Are the Drug Interactions?\n-------------------------------\n\n【51】Medications that increase the risk of hemorrhage must be discontinued before initiating Enoxaparin sodium. Such medications include other anticoagulants, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, NSAIDs, and platelet inhibitors (including acetylsalicylic acid). In case of such co-administration, close laboratory and clinical monitoring must be done.\n\n【52】What Are the Contraindications?\n-------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Major active bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding).\n\n【54】*   Anti-platelet antibody test positive (circulating antibodies) along with thrombocytopenia while using Enoxaparin sodium.\n\n【55】*   History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (within the past three months or 100 days).\n\n【56】*   Hypersensitivity to Enoxaparin sodium (anaphylactic reactions, urticaria).\n\n【57】*   Hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products.\n\n【58】*   Hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol (for multi-dose formulations especially used in neonates).\n\n【59】What Are the Warnings and Precautions?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【60】*   There is an increased risk of hemorrhage when used in patients at risk. Thus, Enoxaparin sodium must be initiated with caution in high-risk patients for hemorrhage.\n\n【61】*   In patients (anticoagulated with Enoxaparin) undergoing a spinal puncture or receiving neuraxial anesthesia, epidural or spinal hematomas may occur. These can result in long-term disability or permanent paralysis. Thus, healthcare providers must consider these risks before scheduling patients taking Enoxaparin sodium for spinal procedures.\n\n【62】*   While using Enoxaparin sodium for percutaneous coronary revascularization, the healthcare professional must obtain hemostasis at the site of the puncture before sheath removal.\n\n【63】*   The drug Enoxaparin sodium must be used with caution in patients with concomitant medical conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diathesis, diabetic retinopathy, recent gastrointestinal ulceration, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.\n\n【64】*   Enoxaparin sodium must be initiated with caution in those with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (or circulating antibodies).\n\n【65】*   If the patients have thrombocytopenia, the drug must be used cautiously, and the thrombocytopenia must be monitored closely.\n\n【66】*   Enoxaparin sodium must not be administered interchangeably with other low molecular-weight heparins or heparin.\n\n【67】*   While administering Enoxaparin sodium in pregnant women who have mechanical prosthetic heart valves, frequent monitoring, and drug dose adjustment are essential.\n\n【68】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【69】**What Is Deep Vein Thrombosis?**\n\n【70】In deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a severe medical condition, blood clots are found in veins, usually in the leg. Symptoms of DVT in the leg include throbbing or cramping pain in one leg (usually in the calf or thigh), swelling in the leg, darkened, red and warm skin around the painful area of the leg, and sore, swollen veins in the leg. These symptoms can also occur in a person's arm or other body parts where the blood clot is. Getting medical help for deep vein thrombosis is essential to prevent its complications.\n\n【71】DVT can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. The blood clot can detach from the veins and enter circulation (bloodstream). These free clots travel through the bloodstream and may block the blood vessels in the lungs, which can be life-threatening. One must rush to the emergency department or call for emergency care in case of a deep vein thrombosis with pain, swelling in the leg and chest pain, and breathlessness (indicators of pulmonary embolism).\n\n【72】**Who Is More Likely to Get Deep Vein Thrombosis?**\n\n【73】The patients at a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are\n\n【74】*   Elderly patients over 60 years of age.\n\n【75】*   Overweight individuals.\n\n【76】*   Those who smoke.\n\n【77】*   Patients who have had DVT before.\n\n【78】*   Women taking oral contraceptive pills or hormonal replacement therapy.\n\n【79】*   Those with cancer or heart failure.\n\n【80】*   Patients with varicose veins.\n\n【81】*   Patients who are confined to bed or cannot move around much (such as after surgery).\n\n【82】*   Individuals who are traveling for a long duration without much movement.\n\n【83】*   Women who are pregnant or have just delivered a baby (in the past six weeks).\n\n【84】*   Dehydrated individuals.\n\n【85】**What Is Enoxaparin Sodium?**\n\n【86】Enoxaparin sodium is an injectable medication that is used to prevent blood clots in the legs and other body parts (such as deep venous thrombosis). These blood clots can travel through the blood to the lungs leading to life-threatening complications or death. Enoxaparin sodium is administered to prevent blood clots in a person who undergoes surgery, such as abdominal surgery and knee or hip replacement. This medication also prevents blood clots for patients experiencing heart attacks or chest pain and in patients confined to bed. Enoxaparin sodium is derived from heparin and is a low molecular weight heparin.\n\n【87】**What Is the Difference Between Enoxaparin Sodium and Heparin?**\n\n【88】Enoxaparin sodium and heparin prevent blood clots inside the body but are indicated for different scenarios. Standard heparin is a liquid medicine administered intravenously (injected directly into the vein) and administered only to hospitalized patients to prevent blood clots during surgery. Patients vary widely in their response to heparin (requiring frequent monitoring), which can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), a life-threatening condition. Thus heparin can be administered only by healthcare providers and cannot be self-injected. Enoxaparin sodium is an injectable medication derived from heparin and also prevents blood clots. Enoxaparin sodium can be injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection). It has predictable efficacy, does not require frequent monitoring, and has lower adverse effects. In addition, the patients can self-administer Enoxaparin sodium at home.\n\n【89】**When Is Enoxaparin Sodium Administered?**\n\n【90】Enoxaparin sodium is a drug that prevents the formation of blood clots. Thus, Enoxaparin sodium is used to treat deep vein thrombosis in which blood clots are formed, usually in the legs. DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs that can be fatal). Enoxaparin sodium is used for prophylaxis and treatment of the condition. Enoxaparin sodium also prevents complications in certain types of chest pain (angina) or heart attack. In addition, Enoxaparin sodium is used for other medical conditions that require medications to prevent blood clot formation.\n\n【91】How Is Enoxaparin Sodium Administered?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【92】Enoxaparin sodium is available as injections that can be administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and as intravenous injections that can be administered into the patient's veins directly by the healthcare provider.\n\n【93】**Warnings:**\n\n【94】The injection can cause a serious blood clot (hematoma) around the spinal cord in patients undergoing spinal procedures such as spinal anesthesia or spinal tap. These hematomas can cause long-term disabilities or paralysis. Thus, care must be taken by the healthcare providers while administering Enoxaparin sodium in patients who are undergoing such procedures and in high-risk patients (with a history of spinal procedures and using other medications such as NSAIDs or blood thinners). Patients with symptoms of spinal cord hematoma, such as numbness, back pain or muscle weakness in the legs, and loss of bowel or bladder control, must get emergency medical help.\n\n【95】**What Are the Precautions to Take Before Using Enoxaparin Sodium?**\n\n【96】*   A person must not use Enoxaparin sodium if allergic to heparin, Enoxaparin sodium, and benzyl alcohol.\n\n【97】*   One must avoid using Enoxaparin sodium injection if they have decreased platelets in the blood test (with certain antibodies) and have active or uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n【98】*   Patients must inform their healthcare provider regarding any underlying conditions that may cause them to bleed, such as bleeding disorder, stroke, bleeding or ulcer in the stomach, recent surgeries, etc.\n\n【99】*   Patients must inform their healthcare provider if they have had any spinal cord-related injuries or procedures done.\n\n【100】*   Patients must also inform their healthcare provider regarding the medications that they are currently taking to prevent drug interactions or drug-induced complications.\n\n【101】*   One must keep their healthcare provider informed about the presence of bleeding disorders, liver disease, kidney disease, blood pressure, diabetes, stomach ulcer, or low platelet count on receiving heparin or other medications.\n\n【102】*   Women who are pregnant must inform their doctor regarding their pregnancy before initiating Enoxaparin sodium treatment or prophylaxis.\n\n【103】*   Pregnant women with a mechanical heart valve must not take Enoxaparin sodium without informing their healthcare provider.\n\n【104】*   One must enquire about the risk associated with their healthcare provider while breastfeeding their baby and initiating the drug.\n\n【105】**How Should One Use Enoxaparin Sodium Subcutaneous Injections?**\n\n【106】Healthcare professionals should only perform intravenous administration (injection into the vein) of Enoxaparin sodium. Enoxaparin sodium can be self-administered at home subcutaneously (under the skin). It is important to follow all the directions in the medication instruction sheets and use them only as directed by the physician. The person administering the subcutaneous injection must:\n\n【107】*   Avoid using Enoxaparin if they do not understand how to inject it.\n\n【108】*   Ask their healthcare provider regarding any doubts about the subcutaneous injection of Enoxaparin sodium.\n\n【109】*   Avoid using the injection if the medicine has particles in it or has changed colors.\n\n【110】*   Prepare the injection only before use.\n\n【111】*   Avoid injecting Enoxaparin sodium into muscle.\n\n【112】*   Use a different site of injection every time. Avoid injecting into the same site continuously.\n\n【113】*   Understand that the patient might require frequent medical tests to determine the duration of Enoxaparin sodium treatment.\n\n【114】*   Inform the healthcare provider if undergoing any surgery (including dental).\n\n【115】*   Store the medicine at room temperature (away from heat and moisture).\n\n【116】*   Understand that each prefilled syringe must be used only once and discarded after a single use (even if some medicine is left in it).\n\n【117】*   If using an Enoxaparin sodium bottle (vial), ensure that the medicine is used within 28 days of opening the vial and it is discarded after 28 days.\n\n【118】*   Use sterile needles and syringes only once and dispose of them safely.\n\n【119】*   Keep Enoxaparin sodium vials and syringes safe and out of reach of pets and children.\n\n【120】What to Do if One Misses a Dose?\n--------------------------------\n\n【121】The injections can be given as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, one must not use two doses and skip the missed dose.\n\n【122】**What Happens if One Overdose?**\n\n【123】Enoxaparin sodium overdose may lead to excessive bleeding, which can be dangerous. It is important to seek emergency medical help and rush to the emergency department for observation and management.\n\n【124】**What Should One Avoid While Using Enoxaparin Sodium?**\n\n【125】Patients using Enoxaparin sodium must avoid activities that can cause injury or bleeding. They must be vigilant to prevent bleeding during daily activities such as shaving or brushing their teeth.\n\n【126】**What Are the Common Drugs That Can Interact With Enoxaparin Sodium?**\n\n【127】Many medications that are used to prevent or treat blood clots interact with Enoxaparin sodium. It is important to keep the healthcare provider informed regarding the other medications that a patient is taking before initiating Enoxaparin sodium. The drugs that could affect Enoxaparin sodium include heparin, other anticoagulants, Dipyridamole, Sulfinpyrazone, NSAIDs, and platelet inhibitors (including acetylsalicylic acid).\n\n【128】What Are the Side Effects of Enoxaparin Sodium?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【129】Enoxaparin sodium can cause severe allergic reactions in some patients. One must seek emergency medical care in case of serious allergic reactions such as itching, hives, burning skin, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face and throat. Suppose the patient experiences signs of spinal hematoma (numbness, back pain, muscle weakness in the legs, loss of bowel or bladder control). In that case, they must call for emergency medical care or rush to the emergency department. If patients notice any side effects from using Enoxaparin sodium, they must visit their healthcare provider for further management. The side effects of Enoxaparin sodium include the following:\n\n【130】*   Uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n【131】*   Easy bruising.\n\n【132】*   Bleeding from the nose and gums.\n\n【133】*   Abnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\n【134】*   Blood in stool and urine.\n\n【135】*   Coughing up blood.\n\n【136】*   Blood in vomit.\n\n【137】*   Bleeding in the brain (sudden weakness in one side of the body, severe headache, sudden speech or vision problems).\n\n【138】*   Anemia (pale skin, tiredness, shortness of breath).\n\n【139】*   Injection site reactions.\n\n【140】*   Other common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, confusion, and irritation.\n\n【141】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【142】无关删除-1:<u>*   Enoxaparin Injection  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601210.html\n*   Enoxaparin  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539865/\n*   Generic Enoxaparin Questions and Answers  \n    https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/generic-enoxaparin-questions-and-answers</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can be defined as an abnormal and excessive accumulation of fat in the body that can impair health. A recent study has predicted that by the year 2035 more than half of the world’s population will be obese. Overweight and obesity were once thought as a problem in high-income countries, but are now substantially on an upward trend in low- and middle-income countries as well, especially in urban areas; it is considered a modern epidemic. Obesity has got to do with much more than the way one looks, it is a risk factor for many diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, certain types of cancers, sleep apnea, etc. There has always been a lot of buzz around healthy ways to lose fat and a never ending research on scientific and evidence based lifestyle practices and dietary habits to keep obesity at bay. Obesity is discerned using the body mass index (BMI); a BMI value above 30.0 falls in the obese category. For Asian populations a BMI greater than 23 is considered as a risk factor for various health conditions. However, athletes may have a BMI falling in the overweight category but they are not obese; other measurements like waist circumference are also taken into consideration rather than just absolute weight.\n\n【2】How Does Obesity Affect the Body?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】The mechanical implication of obesity is extra pressure on the skeleton and joints. Chemical changes in blood due to excessive fat increase the likelihood of life-threatening events like heart disease and stroke. Overall obesity is related to a premature death from various causes. It leads to metabolic changes. Excess calories are stored as lipids in the adipose tissue. When there is no more tissue left to store the excess calories, fat cells become enlarged and start secreting hormones and chemicals. This kicks off a chronic inflammatory process in the body which contributes to several diseases. Insulin resistance, high blood sugars and lipids constitute a metabolic syndrome.\n\n【4】What Is Ghrelin?\n----------------\n\n【5】Ghrelin is a hormone produced and released by the stomach responsible for signaling the brain and stimulating hunger. While it is primarily produced in the stomach, other organs such as the small intestine, pancreas and the brain itself secrete small amounts of ghrelin. It not only stimulates hunger through a metabolic-need driven homeostatic feeding, but also acts centrally, modulating reward, memory and motivated feeding behavior. Structurally it is composed of 28 amino acids and is an acylated peptide.\n\n【6】What Are Its Functions?\n-----------------------\n\n【7】The key functions of ghrelin include:\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Shrinking of Stomach - Causes and Role of stomach</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Hormonal Belly- How to Get Rid of It?</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Signals the hypothalamus leading to increased appetite.\n\n【13】*   Promotes storage of fat.\n\n【14】*   Pituitary gland stimulation by ghrelin leads to growth hormone release.\n\n【15】*   Acts on the digestive system to propel the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines.\n\n【16】*   Has a role in the control of insulin release.\n\n【17】*   Protects cardiovascular health.\n    </u>\n\n【18】The release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland triggered by ghrelin breaks down fat tissue, controls insulin release, and protects the heart.\n\n【19】How Is Ghrelin Related to Appetite and Obesity?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Ghrelin levels peak when the stomach is empty and plummet after consumption of a meal. Nicknamed as the ‘hunger hormone’ it is the only circulating orexigenic (appetite stimulating) hormone and affects intestinal motility and emptying. Researchers believe that ghrelin has an impact on both long term and short term body weight. Contrary to what one might expect, obese individuals were found to have low levels of circulating ghrelin. However, it has been found that postprandial suppression of ghrelin is weaker in obese groups compared to controls with normal BMI; this is a reasonable explanation for the increased food consumption in obese individuals since they experience a sense of hunger even after eating a meal. The two most popular approaches to managing obesity are, a conservative approach involving diet, exercise and lifestyle changes and a surgical approach by surgical weight reduction procedures. The interaction between ghrelin and these measures are as follows:\n\n【21】1.  **Ghrelin and Dieting** \\- Dieting for weight loss can include smaller portions of food at short intervals or avoidance of certain elements of food, or fasting periodically. There are multiple types of diets each advocated for its own benefits. Diets and dietary-induced weight loss have been related to an increase in ghrelin levels in the blood, which could explain why diets fail so frequently. When we limit our calorie intake and/or lose weight, our bodies interpret it as famine. Consequently, a compensatory process to maintain our weight is activated. Our metabolism slows down and we become hungry, we tend to eat more. Dieters who rely solely on willpower to reduce weight generally fail. Ghrelin, in addition to stimulating appetite, may also promote the accumulation of belly fat.\n\n【22】2.  **Ghrelin and Bariatric Surgery** - Bariatric surgery has produced impressive results in morbidly obese individuals. The roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is a type of bariatric surgery in which a small pouch in the stomach is created and connected directly to the small intestine. Another procedure called sleeve gastrectomy (SG) involves the removal of the gastric fundus which is a major site of ghrelin production; hence ghrelin levels fall sharply following SG which could be a contributing factor to the procedure’s success. RYGB causes malabsorption due shunting of the undigested food to the distal part of the small intestine.\n\n【23】To summarize, the proven role of ghrelin in obesity is either due to its overproduction or inadequate suppression following meal consumption. Some individuals may have greater receptor sensitivity for ghrelin action. Diet or dietary-induced weight loss is associated with increased ghrelin levels which could be the reason why there is rebound weight gain due to increased appetite. Changes in the orexigenic hormone ghrelin play a significant role in hunger fluctuation after meals and the maintenance of weight loss accomplished after bariatric surgery.\n\n【24】Can Ghrelin Inhibitors Be the Answer?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【25】The role of ghrelin in appetite makes us wonder if inhibiting this hormone to decrease hunger and food consumption could be a plausible solution. In 2006, the Scripps Research Institute in California developed an anti-obesity ghrelin vaccine which helped reduce fat and slow down weight gain in animal studies. However, ghrelin is also associated with pleasure derived from food and completely blocking this hormone may have side effects. Nevertheless, ghrelin blockers could well be the future in combating obesity.\n\n【26】**Conclusion:**\n\n【27】Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates hunger, discovered only about two decades back. Researchers suggest that excessive production of ghrelin or an exaggerated sensitivity to the hormone can be a factor in obesity. The precise role of ghrelin in the pathophysiology of obesity is yet unknown due to limitations such as challenges to the actual measurement of ghrelin levels and limited number of randomized control trials and studies. Nevertheless, a well-defined explanation and knowledge of the onset of appetite by an increase in ghrelin levels could be revolutionary, opening up new avenues for the management or even therapy of obesity.\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ghrelin and Obesity: Identifying Gaps and Dispelling Myths.

{"seq_id": "a2f5d578-fe91-491b-99d7-5f863865c70c", "title": "Vemurafenib - Indications, Dosage, Warnings, and Precautions", "text": "【0】Vemurafenib - Indications, Dosage, Warnings, and Precautions\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Certain kinds of melanoma involve a specific type of skin cancer with an aberrant \"BRAF\" (B-Raf proto-oncogene) gene that has migrated to other areas of the body, or that cannot be removed surgically; Vemurafenib is a prescription drug. Melanoma with a healthy BRAF gene does not respond to Vemurafenib therapy. Additionally, one specific form of Erdheim-Chester sickness, a disorder in which overproduction of a type of white blood cells occurs, can be treated with it. Vemurafenib belongs to the group of drugs known as kinase inhibitors. It functions by preventing the action of a complex protein that instructs cancer cells to proliferate. This aids in containing or halting the spread of cancer cells. Vemurafenib's safety and effectiveness in children under 18 are unknown.\n\n【2】**Indications for Vemurafenib:**\n\n【3】Metastatic or unresectable melanoma - Vermurafenib is recommended for treating individuals with metastatic or incurable melanoma identified as having the BRAF V600E mutation food and drug administration, United States (FDA) approved test. The limitation of Vemurafenib is that it is not recommended for treating patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma.\n\n【4】The Erdheim-Chester Condition- The use of Vemurafenib is recommended for the treatment of Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) patients who have the BRAF V600 mutation.\n\n【5】How Does Vemurafenib Work?\n--------------------------\n\n【6】The BRAF gene is altered in about 50 percent of all melanomas, causing the cells to overproduce BRAF protein. This protein promotes the growth and division of cancer cells. By concentrating on this protein, Vemurafenib slows or halts the growth of cancer cells. The oral medication vemurafenib inhibits mutant BRAF-serine-threonine kinase. Vemurafenib interacts with the mutant species of BRAF as a competitive inhibitor, particularly effective against the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib inhibits the growth of tumors by blocking downstream pathways, which eventually results in apoptosis. When used against melanoma cell lines that carry the wild-type BRAF mutation, Vemurafenib has no anti-tumor effects.\n\n【7】**Warnings and Precautions:**\n\n【8】**Skin Malignancies:**\n\n【9】Patients who took Vemurafenib in Trial 1 had a greater incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and melanoma than those in the control group. In the Vemurafenib arm, there were 24 % more cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC) and keratoacanthomas than in the dacarbazine arm. Age (65 years and above), past skin cancer, and prolonged sun exposure were all possible risk factors for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma seen in clinical studies utilizing Vemurafenib.\n\n【10】It is advised to utilize dermatopathology analysis and excision to manage problematic skin lesions. Following the cessation of Vemurafenib, patients should consider undergoing dermatologic monitoring for six months. Patients using Vemurafenib may develop non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Patients on Vemurafenib should be cautiously watched for any new non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【11】**Tumor Promotion in Melanoma of the BRAF Wild-Type:**\n\n【12】In vitro tests have shown that BRAF wild-type cells treated with BRAF inhibitors paradoxically activate MAP (mitogen-activated protein)-kinase signaling and promote cell proliferation. Before beginning treatment with Vemurafenib, confirming the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in tumor samples is essential.\n\n【13】**Reactions from Hypersensitivity:**\n\n【14】Vemurafenib can cause anaphylaxis and other severe hypersensitivity reactions both during therapy and after resuming it. Hypotension, medication reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, broad rash, erythema, and severe hypersensitivity reactions were also reported (DRESS syndrome). Patients who have a severe hypersensitivity reaction should permanently stop taking Vemurafenib.\n\n【15】**Dermatologic Reactions:**\n\n【16】Patients on Vemurafenib may experience severe dermatologic reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patients who have a severe dermatologic reaction should permanently stop taking Vemurafenib.\n\n【17】**QT Prolongation:**\n\n【18】In a previously treated patient with metastatic melanoma who also had the BRAF V600E mutation, concentration-dependent QT prolongation was seen. The likelihood of ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes, may increase as QT prolongation occurs. Patients with irreversible electrolyte imbalances, QTc values more than 500 ms, long QT syndrome, or on medications known to prolong the QT interval should not begin treatment. Evaluate ECG (electrocardiogram) and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium) after 15 days, monthly for the first three months of the treatment, then every three months after that, or more frequently as clinically necessary, before and after treatment commencement or after dose change of Vemurafenib for QTc prolongation.\n\n【19】Patients who experience a QTc > 500 ms should stop using Vemurafenib. Upon return to QTc, 500 milliseconds which is Grade 2, recommence at a lower dose. Immediately stop taking Vemurafenib if the QTc interval appears and remains more significant than 500 milliseconds and has grown by more than 60 milliseconds compared to pretreatment readings. QT prolongation can induce cardiac problems such as bradyarrhythmia, congestive cardiac failure, and abnormal electrolytes.\n\n【20】**Hepatotoxicity:**\n\n【21】Injuries to the liver that result in functional hepatic impairment, such as coagulopathy or other organ failures, can occur when using Vemurafenib. Alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, and bilirubin should be given before starting treatment, monthly while receiving treatment, or as clinically necessary. Manage inconsistency in the laboratory with dosage reduction, treatment stoppage, or treatment cessation. Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib together have not been proven to be safe and effective. In a dose-finding trial, most patients who received concurrent Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib experienced Grade 3 elevations in transaminases and bilirubin.\n\n【22】**Photosensitivity:**\n\n【23】Patients on Vemurafenib may experience mild to severe photosensitivity. Encourage patients to use lip balm with an SPF of at least 30 and a broad-spectrum UVA and UVB sunscreen whenever they are outside.\n\n【24】**Ophthalmologic Reactions:**\n\n【25】In patients receiving Vemurafenib, uveitis, blurred vision, and photophobia have all been reported. In a clinical trial of the patients receiving Vemurafenib, they reported experiencing uveitis, including iritis, as opposed to individuals in the Dacarbazine group. To treat uveitis, steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops may be necessary. Keep an eye out for uveitis symptoms in the patients.\n\n【26】**Toxicity to the Fetus:**\n\n【27】When given to a pregnant woman, Vemurafenib has the potential to harm the fetus due to its mode of action. Information should be given to the expectant mothers about the potential fetal risk. Females with the ability to procreate should be advised to use effective contraception while receiving Vemurafenib medication and for two weeks following the last dosage.\n\n【28】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>How to confirm melanoma?</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>What Is Sweat? - Types and Treatments</u>\n\n【33】**Radiation Recall and Radiation Sensitization:**\n\n【34】Patients who had radiation before, during, or after receiving Vemurafenib treatment have reported radiation sensitivity and recall. In some cases, there was severe involvement of cutaneous and visceral organs. Patients with visceral organ involvement have experienced fatal situations, according to reports. When Vemurafenib is given concurrently or after radiation therapy, patients should be watched closely.\n\n【35】**Renal Failure:**\n\n【36】Vemurafenib can cause renal failure, including acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis. Patients in a clinical trial with metastatic melanoma experienced Grade 1 to 2 creatinine in 26 % of Vemurafenib-treated patients and 5 % of Dacarbazine-treated patients; Grade 3 to 4 creatinine elevations occurred in 1.2 % of Vemurafenib-treated patients and 1.1 % of Dacarbazine-treated patients. Before beginning Vemurafenib medication and at regular intervals afterward, check serum creatinine levels.\n\n【37】**Plantar Fasciitis Fibromatosis and Dupuytren's Contracture:**\n\n【38】With Vemurafenib, reports of Dupuytren's contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis have been made. Most cases of Dupuytren's contracture were mild to moderate, but there have also been reports of severe, incapacitating cases.\n\n【39】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【40】What Is Melanoma?\n-----------------\n\n【41】The melanocytes, which make melanin, the pigment responsible for our skin's color, grow into melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Additionally, melanoma can develop in our eyes and, very rarely, inside our body, like in the throat or nose.\n\n【42】**What Causes Melanoma?**\n\n【43】Most medical professionals concur that excessive sun exposure, especially sunburns, is a significant risk factor for melanoma. UV (ultraviolet) exposure can alter specific genes that control how cells grow and divide by damaging a cell's DNA. When the skin's DNA is harmed, and those cells begin to divide, issues could arise.\n\n【44】Although anyone can get melanoma, those who have the following risk factors are more likely to do so:\n\n【45】*   A personal history of having melanoma.\n\n【46】*   A melanoma family history.\n\n【47】*   Blue eyes, blond or red hair, and fair skin with freckles.\n\n【48】*   Excessive sun exposure can result in painful sunburns.\n\n【49】*   A residence near the equator or at a high elevation may expose you to more UV or ultraviolet radiation.\n\n【50】*   A background in using tanning beds.\n\n【51】*   A lot of moles, particularly unusual moles.\n\n【52】*   A compromised immune system.\n\n【53】Melanoma can affect anyone; however, it is more prevalent in white people. Melanoma most frequently develops on the palms, soles, and nails of those with darker skin.\n\n【54】What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Melanoma?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Because early melanomas can often be successfully treated, it is crucial to recognize them. Moles, open sores, scaly patches, and elevated bumps can all be symptoms of melanoma.\n\n【56】The \"ABCDE\" memory aid from the American academy of dermatology will help one remember the indicators that a lesion on their skin can be melanoma:\n\n【57】**Asymmetry:** One half is different from the other.\n\n【58】**Border:** The borders are not straight.\n\n【59】**Color:** There are varying hues of brown, black, gray, red, and white that are speckled and irregular.\n\n【60】**Diameter:** The spot's diameter is larger than the diameter of a pencil eraser.\n\n【61】**Evolving:** The spot changes in size, shape, or color or is new.\n\n【62】Tell the doctor if you see any sores that would not heal, odd bumps or rashes, skin changes, or moles you already have because not all melanomas follow the ABCDE rule. The ugly duckling sign is another method for detecting melanoma. The ugly duckling mole stands out from the rest and needs to be examined by a dermatologist.\n\n【63】**How to Diagnose Melanoma?**\n\n【64】The following tests and techniques are used to identify melanoma:\n\n【65】**Examination of the Body-** Your doctor will inquire about your medical history and look for potential melanoma warning signals on your skin.\n\n【66】**Removing a Tissue Sample for Analysis or Biopsy-** Your doctor could advise taking a sample of skin for testing to identify whether a suspicious skin lesion is a melanoma. The sample is delivered to a lab for analysis.\n\n【67】Their doctor may propose a particular biopsy operation depending on a patient's unique circumstances. When it is feasible, doctors almost always advise removing the entire tumor. A punch biopsy typically involves pressing a circular blade into the skin near the suspicious mole. Another method, an excisional biopsy, involves using a knife to remove the whole mole and a small margin of the surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n【68】The next step is to establish if the melanoma has spread when the doctor receives the skin biopsy findings indicating evidence of melanoma cells. Staging describes this. Once identified, melanoma will be classified according to several criteria, including the extent of its spread and how it appears under a microscope. The most crucial factor in outcome prediction is tumor thickness.\n\n【69】**The following phases are used to categorize melanomas:**\n\n【70】**Stage 0 (Melanoma in Situ):** Only the top layer of skin is affected by melanoma, which is the epidermis.\n\n【71】**Stage I:** Primary melanoma that is low-risk and has not spread. Surgery can typically cure this stage.\n\n【72】**Stage II:** Some characteristics point to a higher likelihood of recurrence, but there is no proof that it has spread.\n\n【73】**Stage III:** The melanoma has affected local lymph nodes or surrounding skin.\n\n【74】**Stage IV:** The melanoma has migrated to internal organs, distant lymph nodes, or skin.\n\n【75】How to Treat Melanoma?\n----------------------\n\n【76】The stage of melanoma and overall general health will determine how the patient will be treated. The main form of treatment for melanoma is typically surgery. The technique entails removing the malignancy and some of the surrounding healthy skin. The location and size of the skin cancer will determine how much healthy skin needs to be removed. Melanomas can typically be surgically removed under local anesthetic in a dermatologist's clinic. Advanced conditions could call for alternative forms of care in addition to or instead of surgery.\n\n【77】**Melanoma Treatments:**\n\n【78】**Melanoma Surgery:** If performed in the early stages, surgery has a good chance of curing melanoma. A dermatologist usually performs this procedure in their clinic, using a local anesthetic to numb the skin before removing the melanoma and its borders which are the healthy surrounding skin.\n\n【79】**Lymphadenectomy:** When melanoma has spread, it may be necessary to remove the lymph nodes close to the location of the initial diagnosis. This may stop the disease from spreading to other parts of your body.\n\n【80】**Metastasectomy:** This procedure removes little pieces of melanoma from organs.\n\n【81】**Targeted Cancer Therapy:** Cancer therapy that targets particular cancer cells employs medications to kill those cells. This \"targeted\" strategy only affects cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.\n\n【82】**Radiation Therapy:** Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to treat tumors and kill cancer cells.\n\n【83】**Immunotherapy:** To combat cancer, immunotherapy activates your body's own immune system.\n\n【84】What Specific Safety Measures Should a Patient Take?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【85】*   If a patient has an allergy to Vemurafenib, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in Vemurafenib tablets, they should tell their doctor and pharmacist before using Vemurafenib.\n\n【86】*   Patients should inform their doctor and pharmacist about any additional prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary supplements, and herbal products they are now taking or intend to use. Incorporate any of the following: antifungal drugs, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) drugs, a number of seizure drugs, Tizanidine, and Warfarin. The physician might need to adjust the dosage of the drugs or keep a close eye on the patients for side effects. Patients should inform their doctor about all the drugs they are taking, even any not on this list, as many other drugs may also interact with Vemurafenib.\n\n【87】*   A prolonged QT interval (a rare heart condition that can result in an erratic heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death); heart failure; a low level of calcium, magnesium, or potassium in your blood; or heart, kidney, or liver problems should all be disclosed to your doctor.\n\n【88】*   Tell your doctor whether you have ever received radiation therapy or if you have any plans to do so.\n\n【89】*   If one is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, they should inform their doctor. Pregnancy should be avoided while taking Vemurafenib. Throughout Vemurafenib treatment and two weeks following your last dose, you should take birth control to prevent getting pregnant. Discuss effective birth control options with your doctor. If a patient is pregnant, they should discuss it with their doctor, as the drug can adversely affect the fetus.\n\n【90】*   Let the doctor know if you are nursing a baby. While using Vemurafenib and for two weeks following your last dosage, one should not breastfeed.\n\n【91】*   Do not undergo surgery, including oral surgery, if you take Vemurafenib unless your physician or dentist directs otherwise.\n\n【92】*   Make a plan to limit your time in the sun, and wear sunscreen, protective clothing, sunglasses, and lip balm (SPF 30 or higher). Your skin could become sun-sensitive if you take Vemurafenib.\n\n【93】For Doctors:\n------------\n\n【94】**Administration and Dosage:**\n\n【95】Melanoma Patient Selection for Treatment- Before beginning Vemurafenib therapy, confirm the existence of the BRAF V600E mutation in melanoma tumor samples.\n\n【96】Vemurafenib should be taken orally, with or without food, at doses of 960 milligrams every 12 hours. One can take a missed dose up to 4 hours before the next dose. Vemurafenib should be given to patients until the onset of unacceptable side effects or disease progression. If vomiting happens after taking Vemurafenib, patients should not take a second dose; instead, they should take the next dose as scheduled. It should not be chewed or crushed.\n\n【97】**Modifications to the Dose for Fresh Primary Cutaneous Malignancies:** No dosage adjustments are advised in such cases.\n\n【98】**Vemurafenib Should No Longer Be Used for Any of the Following Reasons:**\n\n【99】Grade 4 adverse response, first or second manifestation (if clinically indicated).\n\n【100】A QTc prolongation of more than 500 ms and a rise of more than 60 ms from baseline. Withhold Vemurafenib for severe grade 2 or higher adverse reactions.\n\n【101】After reaching Grade 0-1, reintroduce Vemurafenib at a lower dosage as follows:\n\n【102】For the initial occurrence of unacceptable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse effects, 720 milligrams twice daily. 480 milligrams twice daily for the recurrence of adverse reactions of Grade 2 (if unbearable), Grade 3, or Grade 4, or the onset of Grade 4 adverse reactions if clinically appropriate. Never lower the dose to less than 480 mg twice daily.\n\n【103】**Modifying Doses for Potent CYP3A4 Inducers** - Avoid concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inducers when taking Vemurafenib. If a potent CYP3A4 inducer is used simultaneously, 240 mg or one more tablet of Vemurafenib should be administered if it is unavoidable. After ceasing use, restart the Vemurafenib dose taken before beginning the potent CYP3A4 inducer for two weeks.\n\n【104】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n\n【105】Patients who received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily did not suffer significant changes in mean QTc interval, which is more than 20 ms from baseline, in a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study in 132 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutant. Vemurafenib is linked to a concentration-dependent lengthening of the QTc interval. At 2 hours post-dose on day 15, an increase of 12.8 ms (within the upper border of the two-sided 90 percent confidence interval of 14.9 milliseconds) represented the most significant mean change from baseline throughout the first month of treatment. Pre-dose time points showed the greatest observed mean change from baseline over the first six months of treatment, increasing by 15.1 ms (upper bound of the two-sided 90 % confidence range of 17.7 ms).\n\n【106】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【107】Patients with metastatic BRAF mutation-positive cancer were studied to establish the pharmacokinetics of Vemurafenib. After 15 days of taking 960 mg twice daily, melanoma is spaced around 12 hours apart. The 458 patients' data were combined for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Vemurafenib demonstrates steady-state within the dose range of 240 mg to 960 mg, linear pharmacokinetics.\n\n【108】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【109】Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, an orally absorbable inhibitor of some mutant BRAF serine-threonine kinases, such as BRAF V600E. In vitro, Vemurafenib inhibits CRAF, ARAF, wild-type BRAF, SRMS, ACK1, MAP4K5, and FGR at comparable doses. BRAF proteins that are constitutively activated due to mutations in the BRAF gene, such as V600E, can cause cell proliferation without growth factors, which are typically necessary for expansion. In animal models and cellular models of melanomas with mutant BRAF V600E, Vemurafenib shows anti-tumor effects.\n\n【110】**Absorption:**\n\n【111】Vemurafenib's bioavailability has not been established. After multiple doses, the median Tmax (time to peak drug concentration) was almost three hours. The median accumulation ratio estimate from the population pharmacokinetic analysis for the twice-daily regimen is 7.4, and steady-state is reached between 15 and 22 days. Vemurafenib was given without attention to diet during clinical trials. A single dosage of Vemurafenib with a high-fat meal increased AUC by about 5-fold, Cmax (maximum concentration) by approximately 2.5-fold, and Tmax by about 4 hours compared to the fasting state, according to a food effect study. Increased exposures could prolong QTc since vemurafenib is linked to concentration-dependent QTc interval lengthening.\n\n【112】**Distribution:**\n\n【113】Human albumin and plasma alpha-1 acid glycoprotein proteins are substantially bound (> 99 %) to Vemurafenib. With a 66 % inter-patient variability, the population's apparent volume of distribution is calculated to be 106 L.\n\n【114】**Metabolism:**\n\n【115】The mean data showed that Vemurafenib and its metabolites made up 95 % and 5 % of the components in plasma over 48 hours following oral administration of 960 mg of 14C-Vemurafenib, respectively.\n\n【116】**Elimination:**\n\n【117】Approximately 94 percent of the radioactive dose of 960 mg of 14C-Vemurafenib taken orally was retrieved in the feces, and just 1 % was recovered in the urine. With a 32 % inter-patient variability, the estimated apparent population clearance is 31 L/day. Vemurafenib's estimated median elimination half-life is 57 hours (the 5th and 95th percentile range are 30 to 120 hours).\n\n【118】**Non-clinical Toxicology:Mutagenesis, Carcinogenesis, and Fertility Impairment:**\n\n【119】Vemurafenib's potential to cause cancer has not been officially investigated. In clinical trials, Vemurafenib caused more patients to develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. In vitro experiments and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test, Vemurafenib did not result in genetic harm when examined. There have not been any specific studies with Vemurafenib in animals to assess the impact on fertility, but repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (roughly 0.6 and 1.6 times the human exposure and dogs at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day which is about 0.3 times the human therapeutic exposure.\n\n【120】**Animal Pharmacology or Toxicology -** Vemurafenib treatment in mice implanted with human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) cells resulted in a dose-dependent acceleration of the growth of the implanted tumors, which is consistent with the higher frequency of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients treated with the drug.\n\n【121】**Interaction With Other Drugs:**\n\n【122】**Vemurafenib's Response to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers:**\n\n【123】Since Vemurafenib is a CYP3A4 substrate, Vemurafenib plasma concentrations and toxicity may increase when potent CYP3A4 inhibitors are also used. Avoid taking Vemurafenib simultaneously as potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as Voriconazole, Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Clarithromycin, Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir, or Nelfinavir, and wherever possible, switch to an alternative medication.\n\n【124】Vemurafenib plasma concentrations were lowered when Vemurafenib was administered along with Rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, which may have impacted efficacy. Strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin, should not be administered with Vemurafenib; instead, substitute an alternative medication wherever practical. Increase the dose of Vemurafenib by 240 mg (one tablet) as tolerated if coadministration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer is necessary.\n\n【125】**Vemurafenib's Impact on CYP1A2 Substrates-** Tizanidine's systemic exposure was enhanced by 4.7 times when Vemurafenib and Tizanidine, a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate, were administered together. Avoid using Vemurafenib concurrently with medications with a limited therapeutic window and metabolized mainly by CYP1A2. If coadministration cannot be prevented, watch out for toxicities and consider lowering the dose of any concurrent CYP1A2 substrates.\n\n【126】**Ipilimumab Concurrent:**\n\n【127】Most patients who got Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib simultaneously saw an increase in transaminases and bilirubin.\n\n【128】**Vemurafenib's Impact on P-gp Substrates-** Digoxin is a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and coadministration of Vemurafenib enhanced Digoxin systemic exposure by 1.8 times. Avoid using P-gp substrates simultaneously; those are known to have limited therapeutic indices. If you must take these medications, consider lowering the dose of P-gp substrates.\n\n【129】**Usage of Vemurafenib in a Specific Population:**\n\n【130】**Use in Patients With Hepatic Impairment:**\n\n【131】The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib are affected by hepatic impairment, but this has not been examined in formal clinical research. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dosage change is advised for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The right dose of Vemurafenib has not yet been determined in individuals with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n【132】**Usage in Patients With Renal Impairment:**\n\n【133】Evaluation of the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib has not been done in formal clinical research. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dosage change is advised for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no defined Vemurafenib dosage for patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n【134】**Usage in Pregnant Patients:**\n\n【135】When given to a pregnant woman, Vemurafenib has the potential to harm the fetus due to its mode of action. Vemurafenib has been reported to pass through the placenta to a fetus, but there is no data on the usage of Vemurafenib in pregnant women to assess the drug's risk. Vemurafenib exposure at levels high enough to completely address its potential toxicity in pregnant women could not be accomplished in animals. Inform expectant mothers of the possibility of fetal damage.\n\n【136】For the indicated population(s), it is unknown what the baseline risks are for severe birth abnormalities and miscarriage. In rat fetuses at a dosage up to 250 mg/kg/day (roughly 1.3 times the clinical exposure at 960 milligrams twice daily based on AUC) and rabbit fetuses at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the clinical exposure at 960 mg twice daily found on AUC), Vemurafenib showed no evidence of developmental toxicity. Vemurafenib has the potential to be passed from the mother to the developing baby because fetal drug levels were 3 to 5 % of maternal levels.\n\n【137】**Usage in Children:**\n\n【138】Vemurafenib has not been proven to be safe or effective in pediatric patients. Six adolescents (15–17 years old) with metastatic or incurable melanoma and the BRAF V600 mutation were investigated with Vemurafenib. Vemurafenib dosages up to 960 mg twice daily were not enough to attain the maximum tolerable dose. There were no new warning signs of safety. These six teenage patients had steady-state vemurafenib exposures that were usually comparable to adults.\n\n【139】**Usage in Geriatric Patients:**\n\n【140】There were insufficient elderly participants in Vemurafenib clinical investigations to ascertain whether their responses differed from those of younger participants.\n\n【141】**Usage in Lactating Patients:**\n\n【142】There is no information on Vemurafenib's presence in human milk, its effects on nursing infants, or its impact on milk production. Encourage women not to breastfeed during treatment with Vemurafenib and for two weeks following the final dosage due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, including severe dermatologic reactions, QT prolongation, malignancy, hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, and ophthalmologic toxicity.\n\n【143】**Usage in Sexually Reproductive Females and Males:**\n\n【144】When given to a pregnant woman, Vemurafenib has the potential to harm the fetus due to its mode of action. Encourage women who are sexually active to use reliable contraception while taking Vemurafenib and for two weeks following the final dose.\n\n【145】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【146】无关删除-1:<u>*   ZELBORAF® (vemurafenib) tablet for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 2011  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2017/202429s016lbl.pdf\n*   Vemurafenib (Zelboraf)  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/vemurafenib\n*   SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS  \n    https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/zelboraf-epar-product-information\\_en.pdf\n*   Skin Cancer (Including Melanoma)  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin\n*   Vemurafenib  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a612009.html\n*   ZELBORAF® VEMURAFENIB  \n    https://www.gene.com/patients/medicines/zelboraf\n*   Vemurafenib  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535429/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ee6149b3-ee79-4f32-8581-1fead765800b", "title": "Rhythm Analysis for Cardiac Arrest", "text": "【0】Rhythm Analysis for Cardiac Arrest\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Cardiac arrests are heart emergencies in which the heart starts beating irregularly (irregular heart rhythms) and eventually stops beating. This abrupt heart function loss affects breathing and consciousness. It can also lead to death if emergency care is not provided. Prompt heart rhythm analysis, defibrillators, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can help restore normal heart rhythm and function.\n\n【2】What Happens in a Cardiac Arrest?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Various underlying heart conditions, heart tissue scars or damage, electrical abnormalities, thickened heart tissues, medications, drugs, and blood vessel abnormalities can result in sudden cardiac arrests. The electrical signal system of the heart begins to malfunction. This causes irregular heartbeats, also known as arrhythmias, which trigger cardiac arrest, and the heart unexpectedly stops beating. This is a medical emergency. The heart fails to pump blood to the body tissues and organs, including the brain and the lungs. Within seconds, the patient becomes unconscious and unresponsive and starts gasping for breath. Cardiac arrests lead to death within minutes if treatment is not initiated immediately.\n\n【4】What to Do if Someone Has a Cardiac Arrest?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Fluttering heart, weakness, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort may be seen before the patient collapses due to cardiac arrest. Sometimes cardiac arrest has no warning signs. We must suspect cardiac arrest if a person experiences the following:\n\n【6】*   Becomes unconscious or does not react, move, blink or speak (loss of responsiveness).\n\n【7】*   Gasps for breath or is not breathing.\n\n【8】*   Collapses unexpectedly.\n\n【9】*   Has no pulse.\n\n【10】In case of cardiac arrest, we must follow the following steps immediately till emergency service arrives to save the person:\n\n【11】1.  Check for the patient's response after ensuring scene safety.\n\n【12】2.  Call for help immediately (emergency medical services).\n\n【13】3.  Arrange for an automated external defibrillator (AED).\n\n【14】4.  Check the patient's breathing. If the person is not breathing or gasping, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with compression.\n\n【15】5.  Compress or push in the center of the patient’s chest (100 to 120 pushes per minute, around two inches deep). After every push, we must allow the chest to come back to its normal position.\n\n【16】6.  Check the patient’s airway and deliver rescue breaths every 30 compressions (if trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Just continue chest compressions if not trained.\n\n【17】7.  Use the automated external defibrillator for rhythm check and shock delivery and continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation until help arrives.\n\n【18】What Are the Heart Rhythms Seen in Cardiac Arrest?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The heart rhythms must be monitored in cardiac arrest to manage the patient accordingly. There are some types of heart rhythms that require shock (defibrillation) and some rhythms that do not require shock administration. Quick, immediate action based on the heart rhythm is necessary to manage cardiac arrests. There are four basic types of heart rhythm seen in cardiac arrests:\n\n【20】1.  **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF):** This type of rhythm, also known as V-Fib, is the most serious in cardiac arrests. There are disorganized electrical impulses in the heart muscles. The muscles of the heart’s lower chambers or ventricles begin to flutter or fibrillate instead of beating normally. The heart beats with a rapid and erratic rhythm. As a result, the heart finds it difficult to pump blood, causing cardiac arrest.\n\n【21】2.  **Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) start to beat fast or with rapid rhythmic contractions. As a result, the heart beats too fast to pump blood.\n\n【22】3.  **Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)**: The heart is not able to beat sufficiently to produce a detectable pulse.\n\n【23】4.  **Asystole:** This rhythm indicates the absence of electrical activity in the heart.\n\n【24】How Is Cardiac Arrest Managed Based on Heart Rhythm Analysis?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Cardiac rhythm analysis helps guide the management of cardiac arrest emergencies. The interruptions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be kept as short as possible. The key is to stop only for heart rhythm analysis and pulse check and to administer a shock if needed between the chest compressions. The four rhythms seen in cardiac arrest are divided into two groups - shockable and non-shockable rhythms. The electrocardiogram (ECG) helps distinguish between these rhythms. Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are cardiac rhythms that can be reversed by defibrillation or shock. Pulseless electrical activity and asystole (when the heart stops completely, no electrical activity) do not require shock during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the heart rhythm changes frequently. The management must be modified based on the rhythm immediately.\n\n【26】How Are the Non-shockable Rhythms Managed in Cardiac Arrest?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The heart rhythms such as asystole and pulseless electrical activity do not require defibrillation or shock. In such a case, cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be performed immediately with rhythm analysis every two minutes. This is continued till we attain an organized heart rhythm. The pulse is then checked every two minutes of chest compressions. Quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be continued till we attain a pulse. Drugs such as Vasopressors to increase blood flow to the heart and brain are administered, and airway management interventions are initiated to improve the chance of the return to spontaneous circulation (normal blood flow).\n\n【28】What Are Defibrillators?\n------------------------\n\n【29】Defibrillators are devices that are used to deliver electric shocks (defibrillation) through the chest to the heart of a person with shockable rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The electrical shock or defibrillation helps to stop the irregular rhythm of the heart and restarts the heart with a regular organized rhythm or normal heartbeat. Defibrillation, along with immediate chest compression, must be initiated quickly within the first three to ten minutes of cardiac arrest. The person’s chance of surviving drops by seven to ten percent for every minute a normal heartbeat is not restored. There are two basic types of defibrillators used during an emergency. These are:\n\n【30】1.  **Automated External Defibrillators (AED):** These are portable, small, and lightweight devices that are used to deliver an electric shock to the heart through the chest. These can be used by anyone with little training. These devices can be used at home and are found in schools and public places so that the resuscitation process can be initiated immediately following a cardiac arrest. These devices automatically perform the heart rhythm analysis, so the operators do not need to read or interpret the patient’s heart rhythm. They are automated and detect irregular heart rhythms. They deliver controlled shock to the patients with shockable rhythms. In the case of non-shockable rhythms, no shock is delivered by the device.\n\n【31】2.  **Manual Defibrillators:** These are used by medical professionals trained in advanced cardiac life support. They offer greater control and customization (of the shock delivered). In addition, they can be connected to other medical devices to monitor blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, and carbon dioxide exhaled. They can also provide pulses of current that help the heart contract and restore normal heart rhythm.\n\n【32】How to Use Automated External Defibrillators?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation has to be performed in case of cardiac arrest. The automated external defibrillators automatically analyze the heart rhythm, and it has to be performed every two minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In case the device detects shockable rhythms, it will charge spontaneously and prompt the operator to clear when it delivers the shock. After defibrillation, the chest compressions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation have to be resumed for another two minutes, and the process has to be continued until the heartbeat is back to normal or emergency help arrives.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Cardiac arrests are life-threatening emergencies that require immediate medical attention. Heart rhythm-based management of cardiac arrest helps restore the normal regular heartbeat and pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be initiated by lay rescuers with the help of automated external defibrillators. These automated devices perform rhythm analysis and initiate shock delivery for shockable rhythms. Electrical shocks with chest compressions have to be initiated as soon as possible and must be continued until emergency help arrives.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   What is Cardiac Arrest?  \n    https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest/about-cardiac-arrest\n*   Cardiac Arrest vs. Heart Attack  \n    https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cardiac-arrest-vs-heart-attack\n*   What Is Cardiac Arrest?  \n    https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cardiac-arrest\n*   Rhythm Analysis during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Past, Present, and Future  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910663/\n*   American Heart Association Guidelines  \n    https://cpr.heart.org/-/media/CPR-Files/CPR-Guidelines-Files/Highlights/Hghlghts\\_2020\\_ECC\\_Guidelines\\_English.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d020608d-7aa9-431d-b883-223aae77a4fe", "title": "Sunitinib - Uses, Dosage, Efficacy, Side Effects, Precautions, and Warnings", "text": "【0】Sunitinib - Uses, Dosage, Efficacy, Side Effects, Precautions, and Warnings\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Sunitinib is an anti-cancer medication that comes as a capsule to be administered orally. It is a small-molecule and multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that received its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of various conditions in January 2006. The conditions include renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor that is Imatinib-resistant. Sunitinib is considered the first cancer medication that got its approval concurrently for two distinct indications. Sunitinib has been available as a generic medicine since August 2021 in the United States.\n\n【2】**Uses of Sunitinib:**\n\n【3】*   **Renal Cell Carcinoma**: Renal cell carcinoma, sometimes called renal cell adenocarcinoma or renal cell cancer, is the most common form of kidney cancer. About nine out of ten cases of kidney cancers can be renal cell carcinomas. Cancer generally develops as a single tumor and could affect both kidneys in the latter stages. The tumor begins in the cells that line the tubules of the kidney. Here, tubules are the tiny tubes that aid in returning the fluid and nutrients back to the bloodstream.\n\n【4】*   **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor:** It is a form of cancer beginning in any part of the digestive system. But, it commonly occurs in the stomach and small intestine. They are the cancerous conditions that begin in the special nerve cells present in the wall of the digestive tract and associated organs. It is considered the most common mesenchymal tumor to develop in the digestive tract. They are rare, accounting for less than one percent of total gastrointestinal tumors.\n\n【5】*   **Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors:** Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, also referred to as islet cell tumors, are the less common tumors that begin in the pancreas. These tumors form in the hormone-producing cells called the islet cells. These cancers grow at gradual degrees and can potentially metastasize to other parts of the body. There is a range of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, all of which possess different types of signs and symptoms.\n\n【6】How Does Sunitinib Work?\n------------------------\n\n【7】Sunitinib is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in individuals who are not treated successfully with the drug Imatinib or for individuals who are not able to take Imatinib. Sunitinib is also used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. In addition, it is used in the prevention of the recurrence of renal cell carcinoma in individuals who have RCC but are not metastasized and with a history of kidney removal. Sunitinib is also used for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in individuals in whom the tumors have progressed, and the surgical intervention does not seem to work. Sunitinib belongs to a class of drugs called kinase inhibitors. This medication works by blocking the abnormal protein and its action that help in signaling the cancer cells to multiply. So this results in inhibiting or slowing down the spread of cancer cells, causing the tumor to shrink.\n\n【8】What Are the Warnings and Precautions for Sunitinib?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The medicine Sunitinib possesses good needs as well as certain unwanted effects in specified populations or clinical conditions. So, the following should be taken into consideration before taking the medication.\n\n【10】*   **Allergies**: This medication can induce hypersensitivity reactions in patients allergic to this drug. So, one should inform the doctor in case one has a previous history of allergy to Sunitinib or any other medication. Addedly, convey to the doctor if one has other non-medical allergies such as dyes, foods, preservatives, and animal products.\n\n【11】*   **Pediatrics**: Adequate studies have not been performed so far in demonstrating the use and efficacy of Sunitinib in the pediatric population. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of Sunitinib have not been acclaimed in children.\n\n【12】*   **Geriatrics:** The appropriate clinical studies fail to determine the geriatric-related problems associated with Sunitinib that could limit the use of this medication in the elderly.\n\n【13】*   **Breastfeeding**: There are not sufficient studies conducted to determine the risk of Sunitib in infants when administered during the breastfeeding period. Hence, the doctors weigh and compare the potential benefits of Sunitinib against the possible risks and complications before the initiation of Sunitinib treatment in breastfeeding states.\n\n【14】*   **Pregnancy:** This medication can harm the unborn infant while using this during pregnancy. It can also cause birth defects if the partner or the child’s father uses this medicine during the pregnancy of the mother. So, female patients are advised to use effective birth control aids during and four weeks after treatment. Male patients are advised to use effective birth control aids during and seven weeks following the last dose.\n\n【15】**Important Precautions and Considerations:**\n\n【16】*   Sunitinib medication is known to cause serious heart ailments such as heart failure, heart attack, and cardiomyopathy. Inform right away if one experiences symptoms concerning heart problems like chest pain, dilated neck veins, dizziness, abnormal breathing, irregular heartbeat, daintiness, arm pain, nausea, sweating, tightness in the chest, or discomfort.\n\n【17】*   The person under Sunitinib treatment can see the blood pressure getting too high. In addition, the person might feel daintiness, dizziness, or feel a fast, pounding heartbeat. So, seek professional help in case of increased blood pressure with this medicine.\n\n【18】*   This medicine is known to raise the risk of bleeding and induce delayed wound healing. So, one should see the healthcare providers if any unusual bleeding, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine, bruising, or pinpoint red spots in the skin are noticed.\n\n【19】*   It is vital to check with the doctor before getting any dental treatment or surgeries and before taking bisphosphonates like Alendronate, Risedronate, and Ibandronate.\n\n【20】*   This medicine is known to cause serious jaw problems. So, inform the doctor if one has jaw pain, jaw tightness, swelling, pain, or tooth loss.\n\n【21】*   Thrombotic microangiopathy, a condition causing damage in the smaller blood vessels, can occur with this medication. So, inform the doctor straight away if one has tiredness, fever, loss of vision, seizure, or confusion.\n\n【22】*   Sunitinib medication can cause serious skin reactions such as necrotizing fasciitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. So, report to the doctor if facing any of these skin concerns: blistering, peeling, red skin lesions, severe acne, skin rash, sores or ulcers, and loss of the tightness of the skin. The other symptoms include fever, chills, weakness, and tiredness.\n\n【23】*   A rare yet serious brain disorder called reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) can occur with this medicine. The symptoms include blurred vision, back pain, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, fever, seizures, confusion, and abnormal tiredness.\n\n【24】*   Thyroid problems such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can occur with this medicine, according to clinical findings. One should inform the doctor in case of experiencing these symptoms, such as nervousness, heat sensitivity, weight loss, difficulty sleeping, constipation, mood declines, dry skin and hair, hair loss, hoarseness of voice, joint stiffness, muscle cramps, weight gain, husky voice, and unusual weakness.\n\n【25】*   The medicine might also induce hypoglycemia (low blood sugar states). Inform the doctor right away if one detect any changes in the blood sugar level or experience symptoms like sweating, trembling, shaking, pounding heartbeat, hunger, lightheartedness, or faintness.\n\n【26】*   Moreover, contact healthcare professionals if one feels abnormal or if there are any changes in the heart rhythm. Also, one should inform the doctor in case of a history of heart rhythm problems like QT prolongation.\n\n【27】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【28】What Is Renal Cell Carcinoma?\n-----------------------------\n\n【29】Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a cancerous condition of the kidney originating in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a portion of smaller tubules in the kidney that is responsible for the transport of urine (filtration). So, RCC occurs as a result of unconstrained growth and proliferation of cancer cells in the lining of the tubules part of the kidney. It is the most prevailing form of cancer occurring in adults, accounting for about 90 to 95 % of cases. Males are more likely to have this cancerous condition than females. It is also referred to as renal adenocarcinoma, renal cancer, kidney cancer, or hypernephroma. The signs and symptoms of renal cell carcinoma include the following.\n\n【30】*   A lump in the abdomen region.\n\n【31】*   Blood in the urine.\n\n【32】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【33】*   Fatigue.\n\n【34】*   Vision concerns.\n\n【35】*   Excessive hair growth.\n\n【36】*   Persistent pain in the affected area.\n\n【37】How Serious Is Renal Cell Carcinoma?\n------------------------------------\n\n【38】There is no exact cause for the development of renal cell carcinoma. But the scientific researchers say that certain risk factors, including dialysis treatment, obesity, hypertension, family history of RCC, cigarette smoking, polycystic kidney disease, chronic abuse of certain medications, or a genetic condition called Von Hippel-Lindsay disease could increase the risk. It is a serious disease that can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Nevertheless, early diagnosis and intervention are considered key to making the condition more likely to be cured. So, it can be efficiently treated when the tumor is still localized to the kidney and the closely surrounding structures. The probability of cure and the prognosis of the condition is directly connected to the degree or stage of tumor dissemination.\n\n【39】How Does Sunitinib Help Treat Renal Cell Carcinoma?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Sunitinib sorts with a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. They work by blocking the type of enzyme called kinase in the system. The body contains various forms of kinase. But, renal cell carcinoma results when the abnormal protein kinase signals and help the cancer cells to grow and multiply in the lining of the tubules on the kidney. So, Sunitinib performs its action by blocking the abnormal protein kinase and its action from helping cancer cells to multiply. As a result, the spread of cancer cells in renal cell carcinoma is either halted or slowed, leading to the shrinkage of the tumor.\n\n【41】How to Use Sunitinib Medication?\n--------------------------------\n\n【42】*   Sunitinib medication comes as a capsule that is to be taken orally.\n\n【43】*   It is available in various dosages, so the doctors advise the appropriate dosage depending on the age factors, the condition to be treated, and the severity of the condition.\n\n【44】*   For the renal cell carcinoma treatment, the dosage recommendation of Sunitinib is once a day for four weeks, followed by a two-week drug-free period before the initiation of the next dosing cycle and reparations every six weeks as far as the prescription.\n\n【45】*   For renal cell carcinoma prevention, the recommendation is generally once daily for four weeks, followed by a two-week drug-free period prior to the beginning of the subsequent dosing schedule and repeating every six weeks to make up nine cycles.\n\n【46】*   So, one should follow the doctor’s instructions and manufacturer's label information conscientiously.\n\n【47】*   One should take Sunitinib medication exactly as directed. Take the drug around the same time each day.\n\n【48】**Things to Consider and Inform the Doctor:**\n\n【49】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【50】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-2:<u>Adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Renal Cell Carcinoma - An Overview</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>Pyoderma Gangrenosum - Causes, Types, Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-2:<u>Partial Nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma - An Overview</u>\n\n【54】*   Inform the doctor prior to the treatment if one is allergic to Sunitinib or any other ingredients of the prescribed medication.

According to the evaluation of Sunitinib for its inhibitory action against multiple kinases, it was observed that Sunitinib inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors, stem cell factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, colony-stimulating factor receptor of type 1, FMS-like tyrosine kinase, and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor. The inhibition activity of Sunitinib of these receptor tyrosine kinases has been signified in the cellular and biochemical assays while the inhibitory action on function has been signified in the cell proliferation assays. The primary active metabolite of Sunitinib exerts potency similar to Sunitinib in cellular and biochemical assays.\n\n【134】**Absorption:**\n\n【135】*   The maximum plasma concentration (C max) of Sunitinib after an oral administration is observed to be between 6 and 12 hours.\n\n【136】*   Sunitinib can be taken with or without no food since food does not present any significant effect on the bioavailability of this drug.\n\n【137】*   The clinical findings validate that the pharmacokinetics of Sunitinib was similar in healthy individuals and people with solid tumor such as renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\n\n【138】**Distribution:**\n\n【139】*   The apparent volume of distribution is 2230 L for Sunitinib.\n\n【140】*   The binding potency of Sunitinib and its primary metabolite with human plasma protein was 95 and 99 percent in vitro.\n\n【141】**Metabolism:**\n\n【142】*   The drug sunitinib undergoes well metabolism to produce its primary active metabolite by CYP3A4, a cytochrome P450 enzyme.\n\n【143】*   The primary active metabolite, in turn, undergoes further metabolism by CYP3A4.\n\n【144】*   The primary active metabolite of Sunitinib makes up between 23 and 37 percent of the total exposure.\n\n【145】*   Following a radiolabeled dose, Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are chiefly detected in the plasma esteeming for about 92 percent of the radioactivity.\n\n【146】**Elimination:**\n\n【147】*   The primary route of elimination of Sunitinib is through feces.\n\n【148】*   A human mass balance study validates that approximately 16 percent of the administered dose was traced in the urine and 61 percent of the dose in feces, following a radiolabeled dose of Sunitinib.\n\n【149】*   Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are the significant compounds detected in the urine, accounting for about 86 and 74 percent of radioactivity consecutively.\n\n【150】**Half-Life and Clearance:**\n\n【151】*   The terminal half-life of Sunitinib is approximately 40 to 60 hours, and the primary active metabolite is about 80 to 110 hours following a single dose of Sunitinib administration in healthy individuals.\n\n【152】*   The total oral clearance is about 34 to 62 L/h.\n\n【153】**Toxicity:**\n\n【154】*   The clinical findings say that the maximally tolerated dose of Sunitinib for animals such as mice, rats, and dogs is a sum greater than 500 mg/kg when at oral administration.\n\n【155】*   The maximally tolerated dose in the case of non-human primates is higher than 1200 mg/kg.\n\n【156】**Dosing of Sunitinib:**\n\n【157】**Renal Cell Carcinoma:**\n\n【158】*   Sunitinib is indicated for the treatment of advanced forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and as the adjuvant treatment of individuals at higher risk of recurrent RCC after nephrectomy.\n\n【159】*   The recommended dosage for renal cell carcinoma is 50 mg per day for about four weeks; then, two weeks could be drug-free, and the cycle has to be repeated.\n\n【160】*   The recommended dosage for the adjuvant intervention of RCC is 50 mg once per day on a four weeks schedule followed by two weeks off schedule. Nine six-week cycles make up the total duration.\n\n【161】*   The dosage is continued until the disease progresses or has unacceptable toxicity.\n\n【162】**Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor:**\n\n【163】*   The medication is indicated for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treatment after disease progression with intolerance to Imatinib mesylate.\n\n【164】*   The dosage is 50 mg once each day for four weeks, with two weeks drug-free and followed by a resume of the cycle.\n\n【165】*   Continue the dosage until any unacceptable toxicity or progression of the disease.\n\n【166】**Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor:**\n\n【167】*   The recommended Sunitinib dosage for the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is 37.5 mg orally to be taken each day persistently without any off-therapy period.\n\n【168】*   So, no drug-free weeks in adjacent weeks.\n\n【169】*   Continue the dosage up until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n【170】**Dosage Modifications and Considerations**\n\n【171】**For Adverse Reactions:**\n\n【172】Dosage modifications can be done according to the adverse reactions and their severity.\n\n【173】**Hepatotoxicity:**\n\n【174】Sunitinib is known to cause severe degrees of hepatotoxicity, resulting in liver failure. The signs of liver failure include jaundice, increased transaminase, and hyperbilirubinemia that is accompanied by coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or renal failure. Therefore, monitor liver function tests for alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase before initiation of Sunitinib therapy.\n\n【175】*   For grade 3 hepatotoxicity, withhold the treatment until resolving to less than grade 1 or baseline. Moreover, discontinue permanently in case of recurring grade 3 hepatotoxicity.\n\n【176】*   For grade 4, permanently discontinue the treatment.\n\n【177】**Cardiovascular Events:**\n\n【178】Cardiovascular events have been reported with Sunitinib treatment that includes cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia and some were fatal. Monitor conscientiously the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure in individuals who are at higher risk. One should consider the baseline and periodic assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\n\n【179】*   It is recommended to permanently discontinue the treatment for the underlying clinical manifestation of congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\n【180】*   In cases of asymptomatic cardiomyopathy, if LVEF is greater than 20 percent, but less than 50 percent, below baseline or below the lower limit of normal (LLN), or if the baseline is not obtained, withhold until it is resolved to grade less than 1 or baseline. Then, resume the treatment with a reduced dose.\n\n【181】**Hypertension:**\n\n【182】Clinical findings show that nearly 29 percent of adults treated with Sunitinib for various conditions presented with hypertension. Monitor individuals for hypertension and recommend standard antihypertensive therapy if required. Temporary suspension of Sunitinib therapy is recommended up until hypertension is resolved. Subsequently, consider permanent discontinuation of treatment in grade 4 hypertension.\n\n【183】**Hemorrhagic Events:**\n\n【184】Hemorrhagic events have been reported with post-marketing experience and were fatal at times. This included respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, brain, and tumor-related hemorrhages.\n\n【185】*   In grades 3 and 4, consider withholding treatment until resolves to a grade less than one or baseline.\n\n【186】*   Resume the Sunitinib treatment with a reduced dose or consider discontinuation of treatment depending upon the adverse reaction and its severity.\n\n【187】**Thrombotic Microangiopathy:**\n\n【188】Thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported with Sunitinib treatment in clinical trials and as a post-marketing experience. This included hemolytic Turkic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, resulting in renal failure or a fatal consequence. Discontinuation of Sunitinib treatment is strictly recommended in individuals developing or having any grade of thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n【189】**Proteinuria and Nephrotic Syndrome:**\n\n【190】Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome have also been reported with Sunitinib treatment; some of these conditions have turned out to be fatal. Monitor for the development or progression of Proteinuria in patients. So, consider baseline and periodic urine analyses during therapy.\n\n【191】*   Withhold the treatment and resume with a reduced dosage for 24-hour urine protein greater than or equal to three grams.\n\n【192】*   Permanently discontinue the treatment for nephrotic syndrome or recurrent episodes of proteinuria with less than three grams, regardless of dose reductions.\n\n【193】**Dermatological Toxicities:**\n\n【194】Severe degrees of cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), necrotizing fasciitis, and erythema multiforme, have been reported. Some of these conditions were fatal. Consider discontinuation of treatment in cases of the presence of any signs and symptoms of these conditions.\n\n【195】**Thyroid Dysfunction:**\n\n【196】Hyperthyroidism cases, sometimes even hypothyroidism, have been reported in clinical trials. Hence, baseline laboratory assessment of thyroid function should be considered. Individuals with underlying hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism should be according to the standard medical norms before the initiation of Sunitinib treatment. Also, monitor conscientiously for the signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunctions.\n\n【197】**Hypoglycemia:**\n\n【198】Asymptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in about two percent of individuals treated with Sunitinib therapy in clinical trials. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly before, during, and after the discontinuation of Sunitinib treatment.\n\n【199】**Osteonecrosis of the Jaw:**\n\n【200】Osteonecrosis of the jaw is one of the consequences observed in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of Sunitinib. Advise preventive dentistry measures prior to treatment since concurrent exposure to dental diseases and bisphosphonates could increase its risks. Consider avoiding dental procedures during the treatment. The avoidance of dental procedures during Sunitinib treatment should be strictly followed in cases of individuals receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy.\n\n【201】**Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome:**\n\n【202】Discontinuation of Sunitinib treatment is recommended in any degree of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.\n\n【203】**Impaired Wound Healing:**\n\n【204】There prevail certain cases of impaired wound healing during Sunitinib treatment. Temporary discontinuity is recommended for precautionary measures in individuals undergoing major surgical interventions. The resume resolution should be considered depending upon the recovery from surgical intervention.\n\n【205】**Renal Impairment:**\n\n【206】*   No dosage modification is required in the case of any degree of renal impairment in individuals who are not on dialysis.\n\n【207】*   For individuals with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, no modification in the initial dose is required. However, Sunitinib exposure is about 47 percent lower in individuals with end-stage renal disease on dialysis than the exposure in normal healthy individuals. Therefore, a gradual dose increase is required based on tolerability.\n\n【208】**Hepatic Impairment:**\n\n【209】*   For mild to moderate cases, dosage modification might not be required for the starting dose, but subsequent doses should be monitored.\n\n【210】*   The safety and tolerability of Sunitib in severe cases of hepatic impairment have not been studied.\n\n【211】**What Are the Possible Drug Interactions of Sunitinib?**\n\n【212】The drug Sunitinib interacts with several drugs presenting certain adverse reactions. This drug is considered to be contraindicated with six drugs and is known to show serious interaction with about 111 drugs. Moreover, safety and tolerability are to be monitored closely when Sunitinib is used in conjugation with about 170 drugs. The drug even shows minor interactions with six drugs.\n\n【213】The drug Sunitinib is contraindicated with the following drugs-\n\n【214】*   Dronedarone.\n\n【215】*   Lefamulin.\n\n【216】*   Posaconazole.\n\n【217】*   Saquinavir.\n\n【218】*   Thioridazine.\n\n【219】*   Fluconazole.\n\n【220】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【221】无关删除-1:<u>*   Sunitinib Malate  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/sunitinibmalate\n*   SUTENT (sunitinib) capsules  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2011/021938s13s17s18lbl.pdf\n*   Sunitinib: Ten Years of Successful Clinical Use and Study in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313263/\n*   Sunitinib (Sutent, SU11248), a Small-Molecule Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Blocks Function of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters P-Glycoprotein (ABCB1) and ABCG2  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680522/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These pollutants are different in size. The finer these chemical compounds, the faster they can reach the lungs. This topic describes the air pollutants, the symptoms associated with air pollution exposure, the population at high risk of developing respiratory diseases, and the steps involved to overcome respiratory diseases.\n\n【2】What Is Air Pollution?\n----------------------\n\n【3】When the air we breathe gets polluted with smog or other particulate matter, it is called air pollution. When people inhale polluted air, it can cause serious respiratory problems. The effects can be acute or chronic on the respiratory system. Some of the common pollutants that can affect the respiratory tract are ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Further, they are divided into two types of air pollutants.\n\n【4】*   **Ground-level Smog:** It forms when the volatile compounds react with the nitrous oxide in the sunlight. These volatile compounds get produced from the engine exhausts. And nitrous oxide forms when the combustion occurs in oxygen and nitrogen occurs.\n\n【5】*   **Particulate Matter:** These are very fine or tiny particles formed on combustion of wood, power plant, or engine fuels. It is called soot.\n\n【6】How Does Air Pollution Affect the Respiratory System?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The changes in the respiratory system vary from acute to chronic when exposed to pollutants. There can be minor changes to major changes in the respiratory tract and cases of heart diseases, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections also develop from air pollution. However, air pollution can also worsen pre-existing heart and lung diseases. Even long-term exposure to air pollutants can decrease the life expectancy of people.\n\n【8】There are different sizes of particulate matter (pollutants). These different types of particulate matter affect different parts of the respiratory tract. The finer the particle, the more easily it can reach the deep respiratory system. At the same time, the ultrafine particles reach the bloodstream.\n\n【9】The pollutant particles present in the air can get deposited in the respiratory tract. The high water solubility particles get attached to the upper respiratory tract in the nasal cavity, but the particles like ozone (a type of gas) can get deposited to the bronchi and the tracheal tube, where the low solubility particles like nitrogen dioxide get deposited to the alveoli and the bronchioles.\n\n【10】So basically, there are three regions in which the particles get deposited. The nasal cavity, the tracheobronchial, and the alveolar region.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Air Pollution Exposure?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The common respiratory symptoms associated with air pollutants are:\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Air Pollution and Skin Aging</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Effects of Climate Change on Our Health</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Air Pollution and Respiratory Diseases - An Overview</u>\n\n【18】*   Non-allergic rhinitis.\n\n【19】*   Nasal mucosal erythema.\n\n【20】*   Sinusitis.\n\n【21】*   Nasal itchiness.\n\n【22】*   Runny nose.\n\n【23】*   Nasal congestion.\n\n【24】*   Sneezing.\n\n【25】*   Dry mouth.\n\n【26】*   Throat.\n\n【27】*   Productive cough.\n\n【28】*   Dry cough.\n\n【29】*   Wheezing.\n\n【30】*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\n【31】*   Bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the bronchi).\n\n【32】The patient may suffer from nose and throat irritation in cases of asthma.\n\n【33】What Is the Respiratory Problem Associated With the Air Pollutant?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   Lung inflammation.\n\n【35】*   Asthma (a respiratory condition, where the airways become narrow, inflamed, and produce mucus leading to breathing difficulty).\n\n【36】*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a group of lung disease that blocks lungs’ airflow leading to breathing difficulty).\n\n【37】Who Are at High Risk of Respiratory Problems From Air Pollutants?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The people who are at higher risk of developing respiratory problems from the air pollutant are,\n\n【39】*   **Children:** Children who are living in highly polluted cities or towns are more likely to get respiratory problems from air pollutants. They suffer from cough, wheezing, and impaired lung function. Children have a faster breathing rate, so they intake more air per unit area than adults. Hence, leading them to get exposed to more air pollutants. And they play outside for a long time, leading to more air pollutant exposure.\n\n【40】*   **Babies:** Babies who are low birth weight or are associated with preterm birth are more susceptible to respiratory problems. They can develop asthma, rhinitis, and eczema very easily. Even during pregnancy, when the mother is exposed to harmful pollutants, it can cause a negative impact on the baby's respiratory health.\n\n【41】*   **Old Age People:** Sometimes, old aged people can easily develop respiratory or pulmonary, or cardiovascular diseases. This in turn can develop reduced lung functioning.\n\n【42】*   **Pre-Existing Conditions:** The people who are already affected by the previous medical conditions are more affected by air pollution, which leads to other respiratory diseases like asthma or COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n\n【43】How Does the Respiratory Tract Protect From Air Pollutants?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The respiratory tract has a nasal cavity with hairs and the tracheobronchial region with the ciliated mucosa. The nasal cavity can easily grab the coarser form of the particles. But the fine particle is grabbed by the ciliated mucosa present in the tracheobronchial region. This ciliated mucosa produces mucus, which causes the bacteria and virus to get entrapped into the mucus. It is a mucociliary clearance mechanism of the respiratory tract that can moisten the particle by mucus and further leads to expelling the particles out of the nose.\n\n【45】Phagocytosis is a mechanism initiated by the macrophages present in the respiratory tract. Mostly, the alveolar macrophages use this phagocytosis to remove foreign particles from the body. But everyday exposure to such heavy compounds can lead to a burden on the defense mechanisms.\n\n【46】How to Manage Respiratory Diseases in Air Pollutant Areas?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】*   People should try to avoid traffic areas.\n\n【48】*   People should also go for more green areas filled with trees and bushes for work or relaxation.\n\n【49】*   Try to spend less time in polluted areas.\n\n【50】*   Wearing nasal filters.\n\n【51】*   Wearing a mask and respirators.\n\n【52】*   Installing air filters and purifiers in the house.\n\n【53】*   If symptoms like rhinitis, running nose, and cough develop, then go for saline sprays, decongestant medication, and cough suppressants and expectorants.\n\n【54】*   People should also take vitamins A, C, and E in their diet.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】Air pollutants are volatile compounds of various sizes and they can be coarse to fine. As they are fine, they can reach the alveoli swiftly and deep into the respiratory tracts. But even if they are coarse, they accumulate over the nasal cavity. The air pollutant can further cause respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The respiratory system also shows a defense mechanism against air pollutants getting trapped. However, these air pollutants are basically affecting people every day and can burden the defense mechanism, and dread to lower their effect against these harmful toxins. People should manage the effects of air pollution to protect themselves from respiratory diseases by wearing masks, practicing breathing exercises in a clean, open space for better respiratory health.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   UNDERSTANDING AIR POLLUTION  \n    https://resphealth.org/clean-air/understanding-air-pollution/\n*   Air pollution and chronic airway diseases: what should people know and do?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740163/\n*   Air Pollution and Chronic Airway Diseases: What Should  \n    https://www.zhl.org.in/blog/air-pollution-and-chronic-airway-diseases-what-should-people-know-and-do/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "80904864-bbd9-4085-85b2-ed88555fae2b", "title": "Periimplantitis - An Overview", "text": "【0】Periimplantitis - An Overview\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Dental implants are creating a new revolution in the field of dentistry. Crowns, bridges, and dentures are replaced with implants for superior aesthetics and quality. Although dental implants are expensive, they offer an excellent finish and long-term validity. As a result, implants are now considered a treatment of choice for replacing a missing tooth. Additionally, dental implants have several advantages over conventional options. However, like all other dental prostheses, implants are prone to infections. In addition, they are affected by a condition known as periimplantitis.\n\n【2】What Is Periimplantitis?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Periimplantitis is characterized by infection, inflammation, and destruction of the tissues around the implant. It is known as peri-implant mucositis if the implant's soft tissues (gums and the oral mucosa) are affected. Likewise, if the hard tissue (bone) around the implant is inflamed, it is called periimplantitis. However, the two terms can be used interchangeably. Periimplantitis is caused by a bacterial infection that leads to inflammation of the tissues around the implant. Additionally, several risk factors contribute to the occurrence of periimplantitis.\n\n【4】What Causes Periimplantitis?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】Besides the associated risk factors, bacteria are the main culprits behind periimplantitis. The species of bacteria that cause periimplantitis are:\n\n【6】*   Prevotella intermedia.\n\n【7】*   Prevotella nigrescens.\n\n【8】*   Streptococcus constellatus.\n\n【9】*   Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.\n\n【10】*   Porphyromonas gingivalis.\n\n【11】*   Treponema denticola.\n\n【12】*   Tannereall forsythia.\n\n【13】What Are the Risk Factors Associated With Periimplantitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The common risk factors associated with the occurrence of periimplantitis are:\n\n【15】*   Smoking.\n\n【16】*   Previous history of severe gum infection (periodontitis).\n\n【17】*   Poor oral hygiene.\n\n【18】*   Immunocompromised conditions like diabetes, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), etc.\n\n【19】*   Cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【20】*   History of implant failure.\n\n【21】*   Quality of area of the implant (lack of healthy gums and poor bone density).\n\n【22】*   Iatrogenic causes.\n\n【23】*   Overloading the dental implant with stress.\n\n【24】*   Poor quality of implant material or faulty technique.\n\n【25】How Commonly Does Periimplantitis Occur?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   The prevalence rate of periimplantitis is estimated to be around 56 percent.\n\n【27】*   Implants have a success rate of around 82 percent, even after 16 years of implant placement.\n\n【28】*   Some studies have shown the incidence of periimplantitis in the range of 5 to 63 percent.\n\n【29】*   10 to 50 percent of implants show signs of periimplantitis after ten years.\n\n【30】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Periimplantitis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The Symptoms of Periimplantitis Include:\n\n【32】1\\. Red and swollen gums around the implant.\n\n【33】2\\. Bleeding around the implant while brushing.\n\n【34】3\\. Wobbling or loose implant.\n\n【35】4\\. Bad breath or halitosis.\n\n【36】5\\. Foul taste while eating.\n\n【37】6\\. Sometimes, the patient might experience mild pain.\n\n【38】7\\. Pus discharge from the tissues around the implant.\n\n【39】**Clinical Signs of Periimplantitis:**\n\n【40】1. **Bleeding on Probing** - When the doctor examines the gums around the implant using an instrument called a dental probe, the gums start to bleed or show pus discharge.\n\n【41】2\\. **Hyperplasia of the Gingiva** - Gums appear swollen and enlarged on examination due to inflammation.\n\n【42】3\\. **Pocket Formation or Gum Recession** - When the dentist runs a probe around the implant, the probe tends to go deeper, suggesting bone or gum loss due to periimplantitis.\n\n【43】4\\. **Erythema of the Gums** - The area around the implant appears red on examination, indicating inflammation of the tissues.\n\n【44】5\\. **Bone Loss** - On an X-ray, the bone loss around the implant suggests periimplantitis.\n\n【45】How Is Periimplantitis Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【46】The diagnosis of Periimplantitis can be established with the following steps:\n\n【47】1\\. **Case History** - The clinician will ask a series of questions related to the implant’s placement pre-operative and post-operative status, history of symptoms, etc. Additionally, the patient’s systemic condition, habit, personal history, and overall health status are noted down.\n\n【48】2\\. **Clinical Examination** - It is crucial for diagnosing periimplantitis as it can reveal signs of periimplantitis. The dentist will look for signs like bleeding on probing, implant mobility, bone loss, gingival recession, and other signs of inflammation (red and swollen gingiva).\n\n【49】3\\. **X-Rays** - A radiograph of the implant and the surrounding bone appears distorted with periimplantitis. Bone loss can be seen around the implant compared to other regions of the oral cavity.\n\n【50】What Is the Treatment of Periimplantitis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【51】The treatment of periimplantitis involves -\n\n【52】A. **Scaling or Curettage**: This involves debridement of the implant surface with a piezoelectric or manual scaler. The procedure significantly decreases the microbial load and reduces the signs of inflammation. The treatment can be provided with Teflon, carbon, plastic, and titanium curettes.\n\n【53】B. **Pharmacological Therapy**: The doctor might prescribe an antiseptic mouth rinse like Chlorhexidine or Betadine to reduce the microbial load. Additionally, topical or systemic antibiotics might be given depending on the extent of the condition. The commonly prescribed antibiotics are -\n\n【54】*   Tetracycline.\n\n【55】*   Doxycycline.\n\n【56】*   Amoxicillin.\n\n【57】*   Metronidazole.\n\n【58】*   Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【59】C. **Laser Therapy**: Laser therapy offers an excellent advantage compared to conventional treatment modalities. They have a bactericidal effect and yield better results, including decreased bleeding and pocket depth. However, lasers are used as an adjunct to manual therapy.\n\n【60】D. **Photodynamic Therapy**: A newer approach involves generating reactive oxygen molecules using a high-energy diode laser. Photosensitizers like toluidine blue are used along with the laser diode to produce a bactericidal effect. Photodynamic therapy is considered adjunctive care as enough data is not available to prove its efficacy.\n\n【61】E. **Surgical Therapy**: Surgical intervention is considered when other approaches fail to relieve the symptoms. If the defects are too significant (probing depth of more than 5 mm), procedures like resection and regeneration are practiced.\n\n【62】*   **Resection** - This involves the elimination of bone defects, microbial load reduction, or decontamination. Later, the implant surface is polished and smoothened (implantoplasty).\n\n【63】*   **Regeneration** - It involves the use of graft materials or membranes for the regeneration of bone. Regeneration is carried out for long-term functional and aesthetic benefits.\n\n【64】How Can Periimplantitis Be Prevented?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【65】Untreated cases of periimplantitis can lead to significant bone loss and implant failure. Although the condition is irreversible, preventive measures must be taken. These include:\n\n【66】*   Maintaining good oral hygiene, plaque control measures, and regular dental visits.\n\n【67】*   After the implant placement, ensure to follow oral hygiene measures as instructed by the dentist.\n\n【68】*   Avoid smoking and consuming alcohol.\n\n【69】*   Maintain blood sugar levels and good overall health.\n\n【70】*   Lastly, regularly follow up with your dentist.\n\n【71】**Conclusion**:\n\n【72】Dental implants are creating a new revolution in the field of dentistry. Periimplantitis is characterized by infection, inflammation, and destruction of the tissues around the implant. The prevalence rate of periimplantitis is estimated to be around 56 %. The symptoms of periimplantitis include implant mobility, bleeding gums, bad breath, etc. Periimplantitis is a progressive condition that leads to implant failure and bone loss. Although the condition is irreversible, measures can be taken to prevent periimplantitis.\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>*   Peri-implantitis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29926957\n*   Management of peri-implantitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612185/\n*   Peri-implant disease: Treatment  \n    https://www.efp.org/dental-implants/peri-implant-disease-treatment/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Cancer occurs when abnormal cells divide uncontrollably, resulting in a tumor that can spread or a colony of abnormal cells in the circulation. Cancer develops when deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations or inherited defective genes cause one or a few cells to grow and reproduce excessively. However, the immune system fails to recognize and eliminate these cells effectively. This might be related to abnormalities in tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell growth and death.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Cancer?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】The most common types of cancer are as follows:\n\n【4】*   **Carcinoma:** Starts in one organ and spreads to others, such as the intestines, ovaries, lungs, breasts, or pancreas.\n\n【5】*   **Sarcoma:** Tumors of bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, cartilage, or other soft or connective tissues.\n\n【6】*   **Melanoma:** It is skin cancer of melanin-forming cells.\n\n【7】*   **Lymphoma:** Tumors that affect the white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\n\n【8】*   **Leukemia:** It results in immature or aberrant cells that inhibit the creation of normal blood cells.\n\n【9】Is Inflammation a Risk Factor for Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】Most gene mutations are not inherited and are caused by various conditions such as age, carcinogenic chemicals, smoking, sun exposure, obesity, and a lack of exercise. Furthermore, persistent inflammation is a well-known risk factor. Some kinds of cancer have inflammatory symptoms before they become malignant. On the other hand, changes generated by an oncogene create an inflammatory environment in other forms of cancer. In both circumstances, inflammation in the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor growth.\n\n【11】Which Inflammatory Cells Contribute to Cancer?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The following signaling molecules of inflammation cause cancer:\n\n【13】*   **Cytokines:** Promote cell proliferation and the recruitment of immune cells and maintain the tumor microenvironment.\n\n【14】*   **Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase**: Activates transcription factors in precancerous and cancerous tumors. It also triggers oxidative DNA damage.\n\n【15】*   **The Transcription Factor Nf-Kappa Beta:** Promotes tissue invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis protection for altered cell addition. In addition, it increases the production of proinflammatory mediators.\n\n【16】*   **Cox2:** It is overexpressed in various malignancies linked with inflammation as it catalyzes the synthesis of lipid-based inflammatory mediators. It also aids in the maintenance of a chronic inflammatory condition.\n\n【17】*   **PGE2:** Promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) during inflammation. As a result, proinflammatory mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment are activated.\n\n【18】What Is the Mechanism of Action of Inflammation-Associated Cancers?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The tumor microenvironment comprises various resident cell types, including adipocytes, fibroblasts, and migratory hematopoietic cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells. In addition, adaptive and innate immune system members are located in the microenvironment. Macrophages enhance the persistent inflammatory state of the tumor microenvironment. Collaborating with recruited neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and eosinophils raises the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the tumor microenvironment to enhance the body's natural defense against infection. However, higher reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations can cause mutagenesis via DNA damage or altered gene expression in growing cells. Furthermore, the tumor inflammatory microenvironment promotes basement membrane breakage, thus leading to tumor cell invasion and migration.\n\n【20】What Are the Signs of Cancer-Associated Inflammation?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The signs of cancer-associated inflammation are as follows:\n\n【22】*   Invading leukocytes.\n\n【23】*   Increased production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).\n\n【24】*   Increased interleukins.\n\n【25】*   Signals governing the development of new blood vessels.\n\n【26】*   Tissue rebuilding.\n\n【27】What Is the Role of Inflammation in Cancer?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Inflammation, the body's natural defensive system, plays a significant role in establishing the tumor microenvironment and, ultimately, the advancement of cancer. Surprisingly, altered cells can use this natural defensive system to aid their growth and survival. Oncogene activation, which is required for cancer formation, is associated with increased production of immune-influencing molecules such as cytokines and cells that are either directly tumor-promoting or immunosuppressive. This is because tumors develop and are invaded by many immune cells. Inflammation favors the following roles of cancer:\n\n【29】*   Carcinogenesis (cancer formation).\n\n【30】*   Malignant transformation.\n\n【31】*   Tumor growth.\n\n【32】*   Tumor invasion.\n\n【33】*   Metastatic spread.\n\n【34】Mutations in RAS genes, primarily KRAS, play a crucial role in up to 30 % of all human cancers, suggesting that the K-Ras protein has a causal function in carcinogenesis. K-Ras generates the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and interleukin 8, which block normal cell death and accelerate the formation of new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor.\n\n【35】What Is Immunosurveillance?\n---------------------------\n\n【36】Following the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chronic inflammation is caused by the persistence of inflammation-initiating substances or a failure of the systems required to eliminate inflammation. This process of inflammation initiation and elimination is known as immunosurveillance.\n\n【37】**What Is Cancer Therapy-Induced Inflammation?**\n\n【38】Therapy-induced inflammation arises in response to different anti-cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, and immune infiltration produced by various biologic therapies or immunotherapies. Current immunotherapies rely on immune system activation in the tumor following treatment. This procedure can aid in developing anti-tumor immune responses, which will work with traditional therapy. In some situations, releasing ATP and HMGB1 from dying tumor cells might trigger the production of IL-1 and other immunostimulatory cytokines. This, together with enhanced tumor production, may activate and maintain de novo anti-tumor T cell responses or may result in immunosuppression.\n\n【39】How Can Inflammation-Associated Cancers Be Prevented?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Anti-inflammatory chemicals, synthetic and natural, are commonly used in cancer therapy. The selective Cox2 inhibitor revealed markedly decreased chemopreventive effects in colon and gastrointestinal tumor research. Antioxidants such as epicatechin from tea, resveratrol from grapes and red wine, the plant ingredient curcumin, and sulforaphane from broccoli have also been shown to be beneficial against tumors. Studies with cultured cells and antiviral models have shown that inflammation is active in tumor formation and that anti-inflammatory drugs help inhibit and delay tumor growth and progression. Curcumin, a natural substance, works by inhibiting signals.\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】The functional link between inflammation and cancer is still not very clear. Although it is evident that cell proliferation alone does not cause cancer, persistent cell proliferation in an environment rich in inflammatory cells, growth factors, and DNA-damage-promoting cells potentiates cancer growth risk. For example, tumor development in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is preceded by inflammation of gastrointestinal tissues. While it is well acknowledged that chronic inflammation plays a vital role in establishing the tumor microenvironment, further research is needed to identify the particular molecular mechanisms contributing to its initiation and progression. Thus, it is essential to investigate the molecular processes of inflammation in cancer to lead to the discovery of novel targets for improved diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   Inflammation and Cancer: Triggers, Mechanisms, and Consequences  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31315034/\n*   Why Cancer and Inflammation?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1994795/\n*   Roles of inflammation in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20036938/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "84bf5443-d9cc-44be-abdf-36ff9240c3f5", "title": "Tongue-Tie - Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Tongue-Tie - Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】For the tongue to do all its functions, it should be able to reach every part of the mouth. This full range of motion helps you to speak by making different sounds. It also helps in swallowing and sweeping away the food particles sticking in the mouth and helps keep the mouth clean. In this condition, known as \"tongue-tie,\" the tongue is literally tied to the floor of the mouth, restricting speech, eating, and other activities involving a range of motion. Tongue-tie is a common condition seen in around five percent of all newborns, and it is three times more common among boys than girls.\n\n【2】What Is Tongue-Tie?\n-------------------\n\n【3】Tongue-tie refers to a condition in which the lower side of the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth, restricting it from moving freely. This happens when the strip of tissue called the lingual frenulum that connects the tongue and the floor of the mouth is shorter than normal. It is otherwise known as ankyloglossia. This is a condition that has been present since birth.\n\n【4】How Is Tongue-Tie Developed?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】When an embryo is growing in the womb, the tongue and the floor of the mouth fuses together, and eventually, the tongue separates from the floor of the mouth, and finally, only a thin cord of tissue connects the bottom of the tongue with the floor of the mouth and as the child grows the lingual frenulum thins and shrinks whereas in children with tongue-tie the lingual frenulum stays thick and does not recede restricting the movement of the tongue.\n\n【6】How to Know if My Baby Is Tongue-Tied?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】Tongue-tie is associated with difficulties in breastfeeding. Tongue-tie is often noticed when the baby is finding it hard to breastfeed. The symptoms are different in each child, and some children may not have any symptoms, whereas some may have noticeable symptoms. The other symptoms that can be noticed in a baby with tongue-tie include the following:\n\n【8】*   The baby tends to chew more than sucking.\n\n【9】*   Difficulty latching while breastfeeding.\n\n【10】*   Baby does not gain weight as expected.\n\n【11】*   Breastfeeds for a long time.\n\n【12】*   The baby is fussy when trying to breastfeed.\n\n【13】*   The baby makes a clicking sound while feeding.\n\n【14】*   The baby seems hungry all the time.\n\n【15】*   The baby may not be able to move the tongue from side to side and cannot reach the tongue to the roof or upper gums of the teeth. They may also find it hard to put their tongue out of their mouth.\n\n【16】In young children, here are a few commonly noticed symptoms, which include:\n\n【17】*   Impairment in speech.\n\n【18】*   Difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【19】*   Not being able to lick ice cream.\n\n【20】*   Problems sticking the tongue out.\n\n【21】*   Difficulty kissing.\n\n【22】*   Difficulty in moving the tongue towards the roof of the mouth or sideways.\n\n【23】In addition to finding certain symptoms in the baby, the mother might also have a few symptoms like:\n\n【24】*   Pain while or after breastfeeding.\n\n【25】*   Sore or cracked nipples.\n\n【26】*   Inflammation or infection of the breast (mastitis).\n\n【27】*   Reduced milk supply.\n\n【28】How Is Tongue-Tie Classified?\n-----------------------------\n\n【29】Coryllos ankyloglossia grading scale is used to classify the tongue-tie types. The types include:\n\n【30】*   **Type I:**\n\n【31】In type I, the lingual frenulum is thin and elastic and attaches the tip of the tongue to the ridge behind the lower teeth.\n\n【32】*   **Type II:**\n\n【33】In type II the frenulum is fine and elastic, and the tongue is attached 2 to 4 millimeters from the tip to the floor of the mouth.\n\n【34】*   **Type III:**\n\n【35】In type III, the frenulum is thick and stiffened and connects the tongue from the middle of the lower side of the tongue to the floor of the mouth.\n\n【36】*   **Type IV:**\n\n【37】In type IV, the lingual frenulum is posterior, or sometimes it is not visible. Only when touched is the tongue-tie noticed.\n\n【38】Along with the Coryllos grading scale, the Hazelbaker assessment tool (HATLFF) is also used to determine tongue function.\n\n【39】How Does Tongue-Tie Affect Breastfeeding and Speech?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】**Tongue-Tie and Breastfeeding:**\n\n【41】For breastfeeding, an adequate seal is required for which the baby has to extend their tongue over the jawline, whereas in the case of tongue-tied babies, this is not possible, and so they use their gums to keep the nipple in the mouth while breastfeeding.\n\n【42】**Tongue-Tie and Speech Impairment:**\n\n【43】The exact pathology behind how tongue-tie affects speech is still not clear. But however, it is found that the tongue needs contact with the roof of the mouth to pronounce certain lingual sounds like \"t,\" \"d,\" \"z,\" \"n,\" \"l,\" \"s,\" and \"th.\" In the case of tongue-tie, the baby cannot move the tongue to reach the roof of the mouth, so they have difficulties with pronunciation.\n\n【44】How Is Tongue-Tie Diagnosed?\n----------------------------\n\n【45】Tongue-tie is usually diagnosed during the physical examination when the symptoms are examined.\n\n【46】What Are the Available Treatment Options for Tongue-Tie?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】There are cases where the child having tongue-tie does not have any noticeable symptoms like difficulty breastfeeding, swallowing, and speech impairment. So in those cases, treatment is not required.\n\n【48】**Frenectomy:**\n\n【49】In cases when the child is having symptoms, a surgical procedure called frenectomy is performed. Frenectomy is a simple surgical procedure that is carried out under local anesthesia in which the lingual frenulum is cut. This procedure is also known as frenulectomy, frenotomy, and tongue-tie division. Frenectomy is a painless procedure, but like any other surgical procedure, it carries certain risks like bleeding, scarring, infection, or injury to the salivary ducts present in the mouth.\n\n【50】**Frenuloplasty:**\n\n【51】Frenuloplasty is an extensive procedure that is carried out under general anesthesia. This surgical procedure is recommended when the lingual frenulum is too thick for a frenectomy.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications Associated With Tongue-Tie?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The long-term effects associated with tongue-tie are:\n\n【54】*   **Malnutrition:**\n\n【55】Poor breastfeeding leads to inadequate nutrition and results in malnourishment.\n\n【56】*   **Impaired Speech:**\n\n【57】Due to tongue-tie, the child may not be able to pronounce certain sounds, which can later affect their speech and overall school performance.\n\n【58】*   **Poor Oral Hygiene:**\n\n【59】Because of tongue-tie, it may be difficult to sweep away the food debris sticking on from the teeth contributing to tooth decay or plaque formation resulting in a condition known as gingivitis.\n\n【60】**Conclusion:**\n\n【61】There is no particular way to prevent tongue-tie, but early diagnosis and treatment are key to a child's recovery. Most babies recover completely without any treatment. But in severe cases, when not treated, the child may not be able to breastfeed. Poor breastfeeding can lead to inadequate nutrition.\n\n【62】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【63】* * *\n\n【64】#### **1.**删除换行**Do Tongue-Ties Go Away on Their Own?**\n\n【65】In most cases, tongue-ties usually go away after two or three years of life.

{"seq_id": "e315ea32-e3a7-4470-b962-299e149f9ba9", "title": "Are COVID-19 Patients Infectious for up to 90 Days After Recovery?", "text": "【0】Are COVID-19 Patients Infectious for up to 90 Days After Recovery?\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】An increasing number of recovered COVID-19 patients are allegedly reporting back to hospitals with lingering COVID-19 symptoms, such as difficulties in breathing and chest pain. Some patients, apparently asymptomatic, keep testing positive long after recovering. Such patients are in a dilemma if they should end their quarantine and come out, or if they are still capable of infecting others.\n\n【2】The other most confusing topic is reinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There have been reports of COVID-19 recovered patients testing positive and showing symptoms again. This has resulted in a lot of questions about immunity and antibodies against this new Coronavirus. But, most health authorities state that reinfection is not possible in the first three months after recovery. Then why do so many patients keep testing positive?\n\n【3】With the scarcity of COVID-19 testing, not everyone who initially tests positive receives follow-up testing. And according to CDC guidelines (United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), isolation is ended based on how the patient feels after ten days of onset of symptoms and not on retesting. And there is still confusion about what a positive follow-up test means.\n\n【4】What Are the Current Guidelines for Isolation of COVID-19 Patients?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】As of January 2022, these are the updated guidelines given by CDC:\n\n【6】*   COVID-19 patients with a mild illness: 10 days of isolation.\n\n【7】*   People who are critically ill (needing hospitalization, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation): It may be necessary to extend the period of isolation and precautions to at least ten days and up to 20 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as after the fever has subsided (without the use of fever-reducing medication) and symptoms have improved.\n\n【8】*   People who are immunocompromised, whether mildly or severely, may have a longer infectious period: Extend the period of isolation to at least 20 days (day zero is the first day of symptoms or a positive viral test). To identify the optimum duration of isolation and precautions, use a test-based strategy and confer with an infectious disease specialist.\n\n【9】*   Recovering patients include: Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory specimens for up to 3 months after the onset of disease. Replication-competent viruses have not been reliably collected from these patients and thus are unlikely to be infectious.\n\n【10】Should Recovered COVID-19 Patients Get Retested Before Ending Isolation?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】According to the CDC, isolation can be ended if a patient do not have any symptoms, and it has been ten days since the onset or if a patient did not have a fever in the last 24 hours without using medicines. The point to be noted is that loss of smell and taste might last for several months and will not influence the end of isolation. A negative test is not required to be around others for most people. If the doctor asks a patient to get tested again to see if they are still infectious, please repeat the test.\n\n【12】These recommendations do not apply to people with severe COVID-19 or extremely weak immune systems.\n\n【13】When Can Immunocompromised or Severely Ill COVID-19 Patients Be Around Others?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Recovered immunocompromised or critically ill COVID-19 patients might have to stay home in isolation for up to 20 days. Such patients might have to get retested before their isolation ends.\n\n【15】What Is Known So Far About COVID-19 Reinfection?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】To date, this is not enough information available that supports reinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data do show that people who have recovered from COVID-19 may harbor low levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their bodies for as long as three months after diagnosis. So, some recovered people will continue to test positive the next three months even if they do not necessarily transmit the infection to others.\n\n【17】Cases with COVID-19 reinfection are present but are rare. More research is needed. This is why the CDC advises recovered patients with new symptoms to get evaluated for reinfection. If a person develop influenza-like symptoms after recovering from COVID-19, make sure they isolate themselves and consult the doctor for the possible causes and if retesting is needed.\n\n【18】**Findings That Do Not Support Reinfection:**\n\n【19】1.  The concentrations of the Coronavirus reduce significantly in the nasal cavity and throat after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【20】2.  The capacity of the virus to replicate decreases after the onset of symptoms. In mild to moderately sick COVID-19 patients, viruses capable of replicating and spreading have not been recovered after ten days following the start of symptoms. Only in some severely ill and immunocompromised individuals, viruses capable of replicating have been documented between 10 and 20 days after the onset of the symptoms.\n\n【21】3.  One study demonstrated that people with a positive contact did not get infected if the exposure to the infected person started 6 days or more after the person's illness onset.\n\n【22】4.  A study conducted by CDC in Korea, where 285 patients who persistently tested positive, including 126 patients that again developed COVID-19 symptoms, showed that they did not infect their 790 contacts. And scientists were unable to isolate replication-competent viruses (viruses that can replicate) from 108 of these patients.\n\n【23】**Current Findings That Might Indicate Reinfection:**\n\n【24】1.  In a study conducted on workers of a nursing facility to see the future of asymptomatic patients, 1 out of the 48 staff members showed a positive result more than 20 days after the primary diagnosis.\n\n【25】2.  In another reported case, a mildly infected patient tested positive for replication-competent virus around the 18th day after symptom onset.\n\n【26】3.  Also, experts suggest that reinfection is possible within one or two years of initial infection if proper COVID management measures such as vaccination, masks, and social distancing are not followed.\n\n【27】4.  The immunity offered by COVID is short-lived, and failing to get vaccinated can cause reinfections even within months of initial exposure.\n\n【28】After Recovering, Are COVID-19 Patients Immune?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】When a virus attacks the body's cells, the immune system gets activated, which sends cells to fight the virus off. These immune cells also send signals to warn other cells by releasing proteins called interferons. Interferons signal neighboring cells to prepare to fight the virus off. But the SARS-CoV-2 virus blocks these interferons. So, the immune system gets activated, but the cells in the body do not become defensive. So the virus keeps replicating in the cells of the lungs and goes deeper.\n\n【30】As the immune system gets activated, it does produce antibodies against the virus, and survivors of COVID-19 did show high levels of antibodies to the virus. However, some people showed very low levels of antibodies in their blood. So, recovered COVID patients cannot be considered immune, and more studies have to be conducted to determine immunity to reinfection by this virus, even up to 3 months of infection.\n\n【31】How Long Do COVID-19 Antibodies Last?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【32】A United Kingdom study found that immunity against COVID-19 could decline within months. Almost 60 % of the patients in the study demonstrated a potent antibody response; only 17 % retained the same levels of antibodies three months later. And in some cases, it became completely undetectable. This means people can still get reinfected during seasonal waves of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is possible that vaccines may not provide long-term protection.\n\n【33】Why Do Some COVID-19 Patients Continuously Test Positive After Recovery?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】In some recovered patients, the detection of viral RNA through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the throat swab can give positive results. Scientists claim that these are just viral particles left behind after the active infection. There is no proof still available that suggests that these viral particles can replicate and infect others.\n\n【35】### Is It Conclusive That Recovered COVID-19 Patients Who Test Persistently Positive Are Not Contagious?\n\n【36】Even though the detected viral RNA in recovered patients is low in concentration, and it is unlikely that such people can infect others, there is no hard and fast rule in medicine. Although no evidence supports such a spread, there still might be a chance that a minimal percentage of such recovered patients who keep testing positive might still be contagious.\n\n【37】If a Recovered COVID-19 Patient Is Identified as a Contact of a New Case, Should They Be Tested or Quarantined?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】According to the CDC, if the patient recovered from COVID-19 less than three months back and had a positive contact in that period, then retesting and quarantine are not needed. But, if it is more than three months, then the patient should be quarantined and tested.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】While there are contradictory findings of the viral genetic material found in patients after the time window to be able to replicate and be contagious, most doctors suggest it is not a possibility for recovered patients to be contagious after the initial 10 to 20 days. But, some doctors are warning their patients about the possibility of extremely rare cases where immunocompromised and severely ill but recovered patients may still be contagious. This makes the people wonder if the guidelines for how long the Coronavirus lasts in the body should be changed. Such recovered people might act as reservoirs for the virus and potentially cause local outbreaks later on. Even though there is no proof, there is still a minute chance of that happening.\n\n【41】So until everyone gets vaccinated, it is essential to continue safety precautions, such as physical distancing, masks, and frequent hand hygiene, to control the spread of the virus.\n\n【42】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【43】* * *\n\n【44】#### **1.**删除换行**How Soon May I Contract COVID Again?**\n\n【45】Reinfected or infected individuals exhibit symptoms. Most COVID-19 virus-infected individuals create fighter cells and antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections. In the first three months following the initial infection, the likelihood of reinfection for recovered people appears to be relatively low.\n\n【46】#### **2.**删除换行**Why Does COVID-19 Reinfection Occur?**\n\n【47】Viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, are ever-evolving. Variations (new strains of the virus) that enhance the risk of reinfection may evolve due to these alterations.\n\n【48】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Anyone Get COVID Three Times?**\n\n【49】Multiple infections are becoming more and more common, according to studies. Doctors discovered that even if a person is immunized, infections by a virus that occur a second or third time increase the risk to their health.\n\n【50】#### **4.**删除换行**Is COVID Reinfection More Serious?**\n\n【51】Although the severity of the symptoms during reinfection is less severe than during the initial infection, some persons may still experience severe COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【52】#### **5.**删除换行**Is COVID Becoming Worse Each Time?**\n\n【53】Some persons experience more serious COVID-19 symptoms, such as a high temperature, a chronic cough, and breathlessness, which frequently signify pneumonia. A person may experience minor symptoms for about a week before they quickly get worse.\n\n【54】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the COVID Immunity Duration?**\n\n【55】The body usually takes up to 11 months to develop natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection. The body's immune cells and proteins can identify and eliminate the pathogen if reencountered, preventing disease and lessening the severity of illness.\n\n【56】#### **7.**删除换行**How Soon Do the Symptoms of the Omicron Variant Show Up?**\n\n【57】Previous recommendations by WHO (world health organization) stated that COVID symptoms could occur between 2 to 14 days after a person is infected with the virus.\n\n【58】#### **8.**删除换行**How Long Till an Individual Test Positive for Omicron?**\n\n【59】With an at-home fast test, COVID-19 patients typically test for a virus that comes positive within six to ten days. It might last longer with an RT PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test)  \nMany COVID-19 individuals can give positive results for the virus for weeks or even months, according to experts in infectious diseases. A PCR test scans the body for virus bits. A test result may be positive even if a person has been cured of the illness and no longer exhibits symptoms since the test can still identify virus particles in the body. They have a lower chance of being able to determine if the virus is active or whether a person is contagious.\n\n【60】#### **9.**删除换行**What Distinguishes Omicron From Delta?**\n\n【61】Omicron may not cause breathing problems as it mostly multiplies in the throat, whereas Delta may result in more serious symptoms if critical. Omicron has minor side effects; normally, lung involvement is minimal, and patients do not require oxygen.\n\n【62】#### **10.**删除换行**How Can One Get Rid of COVID Quicker?**\n\n【63】One can take the following actions to recover from COVID quickly   \n\\- Maintain a routine.-   \n\\- Spend time away from social media and COVID-19 news.   \n\\- Consume wholesome meals and get enough liquids.   \n\\- Continue to be active.   \n\\- Get lots of rest.   \n\\- Avoid using alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs.  \n\\- Taking proper medications suggested by the doctor.\n\n【64】#### **11.**删除换行**How Long Are People Contagious for Omicron?**\n\n【65】Early on, throughout an ailment, persons are usually most contagious. Most Omicron transmission occurs between one to two days before the onset of symptoms and two to three days after.\n\n【66】#### **12.**删除换行**Can You Test Negative While Having COVID?**\n\n【67】If the test is negative, it is improbable that the individual had COVID-19 at the time of the test, and the nasal swab sample did not contain any antigens. However, it is possible that the test resulted in a false negative even though there is the presence of antigens.\n\n【68】#### **13.**删除换行**Is COVID Possible Without a Fever?**\n\n【69】One of the typical signs of COVID-19 is a fever. Still, individuals might also have other symptoms like a cough or other respiratory issues without a temperature or a very mild one, especially in the early stages.\n\n【70】#### **14.**删除换行**Are PCR Tests Reliable?**\n\n【71】The results are quite accurate when a medical expert properly carries out RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). However, the quick test may miss some cases for antigen. COVID-19 analyses the virus for certain proteins. Once a fluid sample has been taken using a long nasal swab, certain antigen tests can deliver results within a few minutes.\n\n【72】#### **15.**删除换行**COVID: Does It Start Up Suddenly?**\n\n【73】The signs of COVID-19 can appear gradually. While COVID-19 symptoms can arise as soon as two days after infection, they can also manifest anywhere between two and fourteen days. Anyone can experience minor to major symptoms. Possible signs include chills or a fever.\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>*   https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0814-updated-isolation-guidance.html  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0814-updated-isolation-guidance.html\n*   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html#Patients-with-Persistent-or-Recurrent-Positive-Tests  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html#Patients-with-Persistent-or-Recurrent-Positive-Tests\n*   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html\n*   https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Confusion is a state of mind and not a disease; it usually declines the ability of a person to think, understand and remember things. Confusion can be correlated with dementia and referred to as disorientation in its early stage and delirium in the extreme or most progressed stages of the condition.\n\n【2】Confusion, which is also referred to as dementia, is a progressive condition affecting the brain's ability to function, resulting in inappropriate judgment, inability to make decisions, loss of memory, and behavioral changes. Individuals with confusion or delirium are usually unable to think clearly as per their general potential. Confusion can develop gradually over time or suddenly, depending on the condition's root cause. It is most commonly seen in alcoholics and older adults.\n\n【3】What Causes Confusion?\n----------------------\n\n【4】Confusion can be caused due to varied factors like injuries to the brain, medical conditions, drug abuse, etc. these causes are briefed below for a detailed understanding of the condition.\n\n【5】**Injuries to the Brain**\n\n【6】Accidents, or any trauma where the brain is injured or a sudden hit to the head, leave the brain in shock and the person in a state of confusion for a while, and the duration may be longer depending on the type and severity of the trauma. The most common type of brain injury is a concussion that causes dementia. Other mental conditions like grief and depression can also confuse.\n\n【7】**Medical Conditions**\n\n【8】Various medical conditions that are responsible for or have the potential to confuse are:\n\n【9】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n\n【10】*   Low levels of sodium and calcium in the body.\n\n【11】*   Infections in the brain, lungs, or anywhere in the body.\n\n【12】*   Parkinson's disease.\n\n【13】*   Strokes.\n\n【14】*   Cancer.\n\n【15】*   Problems with the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, and thyroid.\n\n【16】*   Seizures.\n\n【17】*   Dehydration.\n\n【18】*   High fever.\n\n【19】*   Sleep deprivation.\n\n【20】*   Lack of oxygen.\n\n【21】*   Depression.\n\n【22】*   Dehydration.\n\n【23】**Drugs or Medications**\n\n【24】*   Alcohol.\n\n【25】*   Antidepressants.\n\n【26】*   Antihistamines.\n\n【27】*   Opioid pain medicines.\n\n【28】*   Sedatives and tranquilizers.\n\n【29】*   Medicines for bladder control problems (anticholinergics).\n\n【30】What Are the Symptoms of Confusion?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【31】Confusion can be diagnosed when a person is disoriented and has difficulty carrying out routine to his fullest potential.\n\n【32】Common signs and symptoms of confusion can be described as follows:\n\n【33】*   Forget things and directions which makes it difficult for them to get back home safely, or a person tends to lose many belongings.\n\n【34】*   Has prolonged pauses while talking.\n\n【35】*   Slurred speech.\n\n【36】*   Looks lost in thoughts.\n\n【37】*   Difficulty in following conversations.\n\n【38】*   Unsure what day or time it is.\n\n【39】*   Uncertain of what is happening around them.\n\n【40】*   Forgetting what the activity is being done while it is still ongoing.\n\n【41】*   Sudden change in emotion, such as anger and agitation.\n\n【42】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【43】Confusion is critical to diagnose when it is of a sudden onset but is considered a normal behavior of that person when it develops over time. But whenever a person is suffering, or people around them notice the symptoms, they should seek medical help.\n\n【44】Confusion should never be ignored when accompanied by the following symptoms, as it can be life-threatening if not treated in time.\n\n【45】*   Dizziness\n\n【46】*   Rapid heartbeat\n\n【47】*   Clammy skin.\n\n【48】*   Fever.\n\n【49】*   Headache.\n\n【50】*   Shivering.\n\n【51】*   Irregular breathing.\n\n【52】*   Weakness on one side of the body.\n\n【53】*   Slurred speech.\n\n【54】How Is Confusion Treated?\n-------------------------\n\n【55】Confusion is seldom caused independently as a diseased condition. An underlying cause almost always accompanies it, so the perfect way to get rid of dementia is to treat the underlying cause first and foremost. E.g. In patients with hypoglycemia, dementia is mainly caused as a result of low blood sugar levels; thus, in such cases, if glucose supplements like candies or sugar are given to the patient, they feel better.\n\n【56】If it is caused by dehydration, consuming beverages can help relieve symptoms. But confusion can not always be treated at home, as severe medical conditions also can cause the disorder. It is always advised to seek medical help whenever such symptoms are noted; emergencies like concussions require medical assistance.\n\n【57】A treatment plan is formulated based on a clinical examination, radiography, and analysis of the injury site. Individuals with delirium need not be bedridden but need to be careful and have someone to keep them in check as they tend to forget almost everything.\n\n【58】**1\\. Counseling and Therapies:** Patients with confusion due to excessive consumption of alcohol or addictive substances require counseling and therapies to help them overcome their addiction; such counseling is termed psychotherapy, where an expert communicates with the subject and advises ways to modify lifestyle and habits.\n\n【59】**2\\. Discontinuation of Medicines:** In patients with confusion due to medicinal drugs, doctors must decide to discontinue, taper the doses, or replace the medications depending on the conditions and severity of the disease.\n\n【60】**3\\. Confusion in Elderly People:** As vitamin deficiency and age are also the causes of dementia, old age patients with dementia are prescribed vitamin supplements. But age-related dementia is not curable and worsens as age progresses.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Confusion, also termed dementia, is a medical condition caused due to various underlying factors such as an injury, concussion to the head, alcohol abuse (one of the most common causes of confusion), and patients with medical conditions like diabetes, dehydration, lack of sleep, etc. A person with this condition is almost always lost, unable to concentrate, and has memory loss. Confusion can develop suddenly after trauma or have a gradual onset. Any similar symptoms noted with someone should be treated or referred to a doctor to seek medical help. Treatment mainly concentrates on eliminating the underlying cause, as confusion is mostly a secondary condition caused due to some of the other associated factors.\n\n【63】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【64】* * *\n\n【65】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are Some Ways to Resolve Confusion?**\n\n【66】Confusion can be resolved through a variety of methods, depending on the cause and severity of the confusion.

Failure of the maternal immune system to properly adapt to pregnancy can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage, preterm labor, or fetal growth restriction.\n\n【2】The immunology of pregnancy is a fascinating area of research that has attracted the attention of scientists and clinicians alike. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the complex immune interactions between the mother and the developing fetus. This has led to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat pregnancy complications.\n\n【3】This article provides an overview of the immunology of pregnancy, including the changes that occur in the maternal immune system during pregnancy, the role of immune cells and molecules in maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the impact of maternal immune dysfunction on pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【4】What Are the Changes That Occur in the Maternal Immune System During Pregnancy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Some of the main changes that occur in the maternal immune system during pregnancy include:\n\n【6】*   Hormonal changes, particularly increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, can affect immune cell function.\n\n【7】*   The maternal immune system undergoes a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory state, which is thought to be necessary to prevent the rejection of the developing fetus by the maternal immune system.\n\n【8】*   There is an increase in the number of regulatory T- cells (Tregs) in the maternal circulation, which help to dampen down potentially harmful immune responses against fetal antigens.\n\n【9】*   Natural killer (NK) cells are abundant in the uterus during early pregnancy and have a key role in regulating trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling.\n\n【10】*   The activity of maternal immune cells that could target the fetus, such as cytotoxic T cells, is suppressed during pregnancy.\n\n【11】*   There is an increase in circulating levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n【12】*   Maternal antibody levels increase to protect the mother and the fetus from pathogens, but this could also pose a risk of autoimmune conditions that can cause complications.\n\n【13】*   Maternal immune cells can migrate into the fetal-maternal interface, where they interact with fetal cells and contribute to placental development.\n\n【14】These changes are essential to ensure a successful pregnancy, but their dysregulation can contribute to a range of pregnancy complications.\n\n【15】What Is the Role of Immune Cells and Molecules in Maintaining a Healthy Pregnancy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Some of the main roles of immune cells and molecules in maintaining a healthy pregnancy include:\n\n【17】*   Regulatory T- cells (Tregs) play a key role in promoting maternal tolerance to the fetus by suppressing potentially harmful immune responses.\n\n【18】*   Natural killer (NK) cells, which are abundant in the uterus during early pregnancy, regulate trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling.\n\n【19】*   Dendritic cells help to promote maternal-fetal tolerance by promoting the differentiation of Tregs and tolerogenic immune responses.\n\n【20】*   Macrophages are critical for placental development and maintenance, and also have important roles in promoting tissue repair and wound healing.\n\n【21】*   Cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), have anti-inflammatory properties and help to prevent excessive immune activation that could damage fetal tissues.\n\n【22】*   Maternal antibodies, transferred to the fetus across the placenta, help to protect the developing fetus from infections and other harmful environmental factors.\n\n【23】*   The complement system plays an important role in preventing infections and promoting tissue repair, but its dysregulation can contribute to placental damage and preterm birth.\n\n【24】These immune cells and molecules work in concert to promote maternal-fetal tolerance and ensure a successful pregnancy. Their dysregulation can contribute to a range of pregnancy complications, including pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction.\n\n【25】What Is the Impact of Maternal Immune Dysfunction on Pregnancy Outcomes?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Some of the impacts of maternal immune dysfunction on pregnancy outcomes are the following:\n\n【27】*   Pro-inflammatory states, such as those associated with chronic infections or autoimmune conditions, can contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, and fetal growth restriction.\n\n【28】*   Inadequate anti-inflammatory responses, such as low levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines, can also contribute to pregnancy complications.\n\n【29】*   Autoimmune conditions that target fetal tissues, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, can result in miscarriage, preterm labor, or fetal growth restriction.\n\n【30】*   Dysregulation of immune cell populations, such as natural killer (NK) cells or Tregs, can contribute to placental abnormalities, impaired fetal growth, and preterm birth.\n\n【31】*   Infections, such as bacterial vaginosis or chorioamnionitis, can activate the maternal immune system and lead to premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, or fetal infection.\n\n【32】*   Dysregulation of complement activation can also contribute to placental abnormalities and preterm birth.\n\n【33】Overall, maternal immune dysfunction during pregnancy can have a significant impact on pregnancy outcomes and the health of the developing fetus. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of immune dysregulation is crucial for developing effective interventions to improve maternal and fetal health.\n\n【34】What Strategies Are Being Developed to Improve Maternal and Fetal Health in Cases of Immune Dysregulation?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Some strategies being developed to improve maternal and fetal health in cases of immune dysregulation during pregnancy are:\n\n【36】*   Immunomodulatory therapies such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and immunosuppressive drugs are being developed and tested to treat pregnancy complications associated with immune dysfunction.\n\n【37】*   Researchers are investigating the potential of natural compounds, such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, to modulate the maternal immune system and improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【38】*   Early detection and monitoring of immune dysregulation during pregnancy using biomarkers is being explored to enable timely interventions and prevent complications.\n\n【39】*   Novel interventions such as microRNA-based therapies and stem cell therapies are being studied to target immune dysregulation and improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【40】*   Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in pregnancy is being used to develop personalized approaches to pregnancy care, including tailored immunomodulatory therapies and targeted interventions to prevent complications.\n\n【41】*   Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, are being investigated as potential strategies to modulate the immune system and improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【42】These strategies hold promise for improving maternal and fetal health in cases of immune dysregulation during pregnancy. Further research is needed to validate their safety and efficacy and optimize their use in clinical practice.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Multiple strategies are being developed to improve maternal and fetal health in cases of immune dysregulation during pregnancy, including immunomodulatory therapies, natural compounds, biomarker-based monitoring, personalized approaches, and lifestyle interventions.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Immunology and the immunological response in pregnancy  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33191116/\n*   Maternal Immunological Adaptation During Normal Pregnancy  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.575197/full\n*   An immune clock of human pregnancy  \n    https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.aan2946</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Urethral discharge is any discharge apart from urine or semen from the urethra. The discharge can be of different colors and odors.\n\n【2】What Is a Urethral Discharge Culture?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】A urethral discharge culture is a diagnostic test to identify certain infections in the urethra or the genital tract, especially for men and boys. This test is also known as a culture of urethral discharge, a genital exudate culture, culture-genital discharge or exudate, or urethritis- culture.\n\n【4】What Is Urethral Discharge?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】Urethral discharge is one of the most common symptoms of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). It occurs due to urethritis or inflammation of the urethra and might cause pus or mucus depending upon the cause of the irritation. It is classified into two types:\n\n【6】*   **Gonococcal Urethritis (GU) -** This occurs due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\n【7】*   **Non-gonococcal Urethritis (NGU) -** This is further divided into chlamydial urethritis and non-chlamydial non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU).\n\n【8】Why Is Urethral Discharge Culture Done?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Urethral discharge culture is advised if a person has signs and symptoms of lower urinary tract infection, which include:\n\n【10】*   Pain while passing urine.\n\n【11】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【12】*   Discharge from the urethra.\n\n【13】*   Redness or swelling of the urethra.\n\n【14】*   Inflammation of the testicles.\n\n【15】The culture tests are done to detect the presence of bacterial or fungal organisms in the urethra. This test can also see sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\n\n【16】*   **Gonorrhea -** This is a common sexually transmitted disease that is caused by the bacteria gonorrhea. It affects the mucous membrane of the reproductive system, like the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and urethra. Gonorrhea commonly occurs in the genital areas, throat, or anus.\n\n【17】*   **Chlamydia -** Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It can cause both urethra and rectum inflammation in men and women.\n\n【18】The symptoms of both gonorrhea and chlamydia infections in the urethra of men include:\n\n【19】*   Pain while passing urine.\n\n【20】*   Pus discharge from the penis tip.\n\n【21】*   Pain or swelling in the testicles.\n\n【22】*   Pain in the rectum.\n\n【23】*   Discharge pus and blood from the rectum (part of the large intestine closest to the anal opening).\n\n【24】*   Pain while having sex.\n\n【25】*   Pain in the lower abdomen.\n\n【26】What Causes Urethritis?\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Urethral discharge culture test can detect the following organisms:\n\n【28】*   **M Genitalium -** The organism was first found as a cause of non-gonococcal urethritis in 1981. It is challenging to grow in the culture. Some investigations have found that M genitalium is responsible for fifteen to twenty-five percent of cases of non-gonococcal urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). Finding the exact relationship between this organism and other urethral pathogens is difficult. Therefore, diagnosing M. genitalium infection is limited to research and studies.\n\n【29】*   **Herpes Simplex Virus -** Around sixty percent of men with herpes simplex infection have non-gonococcal urethritis. Genital herpes symptoms resolve within five to seven days, and the condition gets treated in the course of treating other organisms. Severe pain during the passing of urine (dysuria) and herpes infection is generally suspected.\n\n【30】*   **M Hominis and U urealyticum -** These microbial species have been associated with urethritis for over thirty years. Both of these organisms are related to sexual activity and are isolated from people with urethritis. Whether these species are indeed found in the urethra remains to be found out.\n\n【31】How Is the Urethral Discharge Culture Done?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The test is performed in the laboratory. One is advised not to pass urine one hour before the test. Urine might wash away the pathogens that are being tested for. At first, the nurse will clean the tip of the penis where the urethra is located with a sterile swab. Then a sterile cotton swab is inserted around three-quarters of an inch into the urethra. The swab is rotated to accumulate a good amount of the discharge sample. This process takes little time, and it might be uncomfortable or painful. The collected discharge sample is then sent to a laboratory and put into a culture. The culture is a special dish where the sample is placed and kept for the microbial colonies to grow. The culture growth is examined under a microscope to check for microbial growth. The test result will be out within a few days.\n\n【33】What Do the Test Results of Urethral Discharge Culture Mean?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   A normal or negative result suggests no growth of any microbes in the culture. This means that there is no infection.\n\n【35】*   A positive culture result suggests that an abnormal growth was detected in the culture test. This means that there is an infection present in the genital tract. Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are the most common causes.\n\n【36】What Are the Risks Associated with the Urethral Discharge Culture?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】The urethral discharge culture is a simple procedure that can be carried out efficiently. However, though rarely, certain risks are associated with it:\n\n【38】*   Infection.\n\n【39】*   Bleeding.\n\n【40】*   **Fainting -** This can occur when a cotton swab is introduced into the urethra. Fainting usually happens because of the vagus nerve stimulation (a pair of nerves supplying the heart, lungs, upper digestive tract, and other organs of the chest and abdomen) while taking the sample.\n\n【41】How To Prevent Urethral Discharge?\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】Some people can be asymptomatic even after carrying these organisms. However, such individuals can still transmit one of the sexually transmitted infection-causing bacteria to the other sexual partner. Recommendations to prevent developing urethral discharge include:\n\n【43】*   Periodic screening of sexually active men and women younger than twenty-five years of age.\n\n【44】*   Men who have sex with men (MSM) should also undergo routine check-ups.\n\n【45】*   Check-ups of people having multiple sexual partners.\n\n【46】*   Protecting sex with the help of condoms or any other barrier method can prevent transmitting STDs.\n\n【47】*   Once diagnosed with the infectious disease, the sexual partners should also be notified and tested.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】A urethral discharge culture is a diagnostic test to detect several disease-causing organisms in abnormal urethral discharge. The test is frequently performed to diagnose sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A urethral discharge culture is a simple test to detect the presence of infections in the urinary tract. The procedure is simple but a little uncomfortable or painful. However, the results are obtained within a few days. In case the result tests positive, the treatment can begin immediately.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   Urethral discharge  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298141173\\_Urethral\\_discharge\n*   Urethral Discharge: Diagnosis  \n    https://www.jstor.org/stable/29512904\n*   Urethral discharge culture  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003750.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d58bfae2-2840-452d-a07f-26918ab945be", "title": "Neonatal Meningitis - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Neonatal Meningitis - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, including the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater. It can occur at almost all ages but is more common in infancy. Meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis can occur at any age, whereas Haemophilus influenza is common in children from three months to five years. It is more common in males than females. It is a serious medical condition in neonates. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa may cause it.\n\n【2】What Is the Pathophysiology of Neonatal Meningitis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The bacteria is transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions. The progression of neonatal meningitis begins with bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. The bacteria then invade the intestinal mucosal layer into the bloodstream, causing bacteremia and invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid. The neonates' less efficient immune system cannot prevent the invading bacteria. Therefore, colonization of the mother plays an important role in transmission to the neonate, causing early-onset meningitis. The incubation period is between two to ten days.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Neonatal Meningitis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The symptoms seen in neonatal meningitis are often non-specific that may indicate several other conditions, such as sepsis. These may include fever, dyspnea, and irritability. Signs and symptoms include\n\n【6】*   Flu-like symptoms.\n\n【7】*   Fever.\n\n【8】*   Altered consciousness.\n\n【9】*   Lethargy.\n\n【10】*   Irritability.\n\n【11】*   Headache.\n\n【12】*   Photophobia.\n\n【13】*   Stiff neck.\n\n【14】*   Brudzinski sign or passive neck flexion causes the hips and knees to flexion.\n\n【15】*   Kernig sign or extension at the knee with the hip joint flexed causes spasms in the hamstring muscles.\n\n【16】*   Seizure.\n\n【17】*   Skin rashes.\n\n【18】*   Poor appetite.\n\n【19】Other symptoms of meningitis in neonates or infants include\n\n【20】*   Apnea.\n\n【21】*   Jaundice.\n\n【22】*   Neck rigidity.\n\n【23】*   Hypothermia or hyperthermia.\n\n【24】*   Poor feeding.\n\n【25】*   High-pitched cry.\n\n【26】*   Bulged fontanelles.\n\n【27】*   Poor reflexes.\n\n【28】*   Abdominal distension.\n\n【29】*   Anorexia.\n\n【30】*   Jitteriness.\n\n【31】*   Sunset eyes.\n\n【32】What Are the Types of Neonatal Meningitis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The types of meningitis in neonates:\n\n【34】**Bacterial Meningitis**:\n\n【35】*   Brucella.\n\n【36】**Viral Meningitis**:\n\n【37】*   Enteroviruses.\n\n【38】*   Ebstein-Barr virus.\n\n【39】*   Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n【40】*   Mumps.\n\n【41】*   Influenza.\n\n【42】*   Herpes simplex virus.\n\n【43】*   Varicella zoster.\n\n【44】*   Lymphocytic choriomeningitis.\n\n【45】**Fungal Meningitis**:\n\n【46】*   Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\n【47】*   Candida.\n\n【48】*   Histoplasma.\n\n【49】*   Blastomyces.\n\n【50】*   Coccidioides.\n\n【51】**Protozoa and Parasites Meningitis**:\n\n【52】*   Toxoplasma.\n\n【53】*   Amoeba.\n\n【54】*   Cysticercus.\n\n【55】**Non-infectious Meningitis:**\n\n【56】**Malignant Disease**:\n\n【57】*   Breast cancer.\n\n【58】*   Bronchial cancer.\n\n【59】*   Leukemia.\n\n【60】*   Lymphoma.\n\n【61】**Inflammatory Disease**:\n\n【62】*   Sarcoidosis.\n\n【63】*   Behcet's disease.\n\n【64】*   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n【65】What Are the Laboratory Diagnostic Tests to Be Carried Out?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestation and cerebrospinal fluid examination. The cerebrospinal fluid is obtained by lumbar puncture under aseptic conditions. A lumbar puncture is necessary until and unless there are contraindications such as increased intracranial pressure, unstable patient, skin infection at the site of lumbar puncture, thrombocytopenia, and papilloedema. It is always recommended to obtain a computed tomography (CT) to exclude a mass lesion such as a cerebral abscess before lumbar puncture because of the risk of conning. It is collected in three sterile containers for cell count, biochemical analysis, and bacterial examination. The sample should be examined immediately after collection or placed in the incubator at thirty-seven-degree centigrade.\n\n【67】*   In bacterial meningitis, the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) is usually cloudy or turbid due to more than 1000 x 106 cells per liter of neutrophils.\n\n【68】*   The total protein content is usually significantly elevated, and glucose levels are markedly diminished or absent.\n\n【69】*   Gram film and culture may allow the identification of the organism.\n\n【70】*   Blood cultures may be positive.\n\n【71】*   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can be used on blood and CSF to identify bacterial deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA).\n\n【72】What Is the Management of Neonatal Meningitis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【73】The treatment protocol aims to sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid of any meningitis-causing pathogens. A repeated lumbar puncture is recommended twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the initial treatment to declare sterilization. It is important to start the treatment as soon as possible. Delayed treatment may lead to cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness.\n\n【74】Drugs such as antimicrobial agents are recommended that act upon bacterial infections. A combination of Ampicillin, with an aminoglycoside Gentamicin, and third generation Cephalosporin such as Cefotaxime is recommended for early onset meningitis. A regimen of antistaphylococcal antibiotics such as Nafcillin or Vancomycin, with Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, or Ceftaxidime with or without an aminoglycoside is usually recommended for late-onset neonatal meningitis.\n\n【75】In the case of herpes simplex virus-derived meningitis, antiviral therapy such as Acyclovir or Vidarabine is used. Depending upon the severity of the disease, the infant may require other therapies, such as\n\n【76】*   **Anticonvulsant Drugs:** If the infant undergoes seizures.\n\n【77】*   Intracranial pressure should be monitored using an intracranial pressure monitoring device.\n\n【78】*   It may also require evaluation for cerebral abscess.\n\n【79】*   It may also require evaluation for hydrocephalus.\n\n【80】*   **Supportive therapy includes:** Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance and maintaining temperature.\n\n【81】There are various vaccines available to prevent bacterial meningitis. However, vaccines are not hundred percent effective against these bacteria. They also do not protect against all strains of bacteria. The prognosis of the disease depends on the patient's age, the illness's duration, complications, pathogens involved, and the individual's immune status. Patients with viral meningitis usually have an excellent prognosis. The prognosis is worse for patients at extremes of ages, such as children under two years or adults over sixty years. Patients with impaired levels of consciousness are at higher risk for developing neurologic sequelae.\n\n【82】What Are the Complications of Neonatal Meningitis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【83】The complications of neonatal meningitis include\n\n【84】*   Obstructive hydrocephalus:\n\n【85】*   Hemorrhage.\n\n【86】*   Cerebral infarction.\n\n【87】*   Formation of brain abscess.\n\n【88】*   Increased intracranial pressure.\n\n【89】*   Subdural effusion or empyema or collection of pus in the brain.\n\n【90】*   Cerebral edema for which intravenous mannitol is given six to eight hours for the first few days.\n\n【91】*   Convulsions for which intravenous Diazepam can be given.\n\n【92】*   Ventriculitis is the inflammation of the ventricles in the brain, especially in bacterial infections.\n\n【93】*   Ataxia.\n\n【94】*   Stroke.\n\n【95】*   Shock, which is treated with intravenous fluid and maintenance of blood pressure.\n\n【96】**Conclusion**\n\n【97】Acute bacterial meningitis in neonates is a medical emergency, and any delay in instituting effective antimicrobial therapy may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to start the treatment as soon as possible. Delayed treatment may lead to cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness. The prognosis of the disease depends on the patient's age, the illness's duration, complications, pathogens involved, and the individual's immune status. Early intervention and treatment are highly beneficial for the patient to improve the conditions.\n\n【98】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【99】无关删除-1:<u>*   Neonatal Meningitis: Risk Factors, Causes, and Neurologic Complications  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307368/\n*   Neonatal meningitis  \n    https://www.meningitisnow.org/meningitis-explained/what-is-meningitis/types-and-causes/neonatal/\n*   Neonatal Meningitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532264/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Tigecycline shows a broad-spectrum activity and acts against drug-resistant gram-positive organisms. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005. Currently, Tigecycline is used for the treatment of community-spread pneumonia and infections of the skin, tissues, and abdomen. The dose of Tigecycline is 50 mg intravenously after a 100 mg loading dose every 12 hours.\n\n【2】The common side effects reported with Tigecycline therapy include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that may lead to the discontinuation of therapy. Other less frequently occurring adverse effects are increased alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time, and pancreatitis. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration suggested that Tigecycline has a higher mortality rate as compared to other antibiotics. However, high mortality is associated with lower success rates rather than the adverse effects of the drugs.\n\n【3】Why Is Tigecycline Prescribed?\n------------------------------\n\n【4】Tigecycline injection is used for the treatment of infections like:\n\n【5】*   Community-acquired pneumonia.\n\n【6】*   Skin infections.\n\n【7】*   Infections of the abdomen.\n\n【8】Tigecycline is not used to treat pneumonia in people who are on a ventilator and people with foot infections who have diabetes.\n\n【9】Does Tigecycline Cause Injury to the Liver?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Tigecycline can cause mild, transient elevations in aminotransferase levels in around two to five percent of the patients. Cases of liver injury with jaundice are very rare. However, isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, cholestasis, and jaundice have been identified post-marketing of the drug. The information regarding the latency, pattern, and duration of liver injury is not available in cases of hepatotoxicity caused by Tigecycline. Large clinical trials of Tigecycline have reported that jaundice and death from hepatic dysfunction are more likely due to the complications of multiorgan failure and sepsis rather than the hepatotoxicity caused by the drug.\n\n【11】How Does Tigecycline Cause Liver Injury?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The reason why the serum enzyme elevates during Tigecycline intravenous therapy is still unknown. Intravenous Tigecycline therapy given in high doses causes severe direct hepatic injury, including microvesicular steatosis, lactic acidosis, and hepatic failure. This can be due to direct mitochondrial injury and is similar to Reye's syndrome.\n\n【13】There is a minimal amount of metabolism that takes place in the liver, and Tigecycline is excreted as it is in the bile, feces, and urine; therefore, it does not cause any liver injury.\n\n【14】How Is the Duration of Tigecycline Treatment Associated With the Risk of Liver Injury?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The mechanism by which Tigecycline produces cholestatic liver injury is not clear. Tigecycline will increase hepatic fatty acid uptake and can induce steatosis. It has also been reported that the various tetracycline derivatives could lead to extensive microvesicular steatosis of the liver by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The side effects are observed more frequently in the high-dose group than in the approved dose group.\n\n【16】It has been reported that Tigecycline pharmacokinetics of Tigecycline in serum has a long half-life and a large volume of distribution. The excretion of unchanged Tigecycline through feces is the primary route of elimination that can be related to biliary passage function. Tigecycline accumulated in vivo after high dose application on a slow metabolism, and then it may activate immune-mediated bile duct injury with hyperbilirubinemia and markedly increased alkaline phosphatase.\n\n【17】A high dose of Tigecycline treatment is one of the factors leading to the occurrence of adverse side effects. Consequently, it is suggested that indicators, both liver function and bilirubin, should be closely monitored in patients receiving Tigecycline, especially if high doses and prolonged therapy are given. Therefore, maintaining diligent monitoring and keen insight is required. Doctors should pay particular attention to a high maintenance dose and prolonged Tigecycline dosage, as well as the associated use of drugs causing hepatotoxicity.\n\n【18】How to Diagnose Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The drug-induced liver injury occurs when serum alanine transaminase is five times more elevated than the upper limit of normal (ULN) or alkaline phosphatase elevation is two times the upper limit of normal. The alanine transaminase level reaches the upper limit of normal thrice, with the elevation of bilirubin twice greater than the upper limit of normal.\n\n【20】Hepatitis types of liver injury are defined by using the R-value (R = ALT ULN/ALP ULN).\n\n【21】If R ≥ 5 indicates hepatocellular injury while R < 2 indicates cholestatic injury, and an R-value between two and five suggests a mixed type of injury.\n\n【22】How to Treat Drug-Induced Liver Injury?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   In the case of Tigecycline, there is no dose adjustment required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, aminotransferase elevations rise above five times the upper limit of normal or are accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should have Tigecycline stopped, or the dosage of Tigecycline should be altered to 25 mg every 12 hours.\n\n【24】*   Once a drug-induced liver injury is suspected in a patient, firstly, the drug taken by the patient should be monitored. At the same time, it should also be discontinued if there are no positive results obtained by monitoring the dosage. It is highly important to assess the severity of the cholestatic liver injury. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine are widely used for cholestatic liver injury.\n\n【25】*   Patients with liver cirrhosis should be monitored during Tigecycline therapy for evidence of severe hepatic dysfunction. Patients on intravenous Tigecycline who develop sucrose-sensitivity to hepatic injury among the various tetracyclines are not known, but switching to another class of antibiotics would be more appropriate than changing to another tetracycline-like agent in patients who develop evidence of liver injury while receiving Tigecycline.\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】Currently, Tigecycline is used for the treatment of community-spread pneumonia and infections of the skin, tissues, and abdomen. The dose of Tigecycline is 50 mg intravenously after a 100 mg loading dose every 12 hours. The mechanism that causes liver injury could be related to the pharmacokinetics and esterification of Tigecycline. The high dose of Tigecycline treatment is one of the factors leading to the occurrence of adverse side effects. A high mortality rate is associated with lower success rates rather than the adverse effects of the drugs.\n\n【28】Consequently, it is suggested that indicators, both liver function and bilirubin, should be monitored properly in patients receiving Tigecycline, especially if high doses and prolonged therapy have to be given.\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>*   Tigecycline (Tygacil): the first in the glycylcycline class of antibiotics  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1426172/\n*   Real-World Data of Tigecycline-Associated Drug-Induced Liver Injury Among Patients in China: A 3-year Retrospective Study as Assessed by the Updated RUCAM  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.761167/full\n*   Tigecycline Induced Cholestatic Liver Injury: A Case Report  \n    https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-4-060.php?jid=jide</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The impact of trauma may be minute, moderate, or destructive. This impact depends on various factors. The traumatic stress reactions also vary from one person to another.\n\n【2】What Is Trauma?\n---------------\n\n【3】Traumatic events are those that put an individual into serious harm or death. During a traumatic event, one gets frightened and feels unsafe.\n\n【4】Trauma may happen due to\n\n【5】*   Accidents, violent attacks, and natural disasters.\n\n【6】*   Other reasons are childhood or intimate partner abuse, long-term disease, or due to COVID-19, like pandemic diseases.\n\n【7】*   Living in an unsafe environment.\n\n【8】*   Watching others getting hurt.\n\n【9】When trauma affects, the individual shows an automatic survival mechanism and responds. There is no control of an individual on this mechanism. Trauma may affect people of any age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. It may affect both adults and children.\n\n【10】Trauma may affect the individual in the following ways.\n\n【11】Due to trauma, the individual may get,\n\n【12】*   Frightened.\n\n【13】*   May feel under threat.\n\n【14】*   Feel humiliated, rejected, and abandoned.\n\n【15】*   May feel unsafe, unsupported, and invalidated.\n\n【16】*   Feel powerless, either trapped or ashamed.\n\n【17】Ways trauma may happen include,\n\n【18】*   One-off or an ongoing process.\n\n【19】*   Direct harm to an individual.\n\n【20】*   Observing other person being harmed.\n\n【21】*   Experiencing a traumatic atmosphere every day.\n\n【22】*   Getting affected by trauma in the family or community.\n\n【23】Trauma may influence the identity of the person harassed, bullied, or discriminated against.\n\n【24】**Other Traumas Include:**\n\n【25】**Racial Trauma:** Racism may cause some effects that may influence how individuals think, feel and behave. Affected persons may show symptoms due to this type of trauma.\n\n【26】**Adverse Childhood Experiences ( ACEs):** Some children may experience stressful and difficult situations like physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect. Many researches have shown evidence for the link between ACEs and mental and physical problems.\n\n【27】There are various types of reactions can be observed during trauma.\n\n【28】**Fight**: To fight the situation, being defensive and protesting.\n\n【29】**Flight:** Escape or run away from the situation.\n\n【30】**Freeze:** The individual is not able to make decisions or is unable to move.\n\n【31】**Fawn**: Individual tries to win or please the person hurting.\n\n【32】**Flop:** The individual may become unresponsive, fainting, or disconnected from the body.\n\n【33】Some of the physical changes during trauma include\n\n【34】*   Fast heartbeats.\n\n【35】*   Racing thoughts.\n\n【36】*   Fast breathing.\n\n【37】*   Vomiting.\n\n【38】*   Hands become cold.\n\n【39】*   Trembling.\n\n【40】*   Lightheadedness and vertigo (loss of balance).\n\n【41】These signs and symptoms prepare the individual to react to danger or trauma. Some people get back to normal within half an hour of the event. For some, these feelings may continue for long periods. Some may get stuck in danger even after the threat has passed. They may relive the event through flashbacks, panic attacks, anger, guilt, upset, and problem sleeping.\n\n【42】Trauma may lead to mental health problems. It may cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some may start using alcohol and drugs, or harm themselves, to cope with difficult situations. Depending on how the person is affected by trauma may pose difficulties in daily life.\n\n【43】What Are the Effects of Trauma on Mental Health?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Trauma may affect the individual, family, and even the person's community. Some may lead a life without lasting negative effects after the trauma but some face difficulties and experience traumatic stress reactions. If the person has a strong support system and resilient qualities, they may not get affected mentally.\n\n【45】**Common Effects of Trauma on Mental Health:**\n\n【46】**Flashbacks:** These make the individual like reliving the aspects of traumatic events. They may feel as if the event is happening now. It may happen whether the details are remembered or not by the individual.\n\n【47】**Panic Attacks:** It is the response of an individual showing fear. The responses to danger or trauma may become exaggerated in panic attacks.\n\n【48】**Dissociation:** The individual feels numb and feels the world is not real. This is one way to cope with stress.\n\n【49】**Hyperarousal:** The individual may feel anxious, find it difficult to relax, and may look out for danger or threats.\n\n【50】**Sleep Problems:** The individual finds it difficult to stay asleep, feels unsafe, and fears nightmares.\n\n【51】**Low Self-esteem:** The person may not value self and perceive self.\n\n【52】**Grief:** Many people experience grief after a loss or a traumatic event.\n\n【53】**Self-harm:** Individuals may hurt themselves to cope with the traumatic event.\n\n【54】**Suicidal Thoughts:** Along with suicidal thoughts, the individual may plan suicide methods.\n\n【55】**Alcohol or Substance Misuse:** The individual may misuse alcohol and other substances to cope with traumatic events.\n\n【56】**Self-blame:** Individuals affected feel as if they are to blame. This may create shame or guilt though the individual is not responsible.\n\n【57】**Trauma and Physical Health Problems:**\n\n【58】Trauma may lead to physical health problems that may include chronic illness. Trauma affects both the body and mind. Hence long-term illnesses may develop. These physical health problems may create stress and anxiety and pose difficulty in coping with the trauma.\n\n【59】**Other Effects of Trauma:**\n\n【60】The effects of trauma generally last for a long period, or it may come and go. There may be difficulties in carrying out the day-to-day activities.\n\n【61】The affected individual may face the following-\n\n【62】*   Difficulty in looking after self.\n\n【63】*   A problem in holding a job.\n\n【64】*   Regarding trusting others.\n\n【65】*   Maintaining friendships and relationships may take time and effort.\n\n【66】*   Difficulty in remembering and making decisions.\n\n【67】*   Problems in their sex life.\n\n【68】*   Face problems with changes occurring in life to get adjusted.\n\n【69】*   Difficulty in passing leisure time.\n\n【70】Some individuals may face serious problems in their ability to work due to trauma.\n\n【71】**Conclusion**\n\n【72】Trauma may pose problems in an individual’s life. A person’s quality of life gets affected, and they may suffer from many physical and mental health problems. Hence it is important to know about trauma and its effects on mental health. Knowing helps to seek help from healthcare providers early.

Genetic counseling provides concrete and accurate information about inherited disorders and helps people who are affected by inherited diseases to make informed choices about future reproduction. It also helps to educate people about inherited disorders and the pattern of inheritance. The process integrates the interpretation of the family and medical histories to assess the chances of disease occurrence or reoccurrence.\n\n【2】**What Are the Indications for Genetic Counseling?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Genetic counseling can be done for the following reasons-\n\n【4】*   Hereditary disease in a patient or family.\n\n【5】*   Birth defects.\n\n【6】*   Mental disorders.\n\n【7】*   Early onset of cancer in a family.\n\n【8】*   Miscarriages.\n\n【9】*   Malformations.\n\n【10】*   Tendency to develop a neurological condition.\n\n【11】*   Advanced maternal age.\n\n【12】**What Are the Steps of Genetic Counseling?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The steps involved in genetic counseling are as follows-\n\n【14】1.  **Diagnosis** \\- The first step required for proper diagnostic counseling is the correct diagnosis of the disease. The medical diagnostic persons will analyze the genetic background of the persons involved and assess the suspected disease that their child can develop.\n\n【15】2.  **Prognosis** \\- It refers to the judgment about how something is likely to develop in the future. The medical diagnostic persons will explain to the person in question about the chances of their child developing a disease.\n\n【16】3.  **Treatment** \\- The medical diagnostic person will provide a correct treatment plan to the individual and guide them about all the possible treatment options.\n\n【17】**What Is the Role of a Genetic Counselor, and How Is the Counseling Done?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Genetic counselors are board-certified healthcare professionals who have specialized education in medical genetics and counseling. Their role is to provide information about genetic conditions that can help patients make informed decisions about their genetic health. Genetic counselors work in a variety of specialties, such as preconception, prenatal, pediatric, cancer, cardiovascular, neurology, and research. Consulting a genetic counselor can help understand certain medical conditions that can affect a person and their family. During a genetic counseling session, a genetic counselor will ask questions about personal and family medical history.\n\n【19】Genetic counseling may also include discussions about genetic testing options available, including the benefits, limitations, and risks of testing. The genetic counselor will provide information about conditions of concern which may include the likelihood of inheriting certain conditions in a family and how that might affect the health of the concerned member. The genetic counselor will then review possible options for treatment or medical management changes that may improve the health. They will also provide resources to the patient to support them and inform them regarding possible opportunities to participate in research. A summary of the session is shared with the patient at last. The sessions can be provided in a private clinic or hospital or through a telephone or video consultation.\n\n【20】**What Are the Types of Genetic Counseling?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【21】There are two main types of genetic counseling-\n\n【22】*   **Prospective**\\- A screening test is done to cover the number of recessive defects. If the screening tests come abnormal, the patient is advised to undergo genetic counseling.\n\n【23】*   **Retrospective**\\- This type of counseling is done after a certain condition has occurred, like a child born with birth defects, pregnancy termination, sterilization, etc.\n\n【24】**What Are the Benefits of Genetic Counseling?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The importance of genetic counseling is explained below-\n\n【26】1.  **Increased Understanding** \\- Genetic screening tests can help know the likelihood of a fetus being born with Down’s syndrome (genetic disorder causing abnormal cell division and producing an extra copy of chromosome 21), cystic fibrosis (inherited disease that cause lung damage), Tay-Sachs disease (inherited disorder that cause damage to the nerve cells of brain and spinal cord), or sickle cell anemia (disorder that cause blood cells to breakdown).\n\n【27】2.  **Better Peace of Mind** \\- For parents who are aware about a family history of a particular condition or disease, it can be beneficial to know that they do not carry that gene.\n\n【28】3.  **Early Intervention** \\- In some cases, genetic testing can uncover a hidden gene mutation that puts an individual at risk of developing a deadly disease. Genetic counselors help to understand the cause of the condition and methods to prevent it from developing or spreading.\n\n【29】4.  **Appropriate Testing** \\- A genetic counselor can help people determine what tests are most appropriate.\n\n【30】5.  **Decision Making** \\- Genetic counselors help to understand diagnosis, testing options, and underlying causes of genetic disorders and also guide through any decision-making regarding genetic testing or family planning.\n\n【31】**What Are the Ethical Issues Faced in Genetic Counseling?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】There are some ethical issues that are often faced during genetic counseling, such as-\n\n【33】*   The right to know or not know is a debatable issue in genetic counseling. This term refers to the information that the patients want to know or do not want to know.\n\n【34】*   Any involvement of other members of the family in the decision-making process of the involved individual might hamper the outcome.\n\n【35】*   There are some cases in which the confidentiality of the patient’s information might get overruled to help prevent health damage to other people.\n\n【36】*   There are certain diseases and conditions for which genetic testing is not permitted.\n\n【37】*   The inclusion of minors in genetic testing is controversial.\n\n【38】**What Are the Policies of Genetic Counseling?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】There are a few policies upon which genetic counseling relies, that include-\n\n【40】*   The patient has the right to make their own medical decision without the judgment of others.\n\n【41】*   The genetic counselor can only guide in making decisions and not involve themselves completely in the decision-making process.\n\n【42】*   Every patient has the right to receive correct information and a proper treatment plan.\n\n【43】*   The patient’s information should be kept confidential.\n\n【44】**What Are the Limitations of Genetic Counseling?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】There are certain limitations in the field of genetic counseling-\n\n【46】*   Lack of awareness about genetic counseling.\n\n【47】*   Lack of interest in being involved in genetic counseling.\n\n【48】*   The cost of genetic counseling and genetic testing can be expensive.\n\n【49】*   Genetic counseling is a lengthy process, and the involved individual may not get desired results.\n\n【50】*   There are certain diseases and conditions for which genetic testing is permitted.\n\n【51】*   The inclusion of minors in genetic testing is a sensitive area.\n\n【52】**Conclusion-**\n\n【53】Genetic counseling can help many people understand the basics of genes and uncover their genetic disorders. This counseling can provide valuable information and guide them to make the right choices to plan treatment options and also prevent or manage any condition that an individual might suffer from due to genetic predisposition.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Genetic Counseling  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/genetic\\_counseling.htm\n*   Understanding Genetics: A New York, Mid-Atlantic Guide for Patients and Health Professionals.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK115552/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The pulmonary trunk is a large blood vessel that arises from the heart's right ventricle and carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. At the fifth thoracic vertebra level, the pulmonary trunk divides into two branches; the left and right pulmonary arteries, which enter the left and right lungs.\n\n【2】What Is Pulmonary Trunk Bifurcation?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】The pulmonary trunk bifurcation is a critical point in the cardiovascular system. It marks the beginning of pulmonary circulation, which is responsible for oxygenating the blood and removing carbon dioxide. Therefore, any abnormalities or obstructions at this point can affect blood flow to the lungs and lead to various pulmonary disorders.\n\n【4】What Is the Location of Pulmonary Trunk Bifurcation?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The pulmonary trunk bifurcation is where the pulmonary trunk, a large blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, divides into two smaller branches called the left and right pulmonary arteries. This bifurcation typically occurs at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5) posteriorly and the sternal angle (angle of Louis) anteriorly.\n\n【6】To give a more general location, the sternal angle is located at the level of the second rib and the intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae. The pulmonary trunk bifurcation is slightly lower at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>D-Transposition of the Great Vessels - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Pulmonary Trunk Bifurcation - An Overview</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Lung Circulation Diseases - Types, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【12】What Are the Functions of Pulmonary Trunk Bifurcation?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   The pulmonary trunk bifurcation, also known as the pulmonary artery bifurcation, is where the pulmonary trunk divides into two branches known as the left and right pulmonary arteries. This bifurcation is an essential feature of the pulmonary circulation system. Its function includes directing blood flow to the lungs, regulating oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, and maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis.\n\n【14】*   One of the primary functions of the pulmonary trunk bifurcation is to direct deoxygenated blood from the heart's right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. The right and left pulmonary arteries branch out from the bifurcation and extend into the right and left lungs. The branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries allows for the efficient distribution of blood to the different regions of the lungs, providing optimal oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide.\n\n【15】*   The pulmonary trunk bifurcation also plays a crucial role in regulating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood. Blood flows through the pulmonary arteries and passes through the network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli in the lungs. As a result, oxygen from the air diffuses in the alveoli into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled out of the body.\n\n【16】*   Another function of the pulmonary trunk bifurcation is to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. The pulmonary arteries help to regulate blood pressure in the lungs, and the branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries provides a large surface area for gas exchange to occur. This efficient gas exchange helps to maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body, which is crucial for proper cellular function.\n\n【17】Is Pulmonary Trunk Bifurcation Normal Anatomy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk is a normal anatomical feature. The pulmonary trunk is a large blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. At the base of the heart, the pulmonary trunk divides into two smaller blood vessels called the right and left pulmonary arteries that provide blood to the left and right lungs, accordingly. The bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk occurs during fetal development and is necessary to establish separate blood supplies to the right and left lungs.\n\n【19】What Are the Diseases That Affect the Pulmonary Trunk?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The pulmonary trunk is a large blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs. Therefore, diseases that affect the pulmonary trunk can have significant consequences for the overall health and function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Some of the most common diseases that affect the pulmonary trunk include:\n\n【21】*   **Pulmonary Hypertension:** This condition is characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to enlargement and thickening of the pulmonary trunk. Various underlying conditions, including heart disease, lung disease, and genetic factors, can cause pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【22】*   **Pulmonary Embolism:** This is a blockage of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, typically caused by a blood clot that has traveled from another part of the body. Getting early medical assistance for pulmonary embolism is crucial since it can be fatal.\n\n【23】*   **Pulmonary Valve Stenosis:** This narrowing of the pulmonary valve can impede blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary trunk. Pulmonary valve stenosis can be congenital or acquired, leading to fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n【24】*   **Tetralogy of Fallot:** This is a congenital heart defect that includes a combination of four different abnormalities, including pulmonary stenosis, a ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Tetralogy of Fallot can lead to low oxygen levels in the blood and may require surgery to correct it.\n\n【25】*   **Aortic Dissection:** Although this condition primarily affects the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart, it can also impact the pulmonary trunk. Aortic dissection occurs when the aorta's inner surface separates, causing blood to flow between the layers and potentially leading to a blockage of the pulmonary trunk.\n\n【26】As mentioned above, a few diseases can affect the pulmonary trunk. Treatment for these conditions will depend on the underlying cause, severity of symptoms, and overall health of the individual. However, prompt diagnosis and management of pulmonary trunk diseases can help improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【27】**Conclusion:**\n\n【28】The pulmonary trunk bifurcation is a vital component of the pulmonary circulatory system, responsible for directing blood flow to the lungs, regulating oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, and maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. The location and angle of the bifurcation may vary slightly between individuals, but the presence of the bifurcation itself is a standard and essential feature of the cardiovascular system.\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anatomy, Thorax, Heart Pulmonary Arteries  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534812/\n*   Pulmonary trunk  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-trunk\n*   Pulmonary vascular anatomy & anatomical variants  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039811/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Women's right to request and receive labor pain was controversial – linked to religious belief in the nineteenth century. They viewed pain, including labor pain, as divine punishment, and interference was considered sinful. Nevertheless, many women in the modern community wish to have pain management either by analgesia or anesthesia during labor and delivery. Obstetric anesthesia combines art and science, dealing with the lives of the mother and the newborn. An obstetric anesthesiologist has now become an essential member of the peripartum care team, who works closely with obstetricians, perinatologists, neonatologists, and midwives to guarantee the pregnant woman receives the best possible care. Obstetrics is the only practice carried out daily in numerous centers in every corner of the world.\n\n【2】Obstetric anesthesiologists require in-depth knowledge and experience about the techniques and medications used for pain relief during labor. It is well known that the pain response varies from individual to individual. Physicians are committed to providing comfortable or at least tolerable labor and delivery. Many patients are tense and apprehensive at the onset of labor, although they may have little or no discomfort. The physician must be aware of the options for pain relief and respond to the patient's needs and wishes.\n\n【3】**What Are the Types of Analgesia for Labor?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Almost all women experience severe labor pain during childbirth. This experience varies from individual to individual, and various methods to alleviate pain are chosen depending on the options given by the obstetrician.\n\n【5】**What Are the Types of Labor Analgesia?**\n\n【6】Labor analgesia can be of two types - Non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods.\n\n【7】**Non-pharmacological Methods:**\n\n【8】The administration is easy and has minimal side effects, but they are costly and time-consuming.\n\n【9】*   **Some of the Non-pharmacological Methods Include-** Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), focus on breathing with meditation, modulation of temperature with spa techniques and hypnotherapy, and aromatherapy.\n\n【10】*   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)-** Used to reduce pain in labor, two electrodes are placed on the lower back on either side of the spine. The machine delivers small pulses of electric current to the body. The patient can alter the amount of current supplied to the electrodes as and when needed during contractions.\n\n【11】**Pharmacological Methods:**\n\n【12】Inhalation of nitrous oxide and halogenated gasses.\n\n【13】*   **Nitrous Oxide Inhalation:** Has been used in obstetrics for centuries; Etonox gas, a combination of 50 % nitrous oxide in oxygen, provides analgesia within 20 to 30 seconds of inhalation, with a maximum effect after about 45 seconds. It is straightforward to use, does not require supervision, and can be administered by the patient. However, it is not allowed to be self-administered by the patient. It causes drowsiness, disorientation, and nausea.\n\n【14】*   **Inhalation of Halogenated Agents**: Sevoflurane and Desflurane are used intermittently during labor for analgesia.\n\n【15】*   **Systemic Analgesics:** Analgesics (painkillers) such as Meperidine, Morphine, Fentanyl, Remifentanil, and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) are used. PCA is useful in patients who are contraindicated to general anesthesia.\n\n【16】**What Are the Regional Techniques for Labor Analgesia?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The most efficient form of labor analgesia is neuraxial analgesia, commonly used during labor and delivery with minimal side effects. These include traditional epidural, spinal, or combined spinal-epidural \\[CSE\\] analgesia, dural puncture epidural, and spinal analgesia.\n\n【18】*   **Epidural Analgesia:**\n\n【19】In this technique, an epidural catheter of about a 19 to 29-gauge spinal needle is placed in the epidural space to administer analgesia. Maintenance of analgesia is possible with intermittent bolus injections, continuous infusion, or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). The risk and benefits of epidural analgesia should be assessed and discussed with the patient before labor.\n\n【20】*   **Combined Spinal-Epidural Analgesia (CSEA):**\n\n【21】Combined spinal-epidural analgesia has gained popularity over the past few decades because of its fast-acting analgesic effect. However, this technique has a high risk of fetal bradycardia.\n\n【22】The epidural space is located with an epidural needle, and a spinal needle of 25 to 27 gauge is passed through the epidural needle, and the dura is punctured. Next, a local anesthetic, with or without opioids, is injected into the subarachnoid space. Next, the spinal needle is withdrawn, and a 19 to 20-gauge epidural catheter is introduced through the epidural needle to maintain subsequent doses.\n\n【23】*   **Dural Puncture Epidural Technique (DPE):**\n\n【24】This technique is effective only when a 26 gauge needle is used to puncture the dura-arachnoid space. This technique reduces the occurrence of frequent uterine contractions and hypertonia.\n\n【25】*   **Continuous Spinal Technique:**\n\n【26】This is used only in patients with a previous history of cardiac disease for whom the slow onset of anesthesia is preferred with adequate anesthetic coverage and quality.\n\n【27】*   **Spinal Analgesia:**\n\n【28】Smaller doses of local anesthetics Bupivacaine 5 to 8mg, with opioid (Fentanyl 10-25μg ), should be used to carry C-sections successfully. The anesthetic dosage is based on various factors such as height, weight, and age. Additional doses may be required during labor due to the low-dose regimen. The common side effects are arterial hypotension, spinal headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【29】*   **Caudal Analgesia:**\n\n【30】Caudal analgesia is helpful in those patients whose labor pain has commenced already and who are suffering from pain. It provides the mother with relatively comfortable labor and painless delivery. The vitals and consciousness levels of the mother and the newborn are not altered. The patient can follow a regular diet and fluid intake, and thus there is no disturbance to the mother's metabolism. This method is not intended to be used in case of placenta previa, uterine inertia, and disproportion of the child to the placenta or any other underlying abnormalities.\n\n【31】What Are the Complications of Obstetric Anesthesia?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】1.  **Hypotension:** The decreased venous return to the heart due to the dilation and resistance of the vessels.\n\n【33】2.  **Fetal Bradycardia:** Decreased preload following spinal anesthesia triggers the reflex that causes severe bradycardia (slow heart rate).\n\n【34】3.  **Post Dural Puncture Headache:** The decrease of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which causes cerebral hypotension, adenosine activation, and subsequent dilatation of cerebral arteries to enhance cerebral blood flow, is regarded to be the headache's primary cause. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is more during standing and sitting. Can minimize this leakage by lying. These headaches develop within the first 72 hours, and the patient develops neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, hearing loss, and continuous ringing in the ear.\n\n【35】4.  **Maternal Fever and Back Pain**: These are due to the side effect of the spinal anesthesia given during childbirth. Fever lasts for about a few days after surgery, but back pain persists in some patients but gradually decreases.\n\n【36】5.  **Inadvertent Intravascular Injection of Local Anesthetics**: Nerve injuries caused by regional anesthesia can be caused by direct nerve trauma, chemical injury, or compressive injury. Direct nerve trauma occurs during the placement of the central neuraxial block, in which needles and catheters can cause fluid to be injected. This immediate trauma results in transient neuritis that usually settles within three months to a year. These injuries can cause paraesthesia, loss of sensation, and muscle weakness in the affected nerve's distribution.\n\n【37】6.  **High or Total Spinal Anesthesia:** Preoperative evaluation height of the block and quality is highly subjective, and techniques vary. According to anesthetist surveys, the modality of evaluation and the height of the block - the loss of cold or light response to stimuli is most frequently used. The most commonly mentioned block height that anesthetists focus on before a cesarean section is the bilateral loss of cold sensation below the fourth thoracic vertebrae bilaterally and the bilateral block to light touch to the fifth thoracic vertebrae.\n\n【38】7.  **Infection at the Site of Injection, Meningitis:** Due to lumbar puncture for spinal anesthesia. This results in a break in the defense barrier of the central nervous system, thus predisposing to the risk of transmission of microbes or chemicals to meninges and subarachnoid space through bleeding caused by the puncture of the needle.\n\n【39】8.  **Peripheral Nerve Injury:** Neuraxial blocks used during labor as a part of analgesia cause nerve injury. These nerve injuries are due to trauma to the nerve, chemicals, or due to any compression of the nerve.\n\n【40】**Conclusion:**\n\n【41】During labor, women experience severe pain throughout the lifespan of their life. Recent advances in managing pain during childbirth have drastically improved maternal and newborn outcomes. Improvements in neuraxial labor analgesia techniques, postpartum pain management strategies, and anticipation of maternal hypotension during cesarean delivery have improved the results. Obstetric anesthetics must be tailored for each patient to enhance patient safety and ease the process of labor. Morbidity and mortality have gradually decreased with the advances in the modern practice of obstetric anesthesia.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anesthesia Drugs in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Practice  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709327/\n*   General Anaesthesia in Obstetrics  \n    https://www.bjaed.org/article/S2058-5349(20)30042-1/fulltext#relatedArticles\n*   Update in Obstetric Anaesthesia: A Ten Question Review  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345034370\\_Update\\_in\\_Obstetric\\_Anaesthesia\\_A\\_Ten\\_Question\\_Review</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This can further complicate the already existing issue for the patient. There are a number of complications a patient may face due to different causes. Prompt recognition and treatment will help improve the quality of living of the already compromised individual. But before the complications can be discussed, one has to understand what a stoma is.\n\n【2】What Is Stoma?\n--------------\n\n【3】A stoma is a surgical opening a doctor makes in the abdomen if a patient cannot have a natural bowel movement. The surgeon will attach the end of the colon to the stoma; bowel movements will exit the body through the stoma and are collected in a pouch that has to be emptied. The conditions requiring a stoma are:\n\n【4】*   Cancer.\n\n【5】*   Crohn’s disease.\n\n【6】*   Birth defects.\n\n【7】*   Injury to the colon.\n\n【8】*   A bowel blockage or tear.\n\n【9】*   Pouches in the colon are called diverticulitis.\n\n【10】What Are the Problems a Stoma Patients Encounter?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】A patient with a stoma may face local problems and subsequent systemic disorders, such as:\n\n【12】*   Inadequate blood supply (ischemia).\n\n【13】*   Infection- this site can become a site for infection by pathogens.\n\n【14】*   Fistula\\- an undesired passage between the bowel and the skin.\n\n【15】*   Prolapse of the bowel out into the skin.\n\n【16】*   Leaking of the bowel into the skin causes irritation and erosion.\n\n【17】*   The most common complication related to stoma is skin problems.\n\n【18】What Are Skin Problems Related to Stoma?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   Irritant dermatitis.\n\n【20】*   Infectious dermatitis.\n\n【21】*   Folliculitis (the inflammation of hair follicles).\n\n【22】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【23】*   Pyoderma gangrenosum (a rare skin condition associated with painful ulcers).\n\n【24】*   Infections: the skin around the stoma may be damp and prone to infections.\n\n【25】*   Fungal.\n\n【26】*   Bacterial.\n\n【27】*   Viral.\n\n【28】1\\. **Skin Infection:** Microorganisms may multiply in the skin around the stoma as the area is warm, humid, and prone to infections. The skin infection is more likely if the patient is generally immuno-compromised.\n\n【29】*   Bacterial Infections Include:\n\n【30】*   Secondary infection in the surgical site.\n\n【31】*   Impetigo.\n\n【32】*   Bacterial folliculitis or boils.\n\n【33】*   Cellulitis.\n\n【34】It is confirmed by swabs.\n\n【35】*   Viral Infections Include:\n\n【36】*   Viral warts.\n\n【37】*   Molluscum contagiosum.\n\n【38】*   Herpes simplex.\n\n【39】*   Fungal Infections Include:\n\n【40】*   Candidiasis or thrush.\n\n【41】*   Dermatophyte infection.\n\n【42】*   Malassezia.\n\n【43】It is confirmed by skin scrapings.\n\n【44】**2\\. Inflammatory Skin Disease:** If the stoma is leaking or because of an underlying skin condition, the skin around the stoma may become inflamed papules, or ulceration may form. Papules due to viral warts, cancer, and Crohn’s disease; ulceration may arise due to trauma. Periodic pouch changes can lead to mechanical trauma. The skin may develop rashes around the stoma.\n\n【45】*   **Irritant Contact Dermatitis**: Irritant dermatitis may develop due to mechanical trauma due to ill-fitting appliances. This might cause mechanical stripping due to frequent friction leading to epidermal damage. Common causes include:\n\n【46】*   Frequent contact of skin to bowel content or urine.\n\n【47】*   The skin was stripped by the removal of the appliance.\n\n【48】*   Certain cleaners or bleaches.\n\n【49】*   Constant friction from the appliance.\n\n【50】*   Humidity.\n\n【51】*   Pre-existing skin conditions such as eczema.\n\n【52】Irritant contact dermatitis may appear as red papules (small bumps) or plaques (patches) and scaling. It is usually sore and itchy. It might affect the entire area or appear as a crescent shape below the appliance.\n\n【53】*   **Allergic Contact Dermatitis:** The appearance of allergic dermatitis is similar to that of contact dermatitis; its occurrence is, however, less common. But allergic dermatitis will affect the entire area in contact with the appliance and even spread to wider areas.\n\n【54】Allergies may be caused due to the material of the appliance or the pouch, such as acrylic resin, fragrance, parabens, or cleansing agents and deodorizers. Patch tests must be done to identify the allergens and avoid them.\n\n【55】**3\\. Psoriasis:** It occurs in patients who either are already suffering from psoriasis or have a genetic predisposition to it. The mechanical stripping of skin while removal of the pouch may trigger psoriasis. It presents as sharply defined plaques or patches of scaly red skin. That extends beyond the stoma. It is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【56】**4\\. Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** It presents as painful ulcers. The ulcers may be bluish, undermined, and with ill-defined edges. The skin surrounding the ulcer may be red and swollen. It may be caused by mechanical trauma due to the pouch, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease may have a predisposition to it.\n\n【57】**5\\. Seborrhoeic Dermatitis:** It is similar to dermatitis in appearance to irritant dermatitis or psoriasis. It presents as scaling and rashes.\n\n【58】**6\\. Folliculitis:** Hair follicles may cause irritation and, thereby, inflammation. It may resemble candidiasis and presents as a red pus-filled area.\n\n【59】**7\\. Granulomas:** Lump-like lesions in the skin are called granulomas. It may occur near the stoma due to\n\n【60】*   Poor healing.\n\n【61】*   Infection.\n\n【62】*   Stomal skin morphs into bowel tissue.\n\n【63】*   Crohn’s disease.\n\n【64】**8\\. Color Changes:** The skin color around the stoma may change due to inflammation.\n\n【65】*   **Red or Pink**\\- Due to the formation of new blood vessels.\n\n【66】*   **Brown Color**\\- Due to inflammatory pigmentation, it may fade eventually.\n\n【67】*   **Other Colors**\\- This may be due to urinary deposits.\n\n【68】How to Treat Skin Conditions?\n-----------------------------\n\n【69】*   **Infections:** Proper cleaning with antiseptic can prevent infection. Antibiotics may be required to treat severe infections.\n\n【70】*   **Dermatitis:**\n\n【71】1\\. Improving the fit of the appliance.\n\n【72】2\\. Hydrocolloid dressing under the pouch.\n\n【73】3\\. Antiperspirant to avoid moisture from sweat.\n\n【74】4\\. Topical steroids.\n\n【75】*   **Sucralfate**: This may be used on erosions.\n\n【76】*   **Psoriasis:** Treatment of psoriasis includes steroids.\n\n【77】*   **Topical:** Tacrolimus\n\n【78】*   **Systemic:** Ciclosporin, Minocycline, Dapsone.\n\n【79】*   **Folliculitis:** Antibacterial powder may help reduce incidence.\n\n【80】How Topical Steroids Can Help Improve the Conditions?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【81】**Topical steroids:** Used under the bag to treat and prevent inflammatory conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. It should be applied once daily for three to four weeks.\n\n【82】How to Prevent Skin Problems In Stoma Patients?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【83】*   The patient must be made aware of the potential skin problems, and adequate care should be taken to prevent them from arising.\n\n【84】*   Keep the area clean and dry.\n\n【85】*   Use a skin seal or barrier; this prevents moisture.\n\n【86】*   Periodically changing the pouch.\n\n【87】**Conclusion:**\n\n【88】Stoma patients are individuals with pre-existing systemic disorders. The patients often require pouches for the collection and removal of bowel waste as a result of the treatment for their systemic conditions. For this reason, prevention of local and systemic complications that may arise due to the stoma bag is important in improving their quality of life.\n\n【89】Skin problems due to stomas can be significantly reduced or prevented by educating them about the potential complications of the same. Proper cleaning, prevention of mechanical trauma, and use of topical steroids can be used to prevent and treat the conditions.\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>*   Peristomal Dermatology  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780183/\n*   Skin problems in stoma patients  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20465716/\n*   Skin problems from stomas  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/skin-problems-from-stomas</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e9ff4065-023d-412f-a47e-3ced174324d5", "title": "Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung In Children", "text": "【0】Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung In Children\nWhat Is Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung seen in the mother's womb is a mass or growth of the lung tissue that may not function well but can grow in size. It is also known as congenital pulmonary airway malformation. It is a rare congenital malformation. The mortality rate is much higher than around 30 % of children present with a cystic adenomatoid malformation in the lung. But these figures may not match the children who do not show any symptoms.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lungs is caused by the abnormal growth of lung tissue which continues to grow and does not function properly. These cystic adenomatoid are benign and not genetically inherited, so they do not pass to the upcoming generations. It is the abnormal growth of lung tissues.\n\n【4】When Does Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung Development Occur?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Cystic adenomatoid lung malformation develops at 18 to 26 weeks of gestation. But there will be rapid growth during the 20 and 25 th week of pregnancy. Any genetic defects do not cause it.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The signs and symptoms of cystic adenomatoid malformation are diagnosed during the 18 to 26 weeks of pregnancy with the help of regular ultrasound that is performed during the pregnancy.\n\n【8】*   The very first sign of congenital cystic adenomatoid is the pregnant mother who measures bigger than the usual size for her due date because of too much amniotic fluid. This is due to the congenital cystic adenoma pushing the heart and esophagus of the fetus, which prevents the swallowing of amniotic fluid by the fetus.\n\n【9】*   A large cystic adenomatoid causes a condition called hydrops, in which there will be a severe accumulation of fluid in the skin, chest, and abdomen, which causes severe heart failure. As the cystic adenomatoid presses the heart, it reduces the blood supply to the heart and results in heart failure.\n\n【10】*   About ten percent of all fetuses with cystic adenomatoid develop hydrops. Hydrops is the condition where there is excessive amniotic fluid in the mother's womb.\n\n【11】*   Untreated fetuses with hydrops or congenital cystic adenomatoid will not survive.\n\n【12】*   The mass or the abnormal tissue growth in congenital cystic adenomatoid will grow large and limit the growth of the lungs causing pulmonary hypoplasia, which is called small lungs.\n\n【13】*   The mass or the tissue growth pushes the heart and esophagus of the fetus, which prevents swallowing amniotic fluid that results in polyhydramnios or too much amniotic fluid.\n\n【14】How to Diagnose Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   The cystic adenomatoid malformation is generally diagnosed by a routine ultrasound done during pregnancy, in which an ultrasound shows a bright mass in the chest region.\n\n【16】*   The size of the mass changes gradually throughout the pregnancy.\n\n【17】*   The ultrasound also shows deviated position of the heart.\n\n【18】Can a Child With Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung Survive?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】If the size of the tissue is small, then the mass will shrink on its own. In most cases, the infant will survive. In very rare cases, there will be fetal death. Usually, the cyst will be harmless. But proper diagnosis and early intervention will cause further damage to the infant.\n\n【20】What Is the Treatment for Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】*   Most babies with cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung are treated soon after birth.\n\n【22】*   In very few cases, the treatment is done before the delivery through fetal intervention.\n\n【23】*   Most infants with cystic adenomatoid will not have any symptoms, but in a few cases, the infants may develop difficulty breathing and require oxygen, and a breathing machine called a ventilator is put on.\n\n【24】*   Infants without any symptoms can be discharged after a few days of observation.\n\n【25】*   A CT scan is recommended after three months of age just to confirm if there is any mass or tissue growth left shrunk in the infant's lungs.\n\n【26】*   The mass or the tissue growth should be removed surgically by the pediatric surgeon and a radiologist.\n\n【27】*   Even though the child does not exhibit any symptoms, the tissue mass has to be surgically removed in order to prevent the mass from causing breathing problems in the future or may transform into a cancerous tumor.\n\n【28】*   Fetal intervention is done only when there is heart failure in the fetus, and the surgery is performed on the mother; it is just like a C- section procedure where the surgeon removes the mass from the fetus.\n\n【29】How Is the Surgery Performed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【30】*   The surgery is performed under anesthesia.\n\n【31】*   The surgery is performed using many tiny telescopic instruments.\n\n【32】*   Very small multiple incisions are given than giving a large chest incision to avoid scars.\n\n【33】*   Very tiny scissors are used.\n\n【34】*   And the child is discharged immediately after three to four days. When the child is breathing comfortably and able to drink formula milk or breast milk, and is comfortable on pain medications, the child will be discharged.\n\n【35】*   The child should not be discharged if any of the following symptoms still persist, and post-discharge from the hospital also, the utmost care has to be taken.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】The congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation is a rare benign lung lesion that occurs in the fetus due to the abnormal tissue growth in the lung, causing difficulty in breathing and hindering lung development and also causing increased amniotic fluid in the pregnant mother which can be treated immediately after birth or any complications like heart failure arises then fetal intervention has to be performed which is similar to C-section. The procedure is done by a pediatric surgeon using tiny instruments with tiny incisions which cause minor scars. This mass will shrink on its own, but if it does not shrink, then only surgical intervention is required. Once the surgery is done and the child can breathe comfortably, the patient will be discharged by prescribing a few medications like painkillers.\n\n【38】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【39】* * *\n\n【40】#### **1.**删除换行**Is It Possible to Cure Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation(CCAM)?**\n\n【41】Most newborns with CCAMs are symptomless at birth, but on rare occasions, an infant may have breathing problems and need oxygen, which a ventilator machine can provide. Depending on the severity of the CCAM, most kids are operated on shortly after birth or many months later. Fetal intervention may treat a select few severe conditions before delivery. Instead of making a single major chest incision, the procedure is typically performed on newborns using tiny telescopic equipment through extremely small incisions.\n\n【42】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation?**\n\n【43】A benign or non-cancerous mass of abnormal lung tissue known as a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is often found on one lung lobe. It has an equal frequency with both lungs.   \nCCAMs are distinguished into two types.  \nType 1:The presence of one or more large cysts with a closed sac that contains air, fluids, or semi-solid material.  \nType 2: Presence of cystic and solid abnormalities.\n\n【44】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Typical Method of Treatment For CPAM?**\n\n【45】Babies with CPAM should be born at a hospital with a NICU since they are more likely to experience difficulties during and after birth (neonatal intensive care unit). The size and severity of the lesion will determine the course of treatment for newborns with CPAM after delivery. In severe cases, surgery is required to remove the CPAM and prevent breathing issues as soon as possible after delivery.  \nAlthough, EXIT operation (operates on a damaged lung and removes the CPAM while the baby is still connected to the mother's placenta, which supplies your fetus with nutrition and oxygen. The CPAM is taken out once the baby is fully born. Performed eventually at the time of delivery) can be performed to remove the CPAM at birth.\n\n【46】#### **4.**删除换行**How Do Infants Acquire CPAM?**\n\n【47】The condition known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, or CPAM, has unknown origins. Since CPAM is not inherited, families often do not experience recurrence. The deformity is caused by lung tissue that develops abnormally, often in one lung lobe. The illness affects about 1 in 25,000 pregnancies, making it quite uncommon. Male children are significantly more likely to develop it than females. \n\n【48】#### **5.**删除换行**Is CPAM Potentially Fatal?**\n\n【49】Before birth, CPAM may develop so rapidly that it poses a life-threatening situation. Typically, this occurs between weeks 18 and 26 of pregnancy. The condition compresses the heart and lungs and results in organ failure. Neonatal surgery is required to prevent this condition.\n\n【50】#### **6.**删除换行**How to Diagnose Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation?**\n\n【51】A variety of diagnostic aids diagnose cystic adenomatoid malformation.  \n\\- Prenatal Ultrasound: It is often used to identify such conditions, using advanced prenatal imaging techniques to assess fetal anatomy and lung lesions.   \n\\- Fetal Echocardiogram: A pediatric cardiologist will perform prenatal echocardiography to assess heart anatomy and function.  \n\\- Fetal MRI: To assess anatomical information regarding lung damage.\n\n【52】#### **7.**删除换行**Can CPAM Recover on Its Own?**\n\n【53】Most infants with congenital pulmonary airway malformations do not experience life-threatening symptoms. Sometimes during pregnancy, in the third trimester, the lesions shrink or are no longer visible. Sometimes these lesions are present, but the lungs still grow properly.\n\n【54】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Duration of CPAM Surgery?**\n\n【55】The average operating time of CPAM was two and a half hours, ranging from one and a half hours to four hours. However, the average time to remove the chest drains ranges from one to five days. The patients were discharged within four to seven days.\n\n【56】#### **9.**删除换行**How Frequent Is CPAM in Infants?**\n\n【57】Congenital pulmonary airway malformation is typically rare, and the illness is seen in 1 in 25,000 pregnancies, making it quite uncommon. Male children are significantly more likely to develop it than females.\n\n【58】#### **10.**删除换行**When Does CPAM's Development Stop?**\n\n【59】Initially, one to two weeks of gestational ultrasound are recommended to assess the size of the CPAM. After around 26 to 28 weeks (6.5 to 7 months) of gestation, most CPAMs stop developing. At this stage, ultrasound is recommended every three to four weeks. A fetal MRI may be required if the CPAM enlarges in size.\n\n【60】#### **11.**删除换行**Is CCAM Inherited?**\n\n【61】It has no genetic or chromosomal origin; hence, it is not hereditary. The deformity is caused by lung tissue that develops abnormally in one lung lobe; it rarely occurs in families.\n\n【62】#### **12.**删除换行**What Brings About Fetal Lung Mass?**\n\n【63】Fetal lung lesions, also known as fetal lung masses, are lung malformations that appear before a baby is born. Most masses are solitary, while some may be connected to other congenital defects or hereditary conditions. \n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   Children with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung CT diagnosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443197/#:~:text=The%20main%20clinical%20manifestations%20are,pneumothorax%20by%20X%2Dray%20examination\n*   What is a CCAM?  \n    https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/congenital-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\n*   Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation  \n    https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/conditions/congenital-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is done when excess weight is causing serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. and the traditional methods to reduce obesity have become ineffective.\n\n【2】Some procedures work by reducing the amount of food consumed by the patient, and a few others decrease the body’s ability to absorb nutrients.

The criteria for the patient to be a candidate for any bariatric surgery are-\n\n【5】*   Body mass index greater than 40 even though there are no obesity-related comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, etc.\n\n【6】*   Body mass index equal to or more than 35 and at least one obesity-related comorbid condition.\n\n【7】*   Unsuccessful non-operative weight loss attempts.\n\n【8】*   Mental health clearance.\n\n【9】*   No medical contraindications to surgery.\n\n【10】What Are the Different Types of Bariatric Surgeries?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The procedures approved by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) are mentioned below-\n\n【12】**Sleeve Gastrectomy-** The stomach is a ‘J’ shaped structure with an inner lesser curvature and an outer greater curvature. After anesthesia, the surgeon will dissect almost 80 % of the outer greater curvature, leaving the stomach in the shape and size of a banana that will hold less food and liquids, thereby reducing the amount of food consumed.\n\n【13】The remaining stomach also does not produce the “hunger hormone,” also known as ghrelin; this decreases hunger, increases fullness, and controls blood sugar levels. As time progresses, the body will adjust itself to the changes and maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【14】The advantages of this procedure are-\n\n【15】1.  Shorter surgery time and less technique sensitivity.\n\n【16】2.  Also can be performed on patients with high-risk medical conditions.\n\n【17】3.  This procedure leaves room for other surgeries; if the expected result is not achieved, the surgeon can always go ahead with gastric bypass or other bariatric surgeries.\n\n【18】4.  It reduces the extra weight and improves associated medical conditions effectively.\n\n【19】The disadvantages of the procedure are-\n\n【20】1.  It is an irreversible procedure.\n\n【21】2.  It will cause or worsen acid reflux and heartburn.\n\n【22】3.  Compared to other bariatric procedures, it has less impact on metabolism.\n\n【23】**Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYBG)-** One of the most commonly performed procedures to reduce obesity and its related complications. The procedure needs two dissections- one is done horizontally to divide the stomach into a smaller upper pouch and the lower stomach.\n\n【24】The second dissection is done in the small intestine; these two dissections will divide the entire digestive tract into three parts-\n\n【25】1.  The first part contains the pharynx, esophagus, and pouch (part of the stomach).\n\n【26】2.  The second part contains the major stomach and the first section of the small intestine.\n\n【27】3.  The third part contains the remaining small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.\n\n【28】Now, the third part is sewn directly onto the pouch of the first part; this creates a new digestive tract. The food will pass through from the esophagus into the pouch, then into the small intestine, the rectum, and then the anus, thereby bypassing the second part.\n\n【29】The second part is sewn into the large intestine, which facilitates the drainage of the gastric juices secreted by the stomach and the first section of the small intestine.\n\n【30】These criss-cross attachments resemble the shape “Y,” hence the name.\n\n【31】The advantages of this procedure are-\n\n【32】1.  Reliable and long-lasting weight loss.\n\n【33】2.  Effective for the remission of obesity-associated conditions.\n\n【34】3.  Refined and standardized technique.\n\n【35】The disadvantages of the procedure are-\n\n【36】1.  High risk of small bowel obstruction.\n\n【37】2.  Highly technique sensitive.\n\n【38】3.  It will cause nutritional deficiency.\n\n【39】4.  Occasionally leads to dumping syndrome (feeling sick immediately after eating).\n\n【40】5.  High risk of developing ulcers.\n\n【41】**Adjustable Gastric Band (AGB) -** Relatively simple procedure when compared to other bariatric surgeries, the surgeon will wrap a silicone device in the top part of the stomach creating a small pouch above the band.\n\n【42】The band will squeeze and reduce the opening between the pouch and the rest of the stomach, so whenever the patient consumes food and liquids, the pouch will fill up faster and create the sensation of being full. This will limit the patient’s intake and, in the long run, will reduce the excess weight.\n\n【43】Food will pass down to the rest of the stomach but slowly and in very less quantity than it is used to.\n\n【44】The advantages of this procedure are-\n\n【45】1.  The lowest rate of complications post-surgery.\n\n【46】2.  No division of stomach or intestines.\n\n【47】3.  It can be done as an outpatient procedure.\n\n【48】4.  The band can be removed if needed.\n\n【49】5.  Has the lowest risk for nutritional deficiency.\n\n【50】The disadvantages of the procedure are-\n\n【51】1.  The band will need several adjustments during the first year of the procedure.\n\n【52】2.  Slower and less effective weight loss when compared to other procedures.\n\n【53】3.  Higher risk of slippage of the band and damage to the stomach due to erosion.\n\n【54】4.  Requires a foreign implant to remain in the body.\n\n【55】5.  Has a high rate of reoperation.\n\n【56】6.  It can cause enlargement in the esophagus and difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【57】**Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch -** It is a two-part procedure-\n\n【58】1.  In the first part, the surgeon will reduce the size of the stomach, similar to a sleeve gastrectomy.\n\n【59】2.  The second part is similar to a gastric bypass. It is designed to eliminate the jejunum and ileum (both are parts of the small intestine where nutrient absorption is at its peak).\n\n【60】Two incisions are made- One below the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) and the second one in the lower end of the small intestine. These incisions will separate the jejunum and most of the ileum. The surgeon will join the duodenum with the lower ileum of the small intestine.\n\n【61】Now the food will pass through the reduced stomach, the duodenum, and the lower part of the ileum and then into the large intestine.\n\n【62】The dissected small intestine that contains the jejunum and ileum is not removed from the body; it is joined back at the end of the small intestine.\n\n【63】The advantages of this procedure are-\n\n【64】1.  Has the best results in improving obesity.\n\n【65】2.  Affects bowel hormones to cause less hunger and more fullness after eating.\n\n【66】3.  It is the most effective treatment to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\n【67】The disadvantages are-\n\n【68】1.  Has more complications than other procedures.\n\n【69】2.  Nutrition deficiency.\n\n【70】3.  Worsens acid reflux and heartburn.\n\n【71】4.  Highly technique sensitive.\n\n【72】How Does Bariatric Surgery Cure Diabetes?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【73】Bariatric surgery has been shown to significantly improve type 2 diabetes when compared to alternatives like pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes. Type 2 diabetes is caused due to a combination of low amounts of insulin production from the pancreas and peripheral insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when the cells in the muscles, fat, and liver do not respond well to insulin and cannot take up glucose easily.\n\n【74】This is reversed after bariatric surgery; it creates an acute negative calorie deficit- patients who underwent bariatric surgery will consume fewer calories than their body required to stay at their current weight.\n\n【75】This sudden negative balance normalizes plasma glucose levels within days; the long-term changes are as follows-\n\n【76】*   Calorie restriction in the early postoperative period decreases the fat content which was previously stored in the liver. Now that the liver has used up its stored energy source, it will have to take up glucose from the blood with the help of insulin to meet the energy demands of the entire body. As a result, the hepatic insulin sensitivity is reduced, followed by improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity (observed only in RYGB).\n\n【77】*   Lack of enough food in the stomach also inhibits hormones like ghrelin, incretin, cholecystokinin, etc. which promote the production of glucagon (a hormone that increases blood glucose levels in the body).\n\n【78】*   The insulin insufficiency that was present before the surgery is no longer present after surgery due to the reduced food intake. The amount of insulin produced by the pancreas will be sufficient to maintain the blood glucose level.\n\n【79】*   Other changes include improved gut bacteria, altered bile acid metabolism, and increased peptide tyrosine, all of which reduce hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity leading to the healthy maintenance of blood glucose levels and eventually to diabetes remission.\n\n【80】**Conclusion-**\n\n【81】Bariatric surgery is an elective procedure that provides weight loss, but the amount of weight that can be reduced depends on the type of surgery and the altered lifestyle changes that the patient is supposed to maintain post-surgery. The procedure itself has many complications and risk factors and is only performed by the bariatric surgeon when the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Long-term is necessary for the success of the procedure and to improve the quality of patients’ life.\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【83】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH - Bariatric Surgery And Diabetes Remission  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4566335/\n*   NIH - Mechanism linking diabetes and obesity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4259868/\n*   NIH - Weight loss surgeries.  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery/typesNIH -</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1af904eb-af4d-44ea-89da-227713a81265", "title": "Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome - Cause, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome - Cause, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), also known as hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly syndrome, is a medical condition that affects individuals living in areas where malaria is endemic. The condition is characterized by an enlarged spleen, anemia, and other symptoms that may resemble those of malaria. This article will discuss the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of TSS.\n\n【2】What Is the Cause of Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact reason why tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS) occurs is not fully known. However, it is thought that repeated malarial infections and other factors in the body can cause the immune system to produce too much of a certain type of antibody called IgM. This IgM then forms clumps with other proteins in the body and gets deposited in certain cells in the liver and spleen. This can cause those organs to become larger than normal and lead to anemia (low red blood cells).\n\n【4】TSS is most commonly found in malaria-endemic areas, and high levels of malarial antibodies can be detected in patients with the condition. Anti-malarial treatment has been shown to reduce the size of the spleen, indicating a response to treatment. However, premature discontinuation of treatment may lead to a relapse of TSS. Effective malarial chemoprophylaxis has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of TSS as well as spleen rates.\n\n【5】Individuals with sickle cell trait are relatively protected from TSS, as with malaria. Animal models have been developed to show a similar clinical syndrome after malarial infection, further supporting the relationship between TSS and chronic malaria infection.\n\n【6】In summary, while the exact mechanism of TSS remains unclear, evidence suggests that chronic malaria infection, in combination with unknown host factors, may trigger an overactive immune response that leads to the formation of macromolecular aggregates, deposition in the liver and spleen, and subsequent development of TSS. The prevalence of TSS is highest in malaria-endemic areas, and effective anti-malarial treatment and chemoprophylaxis can reduce the incidence of TSS.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【8】The symptoms of TSS may vary from person to person and may resemble those of malaria. The most common symptom is an enlarged spleen, which can cause discomfort or pain in the left upper abdomen. Other symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Anemia.\n\n【10】*   Fatigue.\n\n【11】*   Weight loss.\n\n【12】*   Fever.\n\n【13】*   Night sweats.\n\n【14】*   Chills.\n\n【15】*   Malaise.\n\n【16】*   Joint pain.\n\n【17】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【18】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【19】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【20】*   Enlarged liver.\n\n【21】How to Diagnose This Condition?\n-------------------------------\n\n【22】Diagnosis of TSS can be challenging as the symptoms may resemble those of other diseases, particularly malaria. The initial stage of diagnosis involves excluding other potential factors that can cause an enlarged spleen, such as liver disease, lymphoma, or leukemia.\n\n【23】The physician performs a physical exam to check for an enlarged spleen and orders blood tests to assess for anemia, liver and kidney function, and the presence of malaria parasites. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, may also be used to visualize the spleen and liver and assess for any abnormalities.\n\n【24】A definitive diagnosis of TSS may require a spleen biopsy, which involves the removal of a small tissue sample from the spleen for examination under a microscope. This procedure is generally carried out under local anesthesia and necessitates a hospital stay of a few days.\n\n【25】In addition to the steps mentioned earlier, the following major and minor criteria can help in confirming the diagnosis:\n\n【26】**Major Criteria:**\n\n【27】*   Gross splenomegaly ten centimeters or more below the costal margin in adults for which no cause can be found.\n\n【28】*   Elevated serum IgM level 2 standard deviations or more above the local mean.\n\n【29】*   Clinical and immunologic responses to antimalarial therapy.\n\n【30】*   Regression of splenomegaly by 40% by six months after the start of therapy.\n\n【31】*   High antibody levels of Plasmodium species (≥1:800).\n\n【32】**Minor Criteria:**\n\n【33】*   Hepatic sinusoidal lymphocytosis.\n\n【34】*   Normal cellular and humoral responses to antigenic challenge, including a normal Phyto hemagglutination response.\n\n【35】*   Hypersplenism.\n\n【36】*   Lymphocytic proliferation.\n\n【37】*   Familial occurrence.\n\n【38】What Is the Treatment of Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   **Medical Care:** The primary mode of therapy for Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome (TSS) involves the use of antimalarial drugs. Antimalarial drugs are the only treatment for HMS, but the optimal drug and duration of treatment are unclear. The choice of drug depends on the pattern of drug resistance in the region. Response to treatment may take time, and relapses are common. Chloroquine, Proguanil, and Pyrimethamine have been found to be effective, but drug resistance is a concern. Fixed-dose drug combinations such as Atovaquone\\-Proguanil or Artemether-Lumefantrine may be used if resistance is suspected. Mefloquine can also be used but may have severe side effects. Chemoprophylaxis in endemic areas and its duration are also unclear.\n\n【40】A retrospective longitudinal study conducted by Bisoffi et al. indicated that patients with early TSS should receive the same treatment as those with full-blown syndrome. This is because early TSS may predispose patients to the more advanced form of the condition. According to the study, it was discovered that patients with early HMS face a substantial risk of TSS progression when re-exposed to malaria. While a single course of antimalarial treatment may be sufficient against early TSS, antimalarial prophylaxis should be used in re-exposed patients to prevent further progression of the condition.\n\n【41】*   **Surgical Care:** Surgical intervention is not a viable option for treating hyperreactive malarial syndrome (HMS), and splenectomy should be avoided. This is because splenectomy can lead to severe infections with a high mortality rate.\n\n【42】*   **Consultations:** In order to rule out diseases that resemble hyperreactive malarial syndrome (HMS), it may be necessary to seek consultations with specialists in metabolic and infectious diseases, as well as oncologists.\n\n【43】What Are the Potential Differential Diagnosis for a Patient With Tropical Splenomegaly?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Below are the possible differential diagnoses practitioners and physicians should think of and rule out:\n\n【45】*   Brucellosis\n\n【46】*   B-cell lymphoproliferative\n\n【47】*   Felty syndrome\n\n【48】*   EBV infectious mononucleosis\n\n【49】*   SCD\n\n【50】*   Tuberculosis\n\n【51】*   Leishmania\n\n【52】How to Prevent It?\n------------------\n\n【53】In order to minimize mosquito exposure and lower the risk of malaria transmission in areas where the disease is prevalent, travelers should adopt various precautionary measures. These include wearing long-sleeved clothing and pants tucked into socks, using N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) spray with a concentration of 25 to 35 percent, utilizing bed nets, and taking prescribed antimalarial medications for chemoprophylaxis. For individuals residing in endemic regions, additional measures such as eliminating stagnant water and employing insecticides near homes can aid in reducing the mosquito population. It is also recommended that the local population follow the same precautions as travelers to prevent malaria.\n\n【54】What Is the Recommended Follow-up Protocol?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【55】It is crucial to schedule regular appointments to track the patient's clinical progress and record reductions in splenomegaly. If chloroquine is administered, ophthalmologic effects should be closely monitored through a slit lamp, funduscopic, and visual field exams. Conduct cardiovascular monitoring with ECG and echocardiography, and other relevant tests periodically. Additional investigation may be necessary to examine myopathy and peripheral neuritis. Liver function tests may also be carried out regularly for those receiving proguanil.\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS) is a condition that occurs in areas where malaria is common and can cause an overactive immune response leading to macromolecular aggregates in the liver and spleen. Antimalarial drugs are the primary treatment for TSS, and surgical intervention should be avoided. Preventative measures such as wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellent, and taking antimalarial medication can help reduce the risk of developing TSS in endemic areas.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly Syndrome—Can the Diagnostic Criteria Be Improved?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4559700/\n*   Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome Treatment & Management  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/959720-treatment\n*   Tropical splenomegaly.

The procedure has been widely used for over 100 years. However, the emergence of new surgical techniques has paved the way for the evolution of nephroureterectomy. Nephroureterectomy can be done using different approaches, and the treatment procedure includes two steps, mainly radical nephrectomy and distal ureterectomy. Dentu and Albarran were the first to describe nephroureterectomy, wherein only a small portion of the ureter was removed. However, other researchers noticed tumor recurrences in distal portions of ureters. As a result, the scientists believed that resectioning the entire ureter is of utmost importance.\n\n【2】What Is Nephroureterectomy?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】A nephroureterectomy is a surgery that aims to treat transitional cell cancer. The surgery simply removes the kidneys, ureters, renal pelvis, or bladder cuff. The renal pelvis is located at the center of the kidney. It works to collect urine and carries it into the tubes known as the ureters. The ureters are muscular tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which is a storage site of urine. The junction between the ureter and the bladder is known as the bladder cuff. The doctor usually recommends nephroureterectomy for patients with urothelial cancer. It is a radical surgery wherein the doctor removes a tumor or other organs where the tumor has spread. For example, if cancer has spread to the colon, the doctor might remove the colon along with the kidneys and ureters. During an open nephroureterectomy, the doctor makes two large incisions in the abdomen to remove the rib. The first incision is usually 8 to 12 inches long. Large and invasive tumors might require an open surgical approach. However, most procedures can be done through robot-assisted techniques. Hence, technology has made procedures convenient and easily accessible.\n\n【4】Why Is a Nephroureterectomy Done?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】A nephroureterectomy is a standard treatment protocol for patients with transitional cell cancer of the ureters or renal pelvis, especially if the tumor is aggressive. Hence, the patient must know everything about the treatment options available for cancer. Laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy is useful for patients with transitional cell cancer in the urinary tract or transitional membrane. The urine is expelled from the body through the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, urinary bladder, ureter, and urethra. Transitional epithelium is a membrane that lines the ureters, kidneys, and urinary bladder.\n\n【6】What Happens Before a Nephroureterectomy?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】The patient must consult the doctor before undergoing a nephroureterectomy. The doctor examines the patient’s general health and checks the vitals, including blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature. The patient must inform the doctor about all the prescription or over-the-counter medications, including herbal supplements. This is because Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs, and other supplements can increase the risk of bleeding. Hence, the patient must communicate with the doctor before discontinuing any medications. The patient must inform the doctor about the allergies, including allergies to skin cleaners like iodine, latex, food items, and isopropyl alcohol. The doctor might provide certain specific instructions on drinking or eating. Hence, the patient must take a liquid diet 24 hours before the surgery. Avoid eating anything the night before the surgery.\n\n【8】How Do the Doctors Perform Nephroureterectomy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Nephroureterectomy is a surgical procedure that typically includes a team of urologists, nurses, and anesthesiologists. First, the patient is given general anesthesia to make him fall asleep and to avoid movements during the procedure. Once the patient falls asleep, the urologist uses a sharp, sterile knife or a scalpel to make small incisions in the abdomen. Next, a laparoscope is inserted through the incisions to examine the affected organs. Finally, the urologist uses sutures to close the incisions. Sometimes, the doctor might place a silicone or drainage tube at the incision sites to drain the blood or fluid. The entire procedure gets completed in two to four hours.\n\n【10】What Happens After a Nephroureterectomy?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】The patient will be taken to a recovery room after the procedure. Next, the stitches are covered with bandages. The patient might take some time to overcome the effect of anesthesia. Once the patient is fully awake, the doctor might administer painkillers to allow the pain to subside completely. General anesthesia can often cause nausea; hence the doctor might provide medications to overcome nausea. The patient is asked to maintain a liquid diet for one or two days after the surgery. This is because a liquid diet helps the body recover. The patient can start taking solid foods a few weeks after surgery. The doctor might encourage the patient to walk a day after surgery because walking enhances recovery. In addition, it reduces the risk of blood clot formation and pneumonia. Once the doctor is assured, the patient will be allowed to go home.\n\n【12】What Are Some of the Risks of Nephroureterectomy?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】All surgical procedures are associated with certain risks or complications. Some of the risks of nephroureterectomy are listed below:\n\n【14】*   Untoward reactions at the site of infusion.\n\n【15】*   Delayed wound healing.\n\n【16】*   Need for blood transfusion.\n\n【17】*   Infections.\n\n【18】*   Formation of hematoma.\n\n【19】*   The buildup of fluids at the surgical site or seroma.\n\n【20】How Long Would a Patient Take To Recover After a Nephroureterectomy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The patient must relax for about six weeks after the procedure. In addition, one must avoid driving for about two weeks after the procedure. The patient must avoid performing strenuous activities or exercises, including running or lifting heavy objects. This is because strenuous physical activities can cause undue strain on the stitches resulting in a hernia or injury. Every individual has a unique body, so the recovery time might vary. Hence, the patient must be aware of his body and its limitations.\n\n【22】When Should the Patient Consult the Doctor After the Procedure?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The patient must schedule follow-ups and consultations with the doctor to evaluate incisions or stitches. The stitches might be removed after two or three weeks if they are not dissolvable. In addition, the doctor might remove the drainage tube along with the stitches. The doctor also performs several tests to ensure that the transitional cell cancer has subsided. The patient must consult the doctor immediately under the following circumstances:\n\n【24】*   Profuse bleeding at the site of the incision.\n\n【25】*   Drainage of discharge from the stitches.\n\n【26】*   High fever.\n\n【27】*   Infections.\n\n【28】*   Foul odor.\n\n【29】*   Presence of pain.\n\n【30】**Conclusion:**\n\n【31】A nephroureterectomy is one of the most effective treatment methods for transitional cell cancer. It can be done using the open or the robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Though the procedure appears complicated, the patient must consult the doctor to know more about the risks and benefits.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   The nephroureterectomy: a review of technique and current controversies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807352/\n*   Robotic-assisted Nephroureterectomy  \n    https://www.bidmc.org/centers-and-departments/urology/urologic-procedures-traditional-and-minimally-invasive/kidney-urologic-procedures/robotic-assisted-nephroureterectomy</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Understanding its drivers and how to evaluate them is critical due to the potentially enormous (beneficial and harmful) consequences on environments and populations. The knowledge gained through various measuring techniques enables the management of environmental quality threats and inadequacies, which is required to enhance and prevent damage.\n\n【2】Human development can be measured mainly by the quality of the environment since people are changing the environment more and more to suit their demands. As a result, if an area's environmental quality is poor, it is frequently due to anthropogenic interference.\n\n【3】What Is Environmental Quality?\n------------------------------\n\n【4】\"Environmental quality\" refers to a group of ecological traits that impact people and other living things, whether general or specific. It is a way to assess how well an environment meets the needs of one or more species and any needs or purposes related to humans.\n\n【5】Environmental quality refers to both the constructed environment and the natural environment. It encompasses factors like air quality, water quality or pollution, noise levels, and any potential consequences that these factors may have on one's physical and emotional well-being.\n\n【6】**What Are the Primary Forms of Environmental Quality?**\n\n【7】The following are the primary categories of ecological quality:\n\n【8】*   Air.\n\n【9】*   Water.\n\n【10】*   Forest.\n\n【11】*   Land.\n\n【12】**Why Is the Environmental Quality of Air Essential?**\n\n【13】The earth's atmosphere is the primary component of all living beings. The world's 200 million square miles of surface area are covered in air. The most widely used natural resource, which nobody can exclude, is air, which is why people so thoroughly pollute it.\n\n【14】**What Is Air Pollution?**\n--------------------------\n\n【15】It is the presence of one or more pollutants or combinations of pollutants in the outdoor atmosphere in such amounts and for such lengths that they may be or tend to be harmful to human, plant, or animal life or property or to the way the business works.\n\n【16】What Are the Various Sources of Air Pollution?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Different sorts of air contaminants exist. Pollutants are divided into primary and secondary categories. Primary pollutants are those released directly into the atmosphere, and secondary pollutants are created from chemical interactions in the environment.\n\n【18】The most popular air pollution sources are as follows:\n\n【19】*   Carbon monoxide is released by cars with engines that run on fuel made from oil and are used for transportation and heating.\n\n【20】*   Hydrocarbons are primarily released by automobiles and also from industrial plant exhausts.\n\n【21】*   Nitrogen oxide emissions from industrial facilities, power plants, and cars.\n\n【22】*   Sulfur oxides, which industrial facilities, power plants, and automobiles mainly produce\n\n【23】*   Particulate matter is released from factories, waste disposal facilities, and power plants.\n\n【24】**How Does Decreased Air Quality Affect Humans?**\n\n【25】Polluted air enters the human body primarily through the respiratory system, and contaminants enter the throat, lungs, and other respiratory organs. As a result, air pollution leads to illnesses such as bronchitis, tuberculosis, asthma, and influenza.\n\n【26】What Makes Water a Part of Environmental Quality?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Water is a crucial ecosystem component for all living things, including humans. It takes up over 70% of the human body's weight. Unfortunately, most water resources are deteriorating due to rapid population growth and industrialization.\n\n【28】What Is Water Pollution?\n------------------------\n\n【29】Water is contaminated when its quality or composition changes due to human activity, either directly or indirectly, so it becomes worthless or less acceptable for drinking. It may be \"any human action that hinders water usage as a resource.\"\n\n【30】The main threat to water quality comes from the discharge of sewage, industrial waste, and a wide range of synthetic chemicals into water sources like rivers, streams, and lakes. Rivers and lakes, which provide water and are harmed by the flora and animals found in the rivers, now contain the effluents of several enterprises. A condition is attained when the river's content turns poisonous and unfit for any purpose.\n\n【31】What Effect Does Polluted Water Have on Humans?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Water-borne diseases have been eradicated in most wealthy countries but not poor ones. Water-borne pathogens or disease-producing organisms play a crucial role in disease transmission.\n\n【33】Drinking water contaminated with chemicals like pesticides, fertilizers, and heavy metals can harm one's health.\n\n【34】Microplastics can be consumed through contaminated seafood or drinking polluted water. For example, in 2016, scientists in Tokyo Bay investigated 64 anchovies for microplastic intake; 77% contained microplastics in their digestive systems.\n\n【35】**Why Is Forest Considered an Environmental Quality?**\n\n【36】The forest is a strange entity that possesses boundless goodness and kindness. Instead of placing demands on people, it provides them with the goods they need for life and activity. They benefit humanity by acting as producers and guardians of a healthy environment. They also offer garments, textiles, food, gasoline, fiber, building materials, industrial goods, and packaging materials.\n\n【37】How Does Deforestation Affect Human Health?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Healthy forests are massive air cleaners. The result of deforestation is the reverse. The air quality worsens due to removing a vital source of cleaner air and carbon dioxide emissions. Poor air quality has profound implications. The World Health Organization estimates outdoor air pollution kills 4.2 million people yearly. Those who live are at risk for various heart and lung diseases.\n\n【39】Why Is Land Considered a Part of Environmental Quality?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】The land is a scarce resource essential to all human needs and activities. It serves as the basis for all economic endeavors and the source of all natural resources. Moreover, the land is just the earth's surface, where all kinds of human activity are possible.\n\n【41】Agriculture-related activities, including irrigation, sowing, and plowing, have all been done on land. It has been applied to housing and urbanization. It is the foundation for industrialization. Humans rely on the ground for transportation. The land is an energy source because it is covered in forests, mountains, and deserts. Consequently, it is well established that land contributes to environmental quality.\n\n【42】**What Effect Does Land Pollution Have on Humans?**\n\n【43】Land pollution can have a range of adverse effects on the human body. People can consume toxic waste and pollutants. Land contamination is also a result of the dangerous disposal of radioactive waste. Long-term health effects include chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and brain damage.\n\n【44】What Are the Factors That Affect Environmental Quality?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Examples of elements that may impact an environment's quality include the following:\n\n【46】*   Noise.\n\n【47】*   Traffic/congestion.\n\n【48】*   Litter.\n\n【49】*   Existence of green spaces.\n\n【50】*   Distance from necessities.\n\n【51】The environmental quality of a region may be compromised if certain elements are prominent. Some of the elements, however, can promote better environmental quality.\n\n【52】How Can Humans Preserve Excellent Environmental Quality?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】It is crucial to consider all potential influences on environmental quality to maintain or acquire good quality. Then, actions can be taken to either completely resolve the problem or lessen the harm caused by prevailing factors.\n\n【54】*   **Noise:** The environment can suffer from noise pollution. To address this, it is critical to identify the sources of noise pollution. For example, one may attribute noise pollution in many locations to traffic, industry, and activity inside buildings. Common traffic management strategies include implementing speed limits, speed bumps, and road narrowing to slow down traffic and reduce noise, promoting electric (low-noise) cars, and implementing noise mapping and zoning to track noise levels.\n\n【55】*   **Traffic/Congestion:** Traffic and congestion can harm the environment by increasing emissions and causing noise pollution. As a result, initiatives have been introduced globally to lessen the effects of congestion as environmental awareness grows. These policies can be broadly divided into two categories: those promoting alternate modes of transportation and those discouraging reliance on automobiles.\n\n【56】*   **Litter:** The cleanup of existing litter and subsequent actions to stop new waste from contributing to the problem is necessary to address the litter problem. The first goal is accomplished by mobilizing volunteer organizations and encouraging widespread litter-picking. The second is more challenging. Common tactics include expanding the number of trash cans, regularly emptying them, and raising public awareness.\n\n【57】*   **Existence of Green Spaces:** It is advantageous for the physical environment and the people who live there to have conveniently accessible green spaces. But due to the demands of the population, building, and infrastructure development frequently take precedence over this. Reversing these objectives and reaching a compromise can ensure that environmental quality is maintained at a high level.\n\n【58】*   **Distance From Necessities**: It is self-evident that having vital amenities nearby is critical for a community's population. The lack of these resources nearby might exacerbate other environmental issues by forcing people to go further for basic requirements. There are two possible fixes for this:\n\n【59】    *   Build facilities, services, and stores nearer to the needy population.\n\n【60】    *   Boost transportation connections to locations with amenities.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Environmental quality is essential for the human population, and various factors influence it. Therefore, multiple measures should be taken to improve and maintain environmental quality. If not maintained, it may have a detrimental effect on the environment and humans.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   Environmental Quality Incentives Program  \n    https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/eqip-environmental-quality-incentives\n*   Environmental Quality  \n    https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/EnvironmentalQuality.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Such oral-pigmented lesions are classified based on pathological, physiological or endogenous, or exogenous types. They may also be classified based on the underlying cause of the lesion, their occurrence, color, nature of the lesion, their link between the use of drugs, family history, and even the health pattern of the affected individual. Determining the underlying cause of the lesion is necessary to distinguish them from other oral lesions. Darkly pigmented lesions are classified as focal, multifocal, or diffuse lesions. Melanin, which is produced in these lesions is formed by the cells called melanocytes. They are present in the basal layer of the skin or epithelium. The pigment or color is transferred to the adjacent keratinocyte cells via the cell membrane-bound organelles known as melanosomes.\n\n【2】Some common examples of these lesions include:\n\n【3】*   Melanocytic nevus.\n\n【4】*   Blue nevus.\n\n【5】*   Smoker’s melanosis.\n\n【6】*   Oral melanoacanthoma.\n\n【7】*   Drug-induced pigmentations.\n\n【8】*   Pigmentated lesions of systemic manifestations like Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Addison´s disease.\n\n【9】What Are the Different Types of Oral Pigmented Lesions?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】A. **Physiological Pigmentation**: Physiological pigmentation is one of the most common oral pigmentation.\n\n【11】*   This lesion mainly results from the increase in the melanin pigment and is more commonly noted in dark-skinned individuals.\n\n【12】*   The color of physiological pigmentation would usually range from a light brown to a blackish color.\n\n【13】B. **Post-inflammatory Pigmentation**: Long-term or chronic inflammatory oral mucosal conditions like oral lichen planus (a chronic condition that causes a patchy white lesion in the oral mucosa), pemphigus (an autoimmune disease causing blisters of the skin, mucosal regions of oral cavity and nose), or pemphigoid (an autoimmune condition causing fluid-filled blisters in the skin and oral mucosa) may result in these types of inflammatory mucosal pigmentation.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Fixed Drug Eruptions - Causes, Clinical Features and Treatment</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Usage of LASER in Dermatology and Skin Care</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>I have painless hard lump in my tongue for the past 2 years. Could this be cancerous?</u>\n\n【19】*   These lesions are characterized by multiple small brown, or black-pigmented area located in the oral mucosa.\n\n【20】*   They are generally present adjacent to reticular, erosive, or vesicular lesions of the oral cavity.\n\n【21】C. **Melanotic Macule**: The oral melanotic macules are common and rather small, well-circumscribed lesions that are brownish-black in color.\n\n【22】*   These lesions are located mainly on the lips, and the gingiva.\n\n【23】*   They might also occur on the palate and buccal mucosa.\n\n【24】*   People suspected of having these lesions are generally advised to do a biopsy study to distinguish it from other drug-induced or systemic melanocytic lesions.\n\n【25】D. **Melanocytic Nevus**: These nevi are comparatively unusual and less common on the oral mucosa. They tend to occur more on the epithelium or the skin.\n\n【26】*   Melanocytic nevus of the oral cavity is a very small circumscribed yet raised macules or papules.\n\n【27】*   These nevi can range from bluish-gray to almost black. And occasionally they may occur as non-pigmented lesions.\n\n【28】E. **Blue Nevus**: This lesion is a benign form of melanocytic lesion that occurs in the oral cavity and presents without any symptoms.\n\n【29】*   The lesions are usually slate-blue or blue-black with a smooth surface resembling macules or papules.\n\n【30】*   These lesions typically measure less than six millimeters (mm) in diameter with the characteristic blue color, hence are called a blue nevus.\n\n【31】*   These lesions are more commonly seen in females than in males.\n\n【32】*   Two-thirds of all intraoral blue nevi are commonly found at the location of the hard palate while the buccal mucosa is the second-most common site.\n\n【33】F. **Smoker’s Melanosis**: This is a global condition that occurs in nearly 25 to 31 percent of all tobacco users worldwide.\n\n【34】*   This condition is typically characterized by the presence of multiple discrete or coalescing macules that are brown in color.\n\n【35】*   They generally involve the attached mandibular gingiva (gums attached to the lower teeth) and the labial side (the front portion) of the mouth. It is very common to see smokers' melanosis pigmentation located on the palate and the buccal mucosa.\n\n【36】*   Recent studies show the association between discrete smokers' melanosis with pipe smoking habits.\n\n【37】*   In cases of smoking-associated melanosis of the oral mucosa, the increased melanin production by the melanocytes and subsequent deposition in the basal cell and lamina propria layer (a layer of connective tissue that forms the mucosa) makes them evident for the diagnosis.\n\n【38】*   The presence of a habitual history of smoking makes the diagnosis easier in cases of smokers' melanosis.\n\n【39】G. **Black Hairy Tongue**: This type of lesion is characterized by the involvement of the tongue and is relatively painless and benign.\n\n【40】*   These lesions are caused due to defective desquamation or reactive hypertrophy that arises within the filiform papillae of the tongue.\n\n【41】*   The keratinized filiform papillae get elongated giving the hairy appearance of the tongue.\n\n【42】*   They may exhibit various colors upon pigmentation ranging from yellow-brown to black.\n\n【43】*   The pigmentation of these lesions depends on various factors such as tobacco, smoking, coffee or tea consumption, and other intrinsic factors such as the involvement of chromogenic organisms in the normal oral flora resulting in pigmentation.\n\n【44】H. **Foreign Body-Induced Pigmentation**: Pigmentations of the oral mucosa may occur due to exposure to metals such as:\n\n【45】*   **Lead Pigmentation**: A generalized cutaneous ‘lead huge lines’ occur upon the gingiva manifesting rather as grey areas of discoloration under the gingival margins.\n\n【46】*   **Mercury Pigmentation**: Resulting in slate gray gingival hyperpigmentation.\n\n【47】*   **Amalgam Pigmentation**: This is similar to other common metal pigmentations caused by the presence of amalgam material in the oral tissues.\n\n【48】I. **Drug-induced Pigmentation**: Drugs like arsenic commonly hold the potential for inducing pigmentation in the epidermal cells of the skin or oral mucous membranes by promoting the action of the tyrosinase enzyme.\n\n【49】*   Other drugs like Phenothiazines and Minocycline may also gets deposited in the skin or in oral mucosa that directly reacts with melanin to form a drug–pigment complex.\n\n【50】*   Clotrimazole and Tetracycline drugs are similarly found to be the most common drug associated with oral pigmentation according to dental research.\n\n【51】*   Ketoconazole, Pyrimethamine, and Barbiturates similarly are other oral pigmentation-inducing drugs in some Individuals.\n\n【52】J. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS)**: This systemic disease is characterized by mucocutaneous macules and intestinal polyposis. The patient affected by this condition suffers an increased risk of cancer in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, breast, or thyroid glands. Orally, the lesions are pigmented as brown or black spots that are less than one mm in size that are localized typically to the lower lip and in the perioral areas.\n\n【53】K. **Systemic Diseases Pigmentation**: Pigmented lesions related to other systemic diseases that may also be present in the oral mucous membrane or gingiva include:\n\n【54】*   Addison disease (a chronic condition causing insufficient production of certain hormones by the adrenal gland).\n\n【55】*   McCune-Albright syndrome (a genetic condition affecting the bone, skin, and endocrine system).\n\n【56】*   Hyperthyroidism (a condition with excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland).\n\n【57】*   Nelson syndrome (a life-threatening condition often causing vision loss, pituitary failure, and dark skin pigmentation).\n\n【58】These lesions may either be diffuse or localized in the oral mucous membrane or gingiva.\n\n【59】**Conclusion**:\n\n【60】Numerous oral pigmented lesions exist because of local or oral diseases or as a result of oral manifestations of systemic diseases. These lesions can be clinically diagnosed by the dentist and ruling out other differential diagnoses such as oral cancers is essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Medical-grade masks, cloth masks, and respirators are available to protect against these infections. Both medical and community people use medical masks to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases from asymptomatic persons and sick people. On the other hand, respirators are primarily used by healthcare professionals and are designed to fit into the face and protect respiratory function.\n\n【2】Early in 2020, when the pandemic hit the world, there was a great demand for surgical masks or medical-grade masks and respirators. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommended people manufacture cloth masks from readily available household items and start using them. This led the medical professionals, affected individuals, and those in close proximity to them to use surgical masks to a greater extent, who are the high-risk group for contracting the disease. Also, speculation about extending the use or employing the reuse of disposable masks, sterilizing the respirators, or resorting to using cloth masks took over.\n\n【3】What Is the History of Cloth Masks?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【4】Even before the pandemic, hospitals employed masks made from various materials like gauze, cotton, and other fabrics in the twentieth century. The medical staff who used two to three layers of masks made from gauze showed fewer cases of respiratory infection. Cloth masks, in particular, were used for protection against scarlet fever (a contagious infection that mostly affects children) and diphtheria (a serious infection of the nose and throat). After the advent of surgical masks, the use of masks made from cotton or gauze rapidly declined; however, their use was still prevalent in the Asian population. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the use of cloth masks by healthcare workers and the common people gradually increased.\n\n【5】What Do Studies Say About the Use of Cloth Masks?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】A randomized control trial performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2015 depicted that the spread of infections was higher in people who used cloth masks. It was performed by comparing the efficacy of the cloth mask with surgical masks and a control group that followed the standard practice method. During this study, four weeks were taken into consideration, and five cloth masks were given, which were made locally and had two layers.\n\n【7】The participants were asked to wash the masks with soap and water. It was attributed that the poor protection offered by cloth masks might be due to infrequent washing or using moist and contaminated cloth masks. The CDC has conducted a series of studies to determine the efficacy of cloth masks. The results of all tests indicated that the efficacy of cloth masks was less as compared to that of surgical masks and respirators. The filtration effectiveness of cloth masks depends on several factors, which include the following:\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>COVID-19 and MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children)</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Natural Ways to Prevent COVID-19</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>COVID-19 and the Immunocompromised</u>\n\n【13】*   Number of layers.\n\n【14】*   Thread count.\n\n【15】*   Type of fabric.\n\n【16】*   Water resistance.\n\n【17】A study was conducted to determine the ability of household cloth masks against viral and bacterial aerosols. It was found that although the efficacy was reduced in cloth masks as compared with surgical masks, the cloth masks made from household cloths, cotton, and towels had better protection than gauze masks. The use of nylon stockings in cloth masks variably increases filtration effectiveness. On the other hand, a wet and moist mask has decreased filtration effectiveness.\n\n【18】CDC gave out updated guidelines on cloth mask usage in January 2022, stating that loosely worn cloth masks do not provide enough protection against COVID-19 like the surgical masks and N95s do.\n\n【19】What Are the Factors to Be Considered While Wearing Cloth Masks During the COVID-19 Pandemic?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted by close contact with the infected person and respiratory aerosol inhalation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised using respirators in high-risk situations and during procedures that involve the production of aerosols. Respirators are highly recommended for frontline workers. In case of a shortage of respirators, medical professionals can use medical masks; however, the rate of infection increases in such cases. The decontamination and reuse of respirators are also considered in some countries. Due to the shortage of surgical masks or respirators, cloth masks are used by some medical professionals. In these circumstances, the use of multilayered, water-resistant masks with a more delicate weave and a high number of threads highly recommended to prevent the risk of infection spread. Also, the fit of the mask should be ensured so as not to allow the flow of air through the gaps.\n\n【21】In areas where the risk of infection transmission is high, the use of universal face masks should be advised. To prevent the demand for surgical masks, the general public can use cloth masks as an alternative. Also, the removal and decontamination procedures while using cloth masks play an important role in preventing the spread and increasing the efficacy of cloth masks. Improper removal of cloth masks may result in self-contamination and may increase the risk of infection spread. Cloth masks can be decontaminated by washing with soap and hot water, applying dry heat, ultraviolet radiation, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, autoclaving, or microwaving. It is advised to wash the mask once it becomes wet or dirty, or atleast after a day’s use.\n\n【22】**What Are the Advantages of Cloth Masks?**\n\n【23】*   Large quantities can be produced in a short time.\n\n【24】*   Reusable.\n\n【25】*   Degradation of cloth masks is unlikely.\n\n【26】*   Inexpensive.\n\n【27】*   Available in a wide variety of designs (masks have become a part of fashion).\n\n【28】What Are the Disadvantages of Cloth Masks?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   The filtration effectiveness of cloth masks is reduced as compared to surgical masks and respirators.\n\n【30】*   Improper decontamination of used masks may result in self-contamination.\n\n【31】*   If used in a hospital setting, the extra work of decontaminating the cloth masks is present.\n\n【32】*   Due to the hydrophilic nature of natural fibers, aerosols can get absorbed into the cloth fibers. That is why it is advised not to touch the upper surface of the mask without washing or sanitization.\n\n【33】Are Double Masks Necessary?\n---------------------------\n\n【34】According to research by the CDC, the use of double masks, including a surgical mask and a cloth mask (to limit the air leakage and provide contoured fit), or the use of tightly-fitting surgical masks, helps reduce the chance of infection to about 96.5 %.\n\n【35】**Conclusion:**\n\n【36】Adequate knowledge about the quality, method of usage, and decontamination of cloth masks to the public are necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Also, the public should be taught how to select cloth masks so that they do not have a false sense of protection. When cloth masks are used, it is always advisable to use double masks and properly remove and decontaminate them to avoid self-contamination.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Effectiveness of Cloth Masks for Protection Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  \n    https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948\\_article\n*   Coronavirus Face Masks & Protection FAQs  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know\n*   Effectiveness of Cloth Masks for Protection Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510705/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a condition where the body is unable to process glucose properly, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes.\n\n【2】What Is Diabetes?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Diabetes is a persistent medical condition characterized by impaired processing of blood sugar (glucose) within the body. When we eat food, our body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, facilitates the absorption of glucose by cells, enabling its utilization as an energy source or storage for future needs.\n\n【4】In those with diabetes, the body either generates inadequate insulin or fails to properly use the insulin that is generated. As a result, blood glucose levels rise as glucose builds up in the system.\n\n【5】What Are the Types of Diabetes?\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】The two main types of diabestes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n【7】*   **Type 1 diabetes:** In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune reaction occurs where the body's own immune system targets and destroys the pancreatic cells responsible for producing insulin.\n\n【8】*   **Type 2 diabetes:** It is a more prevalent condition that arises when the body either develops resistance to insulin or fails to produce an adequate amount to fulfill its requirements.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Diabetes?\n----------------------------------\n\n【10】The symptoms of diabetes can include:\n\n【11】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【12】*   Excessive thirst.\n\n【13】*   Fatigue.\n\n【14】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【15】*   Slow wound healing.\n\n【16】Diabetes can result in a number of serious illnesses if it is not appropriately treated, including:\n\n【17】*   Heart disease.\n\n【18】*   Stroke.\n\n【19】*   Kidney damage.\n\n【20】*   Nerve damage.\n\n【21】*   Blindness.\n\n【22】How Can Diabetes be Managed?\n----------------------------\n\n【23】1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A nutritious diet, frequent exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are all lifestyle modifications that can help control blood sugar levels.\n\n【24】2\\. **Medications**: To help manage blood sugar levels several different types of medications include:\n\n【25】*   Insulin.\n\n【26】*   Oral medications.\n\n【27】*   Injectable medications.\n\n【28】3\\. **Blood Sugar Monitoring:** Monitoring blood sugar levels regularly can help people with diabetes keep track of their glucose levels and modify their treatment plan as necessary.\n\n【29】4\\. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM):** CGM devices are wearable devices that continuously monitor blood sugar levels and provide real-time feedback to the wearer.\n\n【30】5\\. **Insulin Pumps**: Insulin pumps are small devices that deliver insulin to the body through a catheter that is inserted under the skin.\n\n【31】What Are Diabetes Patches?\n--------------------------\n\n【32】Diabetes patches are a type of wearable medical device that is designed to help manage diabetes. There are two main types of diabetes patches: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) patches and insulin patches.\n\n【33】1\\. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring Patch:**\n\n【34】Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a medical technology that measures glucose levels in real-time using a tiny sensor implanted under the skin. In comparison to conventional fingerstick testing, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems are intended to provide more frequent and precise results. This technological development can help people with diabetes monitor and manage their blood sugar levels more effectively.\n\n【35】**Working:**\n\n【36】*   The CGM patch contains a tiny sensor that is inserted into the skin and measures the glucose levels in the interstitial fluid.\n\n【37】*   A sensor and a transmitter are what make up the CGM system. The receiver, which might be a smartphone, a special device, or a smartwatch, receives the glucose data wirelessly from the transmitter.\n\n【38】*   The sensor measures the glucose levels every few minutes and sends the data to the receiver in real-time.\n\n【39】*   This allows people with diabetes to track their glucose levels throughout the day and identify trends and patterns in their glucose levels.\n\n【40】*   The CGM patch can also alert the user if their glucose levels are too high or too low, helping them take action to prevent dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels.\n\n【41】*   Some CGM patches also have advanced features, such as alarms that can alert the user if their glucose levels are rapidly changing or if they are at risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【42】*   Some CGM patches also allow the user to set target glucose levels and can automatically adjust insulin dosages to maintain these levels.\n\n【43】**Features:**\n\n【44】*   **Real-time Glucose Monitoring:** CGM patches provide continuous, real-time glucose monitoring, allowing wearers to see how their glucose levels change in response to food, exercise, and other factors.\n\n【45】*   **Alerts:** Some CGM patches can provide alerts when glucose levels are too high or too low, helping wearers take action to avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.\n\n【46】*   **Data Storage:** CGM patches can store glucose data over time, allowing wearers to track patterns and trends in their glucose levels.\n\n【47】*   **Customization:** CGM patches can be customized to suit the wearer's individual needs and preferences, such as setting target glucose levels and adjusting alert settings.\n\n【48】**Requirements for Usage:**\n\n【49】Certain prerequisites should be met prior to using CGM patches.\n\n【50】*   **Regular Calibration:** To guarantee accuracy, CGM patches must be calibrated using conventional fingerstick tests at least twice per day.\n\n【51】*   **Sensor Replacement:** CGM patches need to have the sensor replaced every few days or weeks, depending on the specific device.\n\n【52】*   **Skin Preparation:** The skin where the sensor will be inserted needs to be cleaned and prepped before insertion to ensure accurate readings.\n\n【53】*   **Device Compatibility:** Some CGM patches may require specific devices or software to access the data.\n\n【54】CGM patches are suitable for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who require insulin, as well as some individuals with gestational diabetes. However, CGM patches may not be suitable for everyone, including those with certain skin conditions or who are unable to calibrate the device regularly.\n\n【55】**Benefits:**\n\n【56】*   **Improved Glucose Control:** CGM patches help people with diabetes better manage their blood sugar levels, leading to improved glucose control and a reduced risk of complications.\n\n【57】*   **Enhanced Convenience:** By eliminating the need for regular finger stick tests, CGM patches make glucose monitoring easier and less invasive.\n\n【58】*   **Improved Quality of Life:** CGM patches can provide individuals with diabetes a greater sense of control over their condition, potentially reducing the stress and anxiety associated with managing blood sugar levels.\n\n【59】**Limitations:**\n\n【60】*   **Cost:** CGM patches can be pricey, and not all insurance providers pay for their purchase.\n\n【61】*   **Discomfort:** Some people may find the sensor insertion process uncomfortable or painful.\n\n【62】*   **Inaccuracy:** CGM patches may not always give correct readings, especially when there are fast fluctuations in blood sugar or when it is very low or very high.\n\n【63】*   **False Alarms:** Some CGM patches may issue false alerts or warn users without a need, which can cause confusion or worry in the user.\n\n【64】**2\\. Insulin Patch:**\n\n【65】Insulin patches are a type of wearable medical device that delivers insulin to the body through the skin. They are designed to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels by providing a more convenient and less invasive method of insulin delivery than traditional injections.\n\n【66】The innermost layer of skin is punctured by a tiny microneedle array used in CGM patches in order to deliver insulin to the subcutaneous tissue beneath. The insulin is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n【67】**Features:**\n\n【68】*   **Non-Invasive**: Insulin patches eliminate the need for injections, which can be painful and inconvenient for people with diabetes.\n\n【69】*   **Continuous Delivery**: Insulin patches can provide continuous delivery of insulin, which can help keep blood sugar levels more stable than traditional injections.\n\n【70】*   **Programmable:** Insulin patches can be set up to administer a certain amount of insulin at a certain time, simplifying blood sugar management.\n\n【71】*   **Customizable:** Insulin patches can be customized to suit the wearer's individual needs and preferences, such as adjusting the rate of insulin delivery or setting specific dosages.\n\n【72】**Benefits:**\n\n【73】*   Pain-free.\n\n【74】*   Continuous delivery of insulin.\n\n【75】*   Convenience.\n\n【76】*   Low risk of infection.\n\n【77】**Limitations:**\n\n【78】*   Limited availability.\n\n【79】*   Limited dosing options.\n\n【80】*   Skin irritation.\n\n【81】*   Limited effectiveness.\n\n【82】**Conclusion**\n\n【83】In conclusion, diabetes patches such as CGM and insulin patches offer convenient and potentially effective alternatives to traditional treatments for diabetes.\n\n【84】By utilizing CGM patches that provide real-time glucose monitoring, individuals with diabetes can enhance their ability to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the likelihood of complications. Insulin patches provide painless, continuous insulin delivery, but some people may have difficulty finding and using them.\n\n【85】Overall, it is crucial to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of diabetic patches with a healthcare professional to decide if they're a good choice for a person's particular needs and circumstances.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Glucose-responsive insulin patch for the regulation of blood glucose  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32015407/\n*   Glucose-Responsive Microneedle Patches for Diabetes Treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313291/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The rupturing of the esophagus leads to leakage of the toxic contents causing the infection. It is an emergency condition and needs urgent treatment as it can become fatal in a few days.\n\n【2】What Is the Prevalence of Boerhaave Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Boerhaave syndrome accounts for almost 15 percent of all cases of esophageal rupture.\n\n【4】It is estimated to affect 0.0003 percent of the total population.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Boerhaave Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Risk factors involved in Boerhaave syndrome are:\n\n【7】*   The build-up of pressure within the esophagus due to excessive straining.\n\n【8】*   Failure of cricopharyngeal muscle (muscles present in the upper portion of the esophagus or food pipe which opens and closes while swallowing) to relax resulting in the build-up of negative pressure outside the esophagus.\n\n【9】*   Forceful or continuous vomiting.\n\n【10】*   Straining while childbirth.\n\n【11】*   Straining by weightlifting.\n\n【12】*   Ingestion of any corrosive substance.\n\n【13】*   Seizures (disorder in which nerve cell activity of the brain is hampered).\n\n【14】*   Abdominal trauma.\n\n【15】*   Excessive intake of alcohol.\n\n【16】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Boerhaave Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Severe chest pain.\n\n【18】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【19】*   Pain on swallowing.\n\n【20】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【21】*   Fever.\n\n【22】*   Excessive sweating.\n\n【23】*   Tightness of the abdomen (belly).\n\n【24】*   Swelling of the tissue of the chest cavity.\n\n【25】What Is the Classic Triad of Boerhaave Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The Boerhaave syndrome typically manifests as Mackler's triad, which includes vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema (entrapment of air under the skin's tissues) as a result of an oesophageal rupture.\n\n【27】What Happens After the Rupture of the Esophagus?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The esophagus or food pipe is a part of the GIT (gastrointestinal tract) that carries chemicals and bacterial toxins that are not required by the body. Sudden rupture or bursting of the food pipe can lead to leakage of the food contents, chemicals, and toxins from the esophagus into the chest and abdomen, resulting in severe infections. This infection can further spread in the bloodstream. It can lead to septicemia (release of chemicals in the bloodstream) or septic shock, a life-threatening condition that can result in multiorgan failure and death.\n\n【29】How to Diagnose Boerhaave Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【30】Different diagnostic modalities of Boerhaave syndrome are:\n\n【31】*   **History and Clinical Examination:** The patient's history of the frequency of vomiting, chest pain, intake of any corrosive material, and breathing difficulties is recorded. A clinical examination is done to rule out a tightening of the abdomen.\n\n【32】*   **Esophagogram:** A radiograph using water-soluble contrast agents like gastrografin is performed to rule out any breach in the esophagus or food pipe. It is done by asking the patient to swallow the fluid containing the water-soluble contrast agent. The contrast dye highlights the complete esophagus from within and appears opaque on the radiograph. Any breach or tear in the esophagus will show leakage of the dye from the esophagus in the surrounding space, which can be easily detected in the radiograph. This test gives significant accuracy in the detection of Boerhaave syndrome.\n\n【33】*   **Computed Tomographic (CT) Scan:** It is done to assess the other involved organs due to Boerhaave syndrome. It also detects esophageal wall thickening and the presence of fluid leaks in the chest and abdomen cavities so that treatment for it can be planned accordingly.\n\n【34】*   **Chest X-Ray:** Chest X-ray helps detect signs of subcutaneous emphysema (entrapment of air under the skin's tissues) and pleural effusion (fluid build-up in the tissue lining the lungs and the chest).\n\n【35】*   **Endoscopic Examination:** It is also one of the techniques used to examine the esophagus or food pipe for the presence of any rupture with the help of an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube-like apparatus with an attached camera used to see the internal body structures). The endoscopic examination should be done cautiously to prevent any further perforation in the esophagus. Examination with the help of a chest tube can also be done with the help of a methylene blue dye test. The patient is asked to swallow the sweetened methylene blue dye, and it gives bluish discoloration to the chest tube drainage within 12 to 24 hours when observed under X-Ray or computed tomography scans.\n\n【36】What Is the Treatment of Boerhaave Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Treatment of the ruptured esophagus depends on the type, severity, and extent of the perforation. Different treatment methods are:\n\n【38】*   **Antibiotic Therapy:** The patient is kept on antibiotics to control the infection.\n\n【39】*   **Rehydration Therapy:** Intravenous fluids are started for the patient to recover the fluid volume loss from the body.\n\n【40】*   **Surgical Treatment:** Surgical repair of the perforated esophagus should be done within 24 hours under the guidance of VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery).\n\n【41】*   **Endoscopic Endoluminal Vacuum Therapy (EVT):** The leakage of the fluid content in the body cavities is drained, and any dead or necrotic tissue present is removed surgically. EVT (endoscopic endoluminal vacuum therapy) helps to clean the perforated cavity and drain the contents effectively. It also minimizes bacterial contamination and promotes esophageal healing.\n\n【42】*   **Esophagectomy:** In cases of any delay in diagnosis when surgery cannot be performed within 24 hours, the affected part of the esophagus is removed surgically, followed by esophageal replacement after six weeks.\n\n【43】*   **Esophageal Stenting:** Esophageal stenting by an endoscopic approach (under the guidance of an endoscope) is done to seal the perforated esophagus and prevent fistula (infected tract between two organs) formation in patients with delayed diagnosis.\n\n【44】**Complications of Boerhaave Syndrome**\n\n【45】*   Swelling of the chest cavity.\n\n【46】*   Formation of pus within the chest cavity (empyema).\n\n【47】*   Pneumothorax (trapping of air between the chest wall and lungs).\n\n【48】*   ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).\n\n【49】*   Entrapment of air under the tissues of the skin.\n\n【50】*   Septicemia and septic shock syndrome (a life-threatening condition resulting in multiorgan failure and death).\n\n【51】**Conclusion:**\n\n【52】Boerhaave syndrome is a rare but life-threatening condition. Early diagnosis of the esophageal rupture is crucial for emergency management of the condition within 12 to 24 hours. Any delay in the diagnosis and management can lead to further complications and death due to septic shock.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   Boerhaave Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430808/\n*   Successful Treatment Using Endoluminal Vacuum Therapy after Failure of Primary Closure in Boerhaave Syndrome  \n    https://synapse.koreamed.org/articles/1121271\n*   Boerhaave's Syndrome  \n    https://www.japi.org/w2d4c4/boerhaaves-syndrome\n*   Boerhaave syndrome  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/boerhaave-syndrome</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It happens in the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli, carrying blood to all body areas. In fibrinoid necrosis, the inside lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged. When blood vessels become damaged, they can break down, causing lesions in the blood vessels, bleeding, and bruises. Fibrinoid necrosis gets its name because the dead blood vessel cells will form fibrin, a non-globular protein that forms a fibrous material that can stop blood flow through the blood vessels.\n\n【2】What Causes Fibrinoid Necrosis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】Necrosis refers to cell death due to injury, trauma, or lack of blood supply. In fibrinoid necrosis, the immune system is highly active, releasing substances that attach to the inside blood vessels and cause inflammation. This can eventually kill the cells lining the blood vessel.\n\n【4】Any health condition can cause fibrinoid necrosis. High blood pressure can lead to fibrinoid necrosis. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Malignant hypertension is when blood pressure is 180/120 mmHg. This can cause fibrinoid necrosis in the blood vessels of the brain, heart, kidneys, and other organs.\n\n【5】Other conditions that can cause fibrinoid necrosis are:\n\n【6】*   Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure.\n\n【7】*   Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or lupus, and rheumatic fever.\n\n【8】*   Subacute bacterial endocarditis infection of the heart.\n\n【9】*   Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels that causes changes in the blood vessel walls.), such as polyarteritis nodosa, Buerger's disease, and IgA vasculitis.\n\n【10】*   Rejection of an organ transplant. If a body rejects a newly donated organ, an infection may result. This infection can damage the blood vessels near the transplant site, leading to fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Fibrinoid Necrosis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Because fibrinoid necrosis involves the destruction of the cells' blood vessels, bleeding may occur. Therefore, most symptoms linked to fibrinoid necrosis involve bleeding, including:\n\n【13】*   Bleeding gums.\n\n【14】*   Nosebleeding (epistaxis).\n\n【15】*   Blood in the urine (hematuria).\n\n【16】*   Blood in the stool (rectal bleeding).\n\n【17】*   Muscle bruises.\n\n【18】*   Hemorrhage of the spleen.\n\n【19】*   Traumatic and surgical bleeding.\n\n【20】*   Menorrhagia and postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【21】*   Gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【22】What Are the Potential Complications of Fibrinoid Necrosis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Complications often have to do with the condition or disease causing it. For instance, in malignant hypertension, fibrinoid necrosis in the kidneys can lead to kidney failure. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), fibrinoid necrosis can lead to skin lesions and heart issues associated with this disease.\n\n【24】How Is Fibrinoid Necrosis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【25】A healthcare provider conducts a biopsy to collect a tissue sample to study it under a microscope. Biopsy procedures typically depend on the location:\n\n【26】*   Internal biopsies involve taking a tissue sample from inside the body. Healthcare providers use a needle or an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera and tiny instruments at the end).\n\n【27】*   Skin biopsies involve shaving off a skin's thin layer or using a punch tool or incision to collect a deeper sample.\n\n【28】Fibrinoid necrosis can be identified only in histologic preparations and has no characteristic macroscopic features. In fibrinoid necrosis, tissues often appear eosinophilic (pink with H&E stains) and lose their structural details (becoming amorphous). \"fibrinoid necrosis\" defines this appearance because it resembles deposits of the blood clotting protein, fibrin.\n\n【29】The importance of fluorescence microscopic investigations with fluorochromes, using Novelli's method, and with certain other procedures are emphasized. Reference has been made to differences in the chemical composition of the fibrinoid substance and its relations to other related substances (keratin, amyloid, and fibrin). A detailed analysis would show that these deposits contain other plasma proteins as well; however, fibrin overshadows other proteins in histologic slides and gives the name to this lesion.\n\n【30】How Is Fibrinoid Necrosis Treated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】There's no standard treatment for bleeding. It depends on the type of bleeding and where it is in the body. Healthcare providers can also treat the conditions that cause fibrinoid necrosis. Medications can reduce blood pressure, suppress the immune system, and restrict further damage to the blood vessels. Healthcare providers can also treat the conditions that cause fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n【32】How to Prevent Fibrinoid Necrosis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Prevention aims to reduce the risk of developing the underlying conditions that cause it. Check in regularly with a healthcare provider. This is the most effective way to detect and address any health problems that may lead to more serious issues. Follow the healthcare provider's instructions if someone knows they have fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n【34】What Is the Outlook for People With Fibrinoid Necrosis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The outlook depends on how severe the underlying condition is. Some diseases that cause fibrinoid necrosis can affect a person's quality of life and lead to early death. People who do not receive prompt treatment for malignant hypertension have a life expectancy of only two years. In addition, follow-up care with a healthcare provider is essential. By following the provider's treatment plan, it is possible to manage the condition and prevent further damage.\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】Fibrinoid necrosis refers to the death of cells in small blood vessels that can lead to bleeding and internal damage throughout the body. Many conditions can cause fibrinoid necrosis, including autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus) and malignant hypertension. There is no standard treatment, but the conditions that cause it are treatable and preventable. The conditions that cause fibrinoid necrosis are serious and require close monitoring by a healthcare provider. Seeing a healthcare provider regularly can help one effectively manage health and prevent potential complications from underlying conditions.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   The fibrinoids of human placenta  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9010564/\n*   The fibrinoid necrosis of placenta  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4296715/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are small, pea-shaped glands located on either side of the vaginal opening. If the glands are blocked, the fluid gets stuck inside the gland causing a painful swelling called a Bartholin cyst. If the cyst gets infected, it is filled with pus and surrounded by inflamed tissues; it is called a Bartholin Abscess. It causes severe pain on one side of the vagina, and a person can notice swelling and change in color near the vagina. It can also vary from very small to over an inch in diameter.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Bartholin Abscess?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Bartholins abscess occurs when the cyst gets infected with bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Bartholin Abscess?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】If the cyst is tiny and not infected, there will be no symptoms.

It is a plastic tube that is thin and small with an inflatable balloon on one end.\n*   Once the balloon is passed inside the empty cyst or abscess, it is filled with saltwater which increases the size of the balloon and fills the abscess or cysts.\n*   Then stitches are made to hold the balloon in position temporarily.\n*   The catheter is left in place for four weeks; meanwhile, new cells grow around it, known as epithelialization.\n*   After the epithelialization, the balloon is drained, and the catheter is removed.\n\n【19】There may be a few complications due to balloon catheter insertion, which include:\n\n【20】*   Bleeding.\n*   Pain while the catheter is in its position.\n*   Discomfort or pain during sex.\n*   Infection.\n*   Scarring.\n\n【21】**Marsupialization:**\n\n【22】If there is a recurrence of the abscess or cyst, marsupialization is recommended. The following are the steps carried out during the procedure:\n\n【23】*   Initially, general anesthesia is provided to the patient.\n*   The abscess is opened with a small incision, and the pus is drained out.\n*   Then stitches are used at each side of the incision to create a permanent opening.\n*   After completing the procedure, the treated area is packed with cotton to absorb the pus and blood from the wound, which would be removed before discharge from the hospital.\n*   The complications after marsupialization may include infection, bleeding, pain, and recurrence of the abscess.\n\n【24】**Bartholin's Gland Removal (Bartholinectomy) -**\n\n【25】If there is frequent recurrence and failure of other procedures, then Bartholin's gland removal is recommended. Bartholinectomy is done under general anesthesia, and two to three days of hospitalization are required. The surgery complications may include bleeding, bruising, and infection of the wound.\n\n【26】**Ablation With Silver Nitrate -**\n\n【27】It is a simple and effective technique that makes a small incision near the cyst or abscess. The content is then drained, and silver nitrate is placed into the cyst after draining. After two to three days, the silver nitrate is removed or falls by itself. The complications may include a burning sensation at the surgical site, dyspareunia, and hematoma.\n\n【28】**Carbon Dioxide Laser -**\n\n【29】This surgical procedure is simple, quick, and causes minimal discomfort to the patient, but it is an expensive procedure. The cyst is removed and destroyed using the laser; at times, a small hole is made to allow fluid drainage.\n\n【30】**Needle Aspiration -**\n\n【31】A needle and syringe are used to drain the cyst in this procedure. Then the cavity is filled with 70 percent alcohol and left in the hole for five minutes, and drained out.\n\n【32】What to Expect After the Surgery?\n---------------------------------\n\n【33】*   A sanitary pad held on with elasticated net pants will be provided. Cotton or gauze inside the wound will be taken out after 24 hours.\n\n【34】*   The vulva will feel slightly painful for 24 hours after the operation. To control the pain, painkillers would be provided, and antibiotics if there was any infection.\n\n【35】*   You can wash the wound area with soap and tap water. Saltwater is not necessary.\n\n【36】*   You can return to a light job after about one week and any heavy jobs after two weeks.\n\n【37】*   You can start sexual relations again when you feel comfortable, usually after two weeks.\n\n【38】What Are the Home Remedy Options for Bartholin Cyst or Abscess?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Home remedies usually relieve the symptoms but do not provide a permanent cure.\n\n【40】The few frequently followed home remedies include:\n\n【41】*   **Sitz Bath:** It helps relieve pain and discomfort. A bathtub is filled with warm water, and a person needs to sit in the water for about 15 minutes; repeat this procedure many times for three to four days or until the symptoms subside. This method helps in the rupture of small abscesses.\n\n【42】*   **Topical Treatment:** Topical application of some natural oil and other products can provide relief from Bartholin's cyst or abscess, which includes :\n\n【43】*   **Natural Oils:** Applying a mixture of castor oil and tea tree oil to the abscess may help drain the abscess. Soak the oil mixture in the gauze, apply it to the affected area, and place hot compression on top of the gauze.\n\n【44】*   **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Dilute the apple cider vinegar and apply it to the abscess with a cotton ball.\n\n【45】How to Reduce the Risk of Bartholin Cyst?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【46】By reducing the following risk factors, Bartholin's cyst can be prevented to some extent:\n\n【47】*   Maintain good genital hygiene and only clean the outside of the vagina.\n\n【48】*   Add probiotic supplements to your diet, which will support the urinary tract and vagina.\n\n【49】*   Drink more water.\n\n【50】*   Use condoms to avoid sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【51】*   Get regular checkups to test for sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【52】**Conclusion :**\n\n【53】Bartholin's cyst or abscess can be painful while doing routine work. The proper treatment will help to relieve the pain and swelling.

When a woman with diabetes becomes pregnant, it is important for her to carefully manage her blood sugar levels to reduce the risks to her baby.\n\n【2】What Is an Infant of a Diabetic Mother?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】An infant of a diabetic mother is an infant born to a mother with diabetes. The infant of a diabetic mother has a higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The baby is at a risk for problems even after birth.\n\n【4】What Causes Diabetes in Mothers During Pregnancy?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Two types of diabetes can occur during pregnancy. One variant is present even before the woman becomes pregnant (pre-gestational diabetes) and the other type is acquired during the pregnancy (gestational diabetes).\n\n【6】*   **Gestational Diabetes** \\- This type of diabetes is not present before pregnancy. The woman develops gestational diabetes during pregnancy and it goes away after the birth of the baby. Gestational diabetes may be caused due to the hormones produced during pregnancy which may block the insulin.\n\n【7】*   **Pre-gestational Diabetes** \\- In this type, the woman has diabetes before getting pregnant. Pregestational diabetes may be type 1 or type 2.\n\n【8】What Are the Effects of Maternal Diabetes on Infants?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The excess blood glucose in the mother’s body gets transferred to the fetus during pregnancy. This may cause an increase in the risk of birth defects and stillbirth. Some of the potential complications that maternal diabetes has on babies are listed below:\n\n【10】*   **Macrosomia:** It is a common complication in an infant of a diabetic mother. Babies are larger than average in macrosomia. Newborns of diabetic mothers have increased muscle mass, excess body fat, and bigger organs. The excess glucose from the mother's blood gets stored up as fat in the baby's body making the baby grow larger than normal.\n\n【11】*   **Metabolic Disorders:**\n\n【12】    2.  **Hypocalcemia** - Low blood calcium concentration in the infants of diabetic mothers. This is due to the decrease in calcium and vitamin D in the mother.\n\n【13】    3.  **Hyperbilirubinemia** - In this condition, there is bilirubin buildup in the blood. This may cause jaundice with yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin. It is not a serious complication.\n\n【14】*   **Preterm Birth**: There is an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth in diabetic mothers. The exact cause of preterm birth in diabetic mothers is still controversial.\n\n【15】*   **Respiratory Disorders:** Babies born to mothers with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome, a condition in which the baby’s lungs are not fully developed and they have difficulty breathing.\n\n【16】*   **Hematological Disorders:** Infants of diabetic mothers have been found to have polycythemia (abnormally high red blood cell count). Hypoglycemia may be aggravated if the baby has polycythemia, this is due to the increased consumption of glucose by the increased red blood cells.\n\n【17】*   **Cardiac Disorders:**\n\n【18】    1.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be present in infants of diabetic mothers. In this condition, the heart muscles become thickened.\n\n【19】    2.  Congenital cardiac defects in babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may be seen.\n\n【20】*   **Neurologic Impairments:**\n\n【21】    1.  Neurologic impairments in babies with diabetic mothers are due to metabolic disorders, perinatal asphyxia (a condition in which the body is deprived of oxygen), and birth traumas.\n\n【22】    2.  The chances for perinatal asphyxia are increased in cases of macrosomia when one of the baby’s shoulders gets stuck during delivery (shoulder dystocia).\n\n【23】    3.  Metabolic disorders like hypoglycemia may produce signs like jitteriness, hypothermia, apnoea, apathy, seizures, and tremors.\n\n【24】    4.  Brachial plexus injuries may occur as a result of spinal cord trauma during birth.\n\n【25】    5.  Poor suckling patterns were found in infants of insulin-managed diabetic mothers. This is due to neurologic immaturity during the neonatal period.\n\n【26】**How Is an Infant of a Diabetic Mother Treated?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Treatment for an infant with a diabetic mother is specifically planned considering factors like the baby’s gestational age, overall health, the extent of the condition, the baby’s tolerance to medications or procedures, etc. Common treatment includes:\n\n【28】*   **Blood Glucose Monitoring** \\- Infants born to diabetic mothers are at risk of low blood sugar levels, and therefore early and frequent blood glucose monitoring is essential. Treatment involves feeding the baby more frequently along with intravenous administration of glucose.\n\n【29】*   **Respiratory Support**: It is given to babies with respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【30】*   **Phototherapy:** Phototherapy for babies with jaundice involves exposing the baby’s skin to blue light to help break down bilirubin.\n\n【31】*   **Feeding Support:** Feeding support for babies with difficulty in breastfeeding includes supplementation with formula, lactation counseling, nipple shields, etc.\n\n【32】*   Other birth injuries and birth defects are treated accordingly.\n\n【33】*   Monitoring for long-term complications including blood glucose levels and overall health is essential because infants born to diabetic mothers are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in their life.\n\n【34】What Can Be Done to Prevent Complications in an Infant With a Diabetic Mother?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】To prevent complications in an infant with a diabetic mother, it is important to manage the diabetes of the mother before and during pregnancy. Here are some steps that can be taken\n\n【36】*   Preconception care to optimize the blood sugar level is given to women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant.\n\n【37】*   All women are tested for gestational diabetes between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【38】*   Regular monitoring of the blood sugar levels is done throughout the pregnancy to ensure that they remain within a safe range.\n\n【39】*   Medication and nutrition are adjusted according to the needs of the pregnant mother. A well-balanced diet that does not affect blood sugar levels is planned for the diabetic mother by a dietician.\n\n【40】*   Regular exercise as advised by the doctor can help control blood sugar levels and promote a healthy pregnancy.\n\n【41】*   Close fetal monitoring during pregnancy can help detect any potential complications early on, allowing for timely interventions.\n\n【42】*   Depending on the mother’s diabetic management and the health of the baby, the delivery may need to be scheduled early or by C-section to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk for many complications. However, control of the maternal blood sugar levels during pregnancy may reduce the risks of complications in the infant. The symptoms of infants with diabetic mothers usually subside within days or weeks in most cases.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- What neonatal complications should the pediatrician be aware of in case of maternal gestational diabetes?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458502/\n*   Medline Plus- Infant of diabetic mother  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001597.htm\n*   Standford Medicine: Infant of a Mother with Diabetes  \n    https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=infant-of-diabetic-mother-90-P02354\n*   CHOP- Infant of Diabetic Mother  \n    https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/infant-diabetic-mother</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus, where there is acute destruction of the renal papilla and an absence of suppuration in the affected area. It is a worrisome complication but is rare. Renal papillary necrosis can occur as a sequel of obstructive uropathy (a condition when urine cannot drain through the urinary tracts) in nondiabetic cases.\n\n【2】What Is Renal Papillary Necrosis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Renal papillary necrosis is a disorder of the kidney in which one or all renal papillae are destroyed. The renal pyramid has an apex called the renal papilla, where the openings of the collecting ducts enter the kidney, and the urine flows into the ureters.\n\n【4】What Are the Synonyms of Renal Papillary Necrosis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The synonyms involve:\n\n【6】*   Necrotizing pyelonephritis.\n\n【7】*   Papillitis renis necroticans.\n\n【8】*   Gunther's disease (also called congenital erythropoietic porphyria affects skin, teeth, bones, hematopoietic system, and bones).\n\n【9】*   Diphtheria of the papilla.\n\n【10】*   Papillitis necroticans.\n\n【11】**Pathogenesis of Renal Papillary Necrosis:**\n\n【12】In the absence of urinary tract obstruction, the lesions of renal papillary necrosis are rarely seen in cases of nondiabetic patients. The most accepted concept is ischemia of the medullary portion of the medulla, which is an ischemic infarct. The characteristics of the lesion are similar to that of an infarct (a condition in which there is the death of a tissue due to obstruction of blood supply caused by a blood clot or narrowing of a blood vessel). The demerit of this theory is that there is no evidence of obstructed blood flow to the papilla. In studies, conducted authors have suggested that it may be due to the coalescence of abscesses at the base of the medulla, and some say it is due to arteriosclerosis of the blood vessels supplying the medulla. Increased hydrostatic pressure, which leads to extrinsic pressure in the tubules caused after obstruction, may also be one of the reasons.\n\n【13】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【14】The symptoms include:\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Cystic Renal Tumors - Types, Clinical Presentation, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Sickle Cell and Kidneys: A Bad Reaction</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>Kidney Tuberculosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【20】*   **Flank Pain:** The pains present on one side of the body between the upper abdomen and the back.\n\n【21】*   Presence of blood (hematuria) or dark and cloudy urine.\n\n【22】*   Presence of tissue pieces in the urine.\n\n【23】*   The patient may sometimes have chills along with fever.\n\n【24】*   **Dysuria:** Pain while passing urine.\n\n【25】*   **Urgency:** Strong irresistible urge to pass urine, patient is often not able to hold the urine.\n\n【26】*   Increased frequency of passing urine.\n\n【27】*   **Urinary Hesitancy:** Difficulty in maintaining a continuous urine stream.\n\n【28】*   **Urinary Incontinence:** Leaky urine caused due to loss of bladder control.\n\n【29】*   Passing urine in large volumes.\n\n【30】*   Increased frequency of passing urine at night.\n\n【31】*   **Azotemia:** Increased levels of urea and nitrogen compounds in the blood.\n\n【32】*   **Albuminuria:** The presence of high levels of albumin in the urine.\n\n【33】*   Individuals have elevated white blood cell count.\n\n【34】*   **Stupor:** A state of unconsciousness.\n\n【35】What Are the Diagnostic Tests Done in Renal Papillary Necrosis?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】On examination, the affected flank area may be tender, and the patient may have a history of frequent urinary tract infections. The patient may also show signs of kidney failure or blocked urine flow.\n\n【37】The doctor may advise the following tests:\n\n【38】*   Ultrasound.\n\n【39】*   Computed tomography (CT).\n\n【40】*   Blood test.\n\n【41】*   Urine test.\n\n【42】Structural changes cause an increase in the size of the minor calyces, which are cavities in the kidney where the urine gets collected. There may be sloughing of the papilla, which produces negative shadows in the large calyces or pelvis. A retrograde urogram can detect all these findings. The program may fail to detect initial cases in which no sloughing has occurred and may appear normal.\n\n【43】What Are the Causes?\n--------------------\n\n【44】Causes involve:\n\n【45】*   **Analgesic Nephropathy:** This condition involves damage to the internal structures of the kidney caused due to long-term usage of pain medications (analgesics). They involve counter drugs (such as phenacetin and acetaminophen) and NSAIDs (such as Ibuprofen and Aspirin).\n\n【46】*   **Sickle Cell Nephropathy:** Sickling of red blood cells in the small blood vessels leading to kidney complications.\n\n【47】*   Diabetes mellitus accompanied urinary tract infections.\n\n【48】*   Prolonged usage of NSAID (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n\n【49】*   **Pyelonephritis:** Infection in the kidneys.\n\n【50】*   Kidney transplant rejection.\n\n【51】*   Urinary tract blockage.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications of Renal Papillary Necrosis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis).\n\n【54】*   **Renal calculi:** Formation of kidney stones.\n\n【55】*   Cancer of the kidneys.\n\n【56】When to Seek Help?\n------------------\n\n【57】Contact a health care professional immediately if there is blood in urine and other symptoms that have been mentioned above in this article.\n\n【58】**Prognosis:**\n\n【59】Prognosis solely depends on the condition causing the disease. If symptomatic relief is provided and the cause is eliminated, then the person with renal papillary necrosis can recover. But not all cases see complete recovery and may lead to kidney failure, which will require a kidney transplant or dialysis.\n\n【60】What Is the Possible Treatment for Renal Papillary Necrosis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】The treatment for renal papillary necrosis is more of a symptomatic approach, where the doctor will try to ease the symptoms and try to eliminate the cause.\n\n【62】**Analgesic Neuropathy:**\n\n【63】In cases of analgesic nephropathy, which is caused due to over the counter pain medications, the doctor will advise the patient to stop those medications.\n\n【64】**Sickle Cell Neuropathy:**\n\n【65】In cases of sickle cell nephropathy, proteinuria managed by a low protein diet should be avoided. Medications that help manage sickle cell nephropathy involve angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to help reduce proteinuria. Hydroxyurea is an analgesic that helps decrease the complications caused by sickle cell nephropathy. It helps reduce lactate dehydrogenase and reticulocytes. Erythropoietin stimulating agents are given to treat anemia and hypoxia.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】Renal papillary necrosis is a disorder of the kidney in which one or all renal papillae are destroyed. The renal pyramid has an apex called the renal papilla, where the openings of the collecting ducts enter the kidney, and the urine flows into the ureters. Von Friedrick described this disease in the year 1877. Renal papillary necrosis is caused by analgesic nephropathy, sickle cell neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, pyelonephritis, and urinary tract blockage.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is easily transmitted, and in the majority of cases, it spreads from one to another through droplets. This virus can also be transmitted through direct inoculation, but it is less frequent. In most people, dendritic keratitis infection does not cause any permanent damage to the cornea, but in severe cases, there might be some scarring.\n\n【2】The most common type of HSV that is responsible for the infection of the cornea is HSV-1, which is also a type of herpes simplex virus that is responsible for causing cold sores on the mouth. Also, dendritic keratitis is considered to be one of the major causes of blindness throughout the world.\n\n【3】What Is the Cause of Dendritic Keratitis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【4】Dendritic keratitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is usually transmitted from one person to another and affects only human beings. In most cases, dendritic keratitis happens as a result of the reactivation of earlier infections. The commonest fact is that corneal infection occurs following another body part's infection. In most cases, another body part being affected is the mouth.\n\n【5】The HSV virus is a double-stranded DNA virus with its core surrounded by a capsid in icosahedron's shape. There are two types of HSV virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is generally associated with infections that affect the orofacial region, whereas HSV-2 is associated with causing infections in the genitals.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms Associated with Dendritic Keratitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Since this condition is directly involved with eyesight, a person could easily notice the signs and symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms of dendritic keratitis include:\n\n【8】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【9】*   Redness of the eye.\n\n【10】*   High sensitivity to light.\n\n【11】*   Eye pain.\n\n【12】*   Constant discharge from the eye.\n\n【13】*   Slight tearing.\n\n【14】If a person is experiencing the above-explained symptoms, it is important to:\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Viral Conjunctivitis - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Corneal Ulcer - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>Disorders of the Cornea - a Brief Overview</u>\n\n【20】*   Remove the contact lenses if they are wearing any.\n*   Wash the eyes frequently with water.\n\n【21】*   Consult a doctor as leaving it untreated could lead to blindness or loss of vision.\n\n【22】What Are the Various Risk Factors of Dendritic Keratitis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The following are the risk factors of dendritic keratitis;\n\n【24】1) Dendritic keratitis is recurrent in nature, so people who have been infected earlier by the herpes simplex virus are at a higher risk of getting it again.\n\n【25】2) The risk gets higher with the group of the population who wear contact lenses.\n\n【26】3) Certain studies have identified that some factors can increase the likelihood of reactivation of the disease. They are:\n\n【27】*   Increased body heat.\n\n【28】*   Stress.\n\n【29】*   Sunlight exposure.\n\n【30】*   Trauma.\n\n【31】*   Menstruation.\n\n【32】*   Stimulation of trigeminal nerve.\n\n【33】*   Other infectious diseases.\n\n【34】4) Some investigations have also shown that women are more susceptible to dendritic keratitis than men.\n\n【35】5) Hormonal changes also significantly increase the risk of being affected by dendritic keratitis.\n\n【36】How Is Dendritic Keratitis Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】Various laboratory tests can be performed to diagnose dendritic keratitis. The condition is clinically marked by the presence of numerous dendritic epithelial ulcers on the terminal bulbs. There can also be other infections such as:\n\n【38】*   Stromal edema.\n\n【39】*   Conjunctivitis.\n\n【40】*   White blood cell infiltration of the sub-epithelium.\n\n【41】Serologic testing might be used to diagnose dendritic keratitis, but it is not very helpful if the patient has already been affected by HSV infections. However, finding the presence of the herpes simplex virus could be helpful with cytological findings from the scrapping of;\n\n【42】*   Conjunctivitis.\n\n【43】*   Vesicular lesions.\n\n【44】*   Impression cytology specimen.\n\n【45】Some of the other diagnostic procedures include:\n\n【46】*   **Fluorescent Antibody Testing -** It involves impression cytology with the aid of a nitrocellulose membrane.\n\n【47】*   **Tzanck Smear Testing -** It helps in identifying multinucleated cells and eosinophilic inclusion bodies.\n\n【48】How Is Dendritic Keratitis Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【49】**1\\. Pharmacological Treatment:**\n\n【50】The treatment of dendritic keratitis mainly consists of antiviral medications (either topical or oral). This includes,\n\n【51】*   Eye drops.\n\n【52】*   Ointments that can be applied to the eye.\n\n【53】*   Tablets such as Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir, etc.\n\n【54】These medications are prescribed for around 10 to 14 days. The oral medications are prescribed twice a day, and the topical medicine must be applied five times daily.\n\n【55】**2\\. Non-Pharmacological Treatment:**\n\n【56】Undergoing surgery is another treatment option, but it is considered only in severe cases where the cornea has been scratched heavily and as a result of which vision is affected.\n\n【57】Each case of dendritic keratitis is different. Hence, it is important to reach out to your doctor as early as possible to avoid any serious damage to the eye and eyesight. Though some of these medications drastically reduce the signs and prevent the recurrence of the symptoms, they are only used as a management method since there is no permanent cure for dendritic keratitis.\n\n【58】How Can Dendritic Keratitis Be Prevented?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【59】The following are some of the tips to prevent dendritic keratitis.\n\n【60】1.  The first and foremost step in having a healthy life is to be hygienic. This not only helps us against dendritic keratitis, but it also helps us to be safe from all other infections.\n\n【61】2.  Dendritic keratitis is mainly transmitted through droplets; hence it is important to avoid unnecessary contact of unwashed hands with the eye.\n\n【62】3.  Proper care should be taken to keep your hands clean. Wash your hands before and after touching any objects.\n\n【63】4.  As dendritic keratitis occurs predominantly following an oral infection, reach out to your doctor in case of cold sores to prevent them from spreading to the eyes.\n\n【64】**Conclusion:**\n\n【65】Dendritic keratitis is a serious condition that might be marked by recurrent infections. However, it can be prevented and treated if proper medical intervention is done. It can be managed extensively through oral and topical medications, but surgery happens to be the only course of treatment in case of severe scarring. Even after surgery, antiviral medications might be prescribed to extend the survival rate of the grafts that are placed during the surgery and prevent further recurrence.\n\n【66】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【67】* * *\n\n【68】#### **1.**删除换行**Define Dendritic Keratitis?**\n\n【69】Dendritic keratitis is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus that affects the cornea, the transparent outer layer of the eye.

Preeclampsia is a severe form of hypertension. It can result in serious health issues for the mother and the unborn child and is one of several consequences that high blood pressure can cause.\n\n【2】Breastfeeding is beneficial for both the mother and the baby. It is advised to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life, then to continue doing so while introducing complementary foods until the child is at least one year old and as long as both the mother and the child desire. Breastfeeding has beneficial effects on a mother's health including lowering her blood pressure.\n\n【3】Studies have proven breastfeeding to help lower the risk of maternal hypertension. Breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin, a hormone that helps to relax the blood vessels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Oxytocin also promotes the relaxation of smooth muscles, including those in the uterus, which helps to reduce the risk of postpartum bleeding.\n\n【4】What Is Preeclampsia?\n---------------------\n\n【5】A significant pregnancy problem known as preeclampsia is marked by elevated blood pressure and organ damage to the liver and kidneys, among other organs. Typically, it appears after the 20th week of pregnancy. However, it might do so at any point. Numerous symptoms, such as excruciating headaches, visual problems, edema (fluid acculmulation), and shortness of breath, can be brought on by preeclampsia.\n\n【6】Preeclampsia's specific cause is unknown. However, it is thought to be related to issues with the placenta's blood arteries. The placenta is an organ that grows during pregnancy and gives the growing fetus nutrition and oxygen. High blood pressure and other issues can result from the placenta's blood arteries not working properly.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Effects of Asthma on Pregnancy - Associated Risks and Management</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Pregnancy - Safety, and Precautions</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Telemedicine and Its Uses During Pregnancy</u>\n\n【12】Preeclampsia can be a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention. If not treated on time, it can lead to various complications, including premature birth, low birth weight, placental abruption, and even maternal and fetal death.\n\n【13】What Are the Positive Effects of Breastfeeding on Maternal Hypertension?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Breastfeeding can positively affect maternal hypertension or high blood pressure during and after pregnancy. Several studies have found that breastfeeding can help to reduce the risk of maternal hypertension and its associated complications.\n\n【15】*   One study in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that women who breastfed for at least 12 months had a significantly reduced risk of developing hypertension compared to those who breastfed for less than 12 months. The study also found that the longer a woman breastfed, the greater her risk of hypertension was reduced.\n\n【16】*   Breastfeeding can also positively impact the cardiovascular system, which can help lower blood pressure. A study in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that women who breastfed for at least six months had a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, than those who did not breastfeed.\n\n【17】*   Breastfeeding can also help to reduce stress and anxiety levels in new mothers, which can contribute to lower blood pressure. Breastfeeding can promote the release of the hormone prolactin, which has a calming effect and helps to reduce stress levels.\n\n【18】What Are the Negative Effects of Breastfeeding on Maternal Hypertension?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Limited evidence suggests that breastfeeding can negatively affect maternal hypertension or high blood pressure during and after pregnancy. The overwhelming majority of research shows that breastfeeding positively affects maternal hypertension.\n\n【20】However, there are some situations where breastfeeding may need to be temporarily interrupted or discontinued due to its potential negative effects on maternal hypertension. For example, if a woman with hypertension takes certain medications to manage her condition, such as beta-blockers or ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, these medications could be passed to the baby through breast milk and potentially cause harm. In this case, the woman may need to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding until she can switch to a safer medication. In addition, if a woman with hypertension experiences severe symptoms, such as seizures or other complications of preeclampsia, she may need to be hospitalized and cannot breastfeed.\n\n【21】What Are the Other Benefits of Breastfeeding on Both Mother and Infant?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Breastfeeding has numerous benefits for both the baby and the mother. These are as follows:\n\n【23】*   **Reduced Risk of Breast and Ovarian Cancer:** Studies have shown that breastfeeding women have a reduced risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the protection against these types of cancer.\n\n【24】*   **Improved Uterine Contractions:** Breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin (a hormone that helps the uterus contract after childbirth). These contractions help to reduce bleeding and promote healing.\n\n【25】*   **Reduced Risk of Postpartum Depression:** Women who breastfeed have lower rates of postpartum depression. Breastfeeding promotes the release of hormones that help to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\n【26】*   **Lower Risk of Osteoporosis:** Breastfeeding can help to reduce the risk of osteoporosis (weakning of bone) in women. This is because breastfeeding promotes the absorption of calcium, which is important for bone health.\n\n【27】*   **Increased Bonding:** Breastfeeding promotes bonding between the mother and the baby. This is because the mother and the baby have physical contact during breastfeeding, which helps to strengthen the emotional bond.\n\n【28】*   **Delayed Return of Menstruation:** Breastfeeding can delay the return of menstruation in some women. This is because breastfeeding suppresses ovulation, which can prevent the release of an egg and delay the start of the menstrual cycle.\n\n【29】*   **Reduced Risk of Type 2 Diabetes:** Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This is because breastfeeding promotes glucose absorption, which helps regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n【30】*   **Weight Loss:** Breastfeeding can help women to lose weight after pregnancy. This is because breastfeeding burns calories and promotes the release of hormones that help to reduce fat stores.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Breastfeeding benefits the baby and positively affects maternal health, including reducing the risk of hypertension. It stimulates the release of oxytocin, improves cardiovascular health, reduces stress levels, and helps prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding as part of maternal care can have long-lasting positive effects on both the mother's and the baby's health.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   EFFECTS OF LACTATION ON POSTPARTUM BLOOD PRESSURE AMONG WOMEN WITH GESTATIONAL HYPERTENSION AND PREECLAMPSIA  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4967398/\n*   Influence of breastfeeding on maternal blood pressure at one month postpartum  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410704/\n*   Influence of breastfeeding on maternal blood pressure at one month postpartum  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22870047/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is an atypical form of pneumonia. It is caused by a bacteria called Legionella. Untreated cases of Legionnaires' disease can be dangerous and fatal. Treatment with antibiotics can cure Legionnaires’ disease. Some people continue to have problems after treatment.\n\n【2】Older adults are more susceptible to this disease. Smokers, alcoholic people, and those with poor immunity are affected more.\n\n【3】What Is the Incubation Period of Legionnaires’ Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The time taken for a disease to show its symptoms is known as the incubation period. Legionnaires' disease starts showing its symptoms within two to fourteen days after exposure to the Legionella bacteria.\n\n【5】What Are the Symptoms of Legionnaires’ Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】*   The symptoms begin with fever, chest pain, and fever.\n\n【7】*   The spread of infection can happen to other organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, and heart.\n\n【8】The specific symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include:\n\n【9】*   Fever above 104 ℉.\n\n【10】*   Chills.\n\n【11】*   Fatigue.\n\n【12】*   Headache.\n\n【13】*   Cough. This may be accompanied by blood.\n\n【14】*   Muscle ache.\n\n【15】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【16】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【17】*   Chest pain.\n\n【18】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【19】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【20】*   Seizures.\n\n【21】*   Confusion.\n\n【22】What Are the Risk Factors of Legionnaires’ Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   Most healthy people do not get sick, even though they are exposed to Legionella. People who are at increased risk of getting sick are:\n\n【24】*   People who are 50 years and older.\n\n【25】*   Smokers. It can affect people who have quit smoking too.\n\n【26】*   People with cancer are more susceptible.\n\n【27】*   People with chronic lung diseases can also be affected. The diseases might include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.\n\n【28】*   People who have poor immune systems.\n\n【29】*   People with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, liver failure, and kidney failure.\n\n【30】How Does Legionnaires’ Disease Spread?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【31】The bacteria Legionella grows and multiplies in the water system. The water containing Legionella then spreads through droplets. When people who are living near the unhygienic water supply tend to get exposed to more bacteria. In some cases, people can accidentally inhale Legionella. In this way, the bacteria directly goes into the lungs.\n\n【32】What Are the Complications of Legionnaires' Disease?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Respiratory failure.\n\n【34】*   Septic shock.\n\n【35】*   Kidney failure.\n\n【36】What Are the Diagnostic Tests for Legionnaires’ Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】**Culture:**\n\n【38】Legionella can be isolated on supporting mediums such as buffered charcoal yeast extract agar when the urinary antigen test fails to detect Legionella's species. It can detect Legionella species and serogroups that the urinary antigen test does not.\n\n【39】**Urinary Antigen Test:**\n\n【40】The most common test for the diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is done in the laboratory using the urinary antigen test. If this test is performed in a patient who already has pneumonia, the test result is positive. The test can remain positive even after the antibiotic treatment.\n\n【41】Serologic and molecular techniques can help in finding out the bacteria.\n\n【42】**NAATs Test:**\n\n【43】Legionnaires' disease can be diagnosed with the help of nucleic acid amplification tests, also known as NAATs. These tests look for the presence of legionella DNA in a patient's tissue to make the diagnosis. NAATs are extremely sensitive and specific, and they can identify even small amounts of Legionella DNA in a relatively short amount of time. NAATs are versatile in that they can be run on a variety of materials, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or urine, and they can function either independently or in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures. However, additional research is required to fully understand the clinical utility of these tests for the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease. Although recent studies agree that NAATs have several potential advantages over traditional culture-based methods, such as faster turnaround time and increased sensitivity, the researchers also note that further research is required.\n\n【44】What Are the Treatment Options of Legionnaires’ Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Antibiotics like Macrolides and Tetracyclines, are used in the effective treatment of Legionella species. The current treatment of respiratory tract infections are Quinolones, such as Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, and Gemifloxacin. The most commonly used antibiotics are Levofloxacin, Doxycycline, and Azithromycin. These antibiotics are highly effective because they have the capacity of excellent penetration into the Legionella-infected cells. Macrolides such as Azithromycin are given for the treatment of patients in all age groups. Levofloxacin can be used in patients above 18 years of age. Doxycycline is prescribed for children above 12 years of age. Rifampicin is often used in combination with a Quinolone or Macrolide.\n\n【46】According to a study published in 2022, the suggested first-line treatment for Legionnaires' disease is either a fluoroquinolone (preferable azithromycin), such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, or a macrolide, such as moxifloxacin. The selection of an antibiotic may be influenced by the infection's severity, the patient's allergies or other health issues, and the local pattern of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics may be administered in combinations in certain instances.\n\n【47】The average number of days recommended for treatment are five to ten. In the case of outbreaks with Legionnaires’ disease, antibiotics are given as prophylactic measures. In this way, huge populations getting affected can be prevented. High-risk individuals can be treated better without being exposed to serious infections.\n\n【48】How to Reduce the Risk of Legionella?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【49】The risk of Legionella can be reduced at home itself. The possibility of Legionella species causing infection at home to the family members is relatively very low. Most of the household equipment cannot store much water. It is always good to maintain a proper clean source of water supply.\n\n【50】Follow these simple steps to prevent the bacteria from growing rapidly:\n\n【51】*   Keeping the hot water thermostat regularly at a temperature of 60ºC can kill any Legionella bacteria. Be aware as the water at this high temperature may cause scalding. Scalding water refers to the burning of flesh and skin due to very high temperatures. It can result in blister formation in the skin. Sometimes the wound gets deeper and can be very painful. These wounds might take several weeks to heal completely.\n\n【52】*   Keep all showerheads free from any accumulation of algae and any bacteria. Such microorganisms can be removed by descaling once every three months. The things required for descaling are lime juice, baking soda, white vinegar, and hot water. These ingredients can be used for domestic descaling. Domestic descaling solutions are also available. After the process of descaling is complete, flush the shower fully and soak it in a bleaching solution. This can help a person to sterilize the equipment and kill the bacteria.\n\n【53】*   Clean the taps by brushing them with a nylon brush.\n\n【54】*   If an individual is planning to go on a vacation for more than ten days a week, it is essential to run all showers and taps continuously for two minutes. This can flush out the bacteria.\n\n【55】*   Check whether the lids on water tanks have tight-fitting. This can help to prevent contamination with microorganisms.\n\n【56】*   Deposits such as rust or others should be replaced soon.\n\n【57】*   If the hot water system is not heating properly, try to replace it as early as possible.\n\n【58】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【59】Diagnosing Legionnaires’ disease faster can increase the chances of getting recovery faster. It can help the recovery period become more effective. It can prevent serious complications. If the doctor thinks a person has been exposed to Legionella bacteria, they have to coordinate with him for a proper treatment plan.\n\n【60】What Is the Prognosis of Legionnaires’ Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【61】The patient's age, general health, and the extent of the illness at the time of diagnosis are just a few of the variables that can affect the prognosis for Legionnaires' disease. Recent studies have shown that cases of Legionella pneumonia with delayed antibiotic therapy have a worse prognosis. In addition, people who smoke also have a poor prognosis. Furthermore, in some people, especially those who are older or have underlying medical problems that impair their immune systems, the illness can be severe and even fatal. Septic shock, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a few potential side effects of Legionnaires' disease. It is crucial to closely watch patients who have Legionnaires' disease and to act quickly if complications arise.\n\n【62】**Conclusion:**\n\n【63】In general, as a result of the rising number of reported cases of legionnaires' disease all over the globe. To help stop the illness from getting worse, people in the medical field and the general public need to be more careful and aware of their surroundings.\n\n【64】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【65】* * *\n\n【66】#### **1.**删除换行**What Causes Legionnaires' Disease?**\n\n【67】Legionnaires', also known as Pontiac fever, is a milder form of pneumonia or lung inflammation caused by Legionella bacteria.\n\n【68】#### **2.**删除换行**How Do You Contract Legionnaires’ Disease?**\n\n【69】The causative bacteria (Legionella) can enter the body by breathing in small droplets of water present in the air, water, or soil that contains the bacteria. It is less commonly contracted from the aspiration of drinking water that contains Legionella because this happens only when the water gets accidentally into the lungs while drinking. People with a weakened immune system, older people, and smokers are most likely to contract the disease.\n\n【70】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Legionnaires’ Disease Go Away on Its Own?**\n\n【71】Legionnaires’ disease usually causes fever, muscle ache, and headache, and the symptoms will go on its own within 3 to 5 days without any treatment. Less than 5% of the people who contract the bacteria will get the disease. But if severe infection is left untreated, it can be fatal. Proper treatment with antibiotics can cure Legionnaires’ disease, but some people will continue to have symptoms even after the treatment.\n\n【72】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Recovery Time for Legionnaires’ Disease?**\n\n【73】This disease is treated with antibiotics, and most patients respond in about 3 to 5 days. Once you feel better, you can continue antibiotics at home. Treatment with antibiotics will last for about 1 to 3 weeks. Therefore, most people may recover fully, but it may take a few weeks to get back to normal for some. The persistence of the symptoms may be due to severe pneumonia.\n\n【74】#### **5.**删除换行**What Will Happen if Legionnaires’ Disease Is Left Untreated?**\n\n【75】Legionnaires’ disease, if left untreated, can lead to severe life-threatening complications like respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and kidney failure. It is a milder form of flu; when left untreated, can be fatal. Antibiotic treatment can cure the disease, but people may have symptoms even after the treatment.\n\n【76】#### **6.**删除换行**How Can We Prevent Legionnaires’ Disease at Home?**\n\n【77】The best way to prevent Legionnaires’ disease is by maintaining a proper water supply at home to prevent Legionella bacteria's growth and multiplication; that means the water supply should be periodically checked, cleaned, and disinfected.\n\n【78】#### **7.**删除换行**How Can You Get Legionnaires’ Disease From Drinking Water?**\n\n【79】Potable water is the primary source of Legionella. People may inhale or aspirate water droplets accidentally into the lungs that contain bacteria while drinking contaminated water.\n\n【80】#### **8.**删除换行**What Test Can Be Done for Legionnaires’ Disease?**\n\n【81】Legionnaires’ disease can be tested by laboratory test like:  \nUrinary antigen test can be done to detect the molecules of Legionella in the urine.  \n\\- Chest x-ray shows a similar pattern to pneumonia.  \n\\- Phlegm or mucus test.  \n\\- Blood test.\n\n【82】#### **9.**删除换行**Will You Get Legionnaires’ From Your Shower?**\n\n【83】The Legionnaire's bacteria is usually dispersed in the water, so the shower's spray can easily allow the bacteria to be inhaled. And people using contaminated showers have a high risk of contracting the bacteria by aspirating into the lungs.\n\n【84】#### **10.**删除换行**How to Prevent Legionnaires’ Disease From Air Conditioners?**\n\n【85】You can acquire Legionnaires’ disease from the contaminated water droplets in the air conditioner. This can be prevented by:  \n\\- Having a proper duct design that prevents stagnation of water.  \n\\- Proper drain lines that prevent Legionella from being drawn back into the system.  \n\\- Having leak-free coils that prevent the bacteria from being sprayed into the duct.\n\n【86】#### **11.**删除换行**Will You Get Legionnaires’ Disease From a Hot Tub?**\n\n【87】You can get Legionnaires’ disease from the hot tub that is not appropriately maintained. Water pools and hot tubs can create a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow. Therefore, we should adequately maintain it.\n\n【88】#### **12.**删除换行**How Long Does Legionnaires’ Disease Take to Develop?**\n\n【89】Legionnaires’ disease can take about 2 to 10 days to develop symptoms after exposure to the bacteria. Associated symptoms include vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\n【90】#### **13.**删除换行**Is That a Virus or a Bacteria That Causes Legionnaires’?**\n\n【91】Legionella is the bacteria that causes the disease Legionnaires’.\n\n【92】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【93】无关删除-1:<u>*   Legionnaires' disease: guidance, data and analysis  \n    https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/legionnaires-disease-guidance-data-and-analysis\n*   What is Legionnaires’ disease?  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/index.html\n*   Legionnaires’ Disease: Update on Diagnosis and Treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9124264/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

But with the rapid pace in sophistication and recent technology, since it was first introduced, indications now exist for several head and neck pathologies, including serious cancers.\n\n【2】Rhinosinusitis is a major inflammatory process or a pathologic sinus condition that impacts the paranasal sinuses. It may be grouped or categorized mainly based upon the duration or time span of these inflammatory processes:\n\n【3】*   Acute Cases of Rhinosinusitis: Exist for less than four weeks.\n\n【4】*   Subacute Rhinosinusitis: Exists between 4 to 12 weeks.\n\n【5】*   Chronic Rhinosinusitis: Exists for longer than 12 weeks.\n\n【6】Endoscopic sinus surgery is considered a safe stepwise technique that addresses all the paranasal facial sinus pathologies and provides a good result in the long term. Initially, it was used only for treating chronic rhinosinusitis. With the recent advent and popularization of balloon sinuplasty as a less invasive and minimal dilatation surgery for sinus drainage in chronic rhinosinusitis, endoscopic sinus surgery is no longer the only option for surgeons to address chronic and extensive cases of rhinosinusitis. However, endoscopic sinus surgery is considered a wide and safe guide path, not just for the sinus pathologies but also when the lesions or pathology persists past the boundaries of the structure beyond the facial sinuses.\n\n【7】What Are the Goals of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The concept of functional endoscopic sinus surgery, as it is called in the medical or surgical literature, stems from the origin of Messerklinger's studies. This research focuses on mucociliary clearance and the lack of it as the leading factor in the pathogenesis of sinusitis. The goal of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is to enlarge the sinus Ostia as well as restore the healthy aeration of the paranasal sinuses of the face and skull. The goal of the surgery would be to improve mucociliary transport and provide better aid for accessory topical therapies to promote faster healing in patients with both moderate and extended sinus pathologies.\n\n【9】What Are the Indications of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The main indications of ESS or Endoscopic sinus surgery are in the below-enlisted conditions majorly:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Scope of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>I get cold frequently with fever and heavy head. Why?</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Will I get benefit from sinus surgery?</u>\n\n【16】*   Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS).\n\n【17】*   Cancers of the pituitary gland (pituitary gland tumors).\n\n【18】*   Defects of the skull base.\n\n【19】*   Sinonasal tumors or cancers.\n\n【20】*   Complicated or extensive cases of the acute form of rhinosinusitis.\n\n【21】*   Mucoceles of known or unknown etiology.\n\n【22】*   Invasive or non-invasive forms of fungal sinusitis.\n\n【23】*   Silent sinus syndrome.\n\n【24】*   In individuals with cerebrospinal fluid leaks.\n\n【25】*   Benign or non-cancerous sinonasal tumors.\n\n【26】*   Ventral lesions of the skull base.\n\n【27】*   Lesions extending or of the petrous apex.\n\n【28】*   Lesions of the pterygomaxillary fossa.\n\n【29】Endoscopic sinus surgery is also a very standardized and recommended procedure by most maxillofacial surgeons and otolaryngologists for extensive or long-spread severe cases of malignancies within the nasal and paranasal spaces or tumors that extend through the anterior skull base that would be life-threatening and possess the potential for distant metastasis.\n\n【30】What Is the Principle of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Functional endoscopic sinus surgery depends on the principle or technicality of endoscopic removal of the sinus pathology, lesion, or disease from the key areas, mainly in the anterior ethmoid and middle meatus region. In addition, this procedure can also offer the scope or possibility of performing sphenoethmoidectomy along with the preservation of the middle turbinate area.\n\n【32】Extracranial or intracranial complications are also common in patients who suffer from an acute attack of rhinosinusitis. In accordance with traditional research by Chandler's classification, as per the order of increasing severity or the potential sequelae of extracranial or intracranial complications, several extended pathologies would also be indicated for functional endoscopic sinus surgery. These are cellulitis, cellulitis of the orbits, subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis.\n\n【33】Especially in cases of orbital cellulitis, functional endoscopic sinus surgery is mainly considered because the patient complains of visual impairment due to increased intraocular pressure. Also, functional endoscopic sinus surgery is suitable for any localized and irreversible disease that occurs in the maxillary sinus. The disease may therefore be removed endoscopically with very minimal trauma. Maxillofacial surgeons and otolaryngologists hence find this technique useful in terms of excellent visualization of the sinus pathology and also due to the minimal morbidity. The application of this procedure hence is beneficial highly for even managing sinus tumors and extended pathologies beyond the sinuses originating from them. However, the most common indication for functional endoscopic sinus surgery always remains chronic rhinosinusitis, for which it is a deemed gold standard technique for surgeons.\n\n【34】What Are the Contraindications of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The contraindications for functional endoscopic sinus surgery are :\n\n【36】*   Patients who are in general contraindicated for either general or local anesthetic procedures prior to surgery.\n\n【37】*   Lesions or oral pathologies that extend exclusively into the palate without any involvement of the paranasal sinuses.\n\n【38】*   Lesions or tumors only of the skin or the soft tissues.\n\n【39】*   Lesions or tumors exclusively penetrating laterally into or above the orbit region.\n\n【40】*   In lateral recess lesions of the frontal sinus.\n\n【41】*   In tumors or lesions that have an extended or advanced intracranial spread (in these severe cases that significantly extend into the cranium or the cranial base, surgeons may recommend a combined surgical approach of both endoscopic and open method approaches).\n\n【42】What Are the Post-Operative Protocols for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Postoperative care, as recommended by the surgeon, forms an essential protocol for the efficacy of this applied technique to decrease the rate of repeated risk of recurrence in chronic rhinosinusitis patients. In addition, your healthcare provider may also further recommend accessory medical therapy like nasal rinsing, application or intake of topical or oral corticosteroids, and post-operatively prescribed antibiotics in order to reduce the recurrence risk and inflammation.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】To conclude, endoscopic sinus surgery is a fundamental and gold standard treatment strategy adopted by most surgeons to target sinus pathology and also is the gold standard for treating chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) despite the advent of procedures like balloon sinuplasty for complete elimination or to eliminate the recurrence risk of the lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The biliary system is the group of organs and tracts that produce and help transport bile. Cholangioscopy is used to detect blockages in the biliary, liver, and pancreatic ducts, which are difficult to remove.\n\n【2】These blockages are generally due to pancreatic duct stones, gallstones, and bile stones. The cholangioscopy technique can also be used to trace cancers in the ducts and to collect tissue samples for investigations like biopsy. There are different types of cholangioscopy, such as dual-operator mother-daughter per-oral cholangioscopy, single-operator per-oral cholangioscopy, and percutaneous and surgical cholangioscopy.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Cholangioscopy?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   **Dual Operator Mother-Daughter Per-Oral Cholangioscopy:** Reusable mother-daughter cholangiocytes contain a control dial for two-way tip deflection and consist of air or water buttons and suction channels. The insertion tube in a cholangioscope consists of an instrument channel, a coherent bundle of glass fibers that helps to transmit the image from the objective lens tip, which is present in the endoscope, to the eyepiece.\n\n【5】*   **Single-Operator Per-Oral Cholangioscopy:** It is a cholangioscopy system with some limitations compared to dual-operator mother-daughter per oral cholangioscopy. The single-operator cholangioscopy is an advanced guidewire into the bile duct through the working channel of the therapeutic duodenoscope.\n\n【6】*   **Ultraslim Endoscopes:** These endoscopes are directly inserted into the bile or pancreatic duct at the time of a standard upper endoscopy.\n\n【7】*   **Surgical and Percutaneous Cholangioscopy:** These fiber optic cholangioscopes have a larger diameter which allows a larger number of optical fibers, which leads to better illumination, field of vision, and good image resolution. These optic fibers are inserted into the biliary tree by a mature percutaneous route or during surgery. The images are then converted from fiber optic to a video format by a separate eyepiece.\n\n【8】Who All Need Cholangioscopy?\n----------------------------\n\n【9】Cholangioscopy is generally recommended for people who have a blockage in their duct or strictures (narrowed duct). However, some cases may need cholangioscopy. They are:\n\n【10】*   **Bile Duct Infections or Blockages:** Infection or blockage in the bile duct is known as cholangitis. The cause of cholangitis is inflammation of the bile duct, generally due to bacterial infection.\n\n【11】*   **Pancreatic Duct Stones or Biliary Duct Stones:** To evaluate the ducts blocked by the stones, endoscopes can be used, and in some cases, sound waves are also used to break a bile stone into simpler pieces. This procedure is known as lithotripsy.\n\n【12】*   **Duct Strictures:** Cholangioscopy tools can widen the narrow bile duct to allow proper flow of bile or insert a stent. A stent is a hollow tube inserted into the duct to hold the duct open. Duct strictures also include primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\n【13】*   **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation caused in the pancreas leads to pancreatitis, which may need cholangioscopy to trace the inflammation.\n\n【14】*   **Cholangiocarcinoma:** Cancer in the bile duct is known as cholangiocarcinoma. In such cases, cholangioscopy helps to investigate the details of the malignant lesion and helps to collect better samples for biopsy tests of the lesion.\n\n【15】How to Prepare for Cholangioscopy?\n----------------------------------\n\n【16】*   It is important to inform doctors about all the patient's medications and supplements.\n\n【17】*   If the patient is suffering from an allergy, they should be informed by the doctor before starting the procedure of cholangioscopy.\n\n【18】*   The patient is asked to stop eating at least 8 to 12 hours before the cholangioscopy.\n\n【19】*   Doctors may prescribe antibiotics before the procedure of cholangioscopy.\n\n【20】*   The patient should not come alone for the procedure of cholangioscopy as the technique requires sedation, which may make it difficult for the patient to go back home alone.\n\n【21】How Is the Procedure of Cholangioscopy Performed?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】*   The first step in the process of cholangioscopy is the administration of anesthesia by the anesthesiologist. This makes the patient drowsy and comfortable for the procedure.\n\n【23】*   Numbing agents are applied to the throat, so the patient does not get gag or experience choking during the procedure.\n\n【24】*   A mouthpiece is placed between the teeth to protect the mouth, and the endoscope does not interfere with breathing.\n\n【25】*   The doctor then guides the endoscope through the mouth and stomach into the biliary system.\n\n【26】*   The endoscope inside will be used to evaluate the biliary, liver, and pancreatic ducts for spotting the blockage or any other issue like inflammation or cancer.\n\n【27】*   At last, with the help of suitable instruments, the doctor either breaks down the bile stones if present or collects tissue for biopsy investigation to check for malignancy.\n\n【28】What Happens After Cholangioscopy?\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】After the test, the patient is kept in the recovery room until the effects of sedatives end, and then the doctor discusses the results of the cholangioscopy. The patient is given further instructions depending on the procedures performed during the cholangioscopy.\n\n【30】What Are the Side Effects of Cholangioscopy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   Sore throat due to insertion of the endoscope. Lozenges can cure this.\n\n【32】*   Side effects due to sedatives include vomiting, drowsiness, and an upset stomach.\n\n【33】*   The doctors blow little air during the procedure for the proper vision of the organs, which may lead to intestinal gas and bloating in the stomach.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Cholangioscopy is a diagnostic and treatment procedure that helps to investigate the biliary and pancreatic duct, gallbladder, and liver. The procedure collects tissue samples in cases of infections, inflammation, and malignancy in the bile duct, pancreatic duct, gallbladder, and liver. Cholangioscopy is also used to widen the narrow ducts or strictures and break down gallstones in the biliary and pancreatic ducts. The cholangioscopy procedure is very effective in treating and diagnosing the conditions of organs that help to produce and transfer bile. There are minimal side effects of the procedure; it is easy and performed in a less invasive technique.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   Peroral Cholangioscopy  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/peroral-cholangioscopy\n*   Applications, Limitations, and Expansion of Cholangioscopy in Clinical Practice  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132717/\n*   Cholangiopancreatoscopy  \n    https://www.asge.org/docs/default-source/education/Technology\\_Reviews/cholangiopancreatoscopy.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In recent years, one product has gained popularity, which is the eyelash serum. The eyelashes serum enhances the thickness and length of the eyelashes. The eyelashes serum promotes the lashes' growth and prevents their breakage. Lashes are an essential part of the makeup routine. Big and thicker eyelashes will act as a mini-eye lift and make the person more beautiful and attractive.\n\n【2】Various factors, such as aging, genetics, and menopause. These factors can lead to hormonal changes that cause hair follicles, eyelashes, and eyebrows thinning. Vigorous scrubbing while removing makeup can result in loss of eyelashes with time. Growth-stimulating and hydrating ingredients such as vitamins and peptides can boost the eyelashes length, volume, and overall appearance of lashes over time. The main ingredient in the eyelashes serum is prostaglandin which extends the growth cycle pattern. This is the phase during which the lash is growing. The article discusses eyelash serum, its work procedure, ways to apply it, different types of eye serum, benefits, and side effects.\n\n【3】What Precisely Does Eyelash Serum Entail?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【4】An eyelash serum is a cosmetic product that enhances eyelash thickness and promotes growth. The serums consist of vitamins, plant extract, and peptides that nourish and strengthen the eyelashes' hair follicles. The serum can be applied with a small brush on the base of the eyelashes once or twice a day. The effectiveness varies between individuals. To avoid any side effects, it is essential to follow instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\n【5】What Are the Different Types of Eyelashes Serum?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Various serums are available in the market with different ingredients and application methods. The common types of eyelashes serums are as follows:\n\n【7】*   **Prostaglandin Analogue-Based Serum:** The main ingredient in this type of serum is prostaglandin which increases the growth phase of the eyelashes hair cycle process. It results in thicker and longer eyelashes.\n\n【8】*   **Peptide-Based Serum:** The serum consists of peptides that stimulate the hair follicles in the eyelids. It promotes the growth of eyelashes.\n\n【9】*   **Essential Oil-Based Serum:** The serum incorporates a blend of organic essential oils, including coconut oil, castor oil, and almond oil, to provide lashes with nourishing nutrients and vitamins, stimulating their growth.\n\n【10】*   **Plant-Based Serum:** The serum consists of plant extracts and ingredients such as green tea, aloe vera, and chamomile that help strengthen the lashes.\n\n【11】*   **Hyaluronic Acid-Based Serum:** This serum contains hyaluronic acid that nourishes and moisturizes the lashes.

People can do this process at home. The steps of the application of the serum are as follows:\n\n【15】*   **Clean the Face:** The first step is to clean the eyelashes and free them from any makeup or debris. An individual can use a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt.\n\n【16】*   **Apply Serum:** An individual can apply eye serum with a brush. The serum application is to be started with an upper lash line. Be careful while using serum. The serum should not go into the eyes. The process is repeated in the lower lash line. The excess serum can be removed with an applicator brush by wiping the tissue.\n\n【17】*   **Let the Serum Dry:** Once you have applied the serum, it is important to let it dry before applying any other facial products or before going to sleep.\n\n【18】*   **Apply serum Regularly:** It is essential to use the serum regularly as the manufacturer directs.\n\n【19】How Does Eyelash Serums Work?\n-----------------------------\n\n【20】Hairs are made up of protein. Around 80 % of proteins are present in the hairs. Eyelash serum nourishes and stimulates the growth of hair follicles in the eyelash area. The serum consists of vitamins, peptides, and other ingredients that support the development of hair follicles. When the eyelashes serum is applied, it penetrates the hair follicles, increases blood flow, and provides nutrients to that area. It helps in strengthening and lengthening the eyelashes over time.\n\n【21】The eyelashes serum contains prostaglandin analogs. It is a group of fatty acid compounds that increase the phase of hair growth. Some over-the-counter serums contain biotin. Vitamin B helps eyelashes grow longer and thicker. Not all eyelash serums are created equal. Most serums work by nourishing and hydrating the eyelashes, which increases the length and thickness of the eyelashes. It will usually take eight weeks for eyelashes to appear thicker, longer, and darker.\n\n【22】What Are the Benefits of Eyelash Serum?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】The benefits of eyelash serums are as follows:\n\n【24】*   **Longer Lashes:** The serum increases the lashes' growth and makes them thicker over time.

{"seq_id": "6ebc9311-42c2-42ed-86b7-3eeef5f021f6", "title": "Inner Ear Infection - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Inner Ear Infection - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Inner ear infections have become very common among the general population. Our inner ear is prone to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, which seek immediate attention. Normally, our inner ear has hair cells (present in the cochlea), which bend on receiving sound waves from the middle ear. This will generate electrical impulses that are transferred by the acoustic nerve (nerve supply to the ear) to the brain, which detects these signals as a sound. Any infections to the inner ear can disrupt the hearing pathway resulting in gradual progression into sensorineural (damage to the nerve transmitting electrical signals to the brain to perceive sound) hearing loss if left untreated. In severe cases, the infection can also spread from the inner ear to the temporal bone (lateral part of the skull bone) and the brain. Inner ear infections also lead to loss of balance due to damage to the vestibular nerve (the eighth cranial nerve).\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Inner Ear Infections?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Inner ear infections are caused by:\n\n【4】*   **Bacterial Infections:** Bacteria like Streptococcus and Neisseria can result in damage to the inner ear. Labyrinthitis (swelling of the labyrinth - part of the inner ear that helps to control balance) can occur due to bacterial infections.\n\n【5】*   **Viral Infections:** Viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the rubella virus affect the inner ear and can cause damage or swelling of the vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve).\n\n【6】*   **Fungal Infections:** Fungus like Aspergillus niger and Candida can result in inner ear infections.\n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of an Inner Ear Infection?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms associated with inner ear infections are:\n\n【9】*   Hearing impairment.\n\n【10】*   Dizziness.\n\n【11】*   Vertigo (spinning sensation in the head).\n\n【12】*   Deafness.\n\n【13】*   Loss of balance.\n\n【14】*   Tinnitus (ringing sensation in the ears).\n\n【15】*   Pressure changes in the ears.\n\n【16】*   Drainage from the ears.\n\n【17】*   Fever.\n\n【18】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【19】*   Disorientation.\n\n【20】*   Pain in the ears.\n\n【21】*   Disbalance while walking.\n\n【22】*   Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).\n\n【23】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【24】*   Meningitis (swelling of the brain tissue if the infection spreads to the brain).\n\n【25】How to Diagnose Inner Ear Infections?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【26】Inner ear infections can be diagnosed by :\n\n【27】*   **History and Clinical Examination:** A detailed history of the patient for the symptoms present are recorded. The ear is examined clinically by an ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) by using an otoscope (an instrument with attached light used to check the inner part of the ears) to rule out the presence of any infections, ear discharge, and swelling in the ears.\n\n【28】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** CT scan is done to rule out the presence of any inner ear infections, swelling, or growth.\n\n【29】*   **An Otoacoustic Emission Test:** It is done using a tiny speaker to produce sounds in the ear, and the response of the cochlear hair cells to the sound is recorded.\n\n【30】*   **Auditory Brain Response (ABR) Test:** It is done to detect the response of the nervous system (brain) to the sound produced in the ear by a mini earphone. It helps to identify the swelling or damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) causing a defect in the hearing pathway.\n\n【31】*   **Vestibular Test Battery:** It is done to assess the functions of the labyrinth (part of the inner ear) and vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) to rule out loss of balance due to infection.\n\n【32】*   **Electrocochleography (ECOG):** It is done to assess the inner ear functions in response to the sound. It can detect abnormal fluid pressure build-up in the ear.\n\n【33】What Is the Treatment for Inner Ear Infections?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Inner ear infections can be managed by:\n\n【35】**1\\. Medicinal Therapy:**\n\n【36】*   **Antibiotics and Anti-Inflammatory Drugs:** These drugs are started for the patient to reduce or stop the infections. Oral, intravenous (through a vein), and intramuscular (through muscles) routes for drug take time to reach the target site (ear) and can cause systemic adverse effects on the other organs of the body, so local drug delivery by intratympanic (within the tympanic membrane of the ear) injections is preferred to avoid these complications. Intratympanic drug administration increases the efficacy of the drug in the target area. Delivery of drugs directly into the inner ear by passing the needle through the oval window and depositing it in the inner ear is another technique that is followed, but it is quite invasive (risky).\n\n【37】*   **Antifungal Drugs:** Antifungal drugs like Gentamicin injections are given through the tympanic membrane to reduce the frequency and intensity of vertigo by destroying the vestibular (sensory receptors in the inner ear) hair cells.\n\n【38】**2\\. Nanoparticles-Mediated Treatment:** It is one of the current trending techniques to treat inner ear infections. Nanoparticles of small size (less than 1 micrometer) are used as targeted drug therapy to treat inner ear infections. These methods allow the drug to act effectively and specifically in the target areas by slow diffusion of the drug through the oval window in the inner ear. Nanoparticles like titanium dioxide (acts against fungal infections), zinc oxide (acts against bacterial infections), and copper oxide (acts against viral infections) are used to treat inner ear infections effectively. Chitosan (linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed β- (1→4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit)) is another polymeric nanoparticle that has been tested to treat inner ear disease effectively. Research for various nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems is still ongoing.\n\n【39】**3\\. Cochlear Implants:** Hearing loss induced by inner ear infections is managed by the use of cochlear implants (a small electronic device that stimulates the nerve for hearing) that helps in hearing sounds.\n\n【40】What Research Is Ongoing for the Treatment of Inner Ear Infections?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Further studies are ongoing for the development of biocompatible (ear-friendly) and multifunctional nanoparticles that can release or deliver the drug in a controlled manner without causing harm or toxicity to the ears due to uncontrolled drug delivery (drug overdose).\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Inner ear infections most likely occur from bacterial or viral infections and are rarely caused by fungus. Inner ear infections can cause hearing loss and loss of balance and can also spread to the brain if left untreated. Any signs and symptoms of ear infections noticed should be reported to the doctor for early diagnosis and management of the infection. Early management of ear infections can prevent permanent hearing loss and further complications associated with the infection.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**Is an Inner Ear Infection Painful?**\n\n【47】Yes, an inner ear infection can be painful. Inner ear infections, also known as otitis media, occur when the part of the middle ear becomes infected or inflamed. Other conditions, such as external ear infections (otitis externa) or dental problems, can also cause ear pain.\n\n【48】#### **2.**删除换行**Do Inner Ear Infections Cause Dizziness?**\n\n【49】Yes, inner ear infections can cause dizziness. The inner ear plays an important role in the spatial orientation and maintaining balance. When an infection affects the inner ear, it can disrupt the normal functioning of the balance organs, leading to dizziness and a sensation of spinning or unsteadiness. This dizziness is known as vertigo.\n\n【50】#### **3.**删除换行**How Does Prednisone Treat an Inner Ear Infection?**\n\n【51】Prednisone is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It is commonly used to treat various inflammatory conditions, including inner ear infections. Prednisone reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system's response. The dosage and duration depend on the severity of the symptoms.\n\n【52】#### **4.**删除换行**Can an Individual Wear a Headset Over the Ear While Having an Inner Ear Infection?**\n\n【53】Generally, it is not recommended to wear a headset over the ear while having an inner ear infection, especially if a person is experiencing symptoms such as ear pain, drainage, or dizziness. Wearing a headset over the ear can potentially aggravate the inner ear, increasing discomfort and worsening the symptoms. The pressure caused by the headset can also cause further inflammation or fluid buildup in the middle ear, prolonging the healing process.\n\n【54】#### **5.**删除换行**How Is an Inner Ear Infection Diagnosed?**\n\n【55】An inner ear infection, also known as otitis media, is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and possibly additional tests. The additional tests include tests like, imaging tests like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, audiometry, and tympanometry tests.\n\n【56】#### **6.**删除换行**How Does an Inner Ear Infection Look Like?**\n\n【57】A healthy eardrum looks pinkish-grey while an infected middle ear or inner ear with otitis media looks bulging red, sometimes clear, yellow, or even greenish-hued drainage is present. An otoscope helps the provider to look at the surface of the eardrum.\n\n【58】#### **7.**删除换行**What Helps in Reducing Inner Ear Pressure From a Sinus Infection?**\n\n【59】Several methods help in reducing the inner ear pressure that includes, the counter decongestants, warm compress, staying hydrated, steam inhalation, nasal irrigation, and rest by elevating the head. If still the symptoms persist consult a provider to get medical help.\n\n【60】#### **8.**删除换行**What Antibiotics Are Used for a Staph Infection of the Inner Ear?**\n\n【61】A specific choice of antibiotics may depend on factors such as the severity of the infection, the suspected or confirmed strain of Staphylococcus, and the individual's overall health. Flucloxacillin, Cephalexin, Clindamycin, and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole are some antibiotics used in staph infections of the inner ear.\n\n【62】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Difference Between an Inner Ear Infection and Vertigo?**\n\n【63】Inner ear infection is an inflammation of the inner ear while vertigo is a symptom characterized by a spinning or dizzy sensation. Inner ear infections typically cause vertigo as a symptom rather than being the same as vertigo. Vertigo can be caused by various conditions such as inner ear problems, migraines, head injuries, and certain medications.\n\n【64】#### **10.**删除换行**How Are Eyes Affected by an Inner Ear Infection?**\n\n【65】Inner ear infections can affect the eyes causing infections like nystagmus, blurred vision, and eye pain. As the inner ear is responsible for balance, they can affect the eye as they are closely connected to the optic nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmission of visual information to the brain.\n\n【66】#### **11.**删除换行**How Longer Does an Inner Ear Infection Stay?**\n\n【67】The duration of an inner ear infection, also known as otitis media, can vary depending on various factors, including the specific cause of the infection, the individual's overall health, and the effectiveness of treatment. Most ear infections clear within three days, some times, they can last up to a week.\n\n【68】#### **12.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment for an Inner Ear Infection?**\n\n【69】Treatment can vary depending on severity, and individual factors. Some common treatments are pain-relieving drugs like NSAIDs, antibiotics, eardrops that contain antifungal, antibiotic, or steroid composition, and decongestants oral or nasal. Applying a warm compress and supportive care can also help in treating the infection.\n\n【70】#### **13.**删除换行**How Long It Takes for an Inner Ear Infection to Cure?**\n\n【71】Inner infections can get severe if they affect the eyes or lead to symptoms like dizziness, vertigo, and balance issues. Most inner ear infections get cured within two weeks of time with proper treatment and management.\n\n【72】#### **14.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment for Inner Ear Infection Vertigo?**\n\n【73】The vertigo symptoms caused by the inner ear are treated by some medications like antihistamines, antiemetics, benzodiazepines, a technique called Epley maneuver, vestibular rehabilitation therapy, symptom management by over-the-counter drugs, and treating the underlying ear infection.\n\n【74】#### **15.**删除换行**How Do Essential Oils Help in Treating Inner Ear Infections?**\n\n【75】Essential oils are natural plant extracts that contain concentrated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, emergency physicians should have the critical skill to order relevant tests, interpret the results, and conclude a diagnosis. They also assess the severity and the type of disease with factors like sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and predictive values to establish a diagnosis and provide an appropriate treatment plan. Unfortunately, there can be misleading results unless there is good correlative clinical judgment and accurate interpretation of test results.\n\n【2】What Is the ABCDE Approach?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Initially, the patient is assessed by skin color, sweating, and environment, followed by a systemic assessment. In a critically ill or serious patient, this ABCDE approach is the predominant approach in almost any emergency department. ABCDE stands for airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. It will help assess the patients in the preclinical scene until they arrive at the emergency department. If there is any problem with these, medical care is provided uninterruptedly until stabilization. Following is a table depicting the assessment criteria of the above-mentioned approaches:\n\n【4】What Are the Diagnostic Tests Available?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】In the fast-moving world, patients want to get traditional laboratory results quickly. As a result, newer innovations like 12-lead electrocardiograms, finger-stick blood glucose measurement, and bedside ultrasound have been introduced in the emergency care setup to reduce time delays and inconvenience.\n\n【6】1.  **Blood Gas Analysis:** It is an important assessment done in critically ill patients and helps provide information about the illness's causes and severity. It is used in assessing oxygen levels, carbon dioxide levels, partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, bicarbonate levels, and pH levels of the blood.\n\n【7】2.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** ECG is very important in the emergency department, during the initial assessment of patients, and throughout their time in the hospital. It can help differentiate between arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and accurate diagnosis of coronary heart conditions. It also monitors the patients to identify any fluctuations throughout their hospital stay.\n\n【8】3.  **Sonography:** Advanced diagnostics have been made possible through portable ultrasound devices. It helps diagnose certain medical conditions by evaluating the tissues' shape, size, and density. However, additional diagnostic information is obtained through other methods. It is very useful in immediately evaluating the patient's abnormality in the emergency department setup.\n\n【9】4.  **Pulmonary Ultrasound:** Pulmonary ultrasound has high accuracy in diagnosing certain conditions like pneumothorax (lung collapse), pleural effusion (fluid build-up around the lungs), and pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs).\n\n【10】5.  **Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE):** It is safe and crucial in emergency medicine. It helps in the assessment of infective endocarditis and in investigating patients who are ventilated.\n\n【11】6.  **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs):** Rapid diagnostic tests are introduced in the emergency department to expedite laboratory results and for swift diagnosis of infectious conditions and prevention of the infection further. Rapid urine antigen tests are implemented to diagnose respiratory infections from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Malaria RDTs are critical to individuals traveling to and from malaria-endemic countries.\n\n【12】7.  **Thromboelastometry:** It is a diagnostic procedure done to evaluate hemostasis. It is useful in patients with bleeding disorders. It helps in detecting abnormalities in clotting and lyses.\n\n【13】8.  **Laboratory Testing:** A remarkable tool in the emergency department is analyzing laboratory test results. A thorough analysis after proper sampling, sample transport, and accurate estimation of all the important elements helps exclude or include any illness. Some important markers are red blood cells, white blood cells, hematocrit, uric acid, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and troponin T.\n\n【14】9.  **Urinalysis and Appearance:** Gross and microscopic appearances of urine and its sediment, along with the determination of urinary pH, specific gravity, protein content, and glucose content, are the most readily available, inexpensive, and informative laboratory tests that help conclude a diagnosis. The gross appearance of urine will help indicate the presence of bleeding or infection in the genitourinary tract. Microscopic examination of urinary sediment will reveal bacteria, and various cell forms, that will help diagnose patients with renal disease.\n\n【15】10.  **Biomarkers of Renal Function:** Serum creatinine is widely used as a marker of GFR (glomerular filtration rate) and renal function. Novel biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18, uromodulin, and microRNA are promising in the early detection of kidney injury. They can have a future role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with kidney injury in the perioperative setting.\n\n【16】11.  **Imaging:** Imaging through X-ray, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and CT (computed tomography) helps in subsequent interpretation in the emergency department. These tests help accurately diagnose the condition and the dimensions of any lesion causing an illness.\n\n【17】What Are Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy in Laboratory Tests?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   **Sensitivity:** Sensitivity refers to the true positive rate in which there is a high probability of the result being positive in patients with a specific disease or condition. High-sensitive tests usually have a lesser number of false-negative outcomes. For example, if the test is 95 percent positive, then 95 percent of the patients with that specific disorder will be positive, and five percent will have a false-negative result. Highly sensitive tests are used in life-threatening and dangerous conditions.\n\n【19】*   **Specificity:** Specificity refers to the true-negative rate in which there is a probability that the result will be negative in patients who do not have that condition or disease. High-specific tests usually have a lesser number of false-positive outcomes. For example, if the test is 95 percent positive, then 95 percent of the patients without that specific disorder will have a true-negative result, and five percent will have a false-positive result. These tests are used in certain situations where a false-positive test can be harmful, like when a therapy is potentially dangerous, such as long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【20】*   **Accuracy:** Accuracy refers to the overall test performance in patients who have the disease and who do not have it. It is calculated by arbitrating the true-negative and true-positive results and dividing them by the number of tests done in total. Highly sensitive tests usually exclude a particular disease, while highly specific tests usually include a particular disease.\n\n【21】**Conclusion**\n\n【22】Diagnostic tools have helped physicians improve the precision and speed of diagnosing a patient's condition. In addition, the latest innovations in diagnostic tools have helped faster and better treatment approaches. Appropriate diagnostic tools and tests will help the doctors provide a correct diagnosis, which will help them better serve the patients.\n\n【23】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>*   Rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the emergency department  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32120036/\n*   Diagnostic Testing In Emergency Medicine  \n    https://iem-student.org/diagnostic-testing-in-emergency-medicine/\n*   Modern diagnostics in emergency medicine - PMC  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204114/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is also called the \"master gland,\" as it controls the functions of different body parts by secreting many hormones. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland work together to release various hormones that act in other body parts.\n\n【2】What Is Pituitary Adenoma?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Pituitary adenoma refers to noncancerous (harmless) growth in the front part of the pituitary gland. It does not spread to different body parts but can increase in size and put pressure on the surrounding structures. The nerves that supply the eyes, close to the gland, present symptoms due to pituitary adenomas, known as the \"mass effect.\" Large adenomas can destroy the pituitary cells, leading to a decrease in the hormones produced by the pituitary. As a result, the patient may experience symptoms like fatigue, low blood pressure, and loss of interest in sexual activity. Pituitary adenomas are the most common tumors of the brain, and they do not cause any problems until they present symptoms.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Pituitary Adenomas?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Pituitary adenomas are classified based on size, aggressiveness, and secretion of hormones.\n\n【6】**Based on Size:**\n\n【7】Pituitary adenomas are classified into two types based on their size.\n\n【8】*   Microadenomas that are less than 1 cm in size.\n*   Macroadenomas that are more than 1 cm in size.\n\n【9】**Based on Aggressiveness:**\n\n【10】The nature and aggressiveness of the growth of adenomas classify them as the following:\n\n【11】*   The benign (harmless) type is most common and shows slow growth.\n*   Atypical pituitary adenomas that grow very rapidly but are rare.\n*   Pituitary carcinomas (malignant type) that spread to other body parts. Carcinomas of the pituitary are extremely rare.\n\n【12】**Based on the Hormone Secretion:**\n\n【13】The secretion of hormones by the tumors classifies adenomas into two types:\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>My headache persists even after pituitary tumor surgery.

Please help.</u>\n\n【19】*   Pituitary adenomas that secrete excessive amounts of hormones are called functional adenomas. The primary hormones that are secreted include:\n\n【20】    *   Prolactin causes prolactinoma.\n\n【21】    *   Growth hormone that causes acromegaly in adults and gigantism in children.\n\n【22】    *   Cortisol causes Cushing's disease.\n\n【23】*   Pituitary adenomas that do not secrete any active hormones are called clinically non-functional adenomas.\n\n【24】What Are the Causes of Pituitary Adenomas?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The exact cause of pituitary adenomas is unknown. However, a mutation (change) in the cell’s genetic material (DNA) can trigger an adenoma leading to an excessive division of the cells. In addition, parents may pass down the mutated gene to the children leading to inherited pituitary adenomas.\n\n【26】What Are the Symptoms of Pituitary Adenomas?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The symptoms of pituitary adenomas depend upon several factors like the hormones that are released, mass effects on the surrounding structures, and deficiency of the pituitary hormones.\n\n【28】Symptoms Due to Excessive Hormonal Secretion Are:\n\n【29】1.  **Growth Hormone-Secreting Adenomas:** Excess growth hormone secretion causes acromegaly (adults) and gigantism (children). Hands and feet show enlargement, and body size increases significantly.\n\n【30】2.  **Prolactinoma:** Excess production of the hormone prolactin causes prolactinoma that presents as breast milk production, irregular menstrual cycle in females, and loss of libido in males.\n\n【31】3.  **ACTH Secreting Pituitary Adenomas:** That causes Cushing's disease. The symptoms include easy bruises, sudden weight gain, and muscle weakness.\n\n【32】4.  **TSH Secreting Pituitary Adenomas:** These are very rare and lead to hyperthyroidism. The symptoms present unexpected weight loss, fatigue, nervousness, and rapid heartbeat.\n\n【33】The general symptoms noted include:\n\n【34】*   Problems in vision.\n\n【35】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【36】*   Nasal drainage.\n\n【37】*   Headaches.\n\n【38】*   Loss of sexual desire.\n\n【39】*   Difficulty in conceiving.\n\n【40】*   Irregular menstrual cycle.\n\n【41】*   Early menopause.\n\n【42】*   Tiredness.\n\n【43】*   Sudden weight loss or gain.\n\n【44】*   Muscle and joint aches.\n\n【45】*   Behavioral changes.\n\n【46】Pituitary apoplexy is when the adenomas stop receiving blood supply due to an excessive increase in size that can lead to the death of tissues of the pituitary and present as severe symptoms like severe headache and sudden loss of vision. The symptoms arising due to a decrease in the hormonal levels can show up in a few days to weeks.\n\n【47】How Are Pituitary Adenomas Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【48】The doctor diagnoses the condition based on the medical history and the signs and symptoms shown by the patient. Then, blood tests and scans are done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【49】1.  **Blood Tests:** Blood tests help to detect and confirm pituitary adenomas by assessing the hormonal levels in the body. An increase in the hormone levels indicates functional adenomas, and a decrease indicates pituitary insufficiency. Therefore, comprehensive hormone testing is essential to determine excess or deficit of particular hormones like prolactin.\n\n【50】2.  **Imaging Tests:** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans help detect adenomas greater than 4 mm in size. The 3T tesla MRI scanner is used to detect tumors smaller than 4 mm. In addition, computed tomography (CT) is combined with MRI scans to get a better picture of the condition.\n\n【51】3.  **Visual Field Test:** The doctor suggests this test when the patient complains of vision problems that occur due to pressure on the nerves supplying the eyes.\n\n【52】How Are Pituitary Adenomas Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【53】The treatment options for pituitary adenomas include surgery, medications, radiation therapy, or all three.\n\n【54】1.  **Surgery:** Endoscopic surgery is performed using a camera and small tools that reach the pituitary through the nose and sinuses. The approach is referred to as the transsphenoidal technique. It is a minimally invasive technique. Alternatively, extensive surgery is indicated in cases where endoscopic surgery is not possible.\n\n【55】2.  **Medications:** Medicines are used to treat certain tumor types that shrink the tumor and relieve the symptoms.\n\n【56】3.  **Radiation Therapy:** High-energy X-rays that target the tumor cells and lead to a shrink in size of the tumors is used as radiation therapy. A particular type called stereotactic radiosurgery uses X-rays targeted on the adenomas from various directions.\n\n【57】Doctors recommend yearly check-ups to keep track of the condition after treatment. Blood tests and scans are conducted regularly, and a watch is held on the symptoms to monitor an increase in the size of adenomas.\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】The outlook of the condition depends on the type and size of adenoma. Patients can return to their everyday lives post-treatment; however, there may be chances of recurrence. Treatment of adenomas that cause a decrease in hormonal levels needs hormone supplements. Periodic monitoring helps to appropriately assess the condition and the need for further treatment.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pituitary Adenoma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554451/\n*   Signs and Symptoms of Pituitary Tumors  \n    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pituitary-tumors/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html\n*   Pituitary Adenoma  \n    https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/pituitary-disorders/conditions/pituitary-adenomas/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The occurrence of pregnancy after the hysterectomy procedure is very rare. The fertilized egg implants in other organs like fallopian tubes (they are two tubes present on either side of the uterus). It is possible but rare to conceive if the cervix is not removed. The hysterectomy is suggested as a birth control procedure. The chances of conceiving after this procedure are very less. A hysterectomy is a common procedure.\n\n【2】What Does a Hysterectomy Procedure Mean?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The hysterectomy procedure is the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix. The other organs, like fallopian tubes and ovaries, are also removed depending on the reason for a hysterectomy. The fetus grows and develops in the uterus. The uterus lining is expelled during menstrual periods. There is an incapability to get pregnant and have menstrual periods due to the absence of the uterus.\n\n【4】What Are the Different Types of Hysterectomies?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The different types of hysterectomy procedures are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Total Hysterectomy Procedure**: Total hysterectomy means the removal of the cervix and uterus, but the ovaries are not removed.\n\n【7】*   **Supracervical Hysterectomy Procedure**: Supracervical hysterectomy means removing the upper portion of the uterus, and the cervix is left in the body.\n\n【8】*   **Total Hysterectomy Procedure With Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: This procedure includes uterus removal along with the cervix, fallopian tube removal (salpingectomy), and ovary removal (oophorectomy).\n\n【9】*   **Radical Hysterectomy With Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: This procedure includes uterus removal along with the cervix, fallopian tubes removal (salpingectomy), and ovaries removal (oophorectomy). Along with this, the upper part of the vagina and some surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. This is done in case of cancers.\n\n【10】The hysterectomy procedure is performed through an incision in the abdomen called abdominal hysteroscopy. The hysterectomy procedure is performed through an incision in the vagina called a vaginal hysterectomy. The laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure is also done with the help of a laparoscope (a tiny tube inserted through the vagina and a small camera attached to visualize the internal organs) and with the help of a robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure.\n\n【11】What Is the Reason for the Hysterectomy Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The reason for the hysterectomy procedure is as follows:\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Had hysterectomy long back and spotting now.

Other treatment methods fail to control severe pain during menstrual periods.\n\n【19】*   **Uterine Fibroids**: The presence of benign (noncancerous) tumors called leiomyomas or uterine fibroids. Elevated pelvic pain is uncontrolled by other treatment methods.\n\n【20】*   **Uterine Prolapse**: There is urinary incontinence and difficulty with bowel movements due to uterine prolapse (the uterus goes down into the vaginal canal because of the weakened support of muscles).\n\n【21】*   **Cancers**: Another reason for a hysterectomy is cervical cancer. Uterine cancer is another reason.\n\n【22】*   **Uterus Hyperplasia**: The uterus lining is endometrium and becomes abnormally thick because of many calls.\n\n【23】*   **Endometrial Polyp**: The benign (noncancerous) growths attached to the inner wall of the uterus (womb).\n\n【24】*   **Adenomyosis**: In this condition, the endometrium, which lines the uterus, breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.\n\n【25】What Are the Side Effects of the Hysterectomy Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   Pain in the pelvis and abdomen. Advised painkillers to subside the pain.\n\n【27】*   There is redness, bruising, and swelling in abdominal hysterectomy cases near the incision area.\n\n【28】*   Around the abdominal incision, there has been numbness for some months.\n\n【29】*   Recommend using sanitary pads and not tampons for severe vaginal bleeding.\n\n【30】*   There is bloating and gas formation in the stomach for a few days. Exercise and warm compress help with such signs.\n\n【31】*   Constipation.\n\n【32】*   Problems with the urinary bladder.\n\n【33】*   There are no longer menstrual periods due to the absence of the uterus, which is a permanent alteration.\n\n【34】*   If the ovaries are removed, then menopause occurs. The signs include vaginal dryness, sleep difficulty, mood swings, and stoppage of periods.\n\n【35】*   There are alterations in sexual feelings.\n\n【36】*   There is a feeling of sadness.\n\n【37】*   Elevated risk of other health conditions like osteoporosis (new bone tissue does not form with old bone tissue removal, and the bones become weak and brittle) and heart disease.\n\n【38】*   Unable to carry a pregnancy for nine months as the uterus is absent, which is essential for a viable pregnancy.\n\n【39】*   Depression over the loss of fertility and changes in their body.\n\n【40】What Are the Chances of Conceiving After a Hysterectomy?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Women conceive after a hysterectomy procedure if the fallopian tubes and ovaries are intact, but it is rare. After the hysterectomy procedure, if the woman is fertile, embryo formation is likely. Due to the lack of a uterus where the embryo implants in normal cases, the embryo attaches and develops in the fallopian tubes. The pregnancy is referred to as ectopic, which is a serious medical emergency. The fallopian tubes are narrow passages and cannot accommodate the growing fetus. Therefore can lead to the rupture of the fallopian tubes and heavy blood loss. An ectopic pregnancy is not normal, and the baby after the delivery is not healthy. As soon as the ectopic pregnancy is detected, efforts must be made to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n【42】The signs of ectopic pregnancy are as follows:\n\n【43】*   Severe cramping pain on one side of the abdomen.\n\n【44】*   Sudden spotting from the vagina.\n\n【45】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【46】*   Dizziness.\n\n【47】*   Fatigue.\n\n【48】*   Vaginal bleeding.\n\n【49】*   Neck pain.\n\n【50】*   Pain in shoulder and rectum.\n\n【51】What Are the Other Methods to Have a Baby After a Hysterectomy?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】The other methods to have a baby after a hysterectomy are as follows:\n\n【53】*   **Surrogacy**: After the surgical removal of the uterus, it does not mean that the ovaries cannot carry out normal functions. Hence the eggs discharged by the ovaries are used for in-vitro fertilization. Invitro fertilization means the fusion of egg and sperm in a test tube. After this, the fertilized egg is transported into the surrogate for further embryo development. The fertilized egg cannot be placed in women after a hysterectomy as the uterus is absent. Surrogacy helps to have genetically related children. Also, surrogacy is not permitted in every country.\n\n【54】*   **Uterus Transplantation**: After the hysterectomy procedure and recovery. The woman can opt for uterus transplantation. Uterus transplantation is a highly complex surgical procedure; the donor's healthy uterus is transplanted to the woman after a hysterectomy. This procedure is still in the experimental phase. There are risks to both the donor and recipient.\n\n【55】*   Can consider adoption in such cases.\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】Even if conceiving after the hysterectomy procedure is possible, the pregnancy is not viable and causes severe complications. Having a baby after a hysterectomy is highly uncommon, but it can happen. This can result in an ectopic pregnancy, which can be seriously dangerous. When a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, this happens. Hence better to terminate such pregnancies and opt for other methods of giving birth to a baby.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ectopic pregnancy after hysterectomy may not be so uncommon: A case report and review of the literature?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5885999/\n*   A case of ectopic pregnancy after total hysterectomy  \n    https://synapse.koreamed.org/articles/1006430\n*   Is There Any Way to Have a Baby After a Hysterectomy?  \n    https://www.medicinenet.com/have\\_a\\_baby\\_after\\_a\\_hysterectomy/article.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The estimated quantity of cobalt required to prevent pernicious anemia is in the range of 150 to 500 mg/kg. But, excessive cobalt can prevent cell mechanisms. Cobalt poisoning has been discussed since 1948.\n\n【2】Cobalt poisoning can happen from long-term cobalt dust exposure from a living or working environment, beer drinking (cobalt adulteration), or wear and tear of arthroplasty (an artificial substitute placed surgically as a joint replacement) implants made from cobalt metal.\n\n【3】What Is Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【4】Orthopedic implants made of metal components have been used as joint replacements for more than 50 years. Cobalt has been one of the most important alloys in those metal structures. Cobalt poisoning related to arthroplasty implants is known as arthroprosthetic cobaltism. Chrome-cobalt alloys have been used as a material of choice in prosthetic implants for long years.\n\n【5】In general, the liver and the kidney eliminate excess cobalt from the body through excretion. However, chronic exposure to cobalt metal can lead to significant damage to the vital organs of the body.\n\n【6】How Does Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism Develop?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Arthroprosthetic cobaltism is a major concern, especially in hip replacement surgery using chrome-cobalt alloys. Naturally, the hip joint is a ball and socket type of joint between the cup-shaped cavity of the hip bone and the ball head of the thigh bone. Therefore, during replacement, the ball and socket form is maintained to preserve the joint’s range of motion. A metal sphere is used as a ball head, and a metal cup is used as a socket, thus providing a metal-on-metal (MOM) gliding action during hip and leg movements.\n\n【8】In the long run, the metal on the metal surface starts to wear and corrode, leading to periprosthetic metallosis (local inflammatory changes around the metal-replaced joint) and hypercobaltemia (increased level of cobalt in the blood).\n\n【9】What Are the Manifestations of Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The clinical manifestation of arthroprosthetic cobaltism includes:\n\n【11】*   Altered brain function and neurological problems like headache, mental disturbances, anxiety, depression, dizziness, visual impairment, and hearing loss.\n\n【12】*   Cardiological issues explicit various heart failure symptoms that are non-coronary artery disease-related.\n\n【13】*   Hypothyroidism (the decreased activity of the thyroid gland).\n\n【14】*   Generalized body weakness and fatigue.\n\n【15】*   Sleep and mood disturbances.\n\n【16】*   Increased risk of cancer.\n\n【17】*   Genetical changes.\n\n【18】*   Reproductive dysfunction.\n\n【19】*   Muscle wastage.\n\n【20】What Are the Grades of Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The cardiovascular and neurological manifestations can be graded into five groups. They are:\n\n【22】What Are the Guidelines for Evaluating Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Specific guidelines have been issued by two of the most important healthcare agencies to evaluate arthroprosthetic cobaltism.\n\n【24】**\\- Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidelines:** The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended a few follow-up investigations after placing metal orthopedic implants. These guidelines are issued for orthopedic surgeons pertaining to metal-on-metal hip replacement implants.\n\n【25】**1\\. For Symptomatic Patients:**\n\n【26】*   Clinically evaluate the condition once in six months.\n\n【27】*   Check for soft tissue changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound.\n\n【28】*   Monitor the level of serum metal ions, preferably with EDTA-anticoagulated blood (best for cobalt testing).\n\n【29】**2\\. For Asymptomatic Patients:**\n\n【30】*   Even though the patients do not show any symptoms, it is advisable to have a clinical evaluation at least once a year or two.\n\n【31】*   Other investigations like soft tissue imaging or metal ions testing are not necessary if the prosthetic implants are functioning properly.\n\n【32】If a general physician or other healthcare professionals find a patient with metal ion toxicity symptoms, they must immediately be redirected to the orthopedic surgeons to analyze the situation and take appropriate action.\n\n【33】**\\- Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Guidelines:**\n\n【34】The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommendations provide threshold values to evaluate arthroprosthetic cobaltism.\n\n【35】**1\\. For Symptomatic Patients:**\n\n【36】*   The patients must be evaluated every year for the rest of their lifetime.\n\n【37】*   MARS MRI (metal artifact reduction sequences - magnetic resonance imaging) and ultrasound are recommended in all symptomatic patients.\n\n【38】*   The patients should undergo a whole blood metal ion test.\n\n【39】*   If the resultant level is above 7 ppb (parts per billion), it indicates a potential soft tissue reaction.\n\n【40】*   The whole blood metal ion test is repeated after three months.\n\n【41】*   If the result of the second metal ion test is also above 7 ppb, or higher than the previous test, the suspicion for soft tissue changes increases.\n\n【42】*   Finally, it is advisable to consider a revision surgery if both imaging and metal ion levels are abnormal.\n\n【43】**2\\. For Asymptomatic Patients:** The recommendations for asymptomatic patients depend on the type and size of the metal prosthetic replacement.\n\n【44】How to Manage Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【45】The literature has not provided a specific treatment for arthroprosthetic cobaltism. Few scientific papers have demonstrated certain modalities for arthroprosthetic cobaltism. They are:\n\n【46】*   Medications used are beta-blockers (manage abnormal heart rhythms), angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) - inhibitors (manage high blood pressure and heart failure), and Diuretics (get rid of excess sodium and water from the body). These drugs have shown good clinical responses.\n\n【47】*   The patients with high serum cobalt levels showed improvement in symptoms with the administration of Unithiol (2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate) - a chelating agent.\n\n【48】*   Hemodiafiltration (kidney replacement therapy) may be performed to remove the toxic metal from the blood.\n\n【49】*   Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) - a chelating agent, has been used to decline the blood cobalt value.\n\n【50】*   Ultimately, hardware removal was performed in revision surgeries, and the metal was replaced with ceramic material with polyethylene liner.\n\n【51】Most of the signs and symptoms of arthroprosthetic cobaltism, like thyroid dysfunction, vertigo, cardiomyopathy, hearing loss, and anemia, have been reported to show improvement following hardware removal. However, neurological symptoms and optic atrophy have shown variable resolution.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】Arthroprosthetic cobaltism is a rare phenomenon, but when occurring, its consequences are devastating. The manifestations can be harmful both locally and systemically. There are no definitive treatment plans in the literature. The evidence-based treatment strategy is followed to manage arthroprosthetic cobaltism. Early diagnosis and intervention will give a better treatment outcome.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Clinical features, testing, and management of patients with suspected prosthetic hip-associated cobalt toxicity  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24222555/\n*   Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism  \n    https://www.fda.gov/media/132881/download</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Surveys show that by 2030, the number of lung cancer deaths is anticipated to rise to ten million per year. Cigarette smoking is the common causative factor for several chronic respiratory diseases like chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer. Thus often in many smokers, both lung cancer and chronic airway disease co-exist. Several clinical studies have shown an association of this kind. The major chronic respiratory diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome, asthma, respiratory allergies (allergen that triggers the airway and causes inflammation), sleep apnea (pause in breathing during sleep), occupational lung disorders, cystic fibrosis (a disorder where the mucous become thick and sticky), and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【2】Apart from genetic and infectious traits, the major risk factors for chronic airway disease include long-term exposure to tobacco primary and secondary, outdoor and indoor air pollutants, occupational agents, allergens, nutrition, diet, and socioeconomic factors. In this article, we will discuss the link between some of the common chronic airway diseases and lung cancer.\n\n【3】What Are the Common Chronic Airway diseases?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Chronic respiratory diseases are the chronic disease of the respiratory pathway and other structures of the lungs. Every year one billion people are affected by some chronic respiratory illness which accounts for 4.2 million deaths worldwide. Some of the common chronic airway diseases are as follows:\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>What are the measures to get the blood values in control?</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>Pneumonia in Lung Cancer- Causes, Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Can I donate blood if my Hb value is high?</u>\n\n【10】1.  **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** It is a chronic lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis (chronic inflammation of the bronchi) and emphysema (damaged air sacs and lungs cause shortness of breath), and patients suffer from difficulty breathing. It causes inflammation of the airways and obstructs normal airflow. It occurs due to long-term exposure to cigarette smoke, particulate matter, or gasses. Patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) risk developing lung cancer, heart disease, and various other conditions.\n\n【11】2.  **Asthma and Respiratory Allergies:** Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and increased bronchial reactivity. Common symptoms are wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness, cough, and sputum. Respiratory allergy is a hypersensitive response of the respiratory tissues in response to sensitization of the immune mechanism by allergens. Asthma and respiratory allergy show similar symptoms and have common triggering factors.\n\n【12】3.  **Occupational Lung Diseases:** Lung conditions that are caused by or sometimes worsened by long-term exposure to irritants at the workplace. Chemicals, fungal spores, dust particles, and animal droppings are common irritants that increase the risk of developing occupational lung diseases.\n\n【13】4.  **Sleep Apnea Syndrome:** A sleep disorder wherein breathing is stopped repeatedly, breaking the continuity of sleep.\n\n【14】5.  **Pulmonary Hypertension:** High blood pressure affects the arteries of the lungs and heart.\n\n【15】What Are the Causes of Lung Cancer?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】When some cells of the lungs undergo certain abnormal changes and multiply uncontrollably, a tumor forms resulting in lung cancer; in the early stages, it is not presented with significant signs and symptoms; however, in the later stages, people may show frequent coughing, blood in the mucous, chest pain, breathing problems, and difficulty in speaking and swallowing.\n\n【17】Based on the size of the cells affected, lung cancer can be divided into small cells (the cancer cells are smaller and are fast-growing) and non-small cells (the cancer cells are larger and behave similarly to squamous cell carcinoma) cancers. 80 to 5 percent of the reported lung cancer cases are non-small cell, and small cell cancer accounts for only 15 percent.\n\n【18】One of the major causative factors for lung cancer is cigarette smoking. It is also caused by using other sources of tobacco such as cigars and pipes, inhaling secondhand smoke, exposure to radon or asbestos at sites of occupation, and a family history of lung cancer. Several clinical studies reveal that people with chronic airway diseases are at higher risk of developing lung cancer at an earlier or later stage.\n\n【19】What Is the Link Between Chronic Airway Diseases and Lung Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases are usually referred to as “complex diseases.” This section will show the relationship between some of the most commonly seen chronic airway diseases and lung cancer.\n\n【21】**1\\. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Lung Cancer:** Cigarette smoking is the main contributing factor to developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Several clinical studies have revealed that there are several other factors linking these two diseases beyond a common etiology. Smokers with obstructive airways are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than those with a normal airway, and COPD is an independent risk factor for lung cancers. This relation suggests that some common mechanism, like premature cellular aging or the presence of certain growth factors, is present in the pathogenesis of both conditions. Some of the common factors are as follows:\n\n【22】*   **Genetic Predisposition to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Lung Cancer:** Lung cancer and COPD has familial susceptibility, and the underlying genetic predisposition is the same for both diseases. Some genetic changes are responsible for inflammation-causing COPD tumor growth responsible for cancer.\n*   **Epigenetic Changes:** In addition to genetic changes, epigenetic (changes in gene activity without changing the DNA sequence) modifications like deoxyribonucleic acid methylation (addition of methyl groups to the DNA), covalent histone modifications(process altering the chromatin structure), microRNAs expression (controls gene expression), etc. play an important role in the progress of lung cancer and COPD.\n*   **Oxidative Stress:** The free radicals produced in cigarette puffs are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. They create oxidative stress in the cells. It is responsible for the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) damage in cancer cells and inflammatory processes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【23】**2\\. Asthma and Lung Cancer:** Studies reveal an increased risk of developing lung cancer in chronic asthmatic patients. Tobacco smoking is a predisposing factor for both diseases. However, asthmatic patients without smoking habits also presented an increased risk of developing lung cancer. The inflammatory cells responsible for the pathogenesis of asthma played a pivotal role in the development of lung cancer also.\n\n【24】**3\\. Occupational Lung Diseases and Lung Cancer:** Long-term exposure to chemicals from occupational sites may result in chronic respiratory illnesses like allergies and asthma. Some of these chemicals are carcinogenic (potential to cause genetic changes in the cells that predispose to cancer), and long-term exposure may pivot the pathogenesis of cancer.\n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】As a general rule, it can be assumed that a chronic respiratory illness predisposes to lung cancer; They have a common etiology, and apart from that, several common mechanisms in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and chronic airway disease suggest the link between the two.\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>*   Chronic respiratory diseases  \n    https://www.who.int/health-topics/chronic-respiratory-diseases\n*   The relationship between COPD and lung cancer  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718929/\n*   Asthma and the risk of lung cancer: a meta-analysis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5355290/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The function of these vocal cords in our body is to vibrate when the air passes from the lungs and reaches the vocal cords making them vibrate as they come closer.\n\n【2】The sound of each person depends on the size and shape of the vocal cords. Any defects in these vocal fold muscles or larynx disrupt the mechanism of the vocal folds to work normally and result in voice disorders.\n\n【3】What Are the Common Disorders That Affect the Voice?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Various disorders that affect the voice are:\n\n【5】*   **Laryngitis:** It is swelling of the vocal cords due to upper respiratory tract infections, Gastroesophageal reflux diseases (acid reflux), or smoking. It results in hoarseness of the voice.\n\n【6】*   **Vocal Cord Paralysis:** It occurs due to damage to the nerves supplying the vocal cords due to cancerous or non-cancerous growth involving the nerves or vocal folds, trauma to nerves during surgery, or in the case of neurological diseases like Parkinson’s disease. It results in loss of vocal tone, pitch, and slurred speech.\n\n【7】*   **Spasmodic Dysphonia:** It is a disorder related to nerves that cause the tightening of the muscles of vocal folds resulting in a strangled voice.\n\n【8】What Are the Causes of Voice Disorders?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Causes of voice disorders include:\n\n【10】*   **Vocal Abuse**: Excessive use of vocal cords like shouting or yelling causes hoarseness of voice.\n\n【11】*   **Smoking:** Smoking causes swelling of the vocal folds and also increases the risk of laryngeal (voicebox) cancer.\n\n【12】*   **Acid Reflux Disease:** Continuous exposure of the vocal folds due to reflux of acid causes swelling of the vocal folds.\n\n【13】*   **Presence of Soft Tissue Growth**: Any cancerous or non-cancerous growth present on the vocal folds like a vocal cyst, polyps, or nodules that disturb the mechanism of the vocal folds to vibrate, leading to voice disorders.\n\n【14】*   **Nerve Disorders:** Any diseases like myasthenia gravis or multiple sclerosis that affect the nerve to vocal fold, like damage to recurrent laryngeal or superior laryngeal nerve, leads to alteration of the voice or voice disorders.\n\n【15】*   **Hormonal Disturbances:** Any disorders affecting the thyroid hormones or growth hormones can lead to hypertrophy (increase in size) of the vocal folds muscle, causing voice disorders.\n\n【16】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Related to Voice Disorders?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Signs and symptoms of voice disorders are:\n\n【18】*   Hoarseness of voice.\n\n【19】*   Loss of vocal tone.\n\n【20】*   Too low or very high-pitched voice.\n\n【21】*   A tremor in speech.\n\n【22】*   Breathlessness while speaking.\n\n【23】*   Vocal fatigue.\n\n【24】*   Too much effort while talking.\n\n【25】*   Pain in the throat.\n\n【26】*   Feeling the presence of a foreign body in the throat.\n\n【27】*   Stammered speech (break in the flow of speech).\n\n【28】How Can We Diagnose Voice Disorders?\n------------------------------------\n\n【29】Diagnostic techniques for voice disorders are :\n\n【30】*   **History and Clinical Examination:** Complete history of any trauma to the vocal cords or any history of surgery related to vocal cords should be recorded. A complete clinical examination of the throat is done by using a laryngoscope (a thin instrument with a light on the tip) to check for any growths present in the vocal folds. The opening and closing of vocal folds can be assessed.\n\n【31】*   **Electromyography:** It is done to check for electrical impulses in the vocal folds in cases of vocal cord paralysis.\n\n【32】*   **Flow-Volume-Loop:** It is done to check the flow of air into the lungs while breathing in and out. Any obstruction in the airway will make the loop appear flat.\n\n【33】*   **Videostroboscopy:** A flexible endoscope with an attached camera is used to visualize the movements of the vocal folds. Slow-motion video can be observed of the opening and closing of vocal folds, and a camera is used to click the magnified images of the vocal folds. It is the most reliable diagnostic technique.\n\n【34】*   **Vocal Assessment:** Assessment of alteration in voice pitch, tone, frequency, and volume is done by the speech-language pathologist.\n\n【35】*   **Computed Tomography Scans:** It is done to check for any cancerous or non-cancerous growth present in relation to vocal folds preventing the vocal cords from vibrating.\n\n【36】What Is the Treatment for Voice Disorders?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Various treatment techniques for voice disorders are:\n\n【38】*   **Conservative Management:** By changing the lifestyle, like avoiding smoking and avoiding vocal abuse or fatigue by voice rest. Keeping the body hydrated by drinking adequate fluids.\n\n【39】*   **Voice Therapy:** Voice therapy is provided by speech-language pathologists, which helps in relaxing the throat and teaches some vocal functioning exercises.\n\n【40】*   **Surgical Removal of the Growth:** Surgical removal of the growth present on the vocal folds like vocal polyps or nodules to restore normal vocal cords movements.\n\n【41】*   **Laser Surgery:** Use of endoscopic laser surgery can be done to remove soft tissue growth like vocal polyps and nodules in the bloodless field as polyps are vascularized lesions that tend to bleed easily.\n\n【42】*   **Treatment of Underlying Diseases:** Underlying causes of voice disorders like viral or bacterial infections and acid reflux disease should be treated by taking medications.\n\n【43】*   **Nerve Repair:** Repair of the damaged nerve is done by moving the healthy nerves to the damaged area restoring the normal vocal cord functions.\n\n【44】*   **Botox Injections:** Botulinum toxin injections are a standard gold treatment for vocal fold tremors or spasms. It is given by an ENT specialist and is repeated after every eight to 12 weeks.\n\n【45】How Can We Prevent Voice Disorders?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【46】Voice disorder can be prevented by:\n\n【47】*   Avoid excessive use of voice, like screaming and shouting.\n\n【48】*   Drink plenty of fluids to keep the membrane of the throat hydrated.\n\n【49】*   Avoid smoking.\n\n【50】*   Treatment of underlying conditions like acid reflux disease by taking Antacids or Proton pump inhibitors drugs.\n\n【51】**Conclusion:**\n\n【52】The voice of a person is an important communication tool in social life. Various disorders affect the vocal folds, like spasmodic dysphonia, laryngitis, and vocal nerve paralysis, resulting in the disruption of the mechanism of vocal folds to vibrate properly, leading to an alteration in voice, affecting the quality of life of a person. Any changes in the quality of voice, such as pitch, tone, and fluency, should be brought to the notice of an ENT surgeon for early diagnosis and management of the condition.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   Voice disorders  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/voice-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20353022\n*   American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)  \n    https://www.asha.org/\n*   Functional Voice Disorders  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563182/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Approximately one percent of children in the United States meet the current diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder, with the onset of symptoms in early childhood persisting throughout life. The degree of severity increases gradually with the outcome of challenges affecting families to get confronted with social, educational, and occupational problems. The treatment options are also very limited as no pharmacological treatment has been proven to work completely with a reduction in autism symptoms or their frequent cognitive comorbidities.\n\n【2】How Do Genetic Factors Influence Autism Disorder Risk?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Genetic disturbance or derangement plays a major role in a newly born baby with a mental disorder. Genetic variants differ in nature and in the frequency at which they occur in the human population, and inherited genetic variants that are passed from parents to children can occur at all frequencies, from common to very rare. Genetic abnormalities arising newly in the offspring that are not seen in a carrier’s parents are typically rare. Genetic studies have strongly suggested that autism disorder generally occurs due to an alteration of the amino acid sequence in a protein or a functional RNA (ribonucleic acid) or by producing a change in the circumstances or timing disturbance.\n\n【4】What Is Autism Disorder?\n------------------------\n\n【5】Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder in which the affected child may face difficulty in social interaction, communication, and behavior. The main and earliest sign to detect an autistic child is they will not be able to make eye contact with anyone, and they do not listen or respond to any commands. About 30 % with the disorder have an intellectual disability and are likely to have the disorder when someone in the family has a history of autism. Early screening and diagnosis can ensure that children receive the better service they need for a better outcome.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Autism Disorder?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】The cause is still unknown, but the most accepted reason behind autism is an abnormality in the brain structure and function. The genetic cause is also considered to be the reason as the genetics of autism is complex and cannot be determined whether it is rare mutations with major effects or if it is multi-gene interactions that occur in common genetic variants. The disruption mainly occurs in the early stages of fetal development due to various environmental factors that affect the gene function and brain cell communication process. Children with tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome have a huge tendency to develop autism. Also, when the parents conceive at a later age, the baby is prone to autism.\n\n【8】How Is Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Autism can be detected from the age of two and is generally diagnosed by skilled professionals, which include a pediatrician, neuropsychologist, and developmental therapists; however, there are many children who cannot be diagnosed as autistic child because some might have different signs and symptoms. The diagnosis must involve two steps, and they are:\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Are my symptoms related to autism or bipolar disorder?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>How is Asperger syndrome named today?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>How to handle a 5-year-old child with ASD who takes off all kinds of clothes and fabric?</u>\n\n【15】1.  **Developmental Screening:** A neuropsychologist and developmental therapist detect the activity and behavioral changes of the child at regular intervals at the age of nine months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months. If there is any developmental delay found in the child, it has to be diagnosed with the developmental screening process, but those who are at higher risk, like premature birth and family history, should be checked earlier.\n\n【16】2.  **Other Diagnostic Evaluation**: Genetic testing, hearing and vision screening, neurological testing, and other medical tests help detect and analyze if there is a problem in the child’s brain development.\n\n【17】How to Treat Autism?\n--------------------\n\n【18】There is no permanent treatment for autism spectrum disorder, but it can be treated and managed to some extent by:\n\n【19】*   **Treatment Through Medication:** Antipsychotic medicines like Risperdal, Melatonin, and others are recommended to manage serious behavioral problems like self-harm, aggression, sleep apnea, and tantrums. However, there is no permanent solution for autistic children.\n\n【20】*   **Diet for Autistic Child:** An autistic child's diet must contain high quantities of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins along with a diet free of gluten, present in wheat, and casein, present in milk, which is often recommended for autistic children. 30 % of autism patients consume non-food items like paper or dirt, and hence, parents must be attentive and careful.\n\n【21】Some of the home treatments are also found to be useful for the treatment of autism, and they are:\n\n【22】*   **Behavior and Communication Approaches:** Most of the time, communication is a major concern, and hence the parents should:\n\n【23】    *   Use the child’s name multiple times to make them understand that they are being referred to when calling the name.\n\n【24】    *   Keep the background sound as minimal as possible.\n\n【25】    *   Start with a slow and steady conversation.\n\n【26】    *   Use simple gestures to communicate with the child.\n\n【27】    *   Notice the expression of the autistic children if they want to say something.\n\n【28】    *   Speak slowly and make them focus on the lip movement so that the autistic child understands and learns the words.\n\n【29】*   **Parent’s Education and Training:** The parents can educate themselves about the facts and figures about the disorder by joining the local communities to learn how to live with autistic children.\n\n【30】*   **Makaton and PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)**: Makaton is an alternative communication method in which the parents are taught how to communicate with the children through signs and symbols.\n\n【31】*   **Alternative Therapies:** In some cases, a few alternative therapies are used, like chelation therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration therapy, and dance movement therapy for autistic children, which do not have any scientific evidence.\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】Autistic spectrum disorder has no cure, but few therapies can help to a great extent to live a better life. To minimize the risk factor of autism, the parents, right from the time of pregnancy, should take care of a proper diet, exercise, minimize the use of electromagnetic rays, and take proper doses of vaccines. Early detection of the disorder is fruitful for both survivors and parents.\n\n【34】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【35】* * *\n\n【36】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Gene Associated With Autism?**\n\n【37】Yes, the disease is associated with the genes. The inherited mutations in the gene called ACTL6B cause autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy.\n\n【38】#### **2.**删除换行**How Do Genes Cause Autism Spectrum Disorders?**\n\n【39】The exact cause of autism spectrum disorder is unknown. People with certain genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome are likely to have autism. A family history of autism spectrum disorder makes the child more prone to autism. Usually, the patient's family history is essential while diagnosing the conditions. Genetic abnormalities arising newly in the offspring that are not seen in a carrier’s parents are typically rare. Genetic studies have strongly suggested that autism disorder generally occurs due to an alteration of the amino acid sequence in a protein or a functional RNA (ribonucleic acid) or by producing a change in the circumstances or timing disturbance.\n\n【40】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Common Genetic Cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder?**\n\n【41】Autism spectrum disorder is associated with a genetic disorder such as fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome. Some genetic mutations are inherited.\n\n【42】#### **4.**删除换行**Are Parents Tested for Autism Genes?**\n\n【43】Yes, parents will need genetic testing because autism is an inherited disorder. Any mutations in the gene can be found in the results of the testing. A family history of autism is one of the risk factors for a child to have autism, especially if the parents have a daughter with autism or more than one child with autism. The other family members will also have kids with autism. If the family members had genetic disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome. It is more likely for the child to have autism.\n\n【44】#### **5.**删除换行**How Autism Is Detected During Pregnancy?**\n\n【45】A routine prenatal ultrasound can diagnose autism. Studies suggest that early signs of autism can be detected through routine prenatal ultrasound in the second trimester.\n\n【46】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Autism Very Common Today?**\n\n【47】Increased paternal age accounts for three percent of autistic children. Autism’s prevalence is rising because of environmental toxins and vaccines. Pregnancy and birth complications, such as delivery before 26 weeks, low birth weight, and multiple pregnancies, are contributing factors.\n\n【48】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Frequency of Autism in Firstborns?**\n\n【49】Yes, firstborn children have an increased likelihood of autism. The first child with autism rises the odds of a second child with the autistic disorder by twenty folds.\n\n【50】#### **8.**删除换行**Who Carries the Autism Gene in Parents?**\n\n【51】One parent inherits a dominant trait. Autism is always thought to have a maternal inheritance component.\n\n【52】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Age at Which Autism Is Noticed First?**\n\n【53】Autism is detected first by 18 months of age or younger. Some people are not diagnosed until they are adults. A diagnosis from an experienced professional by the age of 2 can be considered reliable.\n\n【54】#### **10.**删除换行**At What Month Are Autistic Children Born?**\n\n【55】The symptoms of autism usually appear early in development as children show symptoms by 12 months to 18 months of age or earlier.  Mostly autistic children are not diagnosed till age 3.\n\n【56】#### **11.**删除换行**How Can Stress During Pregnancy Cause Autism?**\n\n【57】Prenatal stress and maternal immune dysfunction contribute to a significant proportion of autism disorders. High levels of stress during pregnancy are connected to autism in children. Stress causes hormone abnormalities in pregnant women are a significant potential risk factor for autism. Viral infections in the mother during pregnancy might also result in autism.\n\n【58】#### **12.**删除换行**How Autism Can Be Prevented in Children?**\n\n【59】It is essential to do medical checkups and take medications during pregnancy. Early diagnosis can help prevent autism. Currently, there is no definitive cure to prevent autism. Pregnant women develop prevention strategies for autism. Pregnants should avoid airborne toxins. Access to clean water can prevent this because contaminated water is connected to high rates of autism. Maintaining a nutritious diet prevents autism. A healthy diet, such as an organic diet rich in green vegetables and fruits containing antioxidants, folic acid, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. Gestational diabetes, prescription medications, and cesarean sections are risk factors for autism that can be avoided.\n\n【60】#### **13.**删除换行**How Does IVF Increase the Chance of Autism?**\n\n【61】No. Invitro fertilization has a slight association with autism. The risk of autism was less among children born to women using in vitro fertilization (IVF). The overall risk of autism is extremely small in children born through in-vitro fertilization. When we control the characteristics of women, such as maternal age, and multiple births, the association can be reduced.\n\n【62】#### **14.**删除换行**At What Rate Autism Is Found in India?**\n\n【63】1 in 500 or 0.20 percent. A higher risk of ASD is found in rural areas than in tribal areas. Upper socioeconomic groups of family and male sex have a higher risk of getting diagnosed with autism than lower socioeconomic people.\n\n【64】#### **15.**删除换行**What Is the Best Treatment for Autism?**\n\n【65】Applied behavioral therapies are considered the gold standard for autism. They focus on changing the behavior. They have the widely accepted evidence for treating symptoms of autism. A prominent treatment for autism is applied behavior analysis (ABA). It discourages undesired behaviors and encourages desired behaviors to improve these skills.\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>*   Genetic research in autism spectrum disorders  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4650984/\n*   Genetic Causes and Modifiers of Autism Spectrum Disorder  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00385/full\n*   Autism Spectrum Disorder, Family Health History, and Genetics  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/autism.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Set an attainable time every day, even if it is only ten minutes. Try to complete the chosen yoga practice in time and extend the practice if time permits. Slower forms of yoga, such as Yin, Hatha, or restorative yoga, should be performed. Avoid practicing such as hot, power yoga, or vinyasa. Concentrate on yoga postures that give a calming effect and are restorative. Active energizing postures like backbends should be avoided. Savasana should be performed at the end of each session, reducing stress and anxiety from the mind and body and enhancing good sleep quality.\n\n【54】Choose a healthy sleep environment with proper temperature, clear electronics, and use of any candles or essential oil diffuser to promote a relaxing aroma. The yoga sessions can be performed under dim lights and with an eye mask on. Slow, soft music can be chosen to enhance sleep.\n\n【55】How to Change the Routine to Incorporate Yoga?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Small and simple changes should be made in the nighttime habits. Design the yoga practice in such a way as to attain the goal and the improvement the person aims at with the amount of time available. Keep a check on the daily routine through electronics, journals, self-rewarding, or having an accountability partner.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】Various forms of yoga help to enhance sleep quality and duration. Bedtime yoga is very beneficial to those with sleep concerns. Choose gentle yoga postures instead of powerful yoga. Focus on the postures and breathing techniques that help relax the stress and anxiety and enhance sleep. Savasana should be performed at the end of any yoga session as it relaxes the mind and body and improves sleep quality. So regular yoga practice may be a choice for improving the sleep cycle and can also be a better alternative for therapeutically aided sleep.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n无关删除-1:<u>*   5 Yoga Poses to Do Before You Go To Sleep  \n    https://www.acefitness.org/resources/pros/expert-articles/5782/5-yoga-poses-to-do-before-you-go-to-sleep/\n*   5 Best Yoga Pose to do before Sleep | 5 minute bedtime yoga  \n    https://theyogainstitute.org/5-best-yoga-pose-to-do-before-sleep-benefits/\n*   Simple yoga poses for a better sleep | The Art of Living India  \n    https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/wellness/mental/holistic-living/simple-yoga-poses-for-a-better-sleep</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "355762bc-c81e-4f74-8c82-8658e5923068", "title": "Diverse Techniques to Battle Mosquito-Borne Illnesses", "text": "【0】Diverse Techniques to Battle Mosquito-Borne Illnesses\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Mosquitoes are vectors of numerous infectious agents (parasites and viruses) that transmit diseases from animals to humans and humans to humans. Most mosquito-borne diseases are fatal or result in comorbidities that last for a few years or throughout the lifespan of affected individuals. Mosquitoes are reported as the deadliest vectors transmitting illnesses in humans by WHO (World Health Organization).\n\n【2】The emergence and resurgence of infectious pathogens transmitted through mosquitoes have raised an alarming alert on global public health. Recent studies suggest that mosquito-borne infections are not only primary health problems in endemic areas like Africa and Asia but also major health threats in developed countries like the United States of America and European countries due to an increase in uncontrolled urbanization, international travel, global trade and relocation of the population from endemic areas.\n\n【3】To tackle such health threats and lower their incidence rates, international health agencies like Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), local governments, and research scientists are working ceaselessly to upgrade existing vector-control methods and discover new techniques and approaches in reducing transmission.\n\n【4】What Are the Illnesses Transmitted by Mosquitoes?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Malaria and dengue are the most prevalent mosquito-borne diseases that pose a major health burden in endemic areas. However, recent WHO reports suggest that the incidence of encephalitis caused by a variety of mosquito-vectored viruses is far more increasing in developed countries like the US. The predominant species of mosquito that transmit disease are Aedes sp. Anopheles sp. and Culex sp.\n\n【6】Why Is It Important to Control Mosquitoes?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Understanding that mosquitoes act as carriers of various life-threatening pathogens and transmit fatal illnesses, reducing the vector population is considered the most effective approach for controlling disease transmission by mosquitoes.\n\n【8】Global health regulatory bodies such as WHO, CDC, and local authorities have formulated multiple protocols and guidelines for vector control based on the geographical and environmental factors that favor mosquito existence in prevalent areas.\n\n【9】Following are some facts about the behavioral patterns of mosquitoes that further help in comprehending mosquito-control techniques.\n\n【10】*   There are over 3000 types of mosquito species present worldwide. Among them, only some bite animals and humans.\n\n【11】*   A few mosquito types bite animals or humans but do not transmit diseases. Such types are termed 'nuisance mosquitoes.'\n\n【12】*   Only adult female mosquitoes bite to retreive blood from animals and humans because they require blood to produce eggs.\n\n【13】*   When mosquitoes suck in blood from animals or humans harboring pathogens (parasites and viruses), they get infected and become vectors of such causative organisms.\n\n【14】*   The pathogens remain alive or complete a part of their life cycle inside the mosquito body before they are injected into another animal or human through mosquito bites, and thus transmission of infection continues.\n\n【15】*   Only a minimum number of mosquitoes is needed to trigger a massive outbreak in a particular area.\n\n【16】Mosquito control is an essential initiative executed for the wider protection of public health and to prevent vector transmission worldwide.\n\n【17】The predominant reasons to establish mosquito-control practices both indoors and outdoors are,\n\n【18】*   To reduce the population of mosquitoes that serve as vectors of infectious diseases and to control outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses, which are major public health threats.\n\n【19】*   To control nuisance mosquitoes that disturb people's normal activities at homes, indoor settings, parks, and other recreational places.\n\n【20】*   To eradicate mosquito population in areas of economic importance such as places of tourism value, real estate business ventures, and livestock and poultry farms where mosquitoes harm their economic production.\n\n【21】*   To hamper and minimize mosquito adaptive behaviors, which they incorporate in them genetically to survive and evolve in their changing environment.\n\n【22】*   To remove mosquito types that not only carry but also act as secondary hosts for mutations of pathogens resulting in the emergence of new virulent strains.\n\n【23】What Are the Diverse Techniques Employed in Mosquito-Borne Disease Control?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The basic fundamental step to control mosquito-borne illnesses is public awareness and prevention-control programs designed with scientific inputs. This includes large-scale surveillance of endemic areas and mosquito behavior and population monitoring. Epidemiological studies conducted on outbreak areas have helped identify the type of mosquito species that act as vectors and environmental factors that influence its life cycles, such as climatic conditions, associated flora and fauna, and adaptive mechanisms.\n\n【25】The three major components of mosquito-borne disease control are,\n\n【26】1.  Physical barriers.\n\n【27】2.  Chemical barriers.\n\n【28】3.  Biological barriers.\n\n【29】**1) Physical Barriers**\n\n【30】The prime strategy to prevent mosquito biting is avoidance which creates physical inaccessibility for the vector to reach the host. Surveillance and identification of breeding grounds such as stagnant water, backwaters, ditches, construction debris, ponds, and drains that collect rainwater and eliminate them help reduce population.\n\n【31】Removing unwanted vegetation around homes and waterbodies also prevents the breeding of mosquitoes. Using wire mesh for doors and windows, mosquito nets are some of the physical barrier methods.\n\n【32】Recent advances in physical barrier methods include using Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated Nets (LLINs) designed using fabric technology. These nets are coated with synthetic insecticides and are used as an efficient vector-control tool. They are more durable and also reduce environmental side-effects caused due to spraying of insecticides.\n\n【33】**2) Chemical Barriers**\n\n【34】Mosquito repellents are the primary defense practice to avoid mosquito bites. They are useful both indoors and outdoors.\n\n【35】Some of the commonly used repellents are-\n\n【36】*   DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) - commonly used standard repellant.\n\n【37】*   Picaridin (Odorless and non-sticky)\n\n【38】*   Lemon oil of eucalyptus (not recommended for younger children)\n\n【39】The use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as a preventive measure has been in practice for many years. But current studies prove that mosquitoes are becoming DDT-resistant, which leads to the development of new insecticides.\n\n【40】Current chemical techniques involve,\n\n【41】*   **Larviciding -** It is done by adding methoprene-containing pesticides to stagnant water where mosquitoes breed and larvae form. Larvae ingest these chemicals and are killed by the toxicity of the pesticides.\n\n【42】*   **Adulticiding -** Insecticides like 2 % pyrethroids and 95 % organophosphates are sprayed using peridomestic spraying techniques. Insecticide concentrations depend on the percentage of active ingredients and the toxicity level of the targeted mosquitoes. Through spraying methods, thermal fog, and cold fog (ultra low volume treatment), pesticide droplets are released into the air to eradicate the mosquito population.\n\n【43】Over the past decades, chemical methods have tremendously helped in controlling the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in endemic areas and in outbreak times. Also, newer chemicals are discovered with minimal harmful side effects. However, the emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes is an alarming threat and is a major obstacle in vector control.\n\n【44】**3) Biological Barriers**\n\n【45】Research studies on genetics, insect biology, and bioengineering have led to a better understanding of host-parasite interactions and the development of biological vector control programs. This includes genetic modifications of vectors, introducing predator agents in target environments, vaccine research, and using bacterio-insecticides that inhibit the development of mosquito resistance.\n\n【46】*   **Biological Predator Agents -** Biological agents like elephant mosquitoes and fish predators introduced in aquatics have larvicidal effects. Certain species of fungi (Coelomomyces, Beauveria, Lagenidium, Culicinomyces, Metarhizium, Entomophthora) also exhibit larvicidal activity against vector species.\n\n【47】*   **Bacterial-Insecticides -** Bacteria like Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, Bacillus sphaericus, etc. are used as larvicidal agents. On introducing these bacteria into the larval population, the bacterial toxins destroy the larvae. Studies show that mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia have reduced the capacity to transmit pathogens since the bacterium inhibits the multiplication of pathogens inside the vector.\n\n【48】*   **Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) -** It is a genetic modification method specific to certain mosquito species. A large population of genetically engineered sterile male mosquitoes is released in the target area to compete with wild types. Female mosquitoes mate with genetically modified mosquitoes (GMMs) and yield minimal progeny, thus reducing vector population over generations.\n\n【49】*   **Introducing a Lethal Dominant Gene (RIDL) -** Release of insects with lethal dominant gene) in modified mosquitoes causes the death of female mosquitoes. The use of RIDL is a promising tool to completely replace DDT-resistant mosquitoes.\n\n【50】*   **Vaccine Development -** The discovery of vaccines, particularly malarial vaccines, inhibit the protozoan life cycle in humans. They effectively protect young children and are widely used by people who frequently travel to endemic areas. Recent advances in vaccine development include using biomolecules that directly target vectors.\n\n【51】Scientists have developed a new serum that directly inhibits a biological component in the mosquito's saliva at the deposition site, thus preventing the pathogen's entry into the bloodstream.\n\n【52】Dengue tetravalent live vaccine \\[CYD-TDV; licensed(2015) in Mexico\\], inactivated alum-adjuvant JE vaccine \\[strain used SA14-14-2; approved(2009) North America, Australia, European countries\\], and Vero-cell derived JE vaccine (Kolar strain- 821564XY; India) are some of the newer vaccines in current clinical practice against mosquito-borne diseases.\n\n【53】Other future perspectives in vector control include genetically modifying vector microbiome, applying CRISPR-Cas genetic tool to edit the genome of the vectors, and projects on vector population genomics are novel strategies that would result in breakthrough developments in vector-disease control.\n\n【54】**Conclusion**\n\n【55】Globally, mosquito-borne illnesses have persisted as life-threatening public health concerns over recent decades. The resurgence of non-pathogenic microbes as more virulent pathogens and the emergence of newer pathogens using vectors as secondary hosts remain a perennial challenge to the clinical community and world health authorities.\n\n【56】Numerous vector-control programs have succeeded and failed since mosquitoes intrinsically show quick evolutionary modifications to the change in their surviving environment. Since most of these adaptations occur genetically, current research and vector-control technology target to alter their genome at the molecular level. Further research and understanding of vector-pathogen-host interactions would eventually lead to implementing newer and safe vector-control strategies, thus helping in successfully combating mosquito-borne illnesses.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Mosquito-Borne Diseases Emergence/Resurgence and How to Effectively Control It Biologically  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7238209/\n*   Vector-borne diseases  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases\n*   Mosquito-Borne Diseases  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/outdoor/mosquito-borne/default.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There are two main forms of vitamin K- phylloquinone or vitamin K1, produced from plant and fiber sources, and menaquinone, or Vitamin K2, which is produced naturally in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【2】Vitamin K deficiency may be multifactorial in origin ranging from underlying genetic conditions and disorders to systemic chronic disease, smoking, chronic alcoholism, detrimental lifestyle, immunosuppression, and dietary deficiency of vitamin K source food, causing interference in the absorption of this vitamin or interference in the mechanism of action leading to a deficiency. Newborn infants are predisposed to a higher incidence of vitamin K deficiencies than adults, where this condition is usually reported mainly as a result of dietary lack of supplementation of vitamin K sources.\n\n【3】Vitamin K was originally discovered in the year 1929 as an essential vitamin important for the clotting mechanism in the body, while it was first initially reported as a \"Koagulation vitamin '' in a German scientific journal. In the early 20th century, the famous dental surgeon Weston prince also studied and researched the mechanisms of action pertaining to the lack of dietary sources linking these vitamin K deficiencies in varying population groups. His particular dental research led him to conclude this hitherto unidentified nutrient is a source of defense mechanism and protection for combating chronic tooth decay and erosion.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>My mother is suffering from painful uterine fibroids.

Can I take other vitamins too?</u>\n\n【9】What Are the Sources and Functions of Vitamin K2?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Phylloquinone or vitamin K1 is obtained by the intake of various plant sources, i.e. leafy greens like spinach, kale, lettuce, broccoli, carrots, blueberries, grapes, vegetable oils, turnips, collards, etc. whereas vitamin K2 though naturally produced in the GI tract can also be obtained through dietary sources of fatty fish, hard cheese and dairy products, soybeans, egg yolks, sauerkraut, etc.\n\n【11】Vitamin K1 deficiency is rather uncommon unless an individual has a dietary deficit in obtaining these sources, and vitamin K1 is essentially functioning as a blood-clotting agent. Vitamin K2, meanwhile, has the below-listed functions for these crucial metabolism and functioning pathways:\n\n【12】Vitamin K2 is responsible for protein activation and the deposition of calcium in the bones and teeth. It maintains the intact calcification of the bone and cartilages, preventing stunted growth and retardation, and maintains an anti-inflammatory effect on the blood vessels preventing plaque accumulation in the circulatory system. It is essential for myelin sheath formation of nerve cells, bone growth, and for facial and dental development. It is a fundamental vitamin that signals the protein pathways essential for the production of vitamins A and D.\n\n【13】What Is the Role of Vitamin K in Osteocalcin Metabolism?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】As mentioned earlier, because of its role in producing vitamins A and D by protein pathway signaling, consequently a protein that is found abundantly in the human body other than collagen is called osteocalcin, which is a product of osteoblast secretion due to vitamin A and Vitamin D metabolism.\n\n【15】Osteocalcin plays multiple roles in bodily metabolism. Ranging from its effect on the insulin hormone pathway and stabilization to its effect on the sperm cells, which have high concentrations of osteocalcin dependent upon the K2 vitamin. Osteocalcin stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin hormone and has a 24-36% approximate lowering effect upon blood glucose concentration. Osteocalcin plays a pivotal part in maintaining male fertility as it boosts and regulates the production of testosterone in men and influences the survival capacity and production of sperm.\n\n【16】What Is the Systemic Model Theory About Vitamin K2 in Protecting Enamel And Dentin?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】In the systemic-based model of dental caries induction, researchers have suggested the importance of multifactorial causes leading to dental decay and tooth erosion. The irreversible loss of enamel and dentin layers in tooth structure causing either caries or erosion is mainly attributed to the enhanced bacterial microflora in the oral cavity leading to inflammatory responses and metalloproteinase (MPA's) based dissolution of tooth structure.\n\n【18】Other systemic hypothesis theories focus on affected endocrine signaling from the parotid gland and hypothalamic oxidative stress that creates a negative impact upon the dentinal fluid of the second layer of the tooth, i.e. the dentin layer. Vitamin K2 has the main function of regulating calcium and inorganic phosphates. Hence it has a direct positive or synergistic impact on the oral cavity by this regulation and preserves enamel health and prevents dentin erosion. Also, dietary sugars cause dental caries to reduce or create an immune breach in oral defense mechanisms. Hence vitamin K2 works in contrast by enhancing antioxidant properties and improving the salivary buffering capacity indirectly, thus helping in the protection of tooth enamel and dentin.\n\n【19】How Does Vitamin K2 Help in Preventing Cardiovascular Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Research studies and clinical trials data have shown to exhibit a significant reduction in vascular damage as well as slowing down the typical progression of atherosclerosis\\-related heart disease by high dietary intake of supplementation with vitamin K2. A higher intake of dietary vitamin K2, around 32 mcg per day without any additional vitamin K1 supplementation, has been associated with reduced arterial calcification, a 50% reduction in death occurring as a result of cardiovascular events, and a 25% reduction in all causative mortalities. Research has also shown that for every 10 mcg of dietary vitamin K2 in the forms of menaquinone 7,8,9 (MK-7, MK-8, MK-9), the risk of CHD or coronary heart disease can also be prevented or reduced by nearly 9%. This may be because the deficiency of vitamin K2 can lead to inadequate activation of MGP, increasing the risk for blood vessel walls calcification. MPG's role is to inhibit calcium from depositing on the blood vessel walls. Hence the risk for arterial calcification can be combated as well significantly reduced by vitamin K2.\n\n【21】**Conclusion**:\n\n【22】The benefits of moderate dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin K2 are synergistic upon cardiac, dental, pancreatic, and reproductive systems. Also, osteocalcin is majorly regulated by this vitamin. Hence it has a positive impact on the overall systemic health of an individual.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3dade581-b6e4-4023-bcc1-bc46d831623b", "title": "Climate Change and Public Health", "text": "【0】Climate Change and Public Health\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The global climate has been relatively stable for a long period. However, technological advances and urbanization have resulted in a dramatic alteration in the environment. Few natural and man-made activities have resulted in a rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gasses. These events have subsequently increased the mean global temperature and rise in sea levels. It is predicted that by the year 2100, the mean temperature will rise by 1.8 ℃ to 4 ℃. Global warmings, ozone depletion, and the greenhouse effect are significant public health challenges that need immediate attention.\n\n【2】There is sufficient scientific evidence to acknowledge a change in the climate globally. Melting ice and glaciers, rising sea levels, and increasing surface temperatures are a few examples to prove that the climate is changing considerably. These climatic changes are known to have a considerable impact on human health. Human health is closely linked to the environment they dwell in. Weather change and human health go hand-in-hand. For example, excess heat is known to cause hyperthermia; cold can cause hypothermia; vector-borne diseases, food-borne diseases, and tropical diseases are all attributed to weather change. Since most of the climatic changes are caused by man-made activities, a robust intervention is necessary to prevent catastrophic consequences.\n\n【3】What Is the Reason for the Changing Climate?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Subtle climate changes have been existing ever since the earth evolved. Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions have contributed to minimalistic changes. However, the industrial revolution and the development of the domestic economy have exacerbated the situation. Various factors that are responsible for climate change are:\n\n【5】*   Deforestation.\n\n【6】*   Burning of fossil fuels.\n\n【7】*   Industrialization.\n\n【8】*   Overfishing.\n\n【9】*   Mining.\n\n【10】*   Consumerism.\n\n【11】*   Vehicles and transportation.\n\n【12】*   Power plants.\n\n【13】These events result in the production of greenhouse gasses that trap the heat in the atmosphere resulting in global warming. Extremes of global warming have resulted in a drastic increase in air and sea temperatures, forest fires, melting of ice, deranged rainfall, severe storms, flooding, and many such calamities.\n\n【14】What Are the Health Effects of Changing Climate?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Climate change is not just an environmental issue but also a major public health concern. According to WHO, it is the biggest threat of the 21st century. Extremes of climate affect the air, water, soil, and food, thus affecting the health and well-being of the community. Principal health concerns concerning changing climate include adverse effects from a rise in atmospheric temperature (heat wave), allergic reactions, vector-induced diseases due to adverse climate, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to worsening air pollution, and contaminated food and water sources. The adverse health effect due to climate change are explained in detail below:\n\n【16】**1\\. Extreme Heat:**\n\n【17】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Heat stroke, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory diseases.\n*   **Affected Population:** Elderly, athletes, socially isolated, low-income group, with pre-existing disease.\n*   **Adaptation Measures:** Air conditioning, early warning, better forecasting.\n\n【18】**2\\. Extreme Rain, Rise in Sea-Level, Floods:**\n\n【19】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Drowning, slip and fall injuries, water-borne diseases, motor vehicle accidents, vector-borne diseases.\n*   **Affected Population:** Elderly, drivers, low socioeconomic group.\n*   **Adaptation Measures:** Public health education, sea walls, mass transit, vector control, prophylactic vaccination.\n\n【20】**3\\. Air Pollution/ Increasing Ground Level Ozone:**\n\n【21】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Respiratory disease such as asthma, COPD, allergic bronchitis and rhinitis, impaired lung.\n*   **Affected Population:** Children, elderly, immunocompromised, those with pre existing diseases.\n*   **Adaptation Measures:** Pollution control, air quality check periodically, public education, medical therapy.\n\n【22】**4\\. Drought:**\n\n【23】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Malnutrition due to food and water shortage.\n*   **Affected Population:** Affects multiple populations.\n*   **Adaptation Measures:** Public education, water treatment and medical management.\n\n【24】**5\\. Wildfire:**\n\n【25】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\n*   **Affected Population:** Affects people who have been exposed to smoke.\n*   **Adaptation Measures:** Awareness, prevention and protection.\n\n【26】**6\\. General Climate Change:**\n\n【27】*   **Associated Health Effect:** Affect mental health and cause other stress related disorders (dementia, schizophrenia, anxiety, and despair).\n*   **Affected Population:** People of all age groups.\n\n【28】Who Is at Risk for a Climate-Related Health Change?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Few individuals are at more risk for climate-related health changes. They are:\n\n【30】*   Children and infants as they are more sensitive to the minutest change in the environment. They are more susceptible to extremes of temperature and dehydration. Also, since their immune system is not fully developed, they have an increased risk of infection or contracting other illnesses.\n\n【31】*   Pregnant women and the elderly are at increased risk for heat stroke due to increased physiological demands.\n\n【32】*   Individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions have an increased risk of air pollution.\n\n【33】*   People living in rural areas are at increased risk from events such as wildfires, droughts, floods, or storms.\n\n【34】How to Stay Healthy in a Changing Climate?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Certain coping measures with temperature extremes and changing weather can prevent potential illness. They are described in detail below:\n\n【36】**Extreme Heat:**\n\n【37】*   Drink plenty of water.\n\n【38】*   Avoid sitting in the car outside for too long.\n\n【39】*   Eat fresh fruits and vegetables to keep yourself hydrated.\n\n【40】*   Air conditioning.\n\n【41】*   Regular cool showers or baths can help cool down.\n\n【42】*   Limit outdoor activities.\n\n【43】*   Wear climate-appropriate clothes.\n\n【44】**Vector-Borne Diseases:**\n\n【45】*   Use of insect repellent.\n\n【46】*   Wear loose-fitting light-colored clothes when outside.\n\n【47】*   Limit outdoor activity, particularly after sunset.\n\n【48】*   Avoid marshy areas.\n\n【49】*   Remove stagnant water.\n\n【50】*   Mosquito nets and screens at home can be more effective.\n\n【51】**Air Pollution:**\n\n【52】*   Avoid burning fossil fuels.\n\n【53】*   Use unleaded petroleum products.\n\n【54】*   Use public transportation or walk or ride a bike.\n\n【55】*   Ensure to maintain the vehicles properly\n\n【56】*   Opt for zero-emission vehicles.\n\n【57】*   Use fluorescent lights instead of energy-consuming incandescent lights.\n\n【58】*   Use products that can be recycled.\n\n【59】*   Encourage planting more trees.\n\n【60】**Conclusion:**\n\n【61】Climate change is a significant public health challenge affecting the community in myriad ways. Since human activities are primarily responsible for this drastic change, certain stringent regulations and increasing public awareness can minimize the damage. Implementing ways to limit greenhouse gas production, eating a healthy and balanced diet, avoiding junk food, and reducing the risk of systemic illness are some ways to prevent and control the health hazards associated with climate change.\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>*   Climate change and health  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/climate-change-and-health\n*   Climate Change: The Public Health Response  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253589/\n*   Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/mental\\_health\\_disorders.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This procedure is carried out in the dental office under local anesthesia. Tooth extraction is done when the tooth cannot be saved with other treatments and to prevent infection from spreading to other parts of the mouth. It is done in cases of severe tooth decay, when the tooth becomes mobile, for orthodontic treatment purposes, teeth with root caries, impacted teeth, and infections surrounding the teeth.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Tooth Extraction?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are many causes for the extraction of teeth. They are:\n\n【4】*   If the teeth are grossly decayed. That is, dental caries got severe, half of the crown got damaged, and even root canal treatment will not be successful. The teeth need to be extracted.\n\n【5】*   If the teeth are mobile, then extraction of the teeth should be done. The mobility of the teeth can be due to periodontitis or trauma. If the mobility is less, then splinting can be done. If more mobility is present, then extraction of those teeth is recommended.\n\n【6】*   If the teeth have root caries, then root canal treatment will not be successful. In that case, teeth have to be extracted.\n\n【7】*   If the crown is decayed completely and only if the root is present, that is root stumps. These root stumps can be extracted. But in rare cases, if the root stump is strong and the root pulp is safe, then root canal treatment and a crown can be placed. But it is not very successful in all patients.\n\n【8】*   If the patient has impacted teeth, then those teeth have to be removed. This kind of removal of impacted teeth involves surgical extraction and not normal extraction.\n\n【9】How to Prepare for a Tooth Extraction?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   An X-ray is taken for the teeth to be extracted. The intraoral periapical radiographs are taken and verified for any infections, the position of the teeth, and the anatomy of the roots.\n*   The patient's medical history is looked into regarding the medication and past hospitalization. Certain medication has to be stopped before extraction and should be continued one day after the extraction. The antiplatelet drugs are stopped for at least five days prior to extraction. But the medication is stopped under the supervision of the general physician and not by the patient himself or herself.\n\n【11】*   The patient should provide the details about the medication, vitamin supplements, and over-the-counter drugs. Then the patient should say if he or she has any medical condition, such as, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, bleeding disorder, thyroid disorder, hypertension, low sugar, liver disease, immune deficiency disease, and adrenal disease.\n\n【12】In case the patient has heart disease and is on medication, the patient has to stop those medicines under the supervision of a general physician. After the stoppage of the medicines, only then extraction can be done. The fitness certificate for extraction is also needed before extraction. The fitness certificate should be given by the general physician.\n\n【13】So medical conditions are important before going for extraction.\n\n【14】*   The patient should avoid smoking before tooth extraction.\n\n【15】*   The patient should also not drink alcohol on the day of the extraction.\n\n【16】*   If the infection is more, the patient will be prescribed antibiotics and painkillers before extraction.\n\n【17】*   It is always advised to come to extraction along with a family member or friend to drive home.\n\n【18】*   If the patient has a cold, then the patient is advised to come after a complete cure of the cold.\n\n【19】What Is the Procedure for a Tooth Extraction?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Dental extraction can be a simple extraction or surgical extraction. It depends on the teeth' position, patient's age, and health.\n\n【21】**Simple Extraction:**\n\n【22】A simple extraction involves the usage of local anesthesia and the removal of teeth. The local anesthesia is injected into the area of the teeth to be extracted. If the patient feels discomfort with the injection, then the local anesthetic gel or local anesthetic spray can be used before local anesthetic injection. The teeth to be extracted are luxated using elevators and removed with forceps. The usage of elevators and forceps varies from patient to patient, depending on the teeth, their mobility, and their location. The teeth are extracted, and even after the extraction, the patient may feel numbness in the surrounding tissues. This numbness will be present for around three hours. The numbness varies depending on the age and dosage.\n\n【23】**Surgical Extraction:**\n\n【24】A surgical extraction is the removal of teeth which is difficult to extract in a normal, simple extraction. The difficulty score depends on the position of the teeth and their bone coverage. If the teeth need surgical extraction, local anesthesia is usually given. If needed, sedation anesthesia and general anesthesia are given. But mostly, local anesthesia is enough for surgical extraction procedures. But general anesthesia can be used for fracture reduction procedures.\n\n【25】Local anesthesia is administered. Then vertical and relieving incisions are given. The flap is elevated, the bone is trimmed, and then the teeth are luxated and removed. The sutures are given and asked to come for review after five days and for removal of the suture after one week. The bone is trimmed in surgical extraction, which is not done in a simple extraction procedure.\n\n【26】What Are the Complications After Extraction?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The patient may feel some discomfort following extraction as follows,\n\n【28】*   Pain in the extraction socket.\n\n【29】*   Swelling around the extraction socket.\n\n【30】*   Numbness in the injected region.\n\n【31】*   Difficulties in opening the mouth.\n\n【32】*   Difficulties in closing the mouth.\n\n【33】*   Fever associated with pain.\n\n【34】*   Bleeding for more than 20 minutes.\n\n【35】*   Dry socket formation.\n\n【36】What Are the Instructions Given After a Tooth Extraction?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   The patient is advised to bite the cotton for one hour. Then the patient can dispose of the cotton. He or she can take a soft diet like curd rice and then take medicines.\n\n【38】*   The patient is advised not to spit saliva for one day.\n\n【39】*   He or she should avoid sleeping on that side.\n\n【40】*   The patient should not touch the socket area with the tongue or finger. The patient can brush their teeth softly.\n\n【41】*   The patient is advised not to smoke for three days.\n\n【42】*   The patient is advised not to lift heavy weights.\n\n【43】*   The patient should not use a straw for drinking any juice.\n\n【44】*   If the patient experiences any kind of swelling or other complications, they can visit the dentist.\n\n【45】*   The patient can give ice packs for around 2 minutes thrice a day extra orally.\n\n【46】*   The medicines usually prescribed are an antibiotic tablet for three to five days, twice a day, and a pain killer thrice a day for three to five days, along with a proton pump inhibitor tablet twice a day for three to five days. These proton pump inhibitors are taken before food.\n\n【47】The healing takes place within seven to 14 days for normal extraction and an average of 15 to 30 days for surgical extraction. But the healing periods vary according to the health of the patient, including diabetes, hemoglobin, and many factors. Generally, the socket will heal within 15 days. But the patient can wait till one month to replace the extracted teeth.\n\n【48】Conclusion:\n-----------\n\n【49】In spite of the fact that permanent teeth are meant to last a lifetime, there are various reasons for getting them extracted. It normally takes a few days to recover after tooth extraction. Following all the instructions given by the dentist aids in better and quick healing.\n\n【50】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【51】* * *\n\n【52】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Expected Recovery Time Following a Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【53】Usually, it takes around five to seven days to recover and the tissues to heal after tooth extraction. Doctors typically prescribe pain-relieving medications that help to reduce the pain and antibiotic medications to prevent infections at the extraction site. Drugs also help in faster healing and shorten recovery time.\n\n【54】#### **2.**删除换行**What Are the Precautions Needed After a Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【55】Here are some precautions one can take after a tooth extraction:  \n\\- Hold the cotton swab at the extraction site for 45 minutes.  \n\\- Avoid spitting out or sucking action for at least 24 hours after the extraction.  \n\\- Avoid brushing the next day, and gently start brushing your teeth a day after the tooth extraction.  \n\\- One must avoid eating or chewing hard foods.   \n\\- Refrain from consuming hot and spicy foods.  \n\\- One must try to eat soft foods.  \n\\- Avoid drinking liquids from a straw and use a glass instead.  \n\\- Avoid sleeping on the side of the extraction. \n\n【56】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Duration of a Tooth Extraction Procedure?**\n\n【57】Whether the tooth extraction is surgical or not, tooth extractions can be quick, ranging from a few minutes or may take a few hours, depending on the tooth's complexity, anatomy, and condition. For example, non-surgical tooth extractions may take about 15 to 20 minutes on average, whereas surgical removal of the tooth may take up to 45 minutes. \n\n【58】#### **4.**删除换行**Does Tooth Removal Require Surgery?**\n\n【59】Depending on the severity, tooth extraction may be surgical (requires surgical procedure under local anesthesia) or non-surgical.The extraction is done surgically if the tooth is stuck inside. Surgical tooth extraction involves pushing the gums aside and cutting the bone or part of the tooth to remove it altogether. However, a well-erupted tooth may be removed non-surgically.\n\n【60】#### **5.**删除换行**What Should One Avoid After A Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【61】One must carefully follow the instructions for post-tooth extraction to avoid post-extraction complications. One must avoid   \n\\- Spitting out for the next 24 hours.   \n\\- Eat hard-textured foods.  \n\\- Hot and spicy foods.  \n\\- Using a straw.  \n\\- Keep touching the extraction socket with the tongue.  \n\\- Sleeping on the side of the extraction site.\n\n【62】#### **6.**删除换行**What Should One Eat After Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【63】Dentists usually recommend eating anything cold, such as ice cream or curd, 45 minutes after the extraction procedure. This acts as a cold pack at the extraction site to prevent and stop bleeding from the extraction site. Following this, dentists also recommend having a liquid or soft diet that can be easily swallowed and does not require much chewing for the next three to four days or until comfortable. It is recommended to avoid eating anything hot and spicy for a few days as it may irritate the delicate tissues, which are already traumatized after the extraction and may cause pain and burning sensations.\n\n【64】#### **7.**删除换行**How Long Does Post-extraction Pain Last?**\n\n【65】Post-extraction pain and swelling may occur after the tooth extraction, which may last a few days to a week. Usually, dentists prescribe pain-relieving medications to reduce pain and swelling. This helps the patient to become more comfortable without any pain.\n\n【66】#### **8.**删除换行**Can One Drink Water After Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【67】Dentists usually instruct to avoid drinking water at least one hour after the tooth extraction. The blood clot formed at the extraction site may get dislodged and lead to a dry socket (post-extraction complication). However, one can drink sips of water one hour after the tooth extraction.\n\n【68】#### **9.**删除换行**What Makes a Tooth Extraction Heal Faster?**\n\n【69】Maintaining oral hygiene, avoiding strenuous or heavy activity workouts, and taking the necessary precautions after tooth extraction helps the tooth extraction socket to heal faster. Failing to take the required precautions may hamper healing and cause more suffering.\n\n【70】#### **10.**删除换行**How Does a Dentist Remove a Tooth?**\n\n【71】A dentist performs a tooth extraction procedure by first injecting local anesthesia at the tooth site to be removed. Following this, the dentist starts with loosening the tooth by pushing aside the gums and carefully cutting the periodontal ligaments surrounding the tooth. After this, the dentist slowly loosens the tooth and removes it with the help of forceps. For surgical removal of the tooth, the dentist performs the same procedure. However, it may also involve cutting the bone and other tissues to remove the tooth. \n\n【72】#### **11.**删除换行**Can One Exercise After Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【73】Dentists recommend avoiding heavy workout activities and strenuous exercises for at least three to four days after the tooth extraction. Any strenuous activity may exert pressure at the extraction site and cause more bleeding.\n\n【74】#### **12.**删除换行**How Should One Sleep After Tooth Extraction?**\n\n【75】Doctors and dentists recommend sleeping on the side opposite of extraction. However, one must avoid sleeping on the side of the tooth extraction as it may exert pressure on the extraction site and cause bleeding and pain. Also, feel more pressure on the same side when they get up the following day. This may hamper the healing process and delay wound healing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "72febdb0-7a23-4e0b-b618-be6aa539d8b6", "title": "Artificial Lung - An Insight", "text": "【0】Artificial Lung - An Insight\nWhat Are Artificial Lungs?\n--------------------------\n\n【1】Artificial lungs, also referred to as mechanical lungs or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems, are medical devices designed so that, for a short time, they replace or support the role of natural lungs in individuals with respiratory failure to a great extent. They provide oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal, performing the functions that healthy lungs usually perform.\n\n【2】What Are The Two Categories Of Artificial Lungs?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)**: ECMO is a technique that provides both cardiac and respiratory support for a short period by taking over the roles of the heart and lungs. It involves expelling blood from the body, passing it through a membrane oxygenator (artificial lung), and oxygenated blood is returned back into the patient's bloodstream. ECMO can be utilized in both adults and children and can be configured for both short-term and long-term use.\n\n【4】*   **Intracorporeal Artificial Lung:** This type of artificial lung is created to be implanted directly into the patient's body. The working capacity is releasing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen to the bloodstream, bypassing the damaged or non-functioning lungs. Intracorporeal artificial lungs are typically utilized as a bridge to lung transplantation or as a support device for individuals with chronic lung conditions.\n\n【5】Artificial lungs are complicated devices, and there is a requirement for careful monitoring and management by a professional medical team. They are utilized in intensive care units or specialized medical centers where highly trained professionals can oversee their operations. The goal of artificial lungs is to provide adequate oxygenation and expulsion of carbon dioxide from the blood, which allows the individual's organs to function while their lungs heal or a suitable donor organ becomes available for transplantation.\n\n【6】What Are The Parts Of The Artificial Lungs?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   **Oxygenator:** The oxygenator is a crucial part that performs roles like a gas exchange, taking in oxygen from an external source, and expulsion of carbon dioxide from the patient's blood. It comprises a series of hollow fibers or membranes through which gas and blood flow in counter-current directions, which allows for the efficient transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the membrane.\n\n【8】*   **Pump:** Artificial lungs consist of a pump to circulate the patient's blood through the system. The pump is responsible for maintaining adequate blood flow and pressure, ensuring oxygenated blood is delivered to the patient's body. Several categories of pumps can be used, like centrifugal pumps or roller pumps.\n\n【9】*   **Cannulas:** These are tubes that enhance the connection between the patient's blood vessels and the artificial lung system. Cannulas are mostly inserted into major blood vessels, like the jugular vein or femoral artery and vein, to facilitate the flow of blood to and from the system.\n\n【10】*   **Filters:** Filters are incorporated into the artificial lung system to expel any potential clots or debris from the blood. These filters are helpful to ensure the system remains free of blockages and prevent any adverse effects on the patient.\n\n【11】*   **Control and Monitoring Systems:** Artificial lungs are equipped with control systems that are helpful to regulate the flow rates, pressures, and gas concentrations within the system. These systems involve sensors, valves, and electronic controls to maintain optimal conditions and provide real-time monitoring of various parameters.\n\n【12】*   **Heat Exchange:** To sustain the temperature of the blood, artificial lungs often incorporate a heat exchanger. These components are helpful to warm or cool the blood as necessary, ensuring it remains within the desired temperature range.\n\n【13】*   **Tubing and Connectors:** Various tubing and connectors are utilized to establish the necessary connections between the different components of the artificial lung system, including the oxygenator, pump, cannulas, and filters.\n\n【14】What Are The Benefits Of Artificial Lungs?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   **Life Support:** Artificial lungs, for a short term, replace the function of damaged or diseased lungs that provide life support to patients with adverse respiratory failure. They oxygenate blood and remove carbon dioxide, helping to sustain adequate oxygen levels and prevent organ damage.\n\n【16】*   **Help to Recover:** In cases where a patient's lungs are damaged for a short duration due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other conditions, artificial lungs can act as a bridge to recovery. By allowing the patient's lungs to rest and heal, artificial lungs provide temporary respiratory support until the medical condition improves.\n\n【17】*   **Bridge to Transplant:** Artificial lungs can serve as a bridge to lung transplantation for individuals waiting for a suitable donor organ. These devices are helpful in maintaining oxygenation and ventilation while patients are on the transplant waiting period, potentially improving their chances of survival until a transplant becomes available.\n\n【18】*   **Lung Function Assessment:** Artificial lungs can be used in clinical research and medical training to assess lung function and test new treatment approaches. By replicating the gas exchange process outside the body, researchers can evaluate the performance of different interventions or study the effects of certain diseases on lung function.\n\n【19】*   **Portable Respiratory Support:** Some artificial lung devices are created to be portable, enabling patients with chronic respiratory conditions, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to maintain mobility and engage in daily activities while receiving adequate respiratory support.\n\n【20】*   **Reduced Complications:** Artificial lungs can help relieve the risk of certain complications associated with traditional mechanical ventilation. By providing more gentle and precise oxygenation and ventilation, these devices can decrease the incidence of lung damage, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and other ventilator-related complications.\n\n【21】While artificial lungs offer benefits, they are typically utilized in critical care settings and require close monitoring and expertise to ensure safe and effective usage.\n\n【22】What Are The Side Effects Of Artificial Lungs?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The side effect is barotrauma, which occurs when the pressure delivered by the ventilator is very high and can cause damage to the lung tissue. Another complication is ventilator-associated pneumonia, where the breathing tube or the device itself is suitable for the growth of bacteria, leading to lung infection. The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation can result in muscle weakness and atrophy due to reduced physical activity.\n\n【24】Other side effects are airway damage, like tracheal or bronchial injury, and the development of blood clots due to immobility. Some patients may experience discomfort or pain associated with the insertion of the breathing tube. There is the constant presence of the machine and the need for invasive procedures can lead to psychological distress, anxiety, or depression.\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】The specific configuration and components of artificial lungs vary depending on the intended use and design of the system. The newer advancements and technologies may introduce additional features or modifications to enhance performance and patient care. These side effects can vary depending on the individual, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the underlying health conditions. The physician closely monitors patients on ventilators to minimize these risks and provide appropriate care.\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>*   Artificial lung basics  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3082030/\n*   The promise of microfluidic artificial lungs  \n    https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/lc/c4lc00828f\n*   Multicenter team seeks to create at-home artificial lung system  \n    https://news.vumc.org/2022/02/16/multicenter-team-seeks-to-create-at-home-artificial-lung-system/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These are the infections that are caught in the hospital. It is caused due to an infection or toxin existing in a particular site like a hospital or any healthcare setting. Healthcare-associated infections and hospital-acquired infections are interchangeably used with nosocomial infections. The characteristic of these HAIs is that the patient might not have had the infection before they underwent medical care. The intensive care unit (ICU), where the most critical patients are treated, is where these infections are acquired most commonly. The incidence is 1 in 10 admitted patients. They also have an association with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost of the hospital.\n\n【2】The HAIs cases are known to grow with more complex medical care and treatment and an increase in antibiotic resistance. Though it is common, it can still be prevented.\n\n【3】What Are the Commonly Occurring Healthcare-Associated Infections?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The following are the most common types of infections:\n\n【5】*   **Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTIs) -** This type of HAIs spread from urinary catheters used to drain urine in hospital settings.\n\n【6】*   **Surgical Site Infection -**.These infections occur near or on surgical wounds. These infections can be present as simple skin infections that may or may not go deeper into tissues or organs.\n\n【7】*   **Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)-** This type of HAI spread from ventilators used in the hospital to help a person breathe. The tube of ventilators can carry bacteria into the lungs and cause infection.\n\n【8】*   **Central Line-associated Bloodstream, Infection (CLABSI) -** It spreads from the central line placed in the hospital settings that can carry viruses or bacteria and spread infections.\n\n【9】*   **Sepsis -** It is a fatal and life-threatening medical emergency due to the body’s extreme response to severe infections acquired from hospital settings.\n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Healthcare-Associated Infections?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The specific time period for an infection to occur in cases of HAIs are as follows:\n\n【12】*   Up to 48 hours after getting admitted to the hospital.\n\n【13】*   Within three days of getting discharged.\n\n【14】*   Within 30 days of undergoing an operation or surgery.\n\n【15】*   In a hospital or healthcare facility where the patient was admitted for management of disease other than infection.\n\n【16】The symptoms of HAIs vary depending on the type. The patient may have the following signs and symptoms:\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>Pneumonia in Lung Cancer- Causes, Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>Influenza Vaccine for the 2022-2023 Season: An Overview</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fever.\n\n【22】*   Cough.\n\n【23】*   Dyspnea.\n\n【24】*   Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath.\n\n【25】*   Discharge from a wound.\n\n【26】*   Headache.\n\n【27】*   Burning sensation or irritation while urinating.\n\n【28】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【29】*   Nausea.\n\n【30】*   Vomiting.\n\n【31】*   Inflammation or rashes at the site of infection.\n    </u>\n\n【32】Patients developing symptoms during their stay in the hospital may have pain and discomfort. Most of the patients become symptomatic.\n\n【33】How Are Healthcare-Associated Infections Caused?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】It is caused by microorganisms which can be bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The prevalence of bacterial infections is the highest and ranges to about 90 %. The hospital stay makes the patients immunocompromised, and thus, they get more prone to develop these infections.\n\n【35】The following are the bacteria that may cause infections:\n\n【36】*   Staphylococcus aureus may cause blood infections.\n\n【37】*   Escherichia coli can cause urinary tract infections.\n\n【38】*   Enterococci may lead to the urinary tract, blood, or wound infections.\n\n【39】*   Pseudomonas aeruginosa may lead to respiratory or kidney infections and urinary tract infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest prevalence of 11 percent and high mortality and morbidity rates.\n\n【40】How Are Healthcare-Associated Infections Transmitted?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】The main mode of transmission is person-to-person contact via unclean hands and medical instruments or hospital tools like catheters, respiratory machines, etc. Excessive and improper use of antibiotics may make the bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics, leading to HAIs.\n\n【42】**Are There Any Risk Factors for Healthcare-Associated Infections?**\n\n【43】The major risk factor is hospital admission. Hence, proper precautions are necessary. Apart from that, the following may also cause infections:\n\n【44】1.  Elderly, especially individuals above the age of 70 years.\n\n【45】2.  An adjacent patient or hospital roommate is infected.\n\n【46】3.  A prolonged period of antibiotic usage.\n\n【47】4.  Stay in the ICU for a long period.\n\n【48】5.  Coma patients.\n\n【49】6.  Urinary catheter usage.\n\n【50】7.  Patients who have experienced a shock.\n\n【51】8.  Immunocompromised patients.\n\n【52】9.  Injury, wound, or trauma patients.\n\n【53】How Can Healthcare-Associated Infections Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】The main method of diagnosis depends on signs and symptoms along with their past histories, like any association with risk factors or recent hospitalization. Any infection present before hospitalization is not categorized under HAIs but is necessary to mention it to the physician so that any severity of the infection can be known. Sometimes, the physician may also ask the person to undergo a blood or urine test to diagnose the condition.\n\n【55】How Can Healthcare-Associated Infections Be Treated?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Most of the patients are managed conservatively. The doctor treats the patient depending on the type of infection and causative organism. Most of the time, the person will be prescribed medications, bed rest, and adequate fluid intake. The medications are decided to depend on the type of causative organism and the level of resistance to a certain antibiotic. If the cause is an external medical tool like the catheters, it will be removed. A healthy diet is also prescribed.\n\n【57】**What Is the Prognosis of Healthcare-Associated Infections?**\n\n【58】The prognosis is good for most of the patients with medical treatment and bed rest. But, in some cases, it can progress to serious complications which can prove to be life-threatening. Although it poses less risk in most situations, it is important to follow all the prevention measures.\n\n【59】How Can Healthcare-Associated Infections Be Prevented?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】The healthcare facilities are responsible for first-hand preventive measures. They have to make proper guidelines for sterilization and disinfection and follow them. Proper preventive measures can prevent the infection by 70 %, but it is not practically possible to prevent 100 % of the infection.\n\n【61】Following are the preventive measures that can be followed:\n\n【62】1.  ICU (intensive care unit) screening to decide on the isolation of the affected patients.\n\n【63】2.  Proper sterilization and disinfection.\n\n【64】3.  Wearing proper protective gear, gloves, footwear, masks, etc.\n\n【65】4.  Hand hygiene is very important. Using sanitizers and handwashing are important.\n\n【66】5.  Surface cleaning.\n\n【67】6.  Well-ventilated rooms are necessary.\n\n【68】The risk of urinary tract infections can be minimized by the healthcare worker using the following measures:\n\n【69】1.  Following aseptic conditions.\n\n【70】2.  Changing catheters only when required.\n\n【71】3.  Inserting catheters only when required and the same for removal.\n\n【72】4.  Keeping a closed drainage system.\n\n【73】If a person has any concerns, they can talk to their physician.\n\n【74】**Conclusion**\n\n【75】Hospital-acquired infections or nosocomial infections are common but can be managed and prevented. Online medical platforms have made it easier to talk to a physician or a specialist regarding concerns about this condition or any medical issue. Ask a specialist to know more.\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>*   Nosocomial infections: Epidemiology, prevention, control and surveillance  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2221169116309509\n*   Preventing Healthcare-associated Infections  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/hai/prevent/prevention.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

While pads are worn on underwear, menstrual cups, and tampons go inside the vagina. Some women feel wearing a tampon is convenient as it is out of the way and cannot be felt, unlike sanitary pads. However, many women wonder whether sleeping with a tampon is safe or not.\n\n【2】What Are Tampons?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Tampons are small plugs of cotton that fit inside the vagina and soak up menstrual blood. While tampons can be inserted directly into the vagina, some come with an applicator that helps place the tampon. Tampons usually have a string attached at the end, making it easier to pull them out when the need arises.\n\n【4】Is It Safe to Sleep With a Tampon Overnight?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Sleeping with a tampon overnight is more comfortable than wearing a sanitary pad. However, sometimes sleeping with a tampon for longer periods can be as risky similar to sleeping with contact lenses. Normally, sleeping wearing a tampon is considered safe unless the sleep duration is more than eight hours. Sleeping with a tampon for more than eight hours increases the chance of toxic shock syndrome, a rare but deadly condition requiring prompt medical attention.\n\n【6】What Is Toxic Shock Syndrome?\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication caused by certain types of bacteria that produce toxins. Usually, toxic shock syndrome is caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, but it can also be caused by toxins of group A Streptococcus bacteria. The toxins enter the bloodstream and affect organs like the heart, kidneys, or liver. The risk factors for this condition include surgery, skin wounds, use of tampons, contraceptive sponges, or menstrual cups.\n\n【8】How Is Sleeping With a Tampon Associated With Toxic Shock Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Even though Staphylococcus aureus is naturally present on the skin and in the nose, when it overgrows, it can give rise to infections. The infections usually begin through an opening or cut in the skin. Even though experts are not entirely sure of how tampons give rise to toxic shock syndrome, there is a possibility that tampons attract bacteria as they provide a moist and warm environment. The tampons provide the ideal environment for the bacteria to grow, thereby encouraging the overproduction of both bad and good bacteria.\n\n【10】The bacteria enter the body through the microscopic scratches present in the vagina that may be caused by the fibers in the tampons. The risk of toxic shock syndrome is higher with high-absorbency tampons as it absorbs the natural mucus of the vagina more, dries it out, and increases the chances of making small tears in the vaginal walls that attract more bacteria to enter the body.\n\n【11】What Symptoms Following Tampon Usage Require Medical Attention?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Anyone using tampons should contact a doctor if they observe the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome. They are as follows:\n\n【13】*   Fever and chills.\n\n【14】*   Sore throat.\n\n【15】*   Muscle aches and headaches.\n\n【16】*   Dizziness and disorientation.\n\n【17】*   Skin redness and rashes resembling a sunburn.\n\n【18】*   Stomach pain.\n\n【19】*   Vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n【20】*   Low blood pressure, particularly after standing.\n\n【21】*   Hallucinations.\n\n【22】*   Irritability and confusion.\n\n【23】*   Eye redness resembles conjunctivitis.\n\n【24】*   Skin peeling on the soles of feet and palms of the hands.\n\n【25】*   Seizures.\n\n【26】What Are the Guidelines for Using Tampons Overnight?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Using a tampon overnight is safe when done under the following guidelines:\n\n【28】*   A new tampon should be put in right before going to bed.\n\n【29】*   The tampon worn at night should be proportionate to the heaviness of the menstrual flow.\n\n【30】*   The tampon with the right absorbency should be picked according to the blood flow. Heavy absorbency tampons should be used only when the blood flow is heavy.\n\n【31】How to Prevent Toxic Shock Syndrome Associated With Tampon Usage?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has laid out a few safety recommendations to help people prevent the chances of developing toxic shock syndrome while using tampons. They are as follows:\n\n【33】*   Every tampon comes with instructions from the manufacturer. Hence, instructions should be read carefully to make sure that tampons are being used correctly.\n\n【34】*   As toxic shock syndrome is a bacterial infection, hands should be washed properly before inserting a tampon. This can reduce the chances of spreading bacteria.\n\n【35】*   Tampons are designed for women to use during their periods. Hence, they should not be used at times other than periods.\n\n【36】*   Tampons should be changed every four to eight hours, depending on the flow. Wearing a tampon for more than eight hours is linked with toxic shock syndrome. Hence, setting the alarm before going to bed while wearing a tampon helps with remembering to remove it before eight hours pass.\n\n【37】*   As high-absorbency tampons increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome. FDA recommends the use of the lowest absorbency needed for the flow. If the tampon does not saturate within eight hours of wear, it is an indicator to switch to a tampon with lower absorbency.\n\n【38】*   FDA recommends only single-use tampons. Using a tampon more than one time or purchasing reusable tampons should be avoided.\n\n【39】What Are the Alternatives for Tampons?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【40】In case of sleeping for more than eight hours or to reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome, certain menstrual hygiene options can be adopted instead of tampons. They are as follows:\n\n【41】*   Disposable menstrual pads.\n\n【42】*   Menstrual underwear or period underwear.\n\n【43】*   Menstrual cups.\n\n【44】*   Menstrual discs.\n\n【45】*   Reusable menstrual pads which consist of layers of washable fabrics.\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】While it is safe to sleep with a tampon for less than eight hours, care should be taken to change the tampons every eight hours to decrease the risk of toxic shock syndrome. Since chances of developing toxic shock syndrome are very rare, tampons can be used at night by following the manufacturer’s directions and FDA guidelines. Any symptoms of toxic shock syndrome should be reported immediately to the doctor as it can progress rapidly and affect all parts of the body. As every menstrual hygiene option has its advantages and disadvantages, it is each person’s personal choice to choose the right option that suits them best.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Can You Sleep With a Tampon In?  \n    https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-faqs/can-you-sleep-with-a-tampon-in\n*   The Facts on Tampons—and How to Use Them Safely  \n    https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/facts-tampons-and-how-use-them-safely\n*   How do I use tampons, pads, period underwear, and menstrual cups?  \n    https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/health-and-wellness/menstruation/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A multidisciplinary team approach is required in both hospital and long-term care facilities to improve the results of treatment in such patients.\n\n【2】What Are the Common ENT Disorders in Children?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The common ENT (ear, nose, and throat) disorders in children in which new trends in rehabilitation have been included are:\n\n【4】**1\\. Chronic Rhinosinusitis:**\n\n【5】Rhinosinusitis is a condition that is common in both adults and children. The symptoms last for more than three months. Acute rhinosinusitis is treated with antibiotics, mostly Amoxicillin; other options are Clavulanate and Cephalosporin. In case of allergy, Azithromycin is given. In cases where medical therapy is not successful, and the patient has a chronic or recurrent condition, the underlying medical condition is evaluated.\n\n【6】Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is used for removing polys and polypoid mucosa. After surgery, follow-ups are initiated, which may last for a year, and are performed with nasal endoscopy and by assessment of breathing spaces, nasal secretion, and sinusotomy patency. All children with the condition are subject to allergy tests, and in chronic recurrent cases, immunodeficiency tests are done.\n\n【7】**2\\. Choanal Atresia:**\n\n【8】Choanal Atresia is one of the most frequent congenital nasal defects that causes obstruction of the posterior nasal choanae, and in half of the cases, it occurs bilaterally. The condition is mostly associated with genetic syndromes.\n\n【9】The main treatment option for the condition is surgical intervention. But an endonasal endoscopic approach is less invasive and safest in terms of compliance. The most common complication of choanal atresia surgery is restenosis. The adjuvant measures used to reduce restenosis risk are nasal stenting, balloon dilatation, and mitomycin C. Stentless endoscopic repair is also available in recent times.\n\n【10】**3\\. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea:**\n\n【11】Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by partial or complete airway obstruction. Adenotonsillectomy is the first therapeutic option in the treatment of the condition. In addition to surgery and medical therapy, rehabilitation is also required in such patients. Neuromuscular and myofunctional therapy are required in such cases.\n\n【12】**4\\. Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis:**\n\n【13】Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis is a rare viral infection. These occur as single and multiple lesions in the glottic region, which extends to the tracheobronchial tree and lungs. The aim of treatment is the maintenance of adequate airway patency to avoid tracheostomy.\n\n【14】How Is Breathing Rehabilitation Done in Children With Laryngotracheal Axis Stenosis?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Laryngotracheal axis stenosis (obstruction of the upper airway between the trachea and larynx) is caused in children mainly due to the following conditions:\n\n【16】*   Vocal cord paralysis.\n\n【17】*   Tracheal stenosis (abnormal narrowing or constriction of the airway).\n\n【18】*   Tracheomalacia (a genetic central airway anomaly).\n\n【19】*   Laryngomalacia (a congenital defect that results in the collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration).\n\n【20】Nowadays, breathing rehabilitation is used in children for mucus removal from the airway and for improving pulmonary function.\n\n【21】The different techniques used are:\n\n【22】*   Forced expiratory technique.\n\n【23】*   Compressions.\n\n【24】*   Cough.\n\n【25】*   Positive expiratory pressure.\n\n【26】*   Physical exercise.\n\n【27】*   Aerosol and nasal unblocking.\n\n【28】*   Autogenic drainage.\n\n【29】The main goal of breathing rehabilitation is to remove airway secretion in cases where the physiological mechanisms (like a cough) are ineffective.\n\n【30】What Are the New Trends in the Pediatric Tracheostomy and Laryngotracheal Reconstruction?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure by which an opening is made in the trachea, which aids in breathing. In children, tracheostomy is mainly indicated in cases of airway obstruction rather than in infective cases. After tracheostomy, each child is assessed for deglutition and phonation.\n\n【32】A multidisciplinary approach involving the medical, surgical, and rehabilitative teams is required for the management of breathing and swallowing difficulties in children after the laryngotracheal reconstruction procedure. The rehabilitation program, in such cases, takes into consideration both swallowing function and respiratory function, including weaning from the tracheal cannula.\n\n【33】How Is Voice Rehabilitation in Pediatrics Done?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The voice craft method is characterized by vocal maneuvers that help develop control over the individual muscle group with the vocal mechanism. The training consists of thirteen training exercises. Each exercise is used to gain control of a specific structure of the vocal mechanism. Six voice qualities which include twang, opera, sob, speech, falsetto, and belting, are used for voice production control. Proprioceptive-Elastic Voice Rehabilitation Program (PROEL) is used for obtaining muscle relaxation and elasticity through unstable balance, body movement, and facilitating postures.\n\n【35】What Is Music Rehabilitation in Children With Cochlear Implants?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Music involvement helps children in improving their social interaction and self-expression. It helps in relieving stress that some children encounter during language training. The three cardinal elements of music are melody, rhythm, and timbre. Of these, the rhythm sensation is found to be similar in ones with normal hearing and ones with a hearing disorder.\n\n【37】Cochlear-implanted kids can usually recognize familiar songs from memory but show poorer performance when compared to children with normal hearing. In most cases, music acts as a motivational tool for positive behavior. Music helps in breaking social barriers and help in removing fear due to hearing loss.\n\n【38】Music therapy, in combination with speech therapy, has the following benefits:\n\n【39】*   Development of auditory skills.\n\n【40】*   Development of good listening habits.\n\n【41】*   Development of sequential memory.\n\n【42】*   Improves voice quality.\n\n【43】*   Improves speech rhythm.\n\n【44】*   Development of suprasegmental language elements.\n\n【45】What Is Aural Atresia Rehabilitation?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【46】Aural atresia is a condition in which a patent ear canal is absent. Patients with atresia on both sides are provided with BAHI (Bone Anchored Hearing Implant) or a bone conduction hearing aid. After age eight, canalplasty is the treatment of choice. Hearing rehabilitation aids patients with atresia. The choices include softband BAHI, percutaneous BAHI, canalplasty, bone conduction hearing aid, and bonebridge. Early identification and management are important for long-term success.\n\n【47】**Conclusion**\n\n【48】Rehabilitation of pediatric patients with disorders of speech and language, hearing and communication, voice disorders, swallowing difficulties, and breathing difficulties is not widely available in both hospitals and long-term care centers. Even the technicians and physicians needed for such programs are inadequate in most countries. A multidisciplinary team for the rehabilitation of pediatric patients with ENT disorders in specialized third-level centers is very much needed.\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pediatric ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat)  \n    https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/pediatrics/pediatric-ent\n*   New trends in rehabilitation of children with ENT disorders  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5720863/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "27df4edc-7816-4fe7-b9c1-d2d3cdc929b0", "title": "Stillbirth and Neonatal Death - Types and Causes", "text": "【0】Stillbirth and Neonatal Death - Types and Causes\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Numerous infants pass away shortly after delivery; most of these deaths occur in the first four weeks of life, known as neonatal deaths. A stillbirth occurs when a baby dies or is lost before, during, or after birth. Although both terms for pregnancy loss - miscarriage and stillbirth - differ depending on when the loss happens, stillbirth is defined in the United States as the loss of a child at or after the 20th week of pregnancy. In contrast, a miscarriage is typically described as the loss of a child before the 20th week of pregnancy. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths have different causes and contributing factors than post neonatal and child deaths.\n\n【2】What Are Stillbirth and Neonatal Death?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Regardless of the length of pregnancy, stillbirth or fetal death occurs before the fetus is fully expelled or extracted from the mother. This type of death is indicated by the fact that the fetus does not breathe or display any other signs of life after this separation, such as the heartbeat, the pulsing of the umbilical cord, or the definite movement of the voluntary muscles. The neonatal period begins with birth and ends 28 complete days after birth. A neonatal death (also called a newborn death) is when a baby dies during the first 28 days of life. Most neonatal deaths happen in the first week after birth.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Stillbirth and Neonatal Death?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Based on the duration, the different types of stillbirth and neonatal death are\n\n【6】*   **Early Neonatal Death -** When a death occurs during the first week of life.\n\n【7】*   **Late Neonatal Death -** Death occurring after seven days but before the 28th day of life.\n\n【8】*   **Early Stillbirth -** Fetal death occurs between 20 and 27 weeks of completed pregnancy.\n\n【9】*   **Late Stillbirth -** Death occurring between 28 and 36 weeks of completed pregnancy.\n\n【10】*   **Term Stillbirth -** Death occurring between 36 and more weeks of completed pregnancy.\n\n【11】What Are the Risk Factors of Stillbirth?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【12】Families of all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and women of all ages, experience stillbirth. However, some populations are more likely to experience a stillbirth, including women who:\n\n【13】*   are of the black race.\n*   are 35 years of age or older.\n\n【14】*   are of low socioeconomic status.\n\n【15】*   smoke cigarettes during pregnancy.\n\n【16】*   have certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n【17】*   have multiple pregnancies, such as triplets or quadruplets.\n\n【18】*   have had a previous pregnancy loss.\n\n【19】This does not imply that every one of black ethnicity or older is more likely to experience a stillbirth. The discrepancies in mothers' preconception health, socioeconomic position, access to high-quality medical treatment, and stress are a few factors that may be responsible for these stillbirth differences. More investigation is required to ascertain the underlying cause of some of these factors associated with stillbirths. Numerous elements have also been linked to other unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth.\n\n【20】What Are the Causes of Stillbirth and Neonatal Death?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The common causes of stillbirth and neonatal death are\n\n【22】*   Poor maternal health.\n\n【23】*   Mother’s nutritional status at the time of pregnancy.\n\n【24】*   Early childbearing.\n\n【25】*   Pregnancy and child-related complications.\n\n【26】*   Prolonged pregnancy.\n\n【27】*   Maternal infections like malaria, syphilis, and HIV.\n\n【28】*   Maternal conditions like hypertension and diabetes.\n\n【29】*   Fetal growth restriction - When an unborn child is smaller than it should be because it cannot reach its growth potential.\n\n【30】*   Neonatal tetanus.\n\n【31】*   Prolonged labor or prolonged rupture of membranes causes infections in both mothers and babies.\n\n【32】*   Poor hygiene during delivery.\n\n【33】*   Improper management of complications during delivery.\n\n【34】*   Birth asphyxia and trauma.\n\n【35】*   Preterm birth and malformations.\n\n【36】What Is Perinatal Mortality?\n----------------------------\n\n【37】There are numerous common causes and causes of neonatal deaths and stillbirths. The phrase \"perinatal mortality\" has been used to refer to deaths that could be connected to obstetric occurrences, such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths within the first week of life. The perinatal mortality index is crucial in giving the knowledge required to enhance the health of expectant mothers, new moms, and infants. Decision-makers can use this data to pinpoint issues, analyze discrepancies and trends over time and space, and evaluate adjustments to public health policy and practice. The quality of obstetric and pediatric care that is accessible is also reflected in perinatal mortality, which is a significant indicator of maternal care, maternal health, and nutrition. Birth results are influenced mainly by social variables, although quality medical treatment becomes more important as societies develop.\n\n【38】**What Are the Sources of Neonatal and Perinatal Mortality Data?**\n\n【39】Vital registration, sample registration, or community studies can be used to get information on live births and infant mortality rates. In contrast, mortality statistics or community studies can provide information on stillbirths. Unfortunately, each of these sources is prone to underreporting. Following are some observations of familiar data sources' qualities, inherent restrictions, and the impact of underreporting.\n\n【40】*   **Vital and Mortality Statistics -** Reporting vital occurrences refer to the results of live births, such as the delivery and death of a baby or the death later in life. Despite being widely acknowledged, many nations do not rely on birth registration on WHO standards. Countries may have different legal definitions from those advised by the WHO for some events, such as live birth, stillbirth, or infant death. Additionally, the requirements for registering births differ by country and by event, as does the deadline for registering an event.\n\n【41】*   **Survey Data -** The accuracy with which births and deaths are reported determines the validity of mortality estimates derived from prospective and retrospective birth or pregnancy histories gathered in community studies. Infant deaths that happen extremely early in infancy tend to be more underreported, including age at death, recollection accuracy, and completeness, which may decline over time. Women are questioned about the results of their pregnancies in the 60 months before the survey, which is the primary data source for developing nations. The proposed WHO standards are challenging to follow because menstrual cycles are unpredictable, newborns are frequently not weighed at delivery, and women may not have records to rely on.\n\n【42】*   **Hospital Data -** Unless all babies are born in a medical facility, hospital studies are an inappropriate data source for determining mortality incidence.\n\n【43】*   **Underreporting -** Underreporting is still an issue, particularly concerning stillbirths and premature deaths. Statistics on stillbirths are more likely to be underreported since they are less commonly available than data on fatalities after birth. Stillbirth data are less reliable and available in fewer countries than early neonatal and death data. Births and deaths must be accurately reported and recorded for data to be considered reliable. Both the mother and the recording device can be at blame for underreporting and misclassification, which are frequent occurrences. Underreporting might be done to avoid a laborious registration process, especially in the case of early death, or it might be done because the person is unaware of the requirements. It might also have to do with obstacles, such as paying a registration fee or just a lack of evident advantages. Misclassification of live births and deaths is another possibility; this can happen when the terms \"live birth\" and \"fetal death\" aren't understood or when the \"reporting purpose\" isn't understood.\n\n【44】What Are the Different Methods Used to Estimate the Perinatal Mortality Rate?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】The following steps were used to determine rates by nation and to determine regional and worldwide estimates:\n\n【46】1.  **Establishing the Estimation Dataset of Available Data -** The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Pan Arab Project for Child Development (PAPChild), the Gulf Child Health Surveys (GCHS), and other national surveys - many of which relied on an adaption of the Macro Demographic and Health Surveys questionnaire - were used to collect reliable data. In partnership with country partners, these organizations conduct and assist demographic and health surveys in underdeveloped countries, giving comparable mortality statistics; definitions for some other health indicators, such as the presence of a skilled attendant during delivery, may vary. However, surveys frequently overlooked stillbirth data and did not always provide age-at-death rates.\n\n【47】2.  **Estimating Missing Neonatal, Early Neonatal, and Stillbirth Mortality Rates -** When one or more rates were unavailable, the missing rate was calculated using the regressions and ratios described below.\n\n【48】    1.  Estimating the neonatal mortality rate of countries with no data.\n\n【49】    2.  Estimating the early neonatal mortality rate of countries with no data.\n\n【50】    3.  Estimating the stillbirth rate of countries with no data.\n\n【51】3.  **Adjusting Mortality Rates to Who Under-Five (5q0) Mortality Estimates for the Year 2000 -** Neonatal and earlier mortality rates were adjusted to the under-five mortality rate as estimated by WHO for the year 2000 to project year-specific mortality estimates and to keep early mortality within the under-five mortality for that year. The under-five mortality rate of each country's estimation dataset was compared to the under-five mortality rate estimated by the WHO for the year 2000. The stillbirth, newborn, and early neonatal mortality rates of surveys or civil registration were then adjusted using this information. This proportional adjustment made the observed age-at-death distribution remain within the WHO-predicted under-five mortality envelope. The rates for the year 2000 were predicted using this method, nation by country, based on the most recent data on newborn death and the two leading causes of perinatal mortality: stillbirths and early neonatal mortality.\n\n【52】4.  **Calculating Rates and Numbers by Country, Region, and Globally -** Neonatal, early neonatal, and stillbirth rates were reported for 187 of the 192 nations and regions with a population of more than 300 000 people using the estimation methods stated above. Early neonatal fatalities and stillbirths are combined with the matching number of deaths by the nation to determine numbers and rates of perinatal deaths. It could not estimate the rates for five remote locations that account for 0.1% of births.\n\n【53】How Can Perinatal Mortality Be Intervened?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Interventions in public health, including vaccination, better nutrition, water, and sanitation, as well as treatment for diarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, and malnutrition, have helped increase child survival. However, additional therapies and strategies are needed for maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival. The best way to deliver the right technologies for the majority of life-threatening medical issues and complications is through a program that guarantees a woman's and baby's continuity of care throughout pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period, at the primary care level for all pregnant women, and at higher levels of care for women and babies with complications. In addition, other crucial measures for the best pregnancy outcomes can be incorporated into maternity services based on disease patterns.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】Family planning to prevent unintended pregnancies, good health and nutrition before and throughout pregnancy, and quality and respectful prenatal and delivery care with appropriately qualified health staff, especially midwives, can all help prevent stillbirths.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Risks of stillbirth and neonatal death with advancing gestation at term: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of 15 million pregnancies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6605635/\n*   Neonatal death  \n    https://www.tommys.org/baby-loss-support/neonatal-death-information-support\n*   What is Stillbirth?  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/stillbirth/facts.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Anorexia nervosa is associated with various conditions like dysfunctions of the renal, metabolic, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems. Anorexia nervosa causes various disorders like kidney disorders, mineral disorders, and physical disorders. Kidney disease may progress to renal failure. Kidney disease is the most common complication of anorexia nervosa.\n\n【2】What Is Anorexia Nervosa?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder characterized by restricted food intake. It is an eating disorder in which the individual has low body weight due to restricted food intake. An individual with this disorder has an overpowering desire to remain thin. It is a psychiatric disorder because individuals imagine themselves as overweight despite their low body weight. The term anorexia refers to loss of appetite, and nervosa refers to the functional and non-organic nature of this disorder.\n\n【4】Individuals with this disorder deny that they are underweight. They frequently weigh, eat small amounts of food, and eat only certain foods. Some exercise, induce vomiting, or use laxatives to maintain low weight and control body shape. The reason for this disorder remains unknown but may be associated with psychological, sociocultural, and developmental risk factors.\n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Associated With Anorexia Nervosa?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Anorexia nervosa is associated with signs and symptoms that exhibit starvation. The signs and symptoms may be physical, affective, cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual. The signs and symptoms include the following:\n\n【7】**Physical Symptoms**\n\n【8】*   Low body mass index.\n\n【9】*   Amenorrhea occurs due to prolonged weight loss.\n\n【10】*   Fear of weight gain.\n\n【11】*   Hair thinning, dry hair, and skin.\n\n【12】*   Rapid and continuous weight loss.\n\n【13】*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate) or tachycardia (increased heart rate).\n\n【14】*   Chronic fatigue.\n\n【15】*   Carotenosis (orange discoloration of the skin).\n\n【16】*   Infertility.\n\n【17】*   Halitosis (bad breath).\n\n【18】*   Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【19】*   Muscle tension, aches, and pain.\n\n【20】*   Insomnia.\n\n【21】*   Abdominal distension.\n\n【22】**Cognitive Symptoms**\n\n【23】*   Obsession with calories and amount of food.\n\n【24】*   Admiring thinner people.\n\n【25】*   Preoccupation with food, calories, or cooking.\n\n【26】*   Depression.\n\n【27】*   Thoughts of being fat.\n\n【28】*   Impaired theory of mind.\n\n【29】*   Difficulty in thinking and problem-solving.\n\n【30】*   Inflexible thinking.\n\n【31】*   Poor self-esteem.\n\n【32】*   Hypercriticism and perfectionism.\n\n【33】**Affective Symptoms**\n\n【34】*   Depression.\n\n【35】*   Ashamed of one’s own body.\n\n【36】*   Anxiety disorders.\n\n【37】*   Rapid mood swings.\n\n【38】*   Emotional dysregulation.\n\n【39】*   Alexithymia (difficulty in identifying emotions).\n\n【40】**Behavioral Symptoms**\n\n【41】*   Food or energy restrictions despite the underweight or a healthy weight.\n\n【42】*   Food rituals like refusing to eat food and cutting food into tiny pieces.\n\n【43】*   Purging with laxatives, ipecac syrup, diet pills, or diuretics.\n\n【44】*   Excessive exercise, micro exercises like persistent movements for smaller fingers or toes.\n\n【45】*   Self-harming or self-loathing.\n\n【46】*   Avoiding friends and family and becoming withdrawn and secretive.\n\n【47】**Perceptual Symptoms**\n\n【48】*   Perception of overweight, despite the underweight.\n\n【49】*   Intolerance to cold and the persistent feeling of being cold.\n\n【50】*   Altered representation of the body.\n\n【51】*   Altered interoception.\n\n【52】Anorexia nervosa is associated with comorbidities like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), depression, alcoholism, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and body dysmorphic disorder. Depression is the common comorbidity of anorexia nervosa, resulting in the worst outcome.\n\n【53】What Are the Complications Associated With Anorexia Nervosa?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder marked by self-starvation, weight loss, and malnutrition. As the illness progresses, various complications develop.\n\n【55】*   Kidney diseases are the common complications associated with anorexia nervosa. It causes electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n【56】*   It causes cardiac problems that result in changes in the functioning of the heart. Complications like myocardial atrophy, mitral valve prolapse, and pericardial effusion may develop due to progressive weight loss. Sinus bradycardia, reversible sinus node dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension are also observed in anorexia nervosa.\n\n【57】*   As a result of progressive weight loss, gastrointestinal complications like gastroparesis and constipation can occur. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (a gastrovascular disorder) may occur due to weight loss-induced mesenteric pad of fat atrophy. Diarrhea occurs due to small-bowel atrophy. Liver diseases and functional bowel disorders are also common.\n\n【58】*   Pulmonary complications occur due to the weakening of the pharyngeal muscles. Complications like spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and aspiration pneumonia are observed.\n\n【59】*   Malnutrition causes leukopenia and anemia.\n\n【60】*   Endocrine abnormalities like amenorrhea, low leptin levels, and hypoglycemia can occur.\n\n【61】*   Bone loss, muscle loss, and brain atrophy are common complications of anorexia nervosa.\n\n【62】*   Dermatological complications like xerosis, dry and fissured skin, acrocyanosis, and lanugo hair are observed.\n\n【63】How Does Anorexia Nervosa Cause Kidney Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【64】Anorexia nervosa causes kidney disease, including electrolyte abnormalities. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by starvation which leads to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may be caused by deficient potassium intake, habitual vomiting, or abuse of diuretics or laxatives. Starvation causes a decrease in insulin levels and an increase in glucagon levels. Insulin promotes potassium transport from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment, lowering serum potassium levels. This mechanism provides energy to the starving cells. Hypokalemia induces various changes in kidney function and impairs tubular transport, resulting in tubulointerstitial diseases and cyst formation. Renal calcifications, chronic dehydration, and rhabdomyolysis are also due to hypokalemia.\n\n【65】Chronic hypokalemia causes renal ischemia, tubulointerstitial damage, renal tubular fibrosis, cyst formation, and atrophy. Renal ischemia causes glomerular shrinkage and collapse. Kidney ischemia causes chronic kidney injury, irreversible fibrosis, and sclerosis in the kidneys. It may progress to renal failure and even end-stage renal disease.\n\n【66】How Is Anorexia Nervosa-Induced Kidney Disease Managed?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【67】The treatment methods to manage anorexia nervosa and kidney disease are complex. Anorexia nervosa is managed with psychotherapy, nutrition counseling, medication, group or family therapy, and hospitalization.\n\n【68】*   Psychotherapy is a type of counseling that is given to change the thinking and behavior of the individual.\n\n【69】*   Cognitive behavioral therapy and nutrition counseling help in improving eating behavior.\n\n【70】*   Medications such as Olanzapine can help in weight gain.\n\n【71】*   Anorexia nervosa-induced kidney diseases require dialysis for maintenance therapy. Cessation of purging and volume depletion are managed to treat kidney diseases.\n\n【72】*   Hydration with oral or intravenous saline infusions helps in treating volume depletion.\n\n【73】*   Dialysis is done to balance electrolytes and fluid levels and remove toxins.\n\n【74】*   A renal transplant is required in end-stage kidney diseases.\n\n【75】**Conclusion**\n\n【76】Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder that causes complications throughout the body due to starvation and malnutrition. Renal complications are common in anorexia nervosa, and dialysis is performed as maintenance therapy to maintain kidney function. A complex treatment approach is required to manage anorexia nervosa, renal complications, and other complications. Early intervention is required to prevent anorexia nervosa and the worsening of the complications. A psychological approach is essential to help the individual overcome mental illness.\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anorexia nervosa and the kidney  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22609034/\n*   Anorexia Nervosa and the Kidney  \n    https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(12)00663-4/fulltext\n*   Anorexia nervosa and dialysis: we have no time when the body is so damaged!  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604274/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The brain is the most important organ weighing about three pounds and makes up only about two percent of the total body weight. Being a critical organ, it is protected by a hard skull and cushioned by the cerebrospinal fluid. It regulates all the activities in the body. Hence, any disorder in the brain can cause abnormal activity and needs immediate treatment. The surgery on the brain is complicated and performed only by a specialist, namely the neurosurgeon.\n\n【2】What Are the Reasons for Brain Surgery?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Brain surgery is done when there is any damage or disease of the brain. The damage to the brain can be traumatic or acquired.\n\n【4】*   Traumatic brain injury is caused due to an external force (accidents, violence, etc.) that damages the skull, affecting the brain.\n\n【5】*   Acquired brain injury is due to infection, tumor, stroke, or any neurological illness that increases the pressure on the brain.\n\n【6】Both traumatic and acquired brain injury occur after birth. During or before birth, the damage caused to the brain by trauma during delivery or genetic mutations is referred to as congenital brain injury.\n\n【7】A few other reasons for the surgery are:\n\n【8】*   Hemorrhage (bleeding) in the brain.\n\n【9】*   Brain aneurysm (a condition causing a bulge in the wall of blood vessels).\n\n【10】*   Brain abscess.\n\n【11】*   Diseases causing facial pain like trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n【12】*   Diseases affecting the nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease.\n\n【13】*   Hydrocephalus (swelling within the brain due to fluid build-up).\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Brain Damage?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【15】Since the brain, nerves, and spinal cord are involved in almost all functional activities, numerous changes can be noticed with its damage. They can be categorized into cognitive, perceptual, physical, and emotional symptoms. The cognitive symptoms include:\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Vocal Cords - Associated Disorders, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy - Indications, Advantages, and Side Effects</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>I have sharp stabbing headaches, which get worse after exercise.

Some investigations include\n\n【43】*   Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain activity.\n\n【44】*   Electromyography (EMG) measures nerve and muscle activity.\n\n【45】*   Evoked potential (EP) measures electrical activity in the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【46】*   Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound produce images of the hard and soft structures of the brain.\n\n【47】*   A myelogram is an imaging technique using contrast dye and a CT scan to detect nerves and spinal cord abnormalities.\n\n【48】*   A sleep study is done to evaluate the sleep-wake cycle and brain activity.\n\n【49】*   A lumbar puncture (a thin needle inserted between the bones in the lower spine region) is performed to diagnose problems in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n【50】*   Neuroendocrine studies are done to know the hormone levels of endocrine glands such as pituitary in case of pituitary tumor.\n\n【51】What Are the Types of Neurological Surgeries Performed?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】There are many different types of neurological surgeries. All of them are done under general anesthesia or sedation. Some of the most common types of neurosurgery include:\n\n【53】1.  **Craniotomy** \\- Craniotomy refers to removing a part of the skull to visualize the brain for surgeries involving the removal of blood clots, tumors, and aneurysms. It also treats skull fractures and relieves pressure after injuries or strokes.\n\n【54】2.  **Biopsy** \\- Biopsy refers to removing a small portion of brain cells or tissue to confirm any abnormalities detected by imaging studies. The tissue sample drawn is then sent to the pathologist for examination.\n\n【55】3.  **Deep Brain Stimulation** \\- This procedure is used in conditions like Parkinson’s disease (a disease affecting the nerves) and seizures. It uses a battery-operated device wherein the electrode leads are placed in specific brain regions. The electrodes generate electrical impulses to stimulate the brain in specific areas. A pacemaker-like device is placed on the upper chest to control the amount of stimulation.\n\n【56】4.  **Neuroendoscopy** \\- Neuroendoscope is a long tube with a camera attached to one end. It can be introduced through the mouth, nose, or an incision made on the skull. This procedure helps remove skull lesions or tumors of the pituitary gland, which is located near the bridge of the nose.\n\n【57】5.  **Posterior Fossa Decompression** - The surgery is helpful in conditions like Chiari malformation (a structural defect in the cerebellum due to inadequate space and pressure build-up). An incision is made on the back of the skull, and a small portion of the skull bone is removed. The removal helps provide adequate space to the cerebellum and relieves pressure.\n\n【58】6.  **Cerebral Aneurysm Repair** - This is done by removing a portion of the skull bone, locating it, and placing a metal clip on the aneurysm to restrict blood flow.\n\n【59】7.  **Thrombectomy** \\- Thrombus refers to any blood clot. Thrombectomy is the removal of the clot. Here, a thin wire with a contrast dye is introduced through the groin to the blood vessels of the head. The affected blood vessel is identified, and the clot is removed.\n\n【60】What Is Awake Brain Surgery?\n----------------------------\n\n【61】In this type of brain surgery, the patient is sedated, and local anesthesia is given to the scalp. The patient remains slightly conscious during the surgery to answer or make movements that the surgeon commands. This helps the surgeon ensure normal vision, hearing, memory, and speech functioning. Brain tumors near critical areas are treated by this method.\n\n【62】What Are the Risks Involved With Neurosurgery?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【63】Brain surgery is a complex procedure, and several risks can be involved that must be resolved as soon as possible.\n\n【64】*   Impairment in speech, vision, balance, and coordination.\n\n【65】*   Memory loss.\n\n【66】*   Blood clot.\n\n【67】*   Hemorrhage (bleeding) in the brain.\n\n【68】*   Stroke (due to the poor blood supply to the brain).\n\n【69】*   Brain swelling.\n\n【70】*   Coma (brain death causing prolonged unconsciousness).\n\n【71】*   Seizures.\n\n【72】*   Infection at the site of the wound.\n\n【73】What Are the Advancements in Neurosurgery?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【74】1.  **Stereotactic Radiosurgery** \\- It is not a surgery involving any cuts or incisions on the body. The procedure is a type of radiotherapy used to treat brain tumors and other functional abnormalities.\n\n【75】2.  **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy** - Laser therapy is used for lesions that are difficult to access through standard surgical procedures. The laser generates heat that removes the tumor without damaging the adjacent tissues.\n\n【76】The techniques mentioned above are some of the advancements used for the precise treatment of neurological conditions.\n\n【77】**Conclusion**\n\n【78】Surgery for neurological diseases is a complex procedure, and a precise treatment performed by an experienced neurosurgeon is essential for improving the patient’s quality of life after surgery. Any symptoms related to brain damage or disease must be consulted with the physician to prevent further complications. With the advancements in the field of neurosurgery, the outcome has improved substantially.\n\n【79】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【80】* * *\n\n【81】#### **1.**删除换行**How do Doctors Perform Brain Surgery?**\n\n【82】The most common procedure of brain surgery is known as a craniotomy.

Many age-related changes are commonly observed in elderly people, but a few chronic conditions cannot be considered a part of normal aging as they may affect the quality of life. Older people are more prone to developing diseases than younger adults due to decreased immunity, nutritional imbalance, etc.\n\n【2】What Are the Changes That Occur in Elderly Due to Aging?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Changes seen in elderly individuals as a result of biological aging include:\n\n【4】*   **Sensory Changes:** Difficulty in hearing is seen in more than 50 percent of the elderly population, affecting their speech and communication, making it difficult to express themselves in social gatherings. This may cause isolation leading to depression, a decline in cognition, and reduced quality of life. Additionally, elderly people may also suffer from impaired or blurred vision.\n\n【5】*   **Changes in Muscle Strength and Fat**: A decline in muscle mass and muscle strength begins in about the fourth decade and progresses further with aging, leading to alteration in the drug metabolism.\n\n【6】*   **Weakened Immunity:** Elderly people also have immune function alterations, which weakens the body’s response to fight against infections.\n\n【7】*   **Changes in Bladder Control:** Changes in the functioning of the urinary bladder may be experienced, which may cause urinary incontinence or bacteriuria.\n\n【8】What Are the Common Health Hazards Seen in Elderly?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Common heart ailments are seen due to the accumulation of fat or plaque in the walls of the coronary arteries. It is mainly seen due to increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which may result in a stroke, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction. Changes in the stiffness of the blood vessels and their remodeling occur as a process of normal aging, further aggravating the inflammation caused by atherosclerosis. It may increase the risk of organ damage and cerebrovascular diseases.\n\n【10】*   **Lung Diseases:** Chronic bronchitis is commonly seen in elderly individuals, which occurs due to the infection of the lungs or the airways, resulting in chest pain, sore throat, headache, excess mucus production, and cough. Smoking is also one of the risk factors associated with chronic bronchitis.\n\n【11】*   **Diabetes:** A metabolic disorder mainly related to an unhealthy lifestyle usually develops in middle age. It occurs when the body cannot produce insulin or may be due to genetic predisposition. High blood sugar levels can, in turn, cause serious effects on the kidneys, heart, eyes, etc.; hence, it must be screened frequently at a young age, and appropriate medications must be started to prevent the progression of the disease.\n\n【12】*   **Arthritis:** It is a chronic condition commonly seen in elderly people, which is associated with significant pain and joint disability affecting the daily activities of the individuals. It has been observed that an increase in obesity may be a risk factor in the development of arthritis. Age-related bone loss can also be a contributory factor that may lead to fractures or ligament injuries. Arthritis is associated with pain, inflammation, stiffness, and tenderness around the joints and causes limited or restricted movement.\n\n【13】*   **Cancer:** Abnormal replication of cells occurs, which results in the development of tumors and their spread through the bloodstream to various parts of the body. Treatment can be extremely invasive and affects the life of the patients and their family members. Certain symptoms Sudden weight loss, presence of an unexpected lump or mass, or blood in vomit, urine, or stools must be reported immediately to a doctor, and initial screening and testing must be done.\n\n【14】*   **Kidney Diseases:** Metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, frequent infections, inflammation, and chronic use of medications can result in excessive stress on the kidneys, and also due to aging, the cells and tissues may weaken, leading to kidney disorders or renal failure. The condition may be associated with swollen ankles, hands, and feet, tiredness, shortness of breath, blood in the urine, etc. Medical care must be taken immediately to avoid further complications if these symptoms are noticed.\n\n【15】*   **Nervous System Disorders:** Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia may be seen in older adults due to damage or degeneration of the nerves due to aging. These conditions are associated with memory loss, cognition impairment, thinking skills, depression, coordination, speech, confusion, and personality changes. People with Parkinson’s disease experience involuntary shaking or tremors in hands or legs, imbalance in posture, stiffness of muscles, and slow movement.\n\n【16】*   **Polypharmacy:** A chronic use of five or more drugs by the patient is termed polypharmacy. The risk of adverse reactions and drug interactions is very high. It also increases susceptibility to falls, drowsiness, fatigue, and lack of interest in activities. A therapeutic dose regimen must be followed and the drugs must be frequently reviewed to avoid the burden and weigh the benefits and risks considering the treatment goals.\n\n【17】How To Prevent Health Hazards in Elderly People?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Some of the ways in which health hazards can be prevented in elderly people include:\n\n【19】*   Regular health check-ups or screening for diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure, and arthritis help to prevent complications.\n\n【20】*   Quitting smoking and alcohol.\n\n【21】*   Physical exercises and a healthy balanced diet must be followed to maintain immunity against infections.\n\n【22】*   Reducing intake of salt, unhealthy fats, and sugar.\n\n【23】*   Medications must be taken at scheduled intervals without skipping or modifying the dose.\n\n【24】*   Adequate fluid and electrolyte balance must be maintained by consuming plenty of water, herbal teas, fresh fruits, and vegetables.\n\n【25】*   A fiber-rich diet helps prevent constipation and maintain healthy bowel movements.\n\n【26】*   Healthcare professionals must regularly review medicines as it helps to identify the necessary drugs and requirements of a better dose or a substitution with better alternative treatments.\n\n【27】*   Staying connected with friends and family, adopting pets, or developing habits such as gardening, listening to music, and meditation helps to overcome mental health problems.\n\n【28】*   Installation of fall support bars or anti-skid tiles helps avoid accidental falls and injuries.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】Biological changes associated with aging have a great impact on elderly individuals and may be associated with various medical conditions such as impaired vision and hearing, metabolic disorders, or other chronic medical conditions. It is common to experience these challenges. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, scheduled intake of medications, and regular monitoring through medical check-ups can optimize the quality of life in elderly people.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Age-Related Diseases and Clinical and Public Health Implications for the 85?Years Old and Over Population  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732407/\n*   Tip Sheet: Home Safety Tips For Older Adults Print  \n    https://www.healthinaging.org/tools-and-tips/tip-sheet-home-safety-tips-older-adults\n*   Promoting Health for Older Adults  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/promoting-health-for-older-adults.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Affects more than 70 million people worldwide. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a risk factor for glaucoma. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) helps in the regulation of blood pressure. Activation of RAAS causes cell proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and stimulation of fibrosis by angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone. Aldosterone effects can be seen only after it gets bound to MR. These effects influence heart, kidney, electrolyte balance, and vascular pathology. RAAS is present in the retina. Studies have shown that aldosterone plays a role in eye diseases.\n\n【2】What Is Aldosterone?\n--------------------\n\n【3】A mineralocorticoid hormone is secreted in the adrenal cortex and regulates water and salt in the body. Its main function is to act on the distal tubule and collect ducts of nephrons in the kidney in the reabsorption of sodium, water, and potassium. Ang II helps release aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. A study observed that, as in the heart, brain, and vasculature, the eye has an aldosterone-MR system. This system plays a role in the development of retinal vasculopathy.\n\n【4】How Is Aldosterone Related to the Eyes?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】The eye contains the aldosterone-MR system. Conditions like premature damage of the retina, diabetic retinopathy due to increased blood sugar levels, and age-related degeneration of the eyes are angiogenic. These are responsible for vision loss. These pathological processes involve microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates from vessels, retinal detachment due to fibrosis, and neovascular glaucoma leading to increased IOP. Ischemic changes, inflammation, and growth factor-induced angiogenesis are the basic features of retinopathy, although the correct mechanism to know is very tricky about retinopathy.\n\n【6】**What Is the Mechanism Involved?**\n\n【7】The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is related to vascular permeability and angiogenesis. VEGF sends a signal using VEGF receptor 1 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1) and VEGF receptor 2 (fetal liver kinase). VGEF uses protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for signals. VEGF activity is increased by glucose, advanced glycation end products, growth factor-β, and insulin growth factor -1, which are, in turn, regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Hypertension: Overcome the Highs</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>High Blood Pressure Medications</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndromes: Immune and Hormonal Dysfunctions</u>\n\n【13】The eye possesses RAAS. Hence targeting RAAS is more effective in treating retinal vasculopathy as Ang II and aldosterone are proinflammatory, fibrogenic, and angiogenic. As the RAAS system is present in the eye, all components are seen in the eye. Renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, Ang II, and Ang II receptors are present in humans in the vasculature, neurons, and glia. Components of RAAS are increased in diabetic patients-leading to the severity of retinopathy.\n\n【14】What Is Primary Aldosteronism?\n------------------------------\n\n【15】Primary aldosteronism is the increased production of aldosterone by adrenal glands. Hypertension, cardiovascular damage, sodium retention, suppression of plasma renin, and hypokalemia are the causes of PA.\n\n【16】The frequency of occurrence of PA is 5 % in hypertension and 20 % in hypertension with various complications. Patients of PA are at risk of hypertensive retinopathy, retinal vascular occlusion, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Studies have shown an association between PA and central serous chorioretinopathy. A study showed that PA might be responsible for glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\n\n【17】What Are Other Effects of Aldosterone on the Eye?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The effects of aldosterone on the eyes are as follows:\n\n【19】*   **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO):** RVO is the second most common cause of vision loss. A study has shown that RVO is specifically associated with a high aldosterone level. Ischemic RVO is seen in PA patients.\n\n【20】*   **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** CSCR is a choroidal vascular disease affecting men in middle age. It is shown and hypothesized that inappropriate activation of MR results in CSCR.\n\n【21】*   **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV):** CNV is associated with aldosterone. CNV is a vascular disease where choroidal neovessels invade Bruch’s membrane, the sub-retinal pigment epithelial space, and subretinal space, resulting in loss of central vision.\n\n【22】What Is the Mechanism of Aldosterone Responsible for Retinal Vascular Disease?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The target cells involved are vasculature itself. Effects of aldosterone on vascular cells, endothelial cells (EC), vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes were studied to know the mechanism of aldosterone in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to vascular inflammation, increased thrombosis, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【24】Aldosterone increases the transcription and plasma membrane translocation of various components of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, including Nox2, Nox4, p22phoxn, and p47phox in endothelium which leads to more production of ROS.\n\n【25】A study showed the presence of RAAS in retinal microvasculature cells and found aldosterone effects on both cultured ECs and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model.\n\n【26】Another mechanism is through inflammatory mediators where aldosterone mediated endothelial expression of ICAM1 and MCP1 involving macrophages into retinal vascular diseases.\n\n【27】Aldosterone impacts muller glial cells, which are responsible for vascular function, water homeostasis, and extracellular milieu.\n\n【28】What Are the Treatments for the Effects of Aldosterone on the Eye?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Effects of aldosterone on the eye can be treated by using the following methods:\n\n【30】*   RAAS is interrupted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers.\n\n【31】*   Prorenin, a peptide, binds to the renin receptor as a decoy peptide and inhibits the nonproteolytic activation of prorenin.\n\n【32】*   Candesartan significantly reduced retinopathy in type 1 diabetes, beneficial effects were observed on retinopathy progression in type 2 diabetes and supported RAAS’s role in the pathophysiology of retinopathy.\n\n【33】*   MR antagonists with spironolactone improve retinal angiogenesis by attenuating leukostasis and decreasing proinflammatory responses.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Aldosterone is a hormone secreted in the body. Understanding hormones and their actions are very challenging. The actions of hormones vary in different individuals. Its role in the eye is understood. Knowing about the effects of aldosterone on the eyes helps prevent the harmful complications of retinopathy that result in irreparable vision loss.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   PubMed - Effect of acute and chronic aldosterone exposure on the retinal pigment epithelium  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31394103/\n*   NIH - Aldosterone: a mediator of retinal ganglion cell death  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730414/\n*   AHAJ - Aldosterone and Mineralocorticoid Receptors As Novel Targets in Retinal Vasculopathy  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circresaha.108.191288</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a0f7244e-3b78-4ff6-9e02-440080cfea46", "title": "Relationship Between Gut Microbiota And Sepsis", "text": "【0】Relationship Between Gut Microbiota And Sepsis\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】For many years, the gut has been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of sepsis (this involves complex response of cellular activities that trigger proinflammatory mediators). Life-threatening organ dysfunction is called sepsis and is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ failure assessment for sepsis focuses on respiratory, hepatic, renal, neurological, hematological, and cardiovascular systems. The intestinal composition of the microbiome is affected by sepsis and contributes to organ failure.\n\n【2】What Is Gut Microbiota?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Human beings harbor around 10 trillion to 100 trillion microbial cells in a symbiotic relationship. The gut microbiota is the system of microorganisms in an individual's gastrointestinal tract. This includes fungi, bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. These organisms have a symbiotic relationship with the human digestive system and help in immune defense and digestion. They mainly reside in the intestine. They play a key role in digestion control, benefiting the immune system and contributing to causing high blood sugar, weight gain, high cholesterol, and other disorders. Many health issues can thrive if an imbalance in gut microbiota occurs.\n\n【4】What Is Sepsis?\n---------------\n\n【5】Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that leads to organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Almost 20% of deaths all over the world occur due to sepsis. During sepsis, the microbiota is profoundly distorted with a sharp decrease in diversity, overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, and loss of commensal bacteria. Altered gut microbiota influences inflammatory responses and increases gut barrier permeability and enables translocation of pathobionts.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Gut Microbiota Imbalance?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Imbalance in gut microbiota can lead to :\n\n【8】*   Unintentional weight changes.\n\n【9】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【10】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【11】*   Fever.\n\n【12】*   Skin rashes.\n\n【13】*   Food intolerance.\n\n【14】*   Autoimmune conditions.\n\n【15】*   Disturbed sleep patterns.\n\n【16】*   Sugar cravings.\n\n【17】*   Stomach upset.\n\n【18】What Are the Microbiota Disorders Related to Sepsis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】In sepsis, the factors like hypoxia injury, intestinal motility dysfunction, inflammation, and destruction of epithelial cell integrity can change the proportion and composition of gut microbiota. Some harmful bacteria like Trichinella spiralis and Vibrio cholera can induce mucin degradation and inhibit mucin production. Lactobacillus SPP (gut bacteria) can stimulate mucin 3 and mucin 2 production and secretion. The microbial metabolite SCFA's (short chain fatty acids) can also encourage mucin 2 expression. Gut micro-ecological collapse can result in sepsis and a dominant genus changes from common symbiotic bacteria to a pathogenic genus.\n\n【20】The healthy bacterial function also decreases. The gut flora of individuals with septic shock is characterized by low population diversity and a high degree of individualization associated with excessive reproduction of a single genus. Studies reveal that gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset sepsis and is its main risk factor.\n\n【21】What Is the Relation Between Gut Microbiota and Systemic Immunity?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Gut microbiota not only plays an important role in innate and intestinal mucosal immunity. But affects intestinal microcirculation through inflammation and vascular reaction.\n\n【23】*   IgA secreting cells and CD4+T cells are reduced. The destruction of a balanced gut could cause an immune system response, leading to inflammatory reactions and ultimately destroying the mucosal barrier.\n\n【24】*   The gut flora affects the systemic immune response by regulating several key pathways, including production of SCFA, control of inflammatory T cells populations, oral immune tolerance, and expansion and differentiation of extraintestinal T-cells.\n\n【25】*   Disordered gut flora can induce decreased number and differentiation of dendritic cells, increase susceptibility to pathogenic microorganisms and suppress T Cell immune responses in sepsis.\n\n【26】*   The flora dysbiosis can induce macrophages that differentiate into M1 type and release TNF (tumor necrosis factor) alpha, IL-1, and IL (interleukins)-6, which aggravates inflammation and reaction in sepsis.\n\n【27】How Does Gut Microbiota Affect Organ Dysfunction?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   The integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is destroyed by LPS (lipopolysaccharides), partly due to the weakening of altering mucosal hydrophobic properties and bile components. This can cause bile acid reflux and gastric bleeding and reduce bile salts in the ileum.\n\n【29】*   Phosphatidylcholine containing a hydrophobic layer protects and covers the surface of the gastrointestinal tract and helps in maintaining barrier integrity.\n\n【30】*   In sepsis, the integrity of the intestinal (gut) barrier is impaired by PC (Phosphatidylcholine) degradation. It also induces high intestinal permeability and epithelial cell apoptosis.\n\n【31】*   Heparin-binding protein levels associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction are positively related to sepsis.\n\n【32】*   Klebsiella pneumoniae infection leads to many changes in gut microbiota and metabolome (small molecule that is found in organ ,cell, or organism). The gut microbiota and SCFA form a protective effect on lung injury. They directly contribute to organ dysfunction other than lung during sepsis.\n\n【33】*   The gut microbiota reaches the liver through a portal vein, which promotes capture and killing by circulating pathogens by kupffer cells.\n\n【34】*   Death of microbiota by the use of antibiotics can lead to a failure in pathogen clearance and diffuse infection. Microbiota is considered a key player in liver disease by interacting with inflammatory signals and bile acid.\n\n【35】*   Gut microbiota cannot only cause delirium directly through inflammatory pathways but can also lead to acute brain dysfunction through the translocation of bacteria to the brain during sepsis.\n\n【36】What Are Microbial Therapy for Sepsis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【37】The therapies used for treating sepsis are:\n\n【38】*   Probiotics reduce the severity, incidence, and duration of respiratory infections in adults, children, and the elderly. The association between probiotic use in critically ill individuals and infection risk remains to be verified.\n\n【39】*   Fecal microbial therapy (FMT) has shown a potential therapeutic effect in many diseased conditions that are affected by Clostridium difficile infection. FMT enhances the clearance of pathogens by restoring host immunity and reversing fatal sepsis related to the proliferation of butyrate-producing bacteria.\n\n【40】*   Fecal bacterial liquid, transplantation methods, and subsequent treatment are unified approaches for selecting donors.\n\n【41】*   SSD (selective decontamination of the digestive tract) is the most controversial treatment. Here local antibiotics are used to suppress potential pathogens while maintaining colonization resistance. A meta-analysis shows that SDD can prevent secondary infection and reduce overall mortality in critically ill individuals.\n\n【42】*   Recently, traditional Chinese medicines have been used to improve gut microbiota disorders. Using Jinzhi and Xuan Bai Cheng Qi decoction can restore damage to tight binding protein occluding of gut epithelium and improve intestinal barrier dysfunction.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Gut and intestinal flora are essential in maintaining homeostasis in the host. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may be widespread and plays a main role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, which leads to organ dysfunction. Microbial targeted therapy is shown to improve the prognosis of sepsis. However, studies are still required to experiment on their effectiveness and safety.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Crosstalk between gut microbiota and sepsis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8547143/\n*   the Effect of Gut Microbiota on the Prognosis of Sepsis  \n    https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02768324\n*   Therapeutic Potential of the Gut Microbiota in the Prevention and Treatment of Sepsis  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02042/full</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "4f8bb9b8-c374-4a50-8c29-518182622bb9", "title": "Infant Dyschezia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Infant Dyschezia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Dyschezia or disordered defecation means difficulty in pooping. Infant dyschezia occurs in infants within six months of age who have difficulty passing soft stools. Infant dyschezia is also called ‘Grunting Baby Syndrome.’ Due to the strain, the infant’s face can turn red or purple during pooping. Infant dyschezia is self-resolving and is mistaken by parents for constipation.\n\n【2】What Is the Difference Between Adult Dyschezia and Infant Dyschezia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】In adult dyschezia, adults have difficulty and strain with pain before passing stools. Constipation can lead to dyschezia or be a side effect of other conditions, whereas infants have difficulty coordinating various muscle groups necessary to poop. These infants do not constipate but rather find it difficult to pass normal stools. Babies can cry to facilitate the necessary abdominal pressure to release poop. Once they learn to get accustomed to the reflex, the issue gets resolved.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Infant Dyschezia?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Successful pooping requires the coordination of two processes, that is:\n\n【6】*   Relaxation of the thick muscles that occupy the underlying surface of the bony pelvis or the hip bone (pelvic floor muscles).\n\n【7】*   Increased abdominal pressure to push out the stool.\n\n【8】Newborn babies have not developed the ability to coordinate between these two processes. Also, the babies have no control over the stool reflex, and the anal muscles do not relax appropriately. When the stool enters the rectum, signals are sent to the anal muscles to release them, but the pressure in the rectum of infants can be weak. The infants have not yet mastered pushing as well as releasing feces at the same time.\n\n【9】So, to get rid of the stools, the babies use their diaphragm (muscles between the lungs and stomach that help to breathe) and abdominal muscles to relieve the stools but hold the anus tightly. Hence, they cry hard till they can relax their pelvic muscles and pass out the stools. With the infant’s digestive system and brain-to-body communication development, infant dyschezia can be overcome by the infant within a few weeks.\n\n【10】How to Distinguish Infant Dyschezia From Constipation?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】It is common for parents to become apprehensive when the infants find it difficult to release feces and cannot tolerate seeing their strain and cry. Parents often mistake dyschezia for constipation and try home remedies to cure the condition. But, infant dyschezia is not associated with constipation, unlike adult dyschezia. The stools passed by infants with dyschezia are soft and are not hard and bloody as in constipation.\n\n【12】How to Distinguish Infant Dyschezia From Colic?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Colic is a pain in the stomach and is common in babies. Infants with colic become restless, arch their backs, tightly hold their fists, pull their legs towards the stomach, cry uncontrollably, and turn red in the face. Experts also consider colic to be a part of the developmental process. For example, if a restless baby who cries uncontrollably poops after being fussy, then it is a case of infant dyschezia.\n\n【14】How to Diagnose Infant Dyschezia?\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】The pediatrician (child specialist) will ask about the baby’s symptoms and examine the baby physically to check the stomach and might ask for a stool test. If the stool appears normal and if it is confirmed that babies cry only to pass a normal poop, then it is diagnosed as infant dyschezia.\n\n【16】What Is the Treatment for Infant Dyschezia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The condition is usually self-resolving. However, massaging babies regularly can stimulate the nervous system and develop brain-body coordination. The covering of the nerves is called myelin and is responsible for increasing the speed at which the information travels from the brain. Massage relaxes the muscle and enhances myelination. This can help with infant dyschezia, but it is not the primary mode of treatment.\n\n【18】What Is the Normal Pooping Frequency in Babies?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Pooping of breastfed babies ranges from several times a day to once a week with a large blowout, whereas formula-fed infants poop several times a day to once every four days. If the baby’s intake is normal and he/she appears healthy and happy, then this should not be a matter of concern. Formula-fed babies can have pasty stools making it difficult for these babies to poop, but it is not considered constipation.\n\n【20】What Should Not Be Done by Parents?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【21】*   Apprehensive parents use various methods of rectal stimulation to help the baby get rid of the distress. This is wrong and must not be followed. It is only a temporary mode of relief, and doing so can delay the learning process in these infants, and they might depend on these ways of stimulation to pass stools in the future. It is to be understood by the parents that this is a normal part of development.\n\n【22】*   Laxatives (a medicine, food, or drink that helps to get rid of solid waste) must not be given to infants with dyschezia.\n\n【23】*   Switching to a fiber-rich formula or opting for a formula that relieves constipation must be avoided. This can cause diarrhea and lead to dehydration.\n\n【24】*   Inserting fingers into the rectum to ease the passage of stools must be avoided. This can cause injury or infection in infants.\n\n【25】When Can Babies Get Rid of Infant Dyschezia?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Normally, it takes a few days to weeks for the infants to get the hang of passing the stools with ease. So, infant dyschezia is a temporary condition. However, it can be stressful for parents to see their babies in distress during this period. Babies overcome the issue within two to three months.\n\n【27】How to Massage the Babies?\n--------------------------\n\n【28】Massaging is done by:\n\n【29】*   Placing the index and middle fingers on the stomach and moving it clockwise while applying mild pressure. This enhances the circulation of the intestine.\n\n【30】*   Bringing the baby’s knees to the chest can relieve the pain and discomfort as the sphincter (a ring-shaped muscle that tightens or relaxes to open or close an opening in the body) relaxes.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】Infant dyschezia is a short-term, self-resolving problem and part of the developmental process. The infants will try to gain control over the muscle groups involved in pooping within a few weeks. Babies cry to increase abdominal pressure, enabling them to release poop. This does not mean anything serious, and parents must be patient. If it has been long since the baby pooped or in case of hard stools, it is recommended to consult a pediatrician (child specialist).\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Infant Dyschezia  \n    https://aboutkidsgi.org/lower-gi/childhood-defecation-disorders/infant-dyschezia/\n*   Can Infant Dyschezia Be a Suspect of Rectosigmoid Redundancy?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9320059/\n*   Bowel And Bladder Function in Infant Toilet Training (BABITT)  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04082689\n*   Prevalence and Health Outcomes of Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Infants From Birth to 12 Months of Age  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631121/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The buds are first cut open, then the sap of the bud is captured and boiled. After boiling, a caramel-colored sugary consistency is obtained, which has a lot of similarities with brown sugar. Similarly, \"palm sugar\" is a kind of sugar obtained from varied types of palm trees rather than the coconut palm.\n\n【2】Coconut sugar contains the soluble fiber content of inulin which is the main reason it would be linked to a lower risk of blood sugar spikes; however, the facts may not be true just because of the presence of inulin. Nearly one teaspoon of coconut sugar contains the following nutritional value -\n\n【3】*   0 grams of protein.\n\n【4】*   0 grams of fat.\n\n【5】*   5 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n【6】*   5 grams of sugar.\n\n【7】*   18 calories.\n\n【8】Why Is Coconut Sugar Not a Good Alternative for Diabetics?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】According to The American Diabetes Association (ADA), diabetics and people predisposed to diabetes can use coconut palm sugar the same way as they use regular sugar and, as such, yields no extra nutrient benefit. Coconut sugar during manufacturing could be mixed with cane sugar and other similar ingredients. Also, the mineral benefits obtained from coconut sugar have been popularized in recent decades, with researchers claiming the maximum mineral content of potassium within coconut sugar.\n\n【10】According to the data released by the Philippine Food and Nutrition Research Institute, the potassium amounts in half a cup of obtained coconut sugar are on the higher side, approximately 1000 milligrams.\n\n【11】From an economic point of view, coconut sugar is very expensive compared to other sugars in the market. Although many researchers claim that coconut sugar would be suitable for people with diabetes because of its low glycemic index (compared to other sugars), it may not be true, according to nutritionists. This is because to avail of the nutritional benefits alongside the mineral content of coconut sugar, large amounts of coconut sugar would have to be consumed, which is a definite no from a nutrition perspective. Also, consuming large quantities of sugar of any type is not recommended daily, despite the lower glycemic index. It is a known fact, according to diabetic research and evidence, that any form of added sugar should always be consumed as less as possible or limited to an extent regardless of the sugar source. Hence, nutritionists verified that coconut sugar would not be a better alternative as it holds the same position as the other conventional sugars used in daily diets.\n\n【12】Why Is Sugar Consumption Bad?\n-----------------------------\n\n【13】Irrespective of the sugar source, all forms of sugar tend to be concentrated form of sugar only, obtained mainly by natural plant sources that yield these sugars. They would be obtained, for example, from sugar cane, sugar beets, maple trees, honey or nectar, the plant agave, and even rice, to name a few. All these plant-based sugars have one commonality; nutritionally, they yield around 20 calories or 5 grams of sugar or carbohydrate per every single teaspoon consumed. Research on coconut sugar also shows the same statistics appropriately, indicating clearly that sugar in any form, including coconut sugar, is definitely not an ideal exception. Just like the other sugars, overconsumption causes sugar spikes and is unhealthy when consumed in large quantities daily. However, consuming coconut sugar, even in moderation or with less content, makes little or no difference to an individual's general systemic health because of the less nutritious and more risky effects that follow any sugar consumption.\n\n【14】One more important health fact to be noted when considering the glycemic index (GI) of sugars is that the GI can be varied from one batch to another batch of coconut sugar. Most reports of GI of coconut sugar indicate 54 to 55 as a common value which shows that it is lower than it is claimed to be and rather on the medium scale. Researchers, however, agree on the generalized fact that coconut sugar as a natural source, along with honey or agave sugars, would be slightly better in comparison to other conventional sugars or table sugar that causes blood sugar spikes.\n\n【15】What Are the Healthier Substitutes?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】The reasonable and better substitute for table sugar would be replacing it with natural applesauce, bananas, or fruit juice splashes while preparing sweet dishes. Other natural sweeteners, such as the extract of vanilla that is now very popular in the culinary world, or even natural spices like cinnamon, cocoa powder, or almond extracts, make up for a sweeter taste.\n\n【17】**Conclusion:**\n\n【18】Coconut sugar contains negligible or small amounts of minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. It is still very high in calories, making it an average and non-nutritious substitute for natural table sugar. Significant quantities of coconut sugar would have to be consumed, making it a high-calorie count diet and disrupting the minimal nutritional benefits. Hence, nutritionists always treat coconut sugar like regular table sugar and recommend limiting any sugar source for that matter daily.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "86735b7b-2b5f-45e6-91c3-626fa4e77a96", "title": "Bremelanotide - Uses, Dosage, Precautions, Side Effects, and Pharmacological Aspects", "text": "【0】Bremelanotide - Uses, Dosage, Precautions, Side Effects, and Pharmacological Aspects\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Bremelanotide is a synthetic peptide developed as a potential treatment for sexual dysfunction, specifically in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). It works by activating melanocortin receptors in the brain, which can enhance sexual arousal and desire. Bremelanotide is administered as a subcutaneous injection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Bremelanotide for use in premenopausal women with HSDD in 2019. The drug is not approved for use in men or postmenopausal women. The drug can also cause an increase in blood pressure, so individuals with high blood pressure or heart disease should be cautious when using this drug. The patients are advised to use effective contraception while using the drug.\n\n【2】**How Does Bremelanotide Work?**\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Bremelanotide is a synthetic peptide analog of the naturally occurring hormone alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which is produced in the pituitary gland. Bremelanotide works by activating melanocortin receptors in the brain, particularly the MC4 receptor, which regulates a variety of physiological processes, including sexual function, appetite, and skin pigmentation.\n\n【4】When Bremelanotide binds to the MC4 receptor, it activates a signaling pathway that leads to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of mood. This activation of the dopamine pathway is thought to be responsible for Bremelanotide's effects on sexual function, including increased libido and improved sexual satisfaction.\n\n【5】**Dosage and Administration:**\n\n【6】Bremelanotide is administered as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is 1.75 mg, which should be injected into the abdomen or thigh at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity.\n\n【7】The injection site should be rotated with each dose, and the injection should be given under the skin, not into a muscle or a vein. Patients should be instructed on proper injection techniques and should not use the medication if they are unsure of how to administer the injection. It is important to follow the dosing instructions provided by the healthcare provider and not adjust the dose or frequency of administration without first consulting with the healthcare provider.\n\n【8】**Warnings:**\n\n【9】Following are some of the precautions associated with Bremelanotide:\n\n【10】*   **Heart Diseases:** Bremelanotide can cause an increase in blood pressure, which may be particularly concerning for people with a history of cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. Before prescribing Bremelanotide, healthcare providers should assess the patient's cardiovascular risk factors and consider monitoring blood pressure during treatment.\n\n【11】*   **Skin:** Bremelanotide may cause temporary skin darkening, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) light. This effect is more prominent in dark skin people. Patients should be advised to avoid excessive sun exposure and use appropriate sun protection measures during treatment.\n\n【12】*   **Gastrointestinal:** Bremelanotide may cause nausea with the administration of the first dose of the drug and gradually lessens with subsequent use. Medications for nausea may be prescribed by the doctor if the effect is persistent.\n\n【13】Note that Bremelanotide should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider and in accordance with the prescribing information.\n\n【14】**For Patients:**\n-----------------\n\n【15】**What Is Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a sexual dysfunction characterized by a persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity that causes significant distress or interpersonal difficulties. The disorder can affect both men and women and can occur at any age.\n\n【17】The causes of HSDD are not fully understood, but they can include psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as hormonal imbalances and certain medical conditions.\n\n【18】**When and Why to Take Bremelanotide?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   Bremelanotide is taken as a self-administered injection, typically about 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity.\n\n【20】*   The recommended starting dose is 1.75 mg, but the healthcare provider may adjust the dose based on the patient’s response.\n\n【21】*   The drug should only be used as prescribed by a healthcare provider and is not recommended for individuals with uncontrolled high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.\n\n【22】*   It can also interact with certain medications, so it is important to inform the healthcare provider of any other medications the patient is taking.\n\n【23】**How Effective Is Bremelanotide?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【24】Bremelanotide has been shown to be effective in treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. In clinical trials, bremelanotide has been shown to significantly increase sexual desire and decrease distress related to low sexual desire compared to a placebo. It is important to note that the effectiveness of Bremelanotide may vary among individuals and that it may not be effective for all women with HSDD. Also, the drug is intended for short-term use, and its safety and effectiveness extend beyond five months (24 months).\n\n【25】**What Are the Things to Inform the Doctor Before Taking Bremelanotide?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】It is necessary to inform the doctor if any of the following conditions are present before taking Bremelanotide.\n\n【27】*   **High Blood Pressure or Heart Diseases:** Since Bremelanotide can cause transient increases in blood pressure levels. Precaution should be taken in patients with pre-existing high blood pressure.\n\n【28】*   **Kidney or Liver Diseases:** Use only if directed by the doctor.\n\n【29】*   **Pregnancy:** Bremelanotide can cause harm to the fetus if the drug is administered during pregnancy. Hence, effective contraception is advised. However, if pregnancy is suspected, inform the doctor immediately.\n\n【30】*   **Breastfeeding:** The presence of Bremelanotide in breast milk is not yet been fully researched. Hence, it is important for nursing mothers to always talk with the doctor before taking the drug.\n\n【31】**What Are the Side Effects of Bremelanotide?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The common side effects of the drug include:\n\n【33】*   Flushing.\n\n【34】*   Vomiting.\n\n【35】*   Extreme nausea.\n\n【36】*   Cough.\n\n【37】*   Tingling.\n\n【38】*   Injection site reactions.\n\n【39】*   Headache.\n\n【40】*   Dizziness.\n\n【41】*   Fatigue.\n\n【42】*   Hot flush.\n\n【43】*   Nasal congestion.\n\n【44】If these effects are not resolved on their own or become persistent or worsen, immediate medical intervention is necessary.\n\n【45】**Dietary Alterations for Bremelanotide:**\n\n【46】There are no specific dietary alterations that are required when taking Bremelanotide for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). It is important to maintain a healthy and balanced diet while taking Bremelanotide, as good nutrition is important for overall health and well-being. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can provide the nutrients the body needs to function optimally.\n\n【47】**Missed Dose:**\n\n【48】If the patient has any concerns about missed doses or how to take Bremelanotide, it is important to speak with the healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual needs and circumstances.\n\n【49】**Overdose:**\n\n【50】The effects of an overdose of Bremelanotide are not well known. There have been reports of adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, and blood pressure changes, in some individuals who have received higher than recommended doses of Bremelanotide. If an overdose of Bremelanotide is suspected, seek emergency medical attention or call the local poison control center immediately.\n\n【51】**Storage:**\n\n【52】*   Bremelanotide should be stored in a refrigerator between 2°Celsius to 8°Celsius (36°Fahrenheit to 46°Fahrenheit). It should not be frozen.\n\n【53】*   Before using Bremelanotide, allow the vial to come to room temperature by leaving it at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Do not use a microwave or warm water to warm the medication.\n\n【54】*   For any concerns about the storage of Bremelanotide, it is important to speak with the healthcare provider or pharmacist.\n\n【55】**For Doctors**\n---------------\n\n【56】**Indication:**\n\n【57】Bremelanotide is indicated to treat lack or loss of sexual desire in premenopausal women.\n\n【58】**Dosing:** 1.75 mg subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh once as needed, at least 45 minutes prior to sexual activity.\n\n【59】**Maximum Dose:** 1 dose/24 hours and eight doses/month.\n\n【60】**Dosing Considerations:**\n\n【61】No data had yet been published regarding dosing adjustments in various conditions.\n\n【62】**What Are the Pharmacological Aspects of Bremelanotide?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【63】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【64】Bremelanotide is an agonist for numerous melanocortin receptors, including the MC1R, MC4R, MC3R, MC5R, and MC2R, in order of potency. Although MC4R receptors are found in numerous regions of the central nervous system, it is still unknown how agonism of these receptors leads to a reduction in hypoactive sexual desire disease. The hypothalamus is home to the MC3R and MC4R receptors, which regulate food intake and energy homeostasis.\n\n【65】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n\n【66】Bremelanotide is administered as a subcutaneous injection 45 minutes before planned sexual activity. Increased melanin expression is also brought on by MC1R antagonistic activity. Patients on Bremelanotide may also experience vomiting, nausea, and headaches.\n\n【67】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【68】**Absorption:**\n\n【69】Bremelanotide is administered subcutaneously, and its absorption is rapid and complete. The maximum plasma concentration is achieved within 45 minutes after the injection.\n\n【70】**Distribution:**\n\n【71】Bremelanotide is rapidly distributed to tissues after absorption. The volume of distribution of Bremelanotide is approximately 25 liters.\n\n【72】**Metabolism:**\n\n【73】Bremelanotide is metabolized by peptidases, primarily by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and aminopeptidase N (APN). The primary metabolite, des-tyrosyl-bremelanotide, is less active than the parent compound and is excreted mainly in the urine.\n\n【74】**Excretion:**\n\n【75】Bremelanotide and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine, with approximately 70 percent of the dose excreted within 24 hours after administration. The elimination half-life of Bremelanotide is approximately two to three hours.\n\n【76】**Clinical Studies:**\n\n【77】Two randomized phase 3 clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bremelanotide in premenopausal women with HSDD. In both trials, women were randomly assigned to receive either Bremelanotide or a placebo for a period of 24 weeks. The primary outcome measured was an increase in the number of satisfying sexual events (SSEs) per month, as reported by the women themselves.\n\n【78】The results showed that women who received Bremelanotide had a statistically significant increase in the number of SSEs per month compared to those who received the placebo. In addition, a greater proportion of women in the Bremelanotide group reported an improvement in their sexual desire and distress related to low sexual desire compared to the placebo group.\n\n【79】The most common adverse effects reported were nausea, flushing, and headache. These side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and resolved on their own without any treatment. More research is needed to further evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this medication.\n\n【80】**Warnings and Precautions:**\n\n【81】*   **Cardiovascular:** Each dose causes a brief increase in blood pressure and a brief decrease in heart rate; monitoring is advised; use is not advised in patients who have a high risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【82】*   **Dermatologic:** Patients may experience focal hyperpigmentation of the face, gingiva, and breasts. It was observed particularly in patients with dark complexion; discontinuation may be necessary in such cases.\n\n【83】*   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea frequently happens with the first dose and gets better with successive use. If prolonged, nausea may be treated with antiemetics; withdrawal may be necessary.\n\n【84】**Contraindications:**\n\n【85】Bremelanotide is contraindicated in the following conditions:\n\n【86】*   In patients with cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【87】*   In patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n【88】**Specific Population:**\n\n【89】**Bremelanotide in Pregnant Women:**\n\n【90】Animal studies have shown adverse effects on fetal development and reproduction at doses higher than the recommended human dose. Bremelanotide can also cause significant changes in blood pressure, which may be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore, women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid using Bremelanotide. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking Bremelanotide, then her healthcare provider should be informed immediately to assess the risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing Bremelanotide during pregnancy and make appropriate recommendations based on the individual case.\n\n【91】**Bremelanotide in Lactating Women:**\n\n【92】It is not known whether Bremelanotide is excreted in human milk, and the potential risks to the infant are unknown. Hence, the safety of Bremelanotide in lactating women has not been established, and it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding women who are considering Bremelanotide should discuss the potential risks and benefits with their healthcare provider. If Bremelanotide is deemed necessary for the lactating mother, the healthcare provider may recommend discontinuing breastfeeding or closely monitoring the infant for any adverse effects.\n\n【93】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【94】无关删除-1:<u>*   (bremelanotide injection), for subcutaneous use  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2019/210557s000lbl.pdf\n*   Bremelanotide: First Approval  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31429064/\n*   Bremelanotide Injection  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a619054.html\n*   Bremelanotide for the Treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder: Two Randomized Phase 3 Trials  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31599840/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can also live on household items such as clothing, towels, and bedding. Ringworm has many names given based on the infection affecting the location of the body. Ringworm is otherwise known as tinea or dermatophytosis.\n\n【2】Areas of the body that can be affected by ringworm are,\n\n【3】1) Feet,\n\n【4】2) Groin, inner thighs, or buttocks,\n\n【5】3) Scalp,\n\n【6】4) Beard,\n\n【7】5) Hands,\n\n【8】6) Toenails or fingernails\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Can I use Hydrozole for jock itch?</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>I have fungal infection in my ear.Is it mandatory to stay at the hospital overnight for a microsuction?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Can fungal infection cause low grade fever?</u>\n\n【14】7) Other parts of the body such as arms or legs.\n\n【15】Approximately 40 different species of fungi cause ringworm. The fungus causing ringworm infection are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.\n\n【16】Ringworm affecting the feet is known as tinea pedis or athlete’s foot. Ringworms affecting the groin, inner thighs, or buttocks are called tinea cruris or jock itch. Ringworms causing infection in the hands are referred to as the tinea manuum.\n\n【17】Ringworm affecting\n\n【18】1) The scalp is known as tinea capitis.\n\n【19】2) The beard is known as tinea barbae.\n\n【20】3) The fingernails or toenails are known as onychomycosis.\n\n【21】4) Other parts of the body are known as tinea corporis.\n\n【22】What Are the Symptoms of Ringworm Infections?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Ringworm can affect the skin or almost any part of the body, fingernails, and toenails. The symptoms of ringworm vary based on the part of the body infected. But ringworm infection generally causes itchy skin, ring-shaped rash, red and scaly cracked skin, and hair loss. Symptoms start to appear within 4 to 14 days after the skin contacts the fungus that causes ringworm infections.\n\n【24】What Are the General Facts to Know About Ringworm Infections?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】1.  Ringworm infection affects people of all age groups and has a worldwide distribution.\n\n【26】2.  It is contagious as it can quickly spread from one person to another. It can also spread by contact through infected animals and soil.\n\n【27】3.  Once acquired by a person, the same individual can become a source of autoinfection to other body areas, nails, and hairs.\n\n【28】4.  Ringworm infections commonly occur in tropical regions (hot and humid environments), the obese, diabetics, persons on medications that lower one’s resistance to infections (like steroids, anticancer treatment, debilitating conditions), and those living under unhygienic conditions.\n\n【29】5.  It is possible to prevent this infection from spreading further. Several measures help in early recovery and are performed at an individual level.\n\n【30】How Is Ringworm Infection Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【31】The doctor might be able to diagnose ringworm infection simply by looking at it. The doctor may also take skin scrapings from the affected area to be examined under a microscope.\n\n【32】How to Prevent and Cope With Ringworm Infections?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】1.  Please be careful if you fall in one of the following categories: Overweight, obese, diabetic, hot and humid climate or working conditions (athletes, sportspersons, laundry workers, agriculture, animal handling, gardening, working near furnaces, swimming pool staff, sewer workers, cooking and dishwashing), treatment with medication that alters the normal flora of body like antibiotics or steroids, AIDS, malignancy, malnutrition.\n\n【34】2.  If you are obese or overweight, you need to consider weight control seriously. If you are on medication that lowers body resistance, please consult your treating physician. In some occupational cases where the infections are recurrent, it may be advisable to change the profession.\n\n【35】3.  One needs to teach the habits of thorough cleaning and drying of infection-prone areas during and after every bath and immersion of the part in water. Pay more attention to areas of the body that are at risk of fungal infection and treat the same.\n\n【36】4.  The undergarments that one wears should be well-fitting but not too tight. These should allow ventilation of air. If the said areas tend to sweat profusely, one needs to dry the area several times a day with a gauze piece or absorbent tissue paper. If required, a hairdryer or a fan can be employed until the area becomes dry while you get ready after the bath.\n\n【37】5.  Abstain from heavy exercise or strenuous work to minimize sweating.\n\n【38】6.  Stay and work in a well-ventilated area. You can keep the kitchen windows open while working or use an exhaust fan if local conditions permit the same.\n\n【39】7.  Break your jogging and intense physical activities into short spells.\n\n【40】8.  Stay away from foods and drinks that promote profuse sweating (beverages, spices), working outdoors during midday, as far as possible.\n\n【41】9.  Use a chair that permits sweat evaporation from the areas where sweat tends to pool on sitting (for example, on the buttocks and the back). Cane or wooden chairs are better than rexine or leather chairs.\n\n【42】10.  On sitting, one can position the legs slightly apart from the groin area downwards rather than sitting cross-legged.\n\n【43】11.  If you get the infection, do not take medicines on your own. Some of the preparations advertised on the mass media may do more harm than good.\n\n【44】12.  Take regular medication as prescribed by your attending physician. If you are already on medication, all the measures listed above will help you after consulting your physician to enhance the effect of treatment. Please do not use powders or other agents unless specifically recommended. It is possible to be misled by the visible improvement even while the infection is still active in deeper layers of the skin.\n\n【45】13.  The affected person may need prescription-strength antifungal medications such as a lotion, cream, or ointment to be applied on the affected skin. If your infection is particularly severe or extensive, the doctor might prescribe antifungal pills.\n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】Ringworm infection is a contagious infection caused by fungal species and affects various body parts with unique features. This condition is manageable by taking antifungal medications prescribed by the doctor. There is so much that you can do yourself to prevent this infection by following the preventive measures mentioned. Thus, Ringworm infections are both preventable and curable by following the general steps given above.\n\n【48】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【49】* * *\n\n【50】#### **1.**删除换行**Will Ringworms Cause Itching?**\n\n【51】Ringworms can affect any part of the body. The infection is usually a ring-like rash. It can be itchy and can cause red, scaly, and cracked lesions. The symptoms typically appear within four to fourteen days of contact with the fungi.\n\n【52】#### **2.**删除换行**What Will Happen if Ringworm Infection Is Left Untreated?**\n\n【53】Ringworm infection is mainly caused by fungus. If left untreated, it can easily spread to other parts of the body. In some cases, the condition aggravates and forms blisters that are infected by bacteria. Antibiotics may be needed to cure such cases.\n\n【54】#### **3.**删除换行**How Long Will Ringworm Infection Last?**\n\n【55】Ringworm infection may resolve within two to three weeks if the infection is mild.

Drop attacks last 12 to 15 seconds and do not involve loss of consciousness during the fall. According to a study, women are more associated with drop attacks than men, and the average age of onset of drop attacks is between 40 and 50 years. People with drop attacks would regain equilibrium immediately if they were not being hurt during the fall. For example, a drop attack called Tumarkin's otolithic type is associated with vertigo and problems with the inner ear.\n\n【2】What Are the Features of a Drop Attack?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】When a seizure causes a drop attack, electrical activity in the brain becomes altered without warning, resulting in an immediate loss of strength and muscle tone. In such cases, most of the muscles in the body may go limp, including arms and legs. The other features one may experience during a drop attack may include:\n\n【4】*   Experience jerking movement.\n\n【5】*   Legs may give out, which will cause one to slump or fall.\n\n【6】*   Drooping of the eyelid.\n\n【7】*   Forward dropping of head.\n\n【8】*   Falling off the things one might be holding.\n\n【9】*   People will remain conscious during this process.\n\n【10】*   There would be no after effects after a drop attack unless injured by the fall.\n\n【11】*   People with drop attacks may also experience associated injuries like bruising on hands, palms, legs, face, etc.\n\n【12】People with drop attacks are more prone to fractures than the general population. The stroke rate in persons with drop attacks is 0.5 % every year.\n\n【13】What Are the Causes of a Drop Attack?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【14】Drop attacks are caused by different reasons that include various types of seizures, heart diseases, inner ear disturbances, brain disorders, etc. They include:\n\n【15】*   **Brain Tumor** \\- The symptoms of the brain tumor are based on the location and severity of the tumor.\n\n【16】*   **Generalized Atonic Onset Seizure** \\- This seizure affects both sides of the brain and the entire body.\n\n【17】*   **Focal Motor Atonic Seizure -** These seizures affect only one side of the brain.\n\n【18】*   **Epileptic Partial Seizure** \\- A simple partial seizure affects only one side of the brain.\n\n【19】*   **Dravet Syndrome** - This is a rare form of epilepsy.\n\n【20】*   **Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome** - It is also a rare form of epilepsy.\n\n【21】*   **Hyperventilation** - Hyperventilation is rapid breathing.\n\n【22】*   **Hypotension** \\- Hypotension is known as low blood pressure. Low blood pressure on standing is also a common cause.\n\n【23】*   **Photosensitive Seizure** \\- This seizure includes exposure to flashing, flickering, and strobing lights. Striped patterns also trigger photosensitive seizures.\n\n【24】*   **Cardiovascular Syncope** \\- It is the most common cause of drop attacks in older people. It is also known as fainting and is caused by the decreased blood supply to the brain. It causes a slowdown of the heartbeat and decreases blood pressure.\n\n【25】*   **Meniere Disease** \\- It is an inner ear disorder affecting balance.\n\n【26】*   **Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity** \\- It causes a drop in blood pressure and dizziness.\n\n【27】*   **Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency** \\- It occurs because of the reduced blood flow to the back of the brain.\n\n【28】How Is a Drop Attack Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【29】As many different reasons cause the drop attack, the healthcare provider will take a medical history, physical examination, and family history. Make sure to discuss one’s medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. The healthcare provider may use different tests to diagnose the drop attacks.\n\n【30】*   **ECG (Electroencephalogram)** \\- This test detects the brain's wave patterns. The healthcare provider can use this test to isolate issues related to the brain's electrical activity.\n\n【31】*   **ENG (Electronystagmogram)** - ENG measures the involuntary movements of the eye and helps to detect the problems associated with balance.\n\n【32】*   **Audiogram** \\- Audiogram is used to identify the problems associated with the inner ear.\n\n【33】*   **ECOG (Electrocochleography)** - This test measures the electrical responses within the inner ear's cochlea.\n\n【34】*   **CT Scan (Computed Tomography)** - CT scan is used to analyze the cross-sectional images of the brain.\n\n【35】*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** \\- MRI is used if the doctor suspects a brain tumor or any other growth in the brain that is causing the symptoms.\n\n【36】What Is the Treatment for a Drop Attack?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【37】The treatment and prevention of the drop attack depends upon the cause. Sometimes, it is difficult to identify the cause of a drop attack. The treatment and preventive measures for a drop attack include:\n\n【38】*   Use anti-nausea drugs if needed.\n\n【39】*   Take antiseizure medications.\n\n【40】*   Wear a helmet to avoid head injuries during falls.\n\n【41】*   Take blood pressure medications.\n\n【42】*   Use motion sickness medications when needed.\n\n【43】*   Try stimulating the vagus nerve using an implanted device that transmits electrical energy to the brain. It will help to control other types of seizures.\n\n【44】*   In children, a ketogenic diet has been found effective for reducing seizures.\n\n【45】*   Make use of a hearing aid.\n\n【46】*   One can avoid cardiovascular causes of drop attacks by getting enough rest and staying hydrated.\n\n【47】*   In case of a slow heartbeat, a pacemaker can be used.\n\n【48】*   Attend talk therapy in case of multiple falls as it may help to identify the situations and incidents that trigger drop attacks. Also, therapy will help cope with feelings of anxiety.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Sometimes drop attacks are also referred to as atonic seizures, drop seizures, and akinetic seizures, but a seizure does not cause every drop attack. A sudden fall can happen without a cause, so it is important to get a diagnosis for the specific cause of a drop attack. It may occur once or frequently, so finding out the cause of a drop attack is one of the important ways to avoid having it again.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Drop Attack  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/drop-attack\n*   Drop attacks and vertical vertigo after trans-tympanic gentamicin: diagnosis and management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2639899/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

An abrupt, transient reduction in blood supply to the brain causes syncopal episodes, which results in loss of awareness and motor control. The person subsequently collapses or falls, allowing blood to flow back to the brain. The person can regain consciousness once blood flow has been restored.\n\n【2】What Is Heat Syncope?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Heat syncope is a moderate form of heat disease, also known as fainting or orthostatic dizziness. When the body tries to cool itself via dilation of blood vessels to the point that blood supply to the brain is limited, the syncope arises. Individuals who suffer from dehydration as a result of insufficient fluid replenishment are especially vulnerable to this condition, as their total blood volume is lowered.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Heat Syncope?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】Heat syncope occurs when blood pressure drops as the body dilates small blood vessels or arterioles present in the skin to radiate heat in a warm climate. Before the blood volume expands, this state continues for five days during heat acclimation. When a person stands up rapidly or for a long time, blood flow to the brain is diminished, resulting in light-headedness and fainting. Those who do intensive work outside in hot temperatures are more vulnerable to heat syncope.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Heat Syncope?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Heat syncope is different from heatstroke. In heatstroke, the body temperature is above 40°C (104°F) along with fainting, with or without mental confusion. Heat-syncope is a condition induced by mild overheating combined with a lack of fluids or salt. It is significantly more common in young people than actual sunstroke. Some of the symptoms which are present are:\n\n【8】*   Lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\n【9】*   A brief loss of consciousness.\n\n【10】*   Tunnel vision.\n\n【11】*   Restlessness.\n\n【12】*   Weakness.\n\n【13】*   The pulse rate has increased.\n\n【14】*   Sweaty or pale skin.\n\n【15】*   Nausea.\n\n【16】*   Vomiting.\n\n【17】*   When shifting positions, such as from a lying to a standing position, one may feel lightheadedness (orthostatic hypotension).\n\n【18】How Is Heat Syncope Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【19】A physical examination is used to make the diagnosis of heat syncope. During the physical examination, the medical practitioner will check the patient's blood pressure and pulse. If the patient is suffering from heat syncope, his or her blood pressure will be low, and the pulse will be fast. Excessive sweating will also be observed in the patient. The medical practitioner will enquire more to learn about the patient's symptoms and medical history. It would be considered an actual incidence of heat syncope if the patient acquired symptoms while engaging in physical activity at high temperatures.\n\n【20】How Is Heat Syncope Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Individuals who suffer from heat syncope usually recover rapidly, within 10 to 15 minutes, with minor therapy and monitoring.\n\n【22】**Heat syncope sufferers should:**\n\n【23】*   Sit or lie down in a cool atmosphere or environment when they start to feel the symptoms.\n\n【24】*   Drink water, juice, or an energy drink slowly, which contains salt.\n\n【25】**If the person is unconscious:**\n\n【26】*   If feasible, the legs should be raised, and the heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored.\n\n【27】*   Remove any extra clothing and use ice bags or wet towels to cool the person down.\n\n【28】*   Follow the ABCs of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which are,\n\n【29】*   **Airway** - Airway blocking should be immediately taken care of as a person's capacity to breathe can be hampered by an obstructed airway. A person should be assisted in opening their airway by placing one hand on the individual's brow and tilting their head back gently along with raising their chin with two fingers from the other hand while tilting their head.\n\n【30】*   **Breathing** - Breathing provides oxygen to the body, which keeps them alive. Hence, determining whether or not someone is breathing is critical. To see if someone is breathing normally, stare down at the torso of the person and place your ear over their mouth to hear breath sounds. The sensation of the breath on the cheek and the movement of the chest up and down should be observed. Perform this for no more than 10 seconds at a time.\n\n【31】*   **Circulation** - Circulation is to determine whether the heart is pumping blood to transport oxygen throughout the body. Organs and tissues can start to die if they do not get adequate oxygen. Chest compressions are essential for restoring blood circulation in the body if a person is not breathing.\n\n【32】*   When the person regains consciousness, they should be provided fluids and carbohydrates, for example, a light snack or sports drink, and should be advised to rest for the day.\n\n【33】*   Keep an eye on the person's vital signs to make sure he or she does not develop any other medical problems. Any underlying medical condition should be treated accordingly.\n\n【34】How to Prevent Heat Syncope?\n----------------------------\n\n【35】*   Individuals who are unacclimatized to the heat or whose bodies are not used to elevated environmental temperatures are more likely to experience heat syncope; therefore, individuals should gradually acclimate to exercise in the heat over 10 to 14 days by gradually increasing the duration and intensity of work.\n\n【36】*   Heat syncope can also be caused due to dehydration, which reduces total blood volume and makes people more susceptible to syncope. To ensure a significant blood volume, all exercising individuals should be adequately hydrated before and during the exercise. Individuals can reduce their risk of succumbing to exertional heat diseases by drinking enough liquids.\n\n【37】*   Abstaining from alcohol, avoiding exposure to hot situations, wearing clothing that blocks the sun's rays, and exercising during cooler periods of the day are all ways to prevent heat syncope.\n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】A transient loss of enough blood flow to the brain is a prevalent factor in cases of heat syncope. Blood pools at the feet and does not return to the heart or brain when standing for extended periods without muscle contractions. Wearing heavy equipment (such as football pads or fireman bunker gear) and a uniform also causes excessive sweating, which leads to dehydration. Once the symptoms have subsided and any other medical concerns have been ruled out, he or she may return to their activities. Before resuming practice, the person should rehydrate as much as needed and get medical attention.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   HEAT SYNCOPE  \n    https://ksi.uconn.edu/emergency-conditions/heat-illnesses/heat-syncope/\n*   Heat Stress - Heat Related Illness  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#syncope</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "70291bf9-a3a6-4f32-a97a-e08aac0d3994", "title": "Sub Concussion - Understanding the Risks and Consequences", "text": "【0】Sub Concussion - Understanding the Risks and Consequences\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Concussions are severe injuries to the brain caused by a blow or hit to the brain. A blow or hit to the skull can cause injury to the blood vessels and nerves in the brain and also chemical changes to the brain cells. The impact of sub-concussion does not cause severe symptoms of concussion. They cause milder symptoms compared to concussions. A concussion is a traumatic event that causes temporary headaches. But later on, they can cause problems with memory, concentration, vision, perception, and consciousness.\n\n【2】What Is Sub Concussion?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Sub concussion is an injury that impacts the head but does not lead to severe symptoms caused by a concussion.\n\n【4】*   It is an impulsive force transmitted to the head and neck. Sub concussive trauma includes bumps, blows, or jolts to the head.\n\n【5】*   Unlike concussions that have severe symptoms, sub-concussive cause mild symptoms. A collision while playing sports is one way a person can get an injury due to a traumatic event, such as a blow to the head or a biomechanical force that impacts the head. Usually, the symptoms are short-lived and resolve spontaneously.\n\n【6】*   The impact does not have a sufficient threshold to produce concussion symptoms. When the sub-concussion impact repeats many times, it can reach a noticeable threshold to causes concussion symptoms.\n\n【7】*   Collectively all these repetitive impacts of sub-concussions can lead to functional and microstructural changes in the brain cells. Sub concussive repetitive traumatic injuries can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE or brain degeneration due to traumatic injury).\n\n【8】*   Long-term effects of the sub concussions include dementia (a group of symptoms that disturbs memory and thinking).\n\n【9】*   Studies suggest that affected individuals have a 5.8 times more chance of sustaining concussion symptoms.\n\n【10】*   Several studies suggest a previous history of concussion is linked with subsequent concussions.\n\n【11】What Are the Risk Factors for Concussion and Sub Concussion?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The potential risk factors include:\n\n【13】*   Playing a contact sport such as football.\n\n【14】*   Non-contact sports, such as cricket and tennis.\n\n【15】*   Not using safety gear for the game, such as a helmet.\n\n【16】*   The collision between the players.\n\n【17】*   Being hit by a ball or object during the game.\n\n【18】*   Bike or car or bicycle accidents.\n\n【19】*   Environmental impacts like hitting with ice or board, unexpected accidents, or clashes.\n\n【20】*   Happens in non-players in the playground.\n\n【21】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Concussion and Sub Concussion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】There is a more functional disturbance of the brain than structural disturbance. The signs and symptoms can take several days to appear. The signs and symptoms of concussion are:\n\n【23】*   Bleeding or bruise.\n\n【24】*   Headaches.\n\n【25】*   Nausea or vomiting.\n\n【26】*   Vision problems.\n\n【27】*   Dizziness or fatigue.\n\n【28】*   Depression.\n\n【29】*   Anxiety.\n\n【30】*   Irregular periods.\n\n【31】*   Confusion.\n\n【32】*   Lack of concentration and memory.\n\n【33】*   Insomnia (difficulty in sleeping at night).\n\n【34】*   Problems with taste or smell.\n\n【35】*   Easily irritable.\n\n【36】*   Sensitivity to light.\n\n【37】How Does Concussion Cause Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The causes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy are explained below:\n\n【39】*   Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) causes brain degeneration due to repeated head trauma. Persistent head traumas cause this condition.\n\n【40】*   Repetitive head trauma, the severity of the impact, and the number of concussions are the contributing factors for CTE.\n\n【41】*   They develop years after the trauma has occurred.\n\n【42】*   Concussions are a common type of brain injury. Traumatic brain injury caused by cumulative sub-concussions is more common.\n\n【43】*   Traumatic brain injuries can cause death. 30 percent of all injury-related death is attributed to traumatic brain injuries. The cost of the treatment of concussions is also expensive. Concussions and sub-concussions are fast-paced injuries due to a fall, a blow in the head while playing contact sports, or motor vehicle or bicycle accidents.\n\n【44】*   The blow to the head or skull causes damaging effects such as chemical changes in the brain cells.\n\n【45】*   Concussion leads to neurometabolic changes in the brain. They cause cognitive impairment and cellular damage to the brain.\n\n【46】*   The affected individuals have significantly low memory two days post the injury. CTE is diagnosed by taking an autopsy of a section of the brain.\n\n【47】How Does Sub-Concussion Cause Cognitive Impairment?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】The sub-concussion causes cognitive impairment, as explained below:\n\n【49】*   Cognitive impairment causes a decline in mental abilities such as memory and thinking. Their mental abilities become low compared to others of the same chronological age.\n\n【50】*   The changes can be mild or severe. The mild symptoms do not interfere much with the normal functioning of life.\n\n【51】*   Cognitive depression is characterized by the inability to learn new things, slow mental processing, and getting easily distracted by external factors. The acute effects of concussion cause neurocognitive problems such as distraction, low cognitive efficiency, and low verbal fluency.\n\n【52】*   The affected individuals return to their normal cognitive states five days after the concussion.\n\n【53】*   Neurocognitive testing helps detect long-term and short-term cognitive effects after a concussion.\n\n【54】What Are the Diagnostic Tests Done for Sub Concussion?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】The physician evaluates the signs and symptoms. A neurological examination is conducted. A neurological examination, imaging tests, and cognitive testing are recommended.\n\n【56】*   **Neurological Examination -** It evaluates vision, hearing, strength and sensation, balance, and coordination.\n\n【57】*   **Cognitive Testing -** It involves the evaluation of memory and concentration.\n\n【58】*   **Computerized Tomography (CT) -** It is a standard test to examine the brain after injury. The cross-sectional images of the skull and brain are taken for evaluation.\n\n【59】*   **Computerized Neurocognitive Test Batteries -** It measures mild to severe degrees of cognitive decline and general cognitive well-being in children and adults. The online cognitive test evaluates the affected individual’s cognitive functions, such as reasoning, memory, attention, planning, and coordination. Neurocognitive testing batteries are used to find the factors influencing an individual's cognitive ability. Recently neurocognitive testing has played a significant role in treating sports-related sub-concussions. It is considered the cornerstone of concussion treatment. Because paper and pencil tests are time-consuming, these computerized neurocognitive test batteries are better used to find recovery progress and neurocognitive impairments. It helps make decisions significantly when the person has delayed response and decision-making. The cognitive test is taken on a phone or computer. It takes around 30 to 40 minutes to complete. The results are generated in the user’s profile. It represents the cognitive skills of the person. It is not a substitute for clinical diagnosis. It is used in addition to professional diagnosis.\n\n【60】The sports-related concussions are accessed through computerized neuropsychological test batteries like:\n\n【61】*   Immediate post-concussion assessment and cognitive testing (ImPACT)\n\n【62】*   CogSport.\n\n【63】*   Automated neuropsychological assessment metrics (ANAM).\n\n【64】*   HeadMinder (concussion resolution index: CRI).\n\n【65】How Do Mouthguards Prevent Sub Concussions?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【66】Mouthguards have shock absorption capability. Wearing a custom-made, properly fitted mouthguard can reduce the rate of concussion. The immediate impact on the brain and the beginning of the spinal cord causes a concussion. It is also caused by the lower jaw being driven against the skull where the joints are located. It helps absorb shock and stabilize the head and neck. It also limits the movements caused by a direct hit to the jaws. A custom mouthguard is more effective than a standard mouthguard in reducing concussions.\n\n【67】What Is the Treatment for Sub-Concussion?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【68】Physical rest and mental rest is very essential for quick recovery. Slow-sensitive activities can be carried out because too much rest can slow the process of recovery. Physical activity, playing video games, reading books, and watching television can help. Gradually increasing the activities day by day helps in speedy recovery.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Sub-concussions are mild injuries to the brain. Many people recover smoothly without long-term complications. But any mild injury to the head should be evaluated by the doctor to prevent future complications. Repetitive concussions can be dangerous. Usually, the sub-concussion symptoms persist for a few days, and they disappear. But the reoccurrence of symptoms can be pretty dangerous.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   Concussion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537017/#\n*   Effects of Subconcussive Head Trauma on the Default Mode Network of the Brain  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4238241/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The interrupted normal vascular supply to a section of the head of the femur bone can cause the bone to break into tiny pieces, finally leading to its collapse along with hip joint destruction. This is a very gradual process taking approximately months to years to show its adverse effects.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Hip Osteonecrosis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact cause of hip osteonecrosis is unknown, but multiple predisposing factors have been identified that can lead to the development of the condition.\n\n【4】*   **Traumatic Injury**\\- Fractures of the hips, hip joint dislocations, or radiation injury to the bone marrow elements of the bone can result in damage to the extraosseous vascular supply, thereby disrupting the blood supply to the bone.\n\n【5】*   **Alcohol Overuse**\\- Excessive consumption of alcohol has been attributed as one of the main risk factors in the development of the condition. Fatty acids can be deposited in the blood vessels, thereby elevating the cortisone levels due to alcohol abuse. This results in reduced blood supply to the section of the bone.\n\n【6】*   **Long-Term Corticosteroid Consumption**\\- High doses of alcohol consumed for a longer period of time can serve as a major risk factor for the condition.\n\n【7】*   **Certain Medical Diseases-** Sickle cell anemia, Caisson’s disease (decompression caused in scuba diving leading to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the arterioles, thereby occluding them), systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, Cushing's disease, leukemias, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, thrombosis, and Gaucher’s disease are some of the medical conditions that have been found to be associated with the condition.\n\n【8】*   **Smoking, Pregnancy, and a Few Viral Infections** - Have also been found to be associated with hip osteonecrosis in a few cases.\n\n【9】*   **Genetic Predisposition** - It is also seen in some cases.\n\n【10】What Is the Pathogenesis of Hip Osteonecrosis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   Traumatic injury to the femoral head of the bone causes damage to the femoral artery supplying the femur bone leading to the death of the bone cells that are present in the bony matrix. This further results in the weakening of the bone structure, causing the collapse of the femur bone and polyarthritis of the hip joint.\n\n【12】*   The pathogenesis of hip avascular necrosis in cases that occurs from the influence of predisposing factors is the result of intravascular coagulation. The intravascular coagulation causes venous thrombosis, subsequently leading to occluded arterial supply. This, in turn, raises the intraosseous pressure leading to the disrupted blood supply to the head of the femur bone, eventually causing bone cell death and bone collapse with arthritic joint pathologies.\n\n【13】What Is the Epidemiology of Hip Osteonecrosis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The incidence rate of the disease is estimated to be approximately 20,000 to 30,000 new cases yearly in the United States of America. Males are more frequently involved than females. The disease is more commonly seen in the age group of the 3rd to 5th decades of life. The condition has a tendency to occur bilaterally.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Hip Osteonecrosis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   Hip pain is typically the first symptom reported by the patients.\n\n【17】*   The pain onset is often insidious.\n\n【18】*   Continuous dull, throbbing ache or pain in the groin region is the most common symptom reported.\n\n【19】*   This dull aching pain is transferred to the thigh bone and buttocks.\n\n【20】*   With the progression of the disease, it becomes tough to stand and apply pressure on the affected side of the hip.\n\n【21】*   There is restricted hip movement on the affected side with severe pain in the hips on continuous standing posture or climbing stairs.\n\n【22】*   The disease usually takes months to years for its course to progress.\n\n【23】How Is Hip Osteonecrosis Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【24】*   **Complete Health Checkup**: The first and foremost thing to do by a healthcare clinician is to perform a complete health checkup of the patient, including their proper medical history.\n\n【25】*   **Imaging Procedures:** Like x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to evaluate the disease.\n\n【26】    *   **X-Rays**\\- It is recommended to detect any signs of fracture in the bone or arthritic changes in the hip joint.\n\n【27】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-** It is recommended if the radiograph shows negative findings and the condition is still suspected.\n\n【28】How Is Hip Osteonecrosis Classified?\n------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   The avascular osteonecrosis of the hip is classified into four stages based on the Ficat and Arlet classification.\n\n【30】*   This staging system makes use of radiographs, MRIs, and clinical signs and symptoms to classify the osteonecrosisofthe femoral head of the hip.\n\n【31】#### Ficat and Arlet Classification:\n\n【32】*   **Stage 0**\n\n【33】    *   **Radiographic Findings:** Normal.\n\n【34】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** No pathology detected.\n\n【35】    *   **Clinical Symptoms:** Absent.\n\n【36】*   **Stage I**\n\n【37】    *   **Radiographic Findings**: Mild osteopenia is detected or normal x-ray findings.\n\n【38】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Bone marrow edema may be possibly seen.\n\n【39】    *   **Clinical Symptoms:** Pain possibly present in the groin region.\n\n【40】*   **Stage II**\n\n【41】    *   **Radiographic Findings:** Marked osteopenia with the presence of subchondral cysts and sclerosis with joint space collapse.\n\n【42】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Marks the geographical area of involvement of the head of femur bone.\n\n【43】    *   **Clinical Symptoms:** Pain in the groin and thigh region with restricted hip movement, stiffness, and pain while climbing stairs or even standing.\n\n【44】*   **Stage III**\n\n【45】    *   **Radiographic Findings:** The crescent sign is observed with the collapse of the joint space, degenerative changes of the hip joint along with loss of morphological anatomy of the femur head.\n\n【46】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Similar finding to x-ray.\n\n【47】    *   **Clinical Symptoms:** Pain in the groin region that is referred to as knee, limp is seen, and difficulty in performing routine activities like climbing stairs.\n\n【48】*   **Stage IV**\n\n【49】    *   **Radiographic Findings:** An end-stage disease with extensive destruction of the joint followed by complete closure of the joint space. Femoral bone collapse.\n\n【50】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Similar to the radiographic findings.\n\n【51】    *   **Clinical Symptoms:** Severe pain, joint stiffness, and gait are altered with pain even at rest.\n\n【52】What Is the Treatment of Hip Osteonecrosis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The management of osteonecrosis of the hip includes both conservative and surgical procedures.\n\n【54】Non-operative Management Includes:\n\n【55】*   Ice packs.\n\n【56】*   Heat therapy.\n\n【57】*   Proper rest is recommended.\n\n【58】*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the symptom of pain.\n\n【59】*   Bisphosphonate therapy.\n\n【60】*   Physiotherapy to increase hip joint mobility and motion.\n\n【61】**Surgical Management Includes:**\n\n【62】*   Core decompression of the femoral bone by drilling small holes (cores) in the lesional bone to improve the vascular supply to the bone. Stem cell injections can also be included in this procedure.\n\n【63】*   Bone grafts can be used to accelerate the healing process.\n\n【64】*   Hip Joint replacement (in this procedure, the diseased part of the hip joint is removed by the surgeon, and an artificial joint is inserted).\n\n【65】*   Hip arthroplasty (total hip replacement).\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】Hip osteonecrosis has a very high morbidity rate if the condition is left untreated. Therefore, a team of healthcare professionals should work in coordination to treat the patient effectively. The disease should be diagnosed properly by correlating the clinical features with the imaging findings in order to best manage the condition at the earliest. The patient should be educated about the risk factors of the disease to better judge their medical condition and act accordingly.\n\n【68】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【69】* * *\n\n【70】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Osteonecrosis Curable?**\n\n【71】Nonsurgical methods help treat osteonecrosis symptoms but will not treat the condition or slow its progression. Instead, the doctor may suggest one or more options like anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroid injections to reduce swelling and pain, physiotherapy, walking aides like canes and crutches.\n\n【72】#### **2.**删除换行**What Are the Various Stages of Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【73】Based on the severity and degree of damage to the femoral head, osteonecrosis can be classified into four stages and below:  \n - Stage 0: X rays are normal.  \n - Stage 1: Stage 1 is normal, but an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a dead bone.  \n - Stage 2: Standard x-ray can be observed, but the femoral ball does not collapse.  \n - Stage 3: Exhibits collapse symptoms (also known as a crescent sign).  \n - Stage 4: Collapse and evidence of cartilage injury (osteoarthritis).\n\n【74】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Walking Good for Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【75】The patient must avoid stress on the affected area in the early stages of osteonecrosis. Reduce standing and walking as much as possible if hips or knees hurt. Leg elevation while sitting. The doctor may prescribe crutches or a cane to help relieve some of the weight from the injured joint or joints. In addition, the doctor may suggest avoiding or minimizing weight-bearing activities like unprotected walking, standing, and carrying.\n\n【76】#### **4.**删除换行**Who Gets Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【77】Osteonecrosis can affect persons of any age, but it most frequently affects people in their 30s and 40s. Osteonecrosis cases associated with trauma are differentiated from nontraumatic or atraumatic cases by the presence of an injury.\n\n【78】#### **5.**删除换行**How Does Osteonecrosis Develop?**\n\n【79】Osteonecrosis can be brought on by disease or severe trauma, including a fracture or dislocation, which disrupts the bone's blood supply. However, osteonecrosis can also develop without injury or illness.\n\n【80】#### **6.**删除换行**What Happens if Osteonecrosis Is Not Treated?**\n\n【81】If osteonecrosis is left untreated, the joint may deteriorate and develop severe arthritis.\n\n【82】#### **7.**删除换行**Does Osteonecrosis Diagnose on X-Ray?**\n\n【83】X-rays or plain radiography can only detect osteonecrosis-related changes in stages two and up. Plain X-rays cannot detect osteonecrosis changes in stages 1 or 0. Other imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography can show detailed images of the early stages of osteonecrosis.\n\n【84】#### **8.**删除换行**How Common Is Osteonecrosis of the Hip?**\n\n【85】Osteonecrosis is often referred to as aseptic or avascular necrosis (AVN). Osteonecrosis typically affects the hip, though it can affect any bone. Each year, more than 20,000 patients seek treatment for hip osteonecrosis in hospitals. The condition frequently affects both hips.\n\n【86】#### **9.**删除换行**How Much Time Does Osteonecrosis Take To develop?**\n\n【87】Osteonecrosis is the absence of blood supply that causes bone tissue to die. As a result, the bone may collapse due to minor breaks in the bone. In most cases, the procedure takes months or even years.\n\n【88】#### **10.**删除换行**What Increases the Risk of Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【89】The risk factors of osteonecrosis include:  \n - Gaucher disease.  \n - Pancreatitis.  \n - Autoimmune disorders.   \n - Cancer.  \n - HIV infection.  \n - Decompression disease (Caisson disease).  \n - Blood conditions such as sickle cell disease.\n\n【90】#### **11.**删除换行**What Medication Most Commonly Cause Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【91】The most common medicines that cause osteonecrosis are corticosteroids and ethanol. Adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, anti-cancer therapies, chemicals containing arsenic, and antiretroviral drugs, including protease inhibitors, are a few additional medicines that have been found to have the potential to cause osteonecrosis.\n\n【92】#### **12.**删除换行**How Is Osteonecrosis Reversed?**\n\n【93】If osteonecrosis is diagnosed before it has advanced, medication may be able to reverse bone damage. However, if the disease has severely damaged a joint, a surgeon specializing in joint-preserving and joint-replacement surgery can undertake procedures to increase mobility and reduce discomfort.\n\n【94】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is the Prognosis of Osteonecrosis?**\n\n【95】Despite the initial treatment plan, osteonecrosis generally has a poor prognosis. The disease progresses with discomfort, disability, and irreparable joint damage.\n\n【96】#### **14.**删除换行**Is Osteonecrosis a Cancerous condition?**\n\n【97】No, osteonecrosis is not cancerous. People without a history of cancer are more likely to develop osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis occurs when the bone dies due to a reduction in blood supply to the bone tissue. The hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles are more prone to it the most. Chronic steroid usage, alcoholism, joint traumas, and certain diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis may cause this condition.\n\n【98】#### **15.**删除换行**Does Osteonecrosis Require Surgery?**\n\n【99】Yes, surgery is required for advanced stages of osteonecrosis. Patients with early osteonecrosis but a high chance of developing advanced hip arthritis should undergo core decompression and stem cell infusion. Patients who have severe arthritis may require total hip replacement surgery.\n\n【100】#### **16.**删除换行**Do Osteonecrosis Spread to Other Bones?**\n\n【101】Osteonecrosis by itself does not spread to other bones of the body. However, several conditions result in avascular necrosis in numerous body joints. In addition, osteonecrosis may affect numerous bones in certain disorders.\n\n【102】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【103】无关删除-1:<u>*   Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head: an Updated Review of ARCO on Pathogenesis, Staging and Treatment  \n    https://jkms.org/pdf/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e177\n*   Osteonecrosis of the femoral head: Pathophysiology and current concepts of treatment  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331786015\\_Osteonecrosis\\_of\\_the\\_femoral\\_head\\_Pathophysiology\\_and\\_current\\_concepts\\_of\\_treatment\n*   Osteonecrosis of the Hip: A Primer  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380478/\n*   Algorithm for Treatment of Hip and Knee Osteonecrosis: Review and a Presentation of Three Example Cases  \n    https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jrdt/journal-of-rheumatic-diseases-and-treatment-jrdt-3-053.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

People found it really hard to wrap their heads around the fact that consulting a doctor without actually having to meet them personally is never going to be an option. Because let’s face it, this is how we have been trained to do things. Whenever we had a cold, cough, fever or any medical ailment, our parents would immediately take us to the family doctor.\n\n【1】But now, **telemedicine is an essential part of the healthcare system around the world**. This has made specialized, quality, and convenient health care services available to millions of people in areas with limited healthcare facilities.\n\n【2】In the current pandemic, with hospitals being the hotspots for the spread of COVID-19, many chronically ill patients and others are turning to telemedicine platforms for help. The Indian government made telemedicine legal on March 25th, 2020, as they recognized it as a potential way to help the population and curb the spread of this deadly infection.\n\n【3】What Is Telemedicine?\n---------------------\n\n【4】Telemedicine is a tool, which makes healthcare accessible and cost-effective to patients. People living in rural areas, who have difficulties in accessing physicians, can now consult them virtually.\n\n【5】Such platforms help physicians and patients share information in real-time through their computers or smartphones. This skips the need for the patient to wait for an appointment, and also the travel needed to reach the doctor’s office or hospital. This concept of teleconsultation is perfect for the new tech-savvy population, as it is convenient, cost-effective, and intelligent.\n\n【6】The WHO (World Health Organization) calls telemedicine “healing from a distance.“ You no longer have to schedule an appointment with a physician to get treated. With the help of video and phone consultations, experienced and trained doctors are just a call away.\n\n【7】Types of Telemedicine Services:\n-------------------------------\n\n【8】The following are some types of telemedicine that can be used to help patients:\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Stay Home but Stay ACTIVE</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>1.  **Interactive Medicine** \\- It is also called “real-time or live telemedicine.” While maintaining HIPAA compliance, this type of telemedicine helps doctors and patients to communicate in real-time. This includes both phone and video consultations. The doctors can get access to the patient’s medical history and can interact more with the patient\n\n【13】2.  **Store-and-Forward** - This type allows healthcare providers to store and share patient information with a remote specialist. Meaning, the primary care doctor can share patient records with a specialist who is not in the same room. This helps the specialist know what treatments and tests other doctors have previously done.\n\n【14】3.  **Remote Patient Monitoring** - This is mostly preferred by older adults, as it permits physicians to monitor patients in their homes. The doctors can use patient portals, which are **online applications that let patients interact with their physicians 24x7**, to gather information and help their patients. They can also share vital signs using digital machines to send them to the physician so that the treatment plan can be altered accordingly.\n    </u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>What Is Telehealth?\n-------------------</u>\n\n【16】Telehealth is the use of electronic information and telecommunication to support and promote remote clinical health care, patient education, public health, and health administration. The difference between telehealth and telemedicine is telehealth also includes non-clinical programs such as administrative meetings, medical education and training.\n\n【17】Unlike telemedicine, telehealth is a collection of methods to improve education delivery and patient care. Thus, it includes telemedicine and telecare.\n\n【18】What Is Teleconsultation?\n-------------------------\n\n【19】Teleconsultation is the process of providing remote diagnosis and electronic prescription without the help of clinical examination. Here, patients and doctors connect with each other using the internet, telemedicine apps, and smartphones. Both doctors and patients will have to register themselves on an online healthcare platform like iCliniq.com. Then, the patient can consult a doctor either through a text message by writing down their complaint, symptoms, past medical history, or tests that are done, or they can call a doctor instantly or can choose a later time according to their convenience. The doctor will then look at the symptoms and test reports or pictures attached, and diagnose the condition, prescribe medicines, or ask for further tests.\n\n【20】What Are the Advantages and Benefits of Telemedicine?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Teleconsultation has been considered highly essential to the healthcare system today, especially with the current pandemic. With patients scared to visit hospitals and clinics being closed, teleconsultation might just be the safest and smartest option available.\n\n【22】Apart from this, the benefits or advantages of teleconsultation include:\n\n【23】1.  **No Travel** - You can now consult a doctor from the comforts of your home.

During constipation, your child may have a hard poop and may not go to the toilet regularly. They are more frequent, particularly when they begin to take solid foods and around the time of toilet training. Let us get into the article for detailed information about constipation and its warning signs that may help the parents to take care of their constipated child.\n\n【2】What Is Constipation?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Constipation is when a child experiences hard, dry stools with fewer bowel movements that may be painful and difficult to pass out. Normally, a breastfed baby may poop after each meal, whereas bottle-fed and older children will poop once a day or two. Generally, during the first month after birth, bowel movements tend to be once daily.\n\n【4】Before learning more about constipation, many may wonder what is the meaning of bowel we are talking about?\n\n【5】What Is Meant by Bowel and What Is the Normal Pattern?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Here is the answer to this question. Bowel patterns or movements define how and when the stools are passed. It may vary in each child, like the adults. Some children may have one or two bowel movements a day, and some have once every two days or three days.\n\n【7】What Causes Constipation in Your Baby?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【8】When the stool or feces remains in the colon for a longer time, it absorbs more water and leaves the stool dry and hard. This causes difficulty in passing through the colon, causing constipation. Some of the other causes are:\n\n【9】*   Not taking adequate water and fluids.\n\n【10】*   Lack of fiber-rich food in your child's diet. Also, due to soft drinks, junk foods, etc.\n\n【11】*   Switching to solid foods or from breastmilk to formula milk.\n\n【12】*   Lack of physical activity in your baby. Exercises help to move the digested food through the intestines.\n\n【13】*   Your child may ignore the urge to poop as they may be engaged in play or uncomfortable using public toilets.\n\n【14】*   Sometimes the child withholds the painful bowel movements and hard stools.\n\n【15】*   Some children may be allergic to cow’s milk. Consumption of too many dairy products may result in constipation.\n\n【16】*   If the family members experience constipation, then the child is more prone to develop this condition. This may be due to shared genetic and environmental factors.\n\n【17】Some medical conditions can cause constipation in your child. They are:\n\n【18】*   Bowel diseases affect the bowel muscles, intestinal tract, anus, and rectum.\n\n【19】*   The use of certain medications such as antidepressants and iron supplements can cause constipation.\n\n【20】*   Neurological problems, cerebral palsy, etc.\n\n【21】How to Identify Constipation in Your Baby?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Some children may strain and cry when they have a bowel movement. This does not mean it is constipation. As long as the stool is soft, there is likely no problem.\n\n【23】Some signs that help you to identify constipation in your baby are:\n\n【24】*   Hard and dry stools.\n\n【25】*   Difficulty in passing out stools. Pain during bowel movements.\n\n【26】*   Being very restless, changing their body positions and clenching their buttocks during bowel movements.\n\n【27】*   Belly pain, cramps, and bloating.\n\n【28】*   Liquid or stool traces in their underwear. It is a sign of stool backed up in the rectum.\n\n【29】*   Blood in the stool.\n\n【30】*   Not feeling hungry.\n\n【31】*   Having less than three bowel movements in a week.\n\n【32】*   Anal fissures are caused due to strainful passage of large stools.\n\n【33】What Is Encopresis?\n-------------------\n\n【34】When your child faces constipation for a longer duration, it causes them to soil their pants with poop. This occurs when the child's rectum gets full with stools and is stretched. This makes them poop in their pants even without their awareness. This is called \"encopresis\" or \"fecal incontinence.\"\n\n【35】How Does the Doctor Diagnose Constipation?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The doctor diagnoses constipation in your baby from the history you provide them. So keep a record of all the things you notice during constipation. Things to be told to the doctor are\n\n【37】*   If there was any dietary change, you made it for your baby.\n\n【38】*   Frequency of bowel movements.\n\n【39】*   Pain felt while pooping.\n\n【40】*   Were there any toilet training practices done recently?\n\n【41】*   Were there any stressful events in your child's life recently?\n\n【42】This history helps the doctor to provide a clear diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n【43】What Are the Tests Done to Know the Cause of Constipation in Your Child?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】1.  **Abdominal X-Ray:** To check the amount of stool present in the large intestine.\n\n【45】2.  **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):** The doctor puts his gloved, greased finger into the child's rectum to detect any abnormalities.\n\n【46】3.  **Barium Enema:** It is an X-ray examination of the rectum, large intestine, and lower parts of the small intestine. Barium is a metallic fluid taken in a tube and inserted into the child's rectum. This barium coats the organs and can be examined. It shows any narrow areas, blockage, or any other problems.\n\n【47】4.  **Anorectal Manometry:** This test checks the strength of the bowel muscles and your child’s ability to sense that rectum is full.\n\n【48】5.  **Sigmoidoscopy:** Sigmoidoscope is a short, flexible, lighted tube inserted into the child's rectum. This blows air into the rectum causing it to swell for easier examination.\n\n【49】6.  **Colonoscopy:** This test checks the full length of the large intestine for any abnormal growth, tissues, etc.\n\n【50】7.  **Lab Tests:** Certain investigations rule out conditions such as celiac disease, urinary tract infection, blood lead level, thyroid, and metabolic problems.\n\n【51】When to See the Doctor?\n-----------------------\n\n【52】Constipation is not a serious condition. However, chronic constipation can be a sign of any underlying medical condition. When constipation continues for more than two weeks, and if any of the following signs are present, then it is time to take your child to the doctor. They are :\n\n【53】1.  An infant younger than two months of age is constipated.\n\n【54】2.  If your child has a fever, is not eating, and presence of blood in the stools.\n\n【55】3.  A child is experiencing weight loss.\n\n【56】4.  Presence of red, swollen veins in the rectum (hemorrhoids).\n\n【57】5.  If you notice a part of the intestine coming out of the anus (rectal prolapse).\n\n【58】Can Constipation Be Prevented?\n------------------------------\n\n【59】Lifestyle modification and dietary changes can prevent constipation in your child.\n\n【60】*   Provide them with extra water and juices in between feedings.\n\n【61】*   If your baby has started to take solid foods, supply them with high fiber-rich foods such as peas, beans, prunes, spinach, etc.\n\n【62】*   Avoid certain foods such as cheese, meat, and processed foods.\n\n【63】*   Encourage your child for more physical activity.\n\n【64】*   Practicing good bowel habits. Train your child into a regular toilet habit. Let your child sit on the toilet for 10 minutes twice a day, especially after meals.\n\n【65】How Can Constipation Be Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【66】If constipation does not get cured even after the dietary modifications and lifestyle changes, then the doctor may treat the child with medications to remove the stool from the body.\n\n【67】*   **Use of Laxatives or Enema:** This removes the blockage and softens the hardened stool. Never give your child a laxative without the doctor's concern.\n\n【68】*   **Hospital Enema:** In case of severe constipation, a child may require hospitalization to receive a stronger enema that clears the bowel present in the colon.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Constipation is not a serious disorder or disease that you have to worry about. A healthy lifestyle and dietary modifications can prevent constipation in your child. In case your child experiences constipation, simple home remedies can cure constipation in your child, only if it continues for more than two weeks, then seek your doctor and get treatment to improve the condition of the child.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Signs of Constipation?**\n\n【74】Some children may strain and cry when they have a bowel movement.

They can be caused by infections, certain foods, or medications. It can be due to infections, food poisoning, or lactose intolerance. Diarrhea is the more frequent loose stool that can be accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In chronic cases, weight loss is also seen. They are usually diagnosed by testing the stool samples and treated with antibiotics and antidiarrheal medications.\n\n【2】What Is the Difference Between Loose Stools and Diarrhea?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Loose stools are known for their loose consistency. They are mushy, can hold their shape, or do not hold their shape once they go into the toilet bowl. It can happen in regular intervals or occasionally.\n\n【4】Diarrhea is a more frequent loose stool that occurs more than three to four times a day.\n\n【5】What Causes Loose Stools and Diarrhea?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】Though there is a difference in the frequency of loose bowel movements between loose stools and diarrhea, the causes are the same.\n\n【7】*   Food contaminated by bacteria.\n\n【8】*   Laxative abuse.\n\n【9】*   Viruses like the influenza virus, rotavirus, or norovirus.\n\n【10】*   Tiny parasitic organisms present in water or food.\n\n【11】*   Lactose intolerance.\n\n【12】*   Diseases like Crohn’s disease that affect the stomach and the intestines.\n\n【13】*   Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Loose Stools and Diarrhea?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Loose stools do not show symptoms other than loose and mushy stools. Whereas diarrhea is accompanied by symptoms like,\n\n【16】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【17】*   Abdominal bloating.\n\n【18】*   Abdominal cramps.\n\n【19】*   Fever.\n\n【20】*   Vomiting.\n\n【21】*   Nausea.\n\n【22】*   Weight loss.\n\n【23】How Are Loose Stools and Diarrhea Differentiated?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】*   Loose stool is the beginning of diarrhea.\n\n【25】*   The physician will question the affected person to figure out the cause,\n\n【26】    *   Questions like, when did the loose stool start?\n\n【27】    *   How often does the loose stool happen?\n\n【28】    *   What is the consistency of the stool?\n\n【29】    *   Recent history of food intake.\n\n【30】    *   History of blood in stool will also be asked.\n\n【31】*   Diarrhea diagnosis needs stool sampling and blood tests, etc.\n\n【32】**What Medical Conditions Cause Loose Stools and Diarrhea?**\n\n【33】*   Celiac Disease: Celiac disease occurs when there is a change in the immune reaction when exposed to gluten-rich foods like wheat, barley, and rye. It damages the covering that lines the small intestine leading to inflammation.\n\n【34】*   Crohn’s Disease: Crohn’s disease is a variant of irritable bowel syndrome that causes inflammation of the layer of tissues lining the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【35】*   Ulcerative Colitis: Ulcerative colitis is the inflammation of the layer of tissue lining the colon.\n\n【36】*   Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Irritable bowel syndrome is a digestive tract disease that causes irritation to the large intestine leading to symptoms like bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, and both.\n\n【37】What Tests Are Done to Find the Causes?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   **Stool Test:** A stool sample test is done to find out the organism causing diarrhea or loose stools.\n\n【39】*   **Complete Blood Count:** A complete blood count is done to find any abnormalities in the changes in the normal ranges of blood components like red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, eosinophils, hemoglobin, etc. The changes in the normal ranges denote if there is an infection.\n\n【40】*   **Breath Test:** A breath test is performed to check for the presence of H. pylori bacteria. The affected person is made to blow into a balloon, and the breath is checked for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria.\n\n【41】*   **Endoscopy:** An endoscopic procedure is performed with a flimsy, flexible tubular structure that has a camera, a light, and portals for instrument attachment. It is inserted into the mouth to check for any abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【42】**What Dietary Modifications Help the Cessation of Diarrhea and Loose Stools?**\n\n【43】*   Staying hydrated with ample fluids, including juices or broth that have salt and sugar in them.\n\n【44】*   Consume easily digestible foods like potatoes, bananas, rice, oatmeal, soup, etc.\n\n【45】*   Take probiotics like yogurt or curd.\n\n【46】*   Consume fiber-rich foods that aid in smooth bowel movements.\n\n【47】**What Factors Affect the Color and Consistency of Loose Stools and Diarrhea?**\n\n【48】*   Vegetables that have deep colors, like green vegetables and beetroot, change the color of the stools.\n\n【49】*   Foods rich in fat and high-fiber foods also cause changes in stool consistency.\n\n【50】*   Gluten-rich foods.\n\n【51】*   Milk and dairy products.\n\n【52】*   Iron tablets.\n\n【53】*   Gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【54】*   Certain medications.\n\n【55】*   Gastrointestinal obstructions.\n\n【56】*   Medications that contain bismuth, like Pepto-Bismol.\n\n【57】*   Cancer and hemorrhoids.\n\n【58】*   A few diseases of the gastrointestinal tract also cause changes in stool consistency.\n\n【59】How Are They Treated?\n---------------------\n\n【60】Loose stools and diarrhea are treated with,\n\n【61】*   **Antibiotics:** Suitable antibiotic medications will be recommended to treat the infection.\n\n【62】*   **Intravenous Fluid Therapy:** Intravenous fluid therapy is considered when a patient has chronic diarrhea and to prevent and treat dehydration.\n\n【63】*   **Anti-diarrheal Medication:** Antidiarrheal medications like Loperamide or Bismuth subsalicylate reduces gastric motility and helps in reducing bowel movement.\n\n【64】*   **Dietary Modifications:** Dietary modifications must be considered in patients who have frequent loose stools, and an appropriate diet should be substituted.\n\n【65】*   **Other Medications:** Certain medications that cause diarrhea or loose stools as side effects need to be stopped after consulting with a personal physician.\n\n【66】Can Loose Stools and Diarrhea Be Prevented?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【67】*   Avoid foods that trigger increased gastric motility leading to diarrhea and loose stools.\n\n【68】*   Washing hands before eating food.\n\n【69】*   Cleaning hands with handwash prior to and after using a restroom.\n\n【70】*   Washing hands thoroughly before cooking food, after taking out the waste bin, changing diapers, petting animals, and after cleaning or blowing your nose.\n\n【71】*   Washing or cleaning fruits and vegetables before eating.\n\n【72】*   Thoroughly cooking meat and seafood until done completely.\n\n【73】*   Maintaining the refrigerator temperature at 40 Fahrenheit and the freezer temperature below -17.7 celsius.\n\n【74】*   Wash the kitchen counter and vessels after they are in contact with raw fruits or vegetables.\n\n【75】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【76】*   Dehydration: When there is prolonged diarrhea or loose motion, the water, by default, present in the body, is also removed through repeated water loose stools. This leads to dehydration.\n\n【77】*   Malnutrition: Since there is chronic diarrhea or loose stools’ the gastric contents are emptied at intervals leaving the stomach empty. The necessary nutrients are removed from the body through the stools leaving the person weak and malnourished.\n\n【78】When Is It Considered a Medical Emergency?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【79】*   When there are signs of severe dehydration like looking pale, dry mouth, and feeling extremely weak and tired to walk.\n\n【80】*   Blood or pus in the stools.\n\n【81】*   Higher fever that is 102 degrees or above.\n\n【82】*   Diarrhea or loose stools that exist for two or more days in adults.\n\n【83】*   If diarrhea or loose stools last for more than 24 hours in children, medical attention is needed,\n\n【84】*   If the stools are black or tarry in color.\n\n【85】**Conclusion:**\n\n【86】Loose stools and diarrhea occur due to changes in bowel movements when exposed to contaminated food or water due to side effects of certain medications, underlying medical conditions, etc. The primary distinction between loose stools and diarrhea is a change in the consistency of stool that becomes soft and mushy, whereas in diarrhea, if the frequency of loose stools is more than three to four times a day, it is diarrhea. Also, they lead to dehydration and malnutrition, so getting treatment when symptoms appear initially and keeping one well-hydrated will improve the condition and prevent complications. It can be treated with certain antibiotics, anti-diarrheal medications, and increased intake of fluids and probiotics.\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【88】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diarrhea: Overview  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK373090/\n*   Acute Diarrhea in Adults  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/0700/acute-diarrhea.html\n*   Diarrhea  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28846339/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "598394ed-3fe2-40c7-bf66-f0ef3ceefb95", "title": "Aerosol Delivery Devices in Cystic Fibrosis and Asthma - An Overview", "text": "【0】Aerosol Delivery Devices in Cystic Fibrosis and Asthma - An Overview\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Aerosol delivery is a technique of administering medication directly into the lungs and airways. The inhaled drugs pass from the trachea to the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately to the alveolar sacs, where the gaseous exchange occurs. The most commonly administered drugs are bronchodilators, mucolytics, and corticosteroids. The therapy has proven effective in treating obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis.\n\n【2】What Are the Advantages of Aerosol Therapy Over Oral Drug Administration?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The major advantages of aerosol therapy are:\n\n【4】*   Rapid onset of action.\n\n【5】*   Lower requirement of drug dosage.\n\n【6】*   Delivered directly into the airways.\n\n【7】*   Reduces systemic side effects.\n\n【8】What Are the Methods of Aerosol Delivery?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【9】There are multiple devices available:\n\n【10】*   Pressurized metered dose inhaler.\n\n【11】*   Dry powder inhaler.\n\n【12】*   Soft mist inhaler.\n\n【13】*   Jet nebulizer.\n\n【14】*   Mesh nebulizer.\n\n【15】*   Ultrasonic nebulizer.\n\n【16】What Is a Pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】It is the most widely used inhalational device. It is a portable, compact, multi-dose device suitable for emergencies. The aluminum canister contains the drug, which is either in solution, suspension, or co-suspension form. The co-suspension form is one of the most recent advances in this field and provides a more consistent drug delivery. It also consists of propellants, surfactants, and suspending agents.\n\n【18】**The major advantage is**:\n\n【19】*   Portable.\n\n【20】*   Deliver multiple doses.\n\n【21】*   Fewer chances of contamination.\n\n【22】**The major disadvantage of this device is that it requires:**\n\n【23】*   Coordination of inhalation and breath, that is, it is not breath actuated.\n\n【24】*   Not suitable for young children.\n\n【25】*   The high velocity of aerosol released causes high oropharyngeal deposition.\n\n【26】What Is a Pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler with Spacer?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Spacers allow the aerosol spray to slow down and transform into a fine mist. It helps the medication to act on the target area directly without getting deposited in the oropharynx and causing local side effects. It allows the patient more time to inhale so that the lung can imbibe the drug more smoothly and effectively. It makes the entire process more simple and easy. There is no need for hand-mouth coordination; hence it is suitable for children of all ages.\n\n【28】**Advantages:**\n\n【29】*   Increased drug delivery.\n\n【30】*   Removes the need for coordination of inhalation with actuation.\n\n【31】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【32】*   The risk of contamination requires regular cleaning.\n\n【33】What Is a Dry Powder Inhaler?\n-----------------------------\n\n【34】A dry powder inhaler (DPI) is a similar portable, compact breath-actuated device requiring less coordination. It depends on the patient's inspiratory effort to deliver the medication adequately. While inhaling, it should be inhaled forcefully and deeply to optimize the drug delivery to the lung.\n\n【35】It contains a powdered formulation that consists of an ordered mixture of the micronized drug of fewer than 5 micrometers along with larger carrier lactose particles which help in the flow of the powder. It is more environmentally friendly than metered dose inhaler, as the latter contains hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\n【36】**DPI exists in three forms:**\n\n【37】**1\\. Unit Dose Device:** A single dose in capsule form is loaded into the device just before it is used.\n\n【38】**2\\. Multiple Unit Dose Device**: Multiple capsules can be loaded at a time. It is preferred over a unit dose inhaler as they provide several weeks of treatment.\n\n【39】**3\\. Reservoir Device:** Powder is measured from a storage unit before it is used.\n\n【40】**Advantages:**\n\n【41】*   Portable.\n\n【42】*   Actuated by breath, so coordination is not required.\n\n【43】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【44】*   Requires moderate to high inspiratory flow rate as they do not have any propellant.\n\n【45】*   Not suitable for young children.\n\n【46】What Is a Smart Inhaler?\n------------------------\n\n【47】It is an inhaler to which sensors are attached to the device. It automatically sets a reminder for the next dose and helps remind the patient to use it at the right time. This device keeps a record and also helps in predicting asthma attacks. It also guides the patient to inhale the drug optimally to maximize lung targeting.\n\n【48】What Is an Adaptive Aerosol Delivery?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【49】It is also known as an \"I-neb\" or intelligent nebulizer. It is a portable, vibrating mesh nebulizer that delivers aerosol only during inhalation. It is designed to adapt to the changes in the patient's breathing pattern, hence known as adaptive aerosol delivery.\n\n【50】**Advantages:**\n\n【51】*   Reduce the wastage of drugs during exhalation.\n\n【52】*   Dosing variability.\n\n【53】*   Environmental exposure.\n\n【54】What Are Soft Mist Inhalers?\n----------------------------\n\n【55】It is one of the newest types of inhalers, which does not use any propellant; instead, the drug is pushed through a membrane via a compressed spring, thereby producing aerosol/mist that comes out more slowly and lasts longer in the air as compared to the aerosol produced by a metered dose inhaler.\n\n【56】What Is a Nebulizer?\n--------------------\n\n【57】It is an electric or battery-powered device that converts a drug in liquid form to an aerosol. This method is very helpful for young children.\n\n【58】A wide variety of nebulizers are available for inhaled drug therapy:\n\n【59】**1\\. Jet Nebulizer:**\n\n【60】It has an electric compressor and a jet. It is based on Bernoulli's principle. It is a jet because the compressed gas is forced to pass through a narrow opening. As the gas is released, it mixes with the liquid drug and transforms into a fine mist. As a result, high doses of the medication can be given.\n\n【61】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【62】*   Expensive.\n\n【63】*   Less portable.\n\n【64】*   A pressurized gas source is required.\n\n【65】*   Chances of contamination.\n\n【66】**2\\. Mesh Nebulizer:**\n\n【67】It uses mesh with multiple vibrating perforations to produce an aerosol. As a result, it provides better aerosol delivery than jet nebulizers.\n\n【68】**Advantages:**\n\n【69】*   Do not require compressed air.\n\n【70】*   It can operate with power.\n\n【71】*   No recirculation of the drug from baffles, so there is a very little evaporative loss of the drug.\n\n【72】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【73】*   Expensive.\n\n【74】*   Chances of contamination.\n\n【75】*   Device preparation is required.\n\n【76】*   Potential to clog the apertures.\n\n【77】**3\\. Ultrasonic Nebulizer:**\n\n【78】It uses piezoelectric crystals that vibrate at a very high frequency to produce the aerosol.\n\n【79】It has a faster drug delivery as compared to the jet nebulizer.\n\n【80】**Advantages:**\n\n【81】*   Any drug of any dose can be used.\n\n【82】*   Easy to use for the patient.\n\n【83】*   Visible spray reassures the patient.\n\n【84】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【85】*   Expensive.\n\n【86】*   Chances of contamination are more.\n\n【87】*   Device preparation is required.\n\n【88】*   An electric power supply is required.\n\n【89】**Conclusion:**\n\n【90】Aerosol drug delivery is a unique and most effective approach of drug delivery modality to combat chronic lung diseases. The most popular devices are metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\n\n【91】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【92】* * *\n\n【93】#### **1.**删除换行**How Is an Aerosol Useful for Asthma?**\n\n【94】Aerosol is used as the medication for asthma since it enhances the local effects in the lungs and decreases the systemic effects compared with oral medication. Corticosteroids and bronchodilators are used in various delivery devices to treat asthma.\n\n【95】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Use of an Aerosol Device?**\n\n【96】The aerosol device is available in three different forms:  \n\\- MDI (Metered Dose Inhaler): They deliver a certain amount of medicine from a pressurized container containing a propellant mixture. MDIs require pushing a button or lifting a lever before every use. However, various companies have developed breath-actuated MDIs that trigger aerosol release by inhalation through the mouthpiece to simplify the technique.  \n\\- Nebulizer: Nebulizers make an aerosol by agitating a drug solution kept in a small reservoir. The patient has to load the reservoir before each use. A compressed air or oxygen stream creates an aerosol in traditional jet nebulizers.  \n\\- DPI (Dry Powder Inhaler): DPIs form an aerosol by directing the inspiratory flow of the patient through powdered medication inside the device. Certain devices are preloaded with several doses that are aerosolized one at a time. Some devices are single-use, and the patient has to load with a powdered medication capsule before every dose.\n\n【97】#### **3.**删除换行**Which Principles Are Followed in Aerosol Therapy?**\n\n【98】The ideal aerosol delivery device must be inexpensive, portable, and provide selective lower respiratory tract aerosol delivery. It should have minimum delivery in the upper respiratory tract so that it can be readily used by children, the elderly, and the handicapped.\n\n【99】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Benefits of Aerosol Therapy?**\n\n【100】The benefits of aerosol therapy include its direct action on the diseased area of the lungs. Hence, a small drug dose is effective, leading to decreased side effects compared to parenteral (administered to the body other than the mouth and alimentary canal) or oral therapy. For instance, inhaled sympathomimetic bronchodilator causes greater and more rapid bronchodilatation but has fewer side effects like tachycardia, tremor, palpitation, and anxiety. The dose advised for a metered dose of aerosol is 20 times less than the oral dose.\n\n【101】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Inhalers Be Considered Aerosol Devices?**\n\n【102】Aerosols are available in the form of metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers. Therefore, inhalers can be considered aerosol devices. Aerosol works like a spray can by pushing the inhaler. The medicine is sprayed out as the patient breathes it in.\n\n【103】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Use of the Aerosol Delivery System?**\n\n【104】The aerosol delivery system is used for the treatment of asthma. The aerosols are administered through inhalation, allowing treatment of the lungs selectively by providing a high concentration of the drug in the airway and reducing systemic adverse effects.\n\n【105】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Different Types in Which Aerosol Therapy Is Available?**\n\n【106】Three different types of aerosol therapy are as follows:  \n\\- Pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI).  \n\\- Dry powder inhaler (DPI).  \n\\- Soft mist inhaler (SMI).  \nThese inhalers are used to deliver various inhaled medications, like beta-agonists, anticholinergics, glucocorticoids, Tobramycin, Insulin, and Levodopa.\n\n【107】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Importance of Particle Size in Aerosol Therapy?**\n\n【108】The size of the particles is one of the most important factors in aerosol therapy. Large particles do not penetrate the alveolar region. In contrast, smaller particles are easily deposited in the lung by gravitational sedimentation and inertial transport. The lung function improved significantly in asthma patients who inhaled the bronchodilator drug of smaller than larger particles.\n\n【109】#### **9.**删除换行**How Does the Aerosol Generator Function?**\n\n【110】The aerosol generator is a compact atomizer that produces particles in concentrations of up to 108 particles per cubic centimeter and an adjustable flow rate of 1.2 to 5.0 liters per minute. The compressed air is blown into the liquid to be nebulized through a thin ring slit. Shear forces between the air jet and the liquid form the droplet aerosol. The aerosol stream formed as a result is directly fed into the aerosol liquid.\n\n【111】#### **10.**删除换行**How Can Aerosol Inhalers Be Used?**\n\n【112】The mouthpiece of the inhaler is held down, and lips are placed around the mouthpiece to make a tight seal. Then the patient has to breathe through the mouth slowly, and the inhaler is pressed down once. The patient must keep breathing slowly and as deeply as possible.\n\n【113】#### **11.**删除换行**Which Medicine Is Used for Aerosol Therapy?**\n\n【114】The medicines used for aerosol therapy include beta-agonists, anticholinergics, glucocorticoids, Insulin, Tobramycin, and Levodopa. Vasoactive drugs, bronchodilators, surfactants, helium, and antibiotics, are some agents that can be inhaled.\n\n【115】#### **12.**删除换行**What Effects Do Aerosols Have?**\n\n【116】Aerosols have an effect on the climate as they are directly scattered and absorbed by incoming solar radiation. These aerosols are trapped in the outgoing long-wave radiation and cause alteration in cloud optical properties, forming clouds and precipitation.\n\n【117】#### **13.**删除换行**What Can Be Done to Reduce Aerosols?**\n\n【118】Aerosols are not passive particles and actively affect the climate system. Aerosols can be reduced by limiting the use of aerosol-producing devices. Aerosols can be removed from the atmosphere by attaching themselves to the earth’s surface (dry deposition) or when rain or snow washes them out of the air (in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging).\n\n【119】#### **14.**删除换行**What Is Understood by Aerosol Indirect Effect?**\n\n【120】The aerosol indirect effect can be divided into two components:  \n\\- Cloud Albedo: An increase in aerosol concentration caused by an increase in droplet or particle concentration.  \n\\- Cloud Lifetime: The reduction in cloud droplet or particle size that alters the precipitation efficiency.\n\n【121】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【122】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH-Aerosol Delivery Devices for Obstructive Lung Diseases  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29794206/\n*   AARC-Pulmonary Disease Aerosol Delivery Devices  \n    https://www.aarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/aerosol-guide-for-hcp-3rd.pdf\n*   NIH-Aerosol delivery devices in the treatment of asthma  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18501026/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "134a51bc-cfa1-45ee-9b99-5121d908bbd3", "title": "Chest Congestion - Causes, Symptoms and Remedies", "text": "【0】Chest Congestion - Causes, Symptoms and Remedies\nWhat Is Chest Congestion?\n-------------------------\n\n【1】Chest congestion is a symptom of respiratory infection like cold or more severe infections. It results from inflamed air passages, or bronchi, in the lungs. When exposed to a virus, the bronchi get inflamed, producing excess mucus.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Chest Congestion?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】**Chest Congestion in Babies:**\n\n【4】Congestion that develops in a baby’s chest has more severe causes, such as:\n\n【5】*   Pneumonia.\n\n【6】*   Flu.\n\n【7】*   Asthma.\n\n【8】*   Cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease that affects the lungs and the digestive system). The body produces thick and sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and pancreas.\n\n【9】*   Transient tachypnea (a condition in newborns with fast or labored breathing).\n\n【10】*   Bronchiolitis (inflammation of bronchioles).\n\n【11】*   Deviated septum.\n\n【12】*   Weather changes.\n\n【13】*   Allergies.\n\n【14】*   Inhaling dry air.\n\n【15】**Chest Congestion in Adults:**\n\n【16】In adults, the two most common causes of chest congestion are irritants in the air and the bacteria and viruses responsible for upper respiratory tract infections.\n\n【17】*   **Air Pollutants:** When inhaled just by taking a breath, certain particles in the air get trapped in the mucus membrane of the nose and airways. These particles, such as dust and allergens, are usually harmless. However, tiny hair-like structures called cilia transport these particles along with the mucus towards the throat and to the lungs. The irritation caused by these particles results in the overproduction of mucus, making the chest feel congested.\n\n【18】*   **Bacteria and Viruses:** An inhaled virus or bacteria can cause an infection, resulting in chest congestion. Like allergens, bacteria and viruses also work in the same way by entering the body and being transported by cilia, but these microorganisms cause inflammation. As a result, the body produces more mucus in the airways to remove them. But the body may not be able to get rid of this excessive, thicker mucus in the usual ways, and the mucus gets stuck inside the lungs resulting in a congested chest.\n\n【19】What Are the Symptoms of Chest Congestion?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The symptoms of chest congestion are:\n\n【21】*   Labored breathing.\n\n【22】*   Coughing.\n\n【23】*   Difficulty in feeding children.\n\n【24】*   Rapid breathing.\n\n【25】*   Fever.\n\n【26】*   Headache.\n\n【27】*   Body ache.\n\n【28】*   Chills.\n\n【29】*   Sore throat.\n\n【30】*   Chest tightness.\n\n【31】*   Cough with clear, green, or dark yellow mucus. Excess phlegm and mucus production helps get rid of the bacteria or virus in the lungs. The coughed-up phlegm is called sputum and varies in color from clear to brown to green.\n\n【32】*   The phlegm build-up in the lungs makes the air difficult to pass through. It results in shortness of breath from chest congestion. It can be a sign of bronchitis.\n\n【33】*   Coughs that expel sputum are called productive coughs. Excess phlegm in the chest triggers the cough reflex.\n\n【34】**What Is Phlegm?**\n\n【35】Phlegm is a different form of mucus formed in the lower respiratory airways (throat and lungs) in response to inflammation. The phlegm is coughed up from the respiratory tract. Phlegm is also produced naturally from the body and mainly comprises water, proteins, and inorganic salts. The phlegm is thicker than the mucus. Therefore, it is noticeable only when infected with a cold or some underlying medical issue. When phlegm is coughed up, it is called sputum.\n\n【36】**What Is Mucus?**\n\n【37】The mucus is the gelatinous, watery fluid produced by mucous membranes in the body. The mucus is made up of water, inorganic salts, and proteins. Usually, the human body has 1.5 liters of mucus per day. Sputum can be clear, with varying yellow, green, brown, or red shades. When infected with a cold or flu, the body sends white blood cells (neutrophils) to repair the damage. These cells contain green enzymes that affect the mucus color—the more white blood cells, the greener the sputum.\n\n【38】What Are the Underlying Medical Conditions to Cause Chest Congestion?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Following are the underlying medical conditions that lead to chest congestion:\n\n【40】*   **Acute Bronchitis:** Acute bronchitis is a contagious viral infection that causes inflammation of bronchial tubules. When these tubes get infected, they swell and form thick mucus inside the airways, narrowing and making it harder to breathe. One of the most common symptoms of acute bronchitis includes chest congestion or tightness. A cough can last for several weeks or more.\n\n【41】*   **Pneumonia:** It is a contagious infection with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. When there is an infection in the lungs, airways get inflamed (swell), and air sacs in the lungs fill up with mucus and other fluids resulting in chest congestion and other associated symptoms.\n\n【42】*   **Common Cold:** Infection with a cold or flu virus is among the most common causes of chest congestion. The congestion happens when the disease progresses from the nasal passage and throat to the lower respiratory tract.\n\n【43】*   **Coronavirus Disease:** COVID -19 virus affects different people in different ways. The symptoms may vary from mild to moderate to severe. One of the serious symptoms includes chest congestion and difficulty in breathing, leading to life-threatening conditions.\n\n【44】How to Get Rid of Chest Congestion?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【45】There are a few effective remedies to clear chest congestion:\n\n【46】**1\\. Steam:** Steam helps moisten the airways, thereby loosening dried-up phlegm and mucus, making it easier to cough up. Use a humidifier or make a steam room with a bowl of hot water and a towel covering up the head.\n\n【47】**2\\. Stay Hydrated:** Water is considered a natural chest congestion reliever. Keeping hydrated helps to thin thick mucus and phlegm in the lungs and helps to expel it out quickly. Warm liquids are more known to clear out the mucus in the nose and chest. So to relieve this congestion, warm liquid intake such as green tea, warm water, chicken soup, and warm apple juice can do wonders in treating chest congestion. Avoid alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated sodas as they have a dehydrating effect.\n\n【48】**3\\. Use Humidifier:** Another best way to treat chest congestion is to get a humidifier. It makes it easier to cough up the mucus. Humidifiers add moisture to the air and help loosen the mucus that is weighing down the chest.\n\n【49】**4\\. Honey:** Honey serves as the most opted home remedy. It can soothe the irritated throat, and its sticky nature helps in expelling mucus from the membranes.\n\n【50】**5\\. Medications:**\n\n【51】*   **Expectorants:** Expectorants are most effective in removing phlegm from the lungs and throat. They thin out mucus and phlegm, making it easier to expel. The main ingredient, Guaifenesin, helps get rid of mucus and phlegm completely.\n\n【52】*   **Decongestants:** Decongestants help clear the nasal pathways, clear congestion, and reduce mucus production. These are available in sprays, pills, and syrups.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】A stepwise approach is recommended to manage and treat congestion, consisting of proper diagnosis of an underlying cause, patient education and monitoring, avoidance of environmental triggers wherever possible, and pharmacotherapy. In addition, patient counseling and lifestyle modifications are necessary for a better prognosis.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Infections of the Respiratory System  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8142/\n*   Chest Cold (Acute Bronchitis)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/bronchitis.html\n*   Dry Cough and Chest Tightness  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21888-dry-cough-and-chest-tightness</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1c68cd7f-1e4e-4c26-8a87-deab0667c7d4", "title": "Bloating During Ovulation", "text": "【0】What Is Ovulation?\n------------------\n\n【1】Ovulation occurs when the mature egg gets released from the ovaries and travels down to the fallopian tubes, awaiting fertilization by a sperm. Ovulation will occur 10 to 16 days before the period, and you may experience symptoms of bloating during or before ovulation. Ovulation is a physiological process that women usually experience every month. While they expect their period to begin, they often get different body symptoms that show that their menstruation is close.\n\n【2】How To Know That A Woman Is Ovulating?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Women of childbearing age are very much concerned about their ovulation period because, at this time, their body is not protected from getting pregnant. Therefore, when they indulge in sexual activity, it can result in an unplanned pregnancy. One common way to find that a woman is ovulating is by the thickness of their discharge. An egg white-like stretchy discharge during ovulation is the one way to tell that women are ovulating.\n\n【4】Another symptom most girls experience is bloating during ovulation. Bloating is an experience of a swollen or distended stomach that makes anyone feel that they have put on more weight. Most times, they also begin to feel cramps and belly tightness.\n\n【5】Abdominal bloating during and after ovulation occurs because of hormones, and the truth is, in most women, it is not a cause of concern.\n\n【6】Additionally, ovulation sometimes produces a heightened sense of smell, a boost in energy and sex drive, and overall well-being. Inversely, some people may experience ovulation bloating, breast tenderness, and one-sided abdominal pain.\n\n【7】What Is Bloating?\n-----------------\n\n【8】Bloating is a feeling of pain in which the stomach is stuffed, swollen, or filled with gas, especially after a meal. It is the feeling of fullness in the stomach along with abdominal distention. It is prevalent and can be due to many causes.\n\n【9】*   Bloating refers to a feeling of increased abdominal pressure without an existing increase in abdominal size. Swelling, on the other hand, can be due to the retention of fluid in the tissues. Both conditions can make a person with bloating feel puffy.\n\n【10】*   The estrogen level and the luteinizing hormone (LH) levels surge just before the onset of ovulation. These hormonal transformations can trigger water retention and swelling, resulting in bloating during ovulation.\n\n【11】*   For most people, ovulation bloating will resolve on its own a few hours or days later. But if bloating during ovulation persists from other medical issues like endometriosis, an ovarian cyst, or a polycystic ovary syndrome, they should make sure to consult with a health care provider.\n\n【12】Can Bloating After Ovulation Mean Pregnancy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Suppose you are expecting or had unprotected sexual intercourse, cramping, and bloating after ovulation until a period can signify pregnancy. There is no reason to worry if you have used protection during sex, and it is unlikely you will get pregnant after protected intercourse.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>I have bloating after I eat and also constipation.Please advice.</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Is delayed ovulation the reason for delayed period?</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Does bloating indicate pregnancy?</u>\n\n【19】How To Differentiate Between The Ovulation Bloating And The Premenstrual Bloating?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The easiest way to differentiate between premenstrual bloating and ovulation bloating is by tracking the monthly cycle. Ovulation bloating will appear in the middle of the menstrual cycle, several days before the actual ovulation. In contrast, PMS (premenstrual syndrome) bloating will begin after the ovulation, potentially starting a week before the period and lasting up to a week later. Additional PMS symptoms include:\n\n【21】*   Breast swelling or tenderness.\n\n【22】*   Fatigue.\n\n【23】*   Headaches.\n\n【24】*   Period-related diarrhea or constipation.\n\n【25】*   Abdominal cramping.\n\n【26】*   Mood swings and irritability.\n\n【27】*   Period-related nausea.\n\n【28】Why Do You Feel Bloated During An Ovulation?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Ovulation can be something that does not affect you at all, but it could also be something that makes you worry about bloating.\n\n【30】There is a combination of causes that lead to this disturbing symptom. These include:\n\n【31】*   Higher salt intake.\n\n【32】*   Fluctuations of hormone levels.\n\n【33】*   It is common for every woman to crave chips, popcorn, cheese, and other salty foods during their ovulation. If they have many foods of this kind, ovulation bloating will worsen because salt retains water.\n\n【34】*   Naturally, it is not just the cravings that they have to blame, but also the hormones. Although usually, the female hormones are their friends, they prevent them from fitting into their jeans. The good news is that bloating can last only for a short period.\n\n【35】Which Hormone Can Cause Bloating During Ovulation?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Bloating during ovulation is caused due to the increase in the estrogen levels that occur just before ovulation, which gives way to the increased level of luteinizing hormone that triggers the release of an egg. In addition, progesterone is another hormone, which begins to spike and causes changes to the gastrointestinal tract soon after ovulation has occurred.\n\n【37】Why Should Women Not Worry About Their Bloating During Ovulation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   The fact about bloating during ovulation is that women are more hesitant about exercising in their period because of the hormone levels, making water retention even worse. During this time, women do not feel like leaving their house.\n\n【39】*   Women should not be surprised if bloating caused by ovulation prevents their clothing from fitting right and making it impossible for them to remove the rings from their fingers.\n\n【40】*   It is also possible for them to crave other foods besides the salty ones, and they might also have a general bad feeling.\n\n【41】*   They are expected to gain some weight during this time.\n\n【42】*   Even though bloating during ovulation is a temporary symptom, women may still feel fat, un-sexy, or ugly.\n\n【43】When Should You Worry About Bloating During Ovulation?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Bloating during ovulation, in general, is considered to be expected, which occurs due to hormonal changes in the body. But, you should worry about it and consult with your physician if you also have symptoms like:\n\n【45】*   Fever.\n\n【46】*   Vomiting.\n\n【47】*   Frequent diarrhea for days, weeks, or months.\n\n【48】*   Constipation for days.\n\n【49】*   Rectal bleeding.\n\n【50】*   Severe abdominal pain that does not get relieved even after passing gas.\n\n【51】What Are The Remedies For Ovulation Bloating?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【52】It would help if you did not think of this symptom as a curse because there are remedies that you can use.\n\n【53】*   Drink more water.\n\n【54】*   Intake low salt to reduce water retention.\n\n【55】*   Take some over-the-counter diuretic to get rid of the excess water in the body.\n\n【56】*   If the over-the-counter fails to work, consult with your gynecologist or family doctor for a better drug that gives you relief from pain.\n\n【57】*   Avoid junk foods high in salt and opt for foods that prevent the water retention of the body or create gas.\n\n【58】*   Do routine aerobic exercises throughout the month to relieve water retention.\n\n【59】*   Try choosing a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet.\n\n【60】*   FODMAPs are indigestible carbohydrates that can create bloating, stomach pain, and gas.\n\n【61】*   High-FODMAP foods include wheat, onions, broccoli, garlic, cauliflower, cabbage, artichokes, apples, beans, watermelons, and pears.\n\n【62】*   Try relaxation techniques like meditation and yoga to relieve ovulation bloating arising from digestive disturbances.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   How can I tell when I'm ovulating?  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/womens-health/how-can-i-tell-when-i-am-ovulating/\n*   Fluid Retention over the Menstrual Cycle: 1-Year Data from the Prospective Ovulation Cohort  \n    https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2011/138451/\n*   Beat the bloat  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/remedies-for-bloating-and-wind/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Genetic variations are hereditary characteristics that parents pass on to their offspring. Every cell in a child's body gets a copy of their parents' genetic information during development. In many ways, genetics can affect the chance of developing heart disease.\n\n【2】Genes, including the communication between heart cells and the strength of the blood vessels, entirely control the cardiovascular system. Heart disease can be impacted by a genetic variation (mutation) in a particular gene. When a family member is found to have heart disease or a heart disorder, the other family members are advised to get a screen test for risk factors and early-stage diseases.\n\n【3】How Can Genetics Affect Cardiovascular Problems?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Trillions of cells make up the human organism. The nucleus of every cell contains the information that makes it distinct. Genes make up this information. Genetic cardiovascular disorders are caused mainly by a defect in one or more genes. There is a 50:50 possibility that they may inherit defective genes from their parents.\n\n【5】What Are the Types of Cardiovascular Diseases Affected by Genes?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】*   **Cardiomyopathy -** Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic cardiac condition when the heart's cardiac muscle weakens and thins out in at least one chamber. Enlarging the chamber's open region (dilated) results the heart being unable to pump blood as effectively as normal. The cardiac muscle thins and weakens even more due to the heart's effort to compensate by pumping more blood through the heart. This disease progresses to heart failure over time.\n\n【7】*   **Heart Arrhythmias -** Heart arrhythmias is an inherited cardiac rhythm disorder in which the heartbeat gets chaotic and irregular, which increases the risk of stroke.\n\n【8】*   **Cardiac Amyloidosis -** Cardiac amyloidosis is a cardiac condition when amyloid protein deposits are found in the heart.\n\n【9】*   **Cardiac Tumors -** Cardiac tumors are also known as heart tumors, in which growth develops in the heart.\n\n【10】*   **Autoimmune Disorder -** A disorder when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body. Examples include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma.\n\n【11】*   **Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Syndrome -** Genetic disorder known as familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndrome is brought on by abnormalities in several genes, most frequently the ACTA2 or TGFBR2 genes.\n\n【12】*   **Heart Valve Disease -** Some congenital heart valve diseases are inherited, which means the heart valve defect is brought on by particular genes that are passed down to a child from the parents. For example, stenosis may result from an inherited heart valve disorder called bicuspid aortic valve.\n\n【13】*   **Higher Amount of Cholesterol (Familial Hypercholesterolemia) -** Higher than normal blood cholesterol levels are a hallmark of the genetic disorder known as familial hypercholesterolemia. Up to 10 percent of early-onset coronary artery disease, or heart disease before age 55, is attributed to familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【14】*   **Pulmonary Hypertension -** When the blood arteries connecting the heart and lungs experience excessive pressure, it is known as pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Genetic Cardiovascular Diseases?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The signs and symptoms of genetically associated cardiovascular diseases include:\n\n【17】*   Chest pain.\n\n【18】*   Chest tightness.\n\n【19】*   Breathing difficulty.\n\n【20】*   Neck, jaw, pharynx, upper abdominal region, or back pain.\n\n【21】*   Weakness or coldness in legs or limbs.\n\n【22】*   Fatigue.\n\n【23】*   Heart palpitations.\n\n【24】*   Lightheadedness.\n\n【25】*   Fainting.\n\n【26】*   Sudden cardiac death.\n\n【27】How Is Genetic Associated Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The diagnostic options available for genetic-associated cardiovascular diseases include the following:\n\n【29】*   **Computed tomography (CT scan) -** A cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan, also known as a calcium-score screening heart scan, is a process that makes use of numerous X-ray beams at various angles to produce high-quality, three-dimensional (3D) images of the heart, blood vessels, and surrounding structures.\n\n【30】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** The heart's blood supply is also examined during cardiac MRI images. They can assist the doctor in examining conditions like coronary heart disease and reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which may cause angina (chest discomfort).\n\n【31】*   **Echocardiogram (ECHO) -** The medical staff may use an echo test to examine the heart's anatomy and evaluate its work. The examination aids the medical staff in determining the size, thickness, and motion of the heart's walls, as well as the heart's size and structure.\n\n【32】*   **Stress Test -** Cardiologists use a cardiac stress test to assess the heart's ability to respond to stress in a safe, clinical setting. Exercise or intravenous pharmacological stimulation may cause a stress reaction.\n\n【33】*   **Cardiac Catheterization -** Cardiac catheterization is a technique used to detect or treat certain heart conditions, such as blocked arteries or irregular heartbeats, by guiding a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel to the heart.\n\n【34】What Are the Treatment Options Available for Genetics Associated with Cardiovascular Diseases?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The treatment options available for genetics associated with cardiovascular diseases include:\n\n【36】*   Lifestyle changes.\n\n【37】*   Avoid drinking alcohol.\n\n【38】*   Do not smoke.\n\n【39】*   Consume heart-healthy food.\n\n【40】*   Follow the doctor's advice regarding exercise.\n\n【41】*   Discuss weight-loss alternatives with a doctor if overweight.\n\n【42】*   Reduce stress.\n\n【43】*   Schedule regular checkups and follow-up exams with a doctor.\n\n【44】**Oral Medication**\n\n【45】*   Antiarrhythmic drugs will assist in regulating the heartbeat.\n\n【46】*   Blood blockages can be treated, prevented, and reduced with anticoagulants, also known as \"blood thinners.\"\n\n【47】*   Anti-inflammatory drugs can help with both pain alleviation and inflammation reduction.\n\n【48】*   Beta-blockers will aid in lowering blood pressure.\n\n【49】*   Calcium channel blockers will ease tension, widen blood vessels, slow heartbeat, and decrease blood pressure.\n\n【50】*   Diuretics, also known as \"water pills,\" will assist in lowering the body's fluid retention.\n\n【51】*   Protein regulators and drugs that alter genes.\n\n【52】**Surgery**\n\n【53】*   **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) -** The surgical treatment known as coronary artery bypass surgery, often referred to as coronary artery bypass graft, addresses plaque buildup in the heart's arteries. The CABG procedure joins blood vessels above and below the blocked artery using healthy blood vessels from another body section. Bypassing the constricted or obstructed coronary arteries establishes a new pathway for blood flow. The blood vessels are typically leg veins or arteries from the arm or chest.\n\n【54】*   **Heart Transplantation -** A heart transplant is a surgical procedure where the patient's unhealthy heart is removed and replaced with a healthy heart from an organ donor.\n\n【55】*   **Pacemaker Implantation -** An implantable pacemaker is a small electronic device often positioned in the chest, just below the collarbone, to assist in controlling slow electrical issues with the heart.\n\n【56】*   **Septal Myectomy -** In an open-heart treatment called a septal myectomy, the surgeon cuts away a portion of the septum between the ventricles that has grown thick and long\n\n【57】*   Ventricular assist device (VAD).\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】Heart diseases like congenital heart disease and myocardial infarction are included in the category of cardiovascular diseases, most of which are inherited. The genes and particular DNA sequence variants accountable for this heritability have been the subject of intense research. The risk of heart disease can rise even when inheritance is combined with harmful lifestyle decisions like smoking and eating poorly. The risk of heart disease can increase even further.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   Genetics of Human Cardiovascular Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319439/\n*   Heritability in genetic heart disease: the role of genetic background  \n    https://openheart.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000929</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is usually diagnosed in elderly individuals with an average onset age of 70. The cause of the disorder is not well understood, but it is thought to be associated with abnormalities in the production of blood cells. Refractory cytopenia is a severe condition that necessitates continual monitoring and treatment by a medical team.\n\n【2】What Is Refractory Cytopenia?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Refractory cytopenia is a health condition that happens when the body does not make enough blood cells, like red and white blood cells and platelets. This condition is a type of myelodysplastic syndrome, which means there are problems with how the bone marrow produces blood cells.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Refractory Cytopenia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are multiple types of refractory cytopenia, which are classified according to the type of blood cells affected and specific disease features. These include:\n\n【6】*   **Refractory Anemia:** It is characterized by low red blood cell counts and anemia.\n\n【7】*   **Refractory Neutropenia:** It is characterized by low white blood cell counts, particularly low neutrophil counts.\n\n【8】*   **Refractory Cytopenia With Multilineage Dysplasia:** It is characterized by abnormal or dysplastic cells in more than one type of blood cell.\n\n【9】It is important to remember that refractory cytopenia is a rare disease and can be challenging to diagnose, so it is essential to consult with a hematologist or other medical specialist if you suspect you may have this condition.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Refractory Cytopenia?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The indications of refractory cytopenia may vary depending on the specific blood cell type affected. Some general indications of refractory cytopenia comprise the following:\n\n【12】*   Fatigue.\n\n【13】*   Weakness.\n\n【14】*   Pale skin.\n\n【15】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【16】*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n\n【17】*   Easy bruising or bleeding.\n\n【18】*   Frequent infections.\n\n【19】*   Bone pain.\n\n【20】*   Abdominal swelling or discomfort.\n\n【21】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【22】*   Weight loss.\n\n【23】It is essential to note that other conditions could also cause these symptoms, and not all individuals with refractory cytopenia will encounter them. If someone is having any of these symptoms, seeking medical attention for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment is critical.\n\n【24】What Are the Causes of Refractory Cytopenia?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Refractory cytopenia can be caused by various factors, which include the following:\n\n【26】*   **Bone Marrow Failure:** The production of blood cells is the responsibility of the bone marrow. However, if the bone marrow fails to function properly due to certain disorders like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aplastic anemia, or other bone marrow diseases, it can result in refractory cytopenia.\n\n【27】*   **Exposure to Toxins:** Exposure to certain toxins like benzene can damage the bone marrow.\n\n【28】*   **Viral Infections:** Viral infections like hepatitis or parvovirus B19 can cause bone marrow failure and lead to refractory cytopenia.\n\n【29】*   **Autoimmune Disorders:** An autoimmune disorder may lead to refractory cytopenia, as the immune system may attack the bone marrow and hinder its ability to produce blood cells.\n\n【30】*   **Genetic Mutations:** Rare genetic mutations affecting blood cell production can also cause refractory cytopenia.\n\n【31】What Are the Conditions That Are Associated With Refractory Cytopenia?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The specific conditions associated with refractory cytopenia are as under:\n\n【33】*   **Refractory Anemia:** It is marked by insufficient red blood cells, which can result in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n\n【34】*   **Refractory Neutropenia:** It involves a low count of a particular type of white blood cells known as neutrophils, thereby increasing the likelihood of infections.\n\n【35】*   **Refractory Thrombocytopenia:** It is characterized by a scarcity of platelets, leading to unusual bleeding and bruising.\n\n【36】How to Diagnose Refractory Cytopenia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】Refractory cytopenia is typically diagnosed through clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and bone marrow biopsy. The following are the diagnostic criteria for refractory cytopenia:\n\n【38】*   **Persistent Cytopenia:** A patient must have at least one type of cytopenia (low red blood cell count, low platelet count, or low white blood cell count) present for at least six months.\n\n【39】*   **Absence of Blasts:** The bone marrow must contain less than 5 % blasts, and the peripheral blood smear must show no blasts.\n\n【40】*   **Dysplasia:** The bone marrow must show dysplasia in at least one of the major cell lines.\n\n【41】*   **Exclusion of Other Causes:** Other causes of cytopenia, such as vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, or infections, must be ruled out.\n\n【42】To help diagnose refractory cytopenia, the following tests may be ordered:\n\n【43】*   **Blood Tests:** A complete blood count (CBC) can reveal low blood cell counts. Other blood tests can help rule out other causes of cytopenia.\n\n【44】*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** This is the most important test for diagnosing MDS (myelodysplastic), and it can reveal dysplasia and the presence of blasts.\n\n【45】*   **Cytogenetic Analysis:** This test looks for chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow cells.\n\n【46】*   **Flow Cytometry:** This test can detect small numbers of abnormal cells that may not be visible under the microscope.\n\n【47】If the above criteria are met, and other potential causes of cytopenia are ruled out, refractory cytopenia can be diagnosed.\n\n【48】How to Treat the Condition of Refractory Cytopenia?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Treatment options for refractory cytopenia depend on the underlying cause and blood cell type.\n\n【50】*   **Medications:** Doctors may prescribe drugs that promote blood cell production or target an underlying condition. Examples include erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) to increase red blood cells, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase white blood cells.\n\n【51】*   **Blood Transfusions:** Severe cytopenia may require blood transfusions to boost red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in circulation.\n\n【52】*   **Bone Marrow Transplant:** When appropriate, a bone marrow transplant can replace a person's unhealthy bone marrow with a healthy donor to jumpstart blood cell production.\n\n【53】*   **Supportive Care:** Medical treatments may be supplemented with a nutritious diet, exercise, and stress management to improve overall health and blood cell formation.\n\n【54】Collaborating with a doctor to tailor the treatment plan according to the individual's medical history and specific needs is crucial.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】Refractory cytopenia is a severe medical ailment that demands immediate identification and therapy. With proper medical supervision, individuals experiencing refractory cytopenia can alleviate their symptoms and enhance their standard of living. It is crucial for patients who are encountering symptoms of refractory cytopenia to promptly seek medical assistance and adhere to their doctor's recommendations regarding therapy and consistent care.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pediatric MDS Including Refractory Cytopenia and Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554017/\n*   Refractory cytopenias: clinical course according to bone marrow cytology and cellularity  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3814832/\n*   Types of Myelodysplastic Syndromes  \n    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/myelodysplastic-syndrome/about/mds-types.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b177f618-a760-4704-8c7d-9abd0e8744a7", "title": "Holiday Bloat: Tips to Help Stop Bloating Before It Starts", "text": "【0】Holiday Bloat: Tips to Help Stop Bloating Before It Starts\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】During holiday celebrations, consuming plenty of food gives everyone a sensation of heavy belly, indigestion, nausea, discomfort and a bloated feeling. Large portions make the digestive system work harder, leading to bloating; smaller meals are recommended to feel more comfortable and less bloating. Experts suggest ways to reduce this lethargy, overfed, and a bloated feeling during the holiday season. This article will provide certain ways to help stop abdominal or holiday bloating before it even begins.\n\n【2】**What Is Abdominal Bloating?**\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】Abdominal bloating is a feeling of fullness or tightness in the abdomen. It usually happens when the digestive system faces trouble in breaking down ingested foods. Because of this, gas builds up inside the gastrointestinal tract making the belly look bigger than usual, tender, and painful.\n\n【4】What Are the Ways to Stop Holiday Bloating Before It Begins?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   **Do Not Overeat -** Eating consistent meals and snacks will enhance digestion, and eating small portions regularly throughout the day is recommended to avoid overeating. This will help avoid eating excess during the celebrations. When a person waits too long between meals, they tend to be starved, leading to eating fast and too much, triggering abdominal bloating.\n\n【6】*   **Recognize Foods That Trigger Bloating -** It is important to note portions, the food, timing, and emotions when symptoms of bloating are felt. By noting this, it will help identify the factors or foods that aggravate the symptom or trigger abdominal bloating. Eating large amounts of vegetables in one sitting, eating foods with large amounts of added sugar, fats, and sodium, and eating more fiber content tends to trigger bloating. Similarly, protein bars and certain diet foods contain sweeteners like other fructose or sorbitol, which easily trigger gas and bloating for many people.\n\n【7】*   **Add Greens to the Plate -** Some vegetables that reduce bloating include kale, bok choy, spinach, chard, and asparagus. These vegetables are low in calories, packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and have a high water content. They help them in reducing bloating. Including fiber in the diet by eating vegetables regularly reduces bloating and promotes healthy bowel movements. However, increasing the fiber content gradually is recommended rather than increasing the intake quickly, as it may result in more bloating. It is also advised not to increase the water intake when fiber intake is increased, as it can cause constipation and bloating. Vegetables like broccoli tend to cause more gas, so it is recommended to consume them in a cooked form rather than a raw form to decrease the chances of bloating.\n\n【8】*   **Switch Foods -** Certain foods can be switched, and there are several ways to build a healthy relationship with food. For example, if the appetizer contains crackers or dairy-filled cheese balls, mix it up with fresh veggies, and pita. Instead of mashed potatoes, they can be switched with alternatives like sweet potatoes. Heavy cream in recipes can be cut into milk, and large amounts of salt can be alternated with flavorful spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. If switching foods look like too much work, it is advised to eat moderately. This switching will allow a person to enjoy food without overeating, thereby reducing bloating. It is also advised to avoid fizzy drinks like soda, beer, or champagne, as air swallowed when drinking them will enter the digestive system and cause bloating.\n\n【9】*   **Limit Alcohol Intake -** Since alcohol is always part of holiday celebrations, drinking them after consuming heavy foods worsens the stomach symptoms. Alcohol is a substance that causes inflammatory reactions, increases water retention, slows down the digestion process, and also makes a person feel lethargic. When swelling occurs in the body, it results in discomfort, bloating, and gas. It is advised to leave visual reminders where it can be seen, set alarms on the phone to encourage sipping water, or use an app to track the water intake; to prevent dehydration while drinking alcohol. It is also advised to space out water and not to chug them all at once; to avoid abdominal bloating.\n\n【10】*   **Probiotic Supplements -** An imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut can cause several digestive issues like bloating. Intake of probiotic supplements can reduce pain and symptoms of bloating and improve them.\n\n【11】*   **Peppermint Oil -** Peppermint oil is derived from the plant's stems, flowers, and leaves. This oil has been shown to reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome like bloating. The active component called menthol works by reducing the pain receptors of the stomach, and it also relaxes the colon muscles, relieving bloating and gas. Since peppermint oil interacts with certain health conditions and medications, it is always important to consult with the health care provider before starting the intake of peppermint oil. Another option is peppermint tea, which has a high concentration of flavonoids that helps calm the digestive tract bacteria, which causes increased gas and bloating. It also reduces any inflammation. Ginger tea can also soothe stomach discomfort.\n\n【12】*   **Mindful Eating -** The first step in managing abdominal bloating is understanding how a person eats. Mindful eating is a great step in improving a person's digestive health. Mindful eating involves focusing while chewing, eating slowly, and avoiding distractions like phones, television, or laptops. Eating slowly involved spacing between each bite and savoring the flavors, allowing the brain to register any fullness cues fully. Chewing well means chewing food about 10 to 15 times and noticing the flavors and textures of the food. Most people eat while in front of their television sets, phones, or laptop, and they do not register any flavor or understand whether they are full. By focusing on the food, a person can experience their meal very intensely, especially the flavors, and eat with more satisfaction.\n\n【13】*   **Walking -** Whenever a feeling of bloating is experienced after a heavy meal, walking around the block or doing mild exercises like cardio to reduce the bloating effect is advised. Walking for about twenty to thirty minutes several times a week will stimulate the gut peristalsis and moves the gas along the digestive tract, thereby improving bowel function. Consuming enough fiber and walking regularly can minimize constipation and other abdominal discomforts.\n\n【14】**Conclusion**\n\n【15】Most people face abdominal issues like bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, and pain, especially during holiday celebrations when consuming excessive food. However, by incorporating certain lifestyle and dietary modifications, holiday bloating can be prevented even before it begins. Lifestyle modifications include walking after eating, mindful eating, and avoiding overeating. Dietary changes include eating more vegetables, limiting alcohol intake, and avoiding foods that trigger abdominal bloating and discomfort.\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>*   How to beat the bloat and embrace your beach body: a dietitian's guide to gut health on holiday  \n    https://www.standard.co.uk/escapist/health/how-to-avoid-bloating-on-holiday-a3909446.html\n*   Banish Holiday Bloat with These Tips  \n    https://www.healthcorps.org/banish-holiday-bloat-with-these-tips/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "13c40e0c-75a7-41c1-be05-ba4f0c94d0e0", "title": "Brachytherapy - An Overview", "text": "【0】Brachytherapy - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Brachytherapy is also known as internal radiation therapy and is used to treat prostate, breast, cervix, head, and neck cancer. The human body comprises thousands of cells that divide rapidly and help in the growth of the body. Cancer occurs due to the uncontrolled division of the cells. If the cells remain confined to the organ, they are considered benign. On the contrary, if the cells spread to the other organs, they are said to be malignant or cancerous. There are genes present in the body that stimulate and inhibit the growth of cells. When the genes that prevent cell growth fail to function, or are defective, the growth of the cells increases resulting in tumors or cancer. It is because there is no one to stop the genes that allow cell growth. However, there are treatment options available to kill the defective cells or slow down their growth, brachytherapy being one of them. It is a procedure in which a special material is placed into the body to destroy the cells and slow down their growth.\n\n【2】Is Brachytherapy Similar to External Radiation Therapy?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The other name for brachytherapy is internal radiation therapy. It is completely different from external radiation therapy. In brachytherapy, the surgeon places radioactive material in the body to kill the cancer cells. Therefore, the radiation is received by only the organ or the area affected by cancer. Whereas in external radiation therapy, a machine is used to deliver the radiation to the tumor or cancer. As the radiation passes through the skin, there is a chance that the other healthy organs also receive it and get damaged. The side effects of brachytherapy are less compared to external radiation therapy.\n\n【4】What Are the Different Types of Brachytherapy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Brachytherapy implants are classified according to the time up to which they remain in the body. The different types of brachytherapy implants have been described in the table below:\n\n【6】Why Is Brachytherapy Done?\n--------------------------\n\n【7】Brachytherapy aims to release radiation and kill the cells showing uncontrolled growth. It is used to treat cancer of the following organs:\n\n【8】*   Brain cancer.\n\n【9】*   Liver cancer (mainly bile duct cancer).\n\n【10】*   Breast cancer.\n\n【11】*   Cervical cancer.\n\n【12】*   Lung cancer.\n\n【13】*   Skin cancer.\n\n【14】*   Endometrial cancer.\n\n【15】*   Eye cancer.\n\n【16】*   Head and neck cancers.\n\n【17】*   Pancreatic cancer.\n\n【18】*   Prostate cancer.\n\n【19】*   Vaginal cancer.\n\n【20】*   Rectal cancer.\n\n【21】*   Esophageal cancer.\n\n【22】What Are the Benefits of Brachytherapy?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】Brachytherapy is a commonly used procedure to treat cancer. The advantages of brachytherapy are listed below:\n\n【24】1.  It is one of the most effective treatments as the radiation is delivered directly to the organ affected by cancer.\n\n【25】2.  The healthy cells of the body are not damaged, so the side effects are minimal.\n\n【26】3.  The patient need not stay in the hospital for long, unlike other procedures.\n\n【27】4.  The time required to complete the procedure is short, lasting from a few minutes to five days.\n\n【28】5.  The patient need not visit the hospital repeatedly after the procedure.\n\n【29】6.  The recovery is completed in five to seven days so that the patient can return to his job quickly.\n\n【30】How Does the Patient Prepare for Brachytherapy?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Brachytherapy is a procedure used to treat cancer in the body's internal organs. The following things are done before brachytherapy:\n\n【32】*   The doctor explains the procedure as a whole. If the patient is willing to undergo the same, he must sign a consent form.\n\n【33】*   The patient should also inform the doctor about his medications or any allergies or disorders he suffers from. For example, the doctor might ask the patient to stop taking drugs like Aspirin and Ibuprofen before the procedure, as they can cause excessive bleeding.\n\n【34】*   A medication known as a laxative is usually given before the procedure to allow bowel movement.\n\n【35】*   The patient should not eat anything a few hours before the surgery.\n\n【36】*   The doctor might ask the patient to undergo the following imaging test before the procedure to get an idea about the exact location and spread of the cancer:\n\n【37】    1.  **Computerized Tomography (CT) Scans** - In this procedure, the patient is laid on his back on a table that slips into a tunnel-like cylindrical device where the X-rays are taken. It is one of the most commonly used diagnostic methods because it provides three-dimensional (3D) images of the organs affected by cancer.\n*   Before the commencement of the procedure, anesthesia will be administered to the patient so that he falls asleep and the procedure is carried out smoothly without any pain or inconvenience.\n\n【38】What Happens in Brachytherapy?\n------------------------------\n\n【39】The procedure depends upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer. A small tube, known as a catheter, might be inserted to place the radioactive material in the body. The material can also be placed with a device known as the applicator. The different techniques for placing brachytherapy include:\n\n【40】*   **Interstitial Brachytherapy** - In this procedure, a device or applicator containing the radioactive material is placed into the body tissues. This technique is mainly used for breast and prostate cancer. The devices that deliver the radiation to the body tissues are balloons, wires, and seeds that are small as a rice grain. The device is placed by hand or with the help of a computerized machine. It can remain in place for one to seven days if the patient is undergoing low-dose brachytherapy. On the contrary, The device remains in place for 15 to 20 minutes if the patient undergoes high-dose therapy.\n\n【41】*   **Intracavitary Brachytherapy** - As the name suggests, the applicator or the device that contains the radioactive material is placed into the body cavities. For example, the radioactive device can be placed in the vagina to treat cervical cancer or in the trachea (windpipe) to treat lung cancer. The device that delivers the radiation is like a tube that fits into the cavities of the body. It can be placed by hand, a computerized machine, or a catheter. The tube placed at the time of surgery, known as a catheter, can be filled with radioactive material each time. The radioactive device remains in the body for a few minutes, days, or permanently depending upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer.\n\n【42】*   **Episcleral Brachytherapy** - It is a procedure used to treat eye melanoma and retinoblastoma. Melanoma occurs in the eyes when the cells producing melanin pigments are damaged due to cancer. Retinoblastoma is also a type of eye cancer wherein the cells forming the retina are damaged. In episcleral brachytherapy, the radiation device is attached to the eye to treat eye cancer.\n\n【43】What Happens After Brachytherapy?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】After the treatment, the patient is taken to the recovery room to allow the anesthesia to wear off. If the patient has undergone high-dose brachytherapy, the catheter or the applicator is removed, and the patient does not emit any radiation. However, the following things need to be kept in mind after the procedure:\n\n【45】1.  The doctor will prescribe painkillers after removing the catheter.\n\n【46】2.  If the patient has undergone permanent or low-dose brachytherapy, the applicator remains in place for a few days or permanently.\n\n【47】3.  The patient will be emitting radiation, so he needs to stay away from people, especially children and pregnant women.\n\n【48】4.  The doctor or the nurse will treat and provide all the care to the patient but from a distance because of the radiation device attached to the body.\n\n【49】5.  Friends and relatives will not be allowed to meet the patient because of the risk of radiation exposure.\n\n【50】6.  The patient is allowed to meet someone only for half an hour and from a distance.\n\n【51】7.  Consult the doctor before going to work or doing other activities.\n\n【52】8.  The patient must immediately report to the doctor if he experiences the following:\n\n【53】    *   Diarrhea.\n\n【54】    *   Urine leakage.\n\n【55】    *   Respiratory difficulties.\n\n【56】    *   Vomiting and loss of appetite.\n\n【57】    *   Stomach problems.\n\n【58】What Are the Complications of Brachytherapy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【59】The complications depend upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer that has been treated. The complications of brachytherapy are listed below:\n\n【60】*   The patient might leak urine (urinary incontinence) before reaching the toilet if he has been treated for prostate cancer.\n\n【61】*   The presence of pain and burning sensation while urinating are commonly seen.\n\n【62】*   The radiation might damage the nerves and blood vessels of the pelvis and cause erectile dysfunction. The penis cannot remain erect as the blood supply has been blocked due to radiation.\n\n【63】*   Brachytherapy also causes stomach problems like diarrhea, pain, and gas in the stomach.\n\n【64】*   If brachytherapy has been used to treat cervical, vaginal, or prostate cancers, bowel movements get affected, and the patient might suffer from constipation.\n\n【65】*   The patient might experience hair loss if he has been treated for head and neck cancer.\n\n【66】*   The radiation might destroy the healthy cells of the mouth, causing ulcers and mouth sores.\n\n【67】*   The patient feels tired throughout the day and cannot eat anything due to stomach problems.\n\n【68】*   If brachytherapy has been done to treat lung cancer, shortness of breath is one of the most common complications.\n\n【69】**Conclusion**\n\n【70】Brachytherapy is used to treat cancer in multiple body organs. When the cells present in the body proliferate rapidly, cancer occurs. There are many options available to treat cancer, but brachytherapy has become a choice of the doctors and the patient. It is because the procedure is minimally invasive, the healing is quick, and the radiation emitted from the device only targets the defective cells, not the healthy ones. It has been commonly seen that people lose hope when they are diagnosed with cancer. Brachytherapy is a boon for such patients because it saves them from long hospital stays and strong drugs that cause side effects. The devices used for brachytherapy are designed in such a way that they deliver radiation only to the organ affected by cancer. Hence, the healthy tissues of the body are saved from getting damaged. Therefore, the patient must not lose hope and consult the doctor immediately if he is diagnosed with cancer. Brachytherapy is a simple procedure with great results and minimal side effects.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   Brachytherapy to Treat Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/brachytherapy#types-of-brachytherapy\n*   Brachytherapy  \n    https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/brachy\n*   Getting Internal Radiation Therapy (Brachytherapy)  \n    https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/radiation/internal-radiation-therapy-brachytherapy.html\n*   Brachytherapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562190/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Achieving a radiant complexion requires a combination of proper skin care, healthy lifestyle habits, a balanced diet, and exercise. Most people opt for heavy and costly skin care products to achieve that glow. However, these are temporary ways to achieve glowing skin that may not be sustainable in the long run. Glowing skin needs healthy skin internally to show its effects on the outside. Applying makeup to the face is just a coverup. What one may actually need is a consistent exercise routine. Exercise is an underestimated yet essential step to boost the skin's glow naturally within one to two weeks.\n\n【2】Does Exercising Actually Help to Have Glowing Skin?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Most people opt for heavy and costly skin care products to achieve that glow. However, what one may actually need is exercise. Regular exercise has numerous health benefits, including glowing skin. Exercise increases blood flow, delivering oxygen and essential nutrients to the skin. This boost in circulation also helps remove toxins and waste products from the skin, resulting in a clearer complexion. Furthermore, exercise promotes the production of collagen, a protein that keeps skin firm and elastic. It also helps regulate hormones, which contribute to acne and other skin issues. In addition, sweating during exercise helps flush out pores and remove impurities from the skin. Overall, exercise can improve skin health and appearance, making it an essential part of a comprehensive skincare routine.\n\n【4】How Does Exercising Work to Boost Skin Glow?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Exercise is known to have various positive impacts on the body, including weight loss, muscle strengthening, and improvement in overall health. Studies have shown that exercise improves the functioning of the skin cells and reverses mitochondrial changes within the muscles. This is because while exercising, the body's blood flow increases, leading to a rise in body temperature and sweat production. This sweat and heat can cause the skin cells to expand, leading to increased cell turnover and regeneration. Hence, regular exercise can not only improve overall health but also lead to healthy, glowing skin.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>Fact and Fiction Associated With Breastfeeding and Obesity</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Lasers in Plastic Surgery - An Overview</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Please explain molecular karyotyping report taken after miscarriage.</u>\n\n【11】*   **Increases Blood Flow -** When we exercise, the body increases blood flow, which helps carry oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells. It also increases the lymphatic flow, which reduces puffiness.\n\n【12】*   **Increases Collagen Production -**Exercising stimulates the production of collagen, which enhances skin suppleness and lessens wrinkle appearance.\n\n【13】*   **Removes Body Toxins -** Additionally, exercise helps to allow the body's poisons to be removed from it by sweating, which can reduce the occurrence of acne and other skin blemishes.\n\n【14】*   **Reduces Stress** **\\-** Furthermore, exercise can reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins, which can have a positive impact on the skin's appearance. High stress levels have been associated with skin inflammation and premature aging.\n\n【15】*   **Reverse Skin Aging -** Studies have shown that exercising regularly can also help one reverse the signs of aging by improving cell functioning.\n\n【16】How Does Yoga Help Improve Skin Glow?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【17】Yoga involves a series of postures, stretches, and breathing exercises that can help increase blood flow, reduce stress levels, and improve overall body function. All of these factors can contribute to healthier, more radiant skin. Additionally, certain yoga poses and face yoga can target specific areas of the body, such as the face and neck, which can help reduce wrinkles and fine lines.\n\n【18】Which Is Better Yoga or Cardio Exercises for Glowing Skin?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Yoga and cardio are both excellent forms of exercise, each with its own benefits. However, when it comes to achieving glowing skin, aerobic exercises might have the edge.\n\n【20】On the other hand, cardio activities like cycling, running, jogging, and so on make the skin appear tighter and more radiant, reducing fine lines and wrinkles. It opens up the tiny arteries and ensures a good, rich oxygen supply and a sufficient supply of nutrients for skin repair. Exercise helps to improve the mitochondrial functioning of the cell, boosting energy production and controlling reactive oxygen molecules (aging and inflammation). It can also cause more sweating and improve overall skin health, including glowing skin.\n\n【21】Can Outdoor Workouts Worsen the Skin?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】Outdoor workouts have many benefits, including fresh air, vitamin D, and a change of scenery from the monotony of indoor exercise. However, there are concerns about how outdoor workouts can affect the skin. Sun damage is a common concern, especially for those who are outside for extended periods without proper sun protection. Excess sweating can also lead to clogged pores and breakouts, particularly if sweat is left to dry on the skin. Additionally, pollution and environmental toxins can harm the skin and exacerbate existing skin conditions. To minimize the negative effects of outdoor workouts on the skin, it is essential to wear sunscreen, wash one’s face and body immediately after exercise, and consider using skincare products specifically formulated for active individuals.\n\n【23】Is Skin Care After Exercising Important?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【24】After a good workout, it is important to take care of the skin to prevent breakouts and other skin issues and keep it glowing. One must gently wash their face with a cleanser to remove sweat and bacteria. Hot water could rip the skin off its natural oils. Instead, use lukewarm water and a mild cleanser. Next, apply a moisturizer to hydrate the skin. It is advised to use a moisturizer that is lightweight and non-comedogenic, which prevents clogging of the pores. In the case of acne-prone skin, one must consider using a moisturizer with salicylic acid to help prevent breakouts. The final step is to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 before heading outside. This will help prevent sun damage and premature aging. By following these simple steps, one can keep their skin healthy and glowing even after a tough workout.\n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】In summary, regular exercise can help promote healthy and glowing skin by increasing blood flow, stimulating collagen production, flushing out toxins, and reducing stress levels. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and reducing stress can also contribute to a glowing complexion. Finally, incorporating antioxidant-rich foods into the diet, such as berries and leafy greens, can help nourish and protect the skin from damage. By properly following these tips and taking a holistic approach to skincare and wellness, one can achieve a radiant and healthy glow.\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>*   The association between activity levels and skin moisturising function in adults  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018252/\n*   Influence of 8-Week Aerobic Training on the Skin Microcirculation in Patients with Ischaemic Heart Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199599/\n*   Differences in Skin Health Outcomes according to Physical Activity Level among Korean Female College Students  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908903/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a rare, chronic condition characterized by the hardening of the skin and other organs and tissues. In juvenile systemic scleroderma (JSS), the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and scarring. As a result, JSS causes the hardening of the skin, which typically appears first on the face, hands, feet, and abdomen. In addition, individuals with JSS may experience difficulty with joint movement due to stiffness or swelling, gastrointestinal problems such as difficulty swallowing or abdominal pain, and fatigue. Over time, these conditions can worsen, leading to more severe complications.\n\n【2】**What Are the Types of Systemic Scleroderma?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Systemic scleroderma is classified into three main types: diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma, limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and limited systemic sclerosis.\n\n【4】*   **Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Scleroderma:** The most severe form of systemic scleroderma is characterized by the thickening and hardening of the skin on large body areas. It may also affect other organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, digestive system, and muscles.\n\n【5】*   **Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis:** It is the most common form of systemic scleroderma. It is characterized by the thickening and hardening of the skin on restricted body areas, usually the hands and face. It may also affect other organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, digestive system, and muscles.\n\n【6】*   **Limited Systemic Sclerosis:** It is a milder systemic scleroderma typically involving organ function. It usually does not causes the thickening of the skin.\n\n【7】What Are the Sign and Symptoms of Juvenile Systemic Scleroderma?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Systemic scleroderma causes symptoms that affect the child’s skin and organs. They may include:\n\n【9】**Skin and Tissue Symptoms:**\n\n【10】*   Swelling and tightening of the skin, with a thick leathery texture.\n\n【11】*   Calcinosis, which is calcium deposits in the skin or muscles.\n\n【12】*   Ulcers on the fingertips, toes, and other areas of the body.\n\n【13】*   Loss of skin’s ability to stretch.\n\n【14】*   Reduced hand function due to tightening of the fingers and hand.\n\n【15】*   Telangiectasias (enlarged red blood vessels at the skin area of the hand, face, and nail beds).\n\n【16】**Organs symptoms:**\n\n【17】*   Stiffening of the joints can lead to reduced mobility.\n\n【18】*   Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【19】*   Raynaud's phenomenon causes coldness, tingling, and pain in the extremities.\n\n【20】*   Chronic fatigue due to decreased blood flow.\n\n【21】*   Fatigue or tired easily.\n\n【22】*   Muscle weakness.\n\n【23】*   Organ damage, including kidney, gastrointestinal, and heart.\n\n【24】*   Digestive problems include heartburn, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.\n\n【25】**Raynaud’s Phenomenon:**\n\n【26】Raynaud's phenomenon is when the body's blood vessels contract, leading to decreased blood flow in the extremities. Symptoms include coldness, tingling, and pain in the fingers, toes, and other body areas. Raynaud's phenomenon can be triggered by exposure to cold temperatures or stress, lasting a few minutes to several hours. People living with juvenile systemic scleroderma often experience this phenomenon more frequently.\n\n【27】**What Are the Causes of Juvenile Systemic Scleroderma?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Juvenile systemic scleroderma (JSS) is rare when the body's immune system attacks healthy cells. While the exact cause of JSS is unknown, it is believed to be caused by an overactivity of skin connective tissue cells called fibroblasts. These cells produce collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to the skin and other tissues. When these cells become overactive, they can cause an excessive buildup of collagen in the body, leading to the symptoms associated with JSS. In addition to this overactivity of fibroblasts, other factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and infections may also contribute to the development of JSS.\n\n【29】**How Is Systemic Scleroderma Diagnosed?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【30】The healthcare provider will diagnose juvenile systemic scleroderma based on physical examination, patient history, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.\n\n【31】*   **Physical Examination:** The doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination to look for signs of the condition, such as swelling and skin discoloration.\n\n【32】*   **Blood Tests:** Are used to measure autoantibodies that may indicate systemic scleroderma.\n\n【33】*   **Imaging Tests:** Imaging studies such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to look for the thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Sometimes, a skin biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【34】*   **Pulmonary Function Tests:** such as breathing tests to assess lung function.\n\n【35】*   **Echocardiography ( Heart Ultrasound):** Measures the child's heart function.\n\n【36】*   Tests to measure the swallowing function of the esophagus (a tube inserted into the mouth to the stomach).\n\n【37】**How to Treat Juvenile Systemic Scleroderma?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【38】When treating juvenile systemic scleroderma, the main goal is managing symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options for JSS include skin protection, physical therapy, and surgery, and medications.\n\n【39】**Skin Protection:**\n\n【40】*   Protecting the skin is an important part of managing JSS. Skin protection will maximize blood flow to the skin of the hands and feet. It is important to moisturize the skin and avoid sun exposure. Applying sunscreen before going outdoors can help protect the skin from damage. Special dressings or clothing may also help protect the skin.\n\n【41】*   Avoid injury to the affected areas, such as fingertips and toes.\n\n【42】*   Protect the child’s hands and feet from the cold.\n\n【43】*   Avoid smoking or exposing the child to smoke.\n\n【44】*   Avoid cold medications that may include pseudoephedrine.\n\n【45】*   Avoid using astringents on the body.\n\n【46】*   Avoid hard detergents and facial scrubs.\n\n【47】*   Use the lotions a healthcare provider prescribes to keep the skin calm and soft.\n\n【48】**Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy can help improve the range of motion in affected joints and build muscle strength. Physical therapists can also provide exercises that help maintain joint flexibility and decrease pain by improving the blood flow of the affected area.\n\n【49】**Surgery:** In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat severe symptoms of JSS. For example, surgery may remove hardened tissue from affected areas, repair damaged tendons or ligaments, or reduce joint stiffness.\n\n【50】**Medication:**\n\n【51】*   **Corticosteroids:** such as prednisone, are frequently used to treat inflammation in the muscle joints and the skin. However, it is also used to reduce the early stages of internal organ inflammation and decrease the activity of the immune system.\n\n【52】*   **NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs):** Ibuprofen and Naproxen are also used to help reduce inflammation and pain in the joint area for children with arthritis.\n\n【53】*   **Immune Modulator Medication:** It is another type of treatment for JSS. These medications help to alter the immune system and reduce its activity, which can help to lessen the severity of symptoms. Immunosuppressive agents, such as Methotrexate, may also be prescribed to reduce the activity of the immune system.\n\n【54】*   Medications may also be prescribed to help manage Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is a condition that causes episodes of decreased blood flow to the fingers and toes. Medications such as nifedipine or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may help improve circulation and reduce the frequency of Raynaud’s episodes.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Juvenile systemic scleroderma (JSS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect children. The thickening of the skin, connective tissue, and other organ system involvement characterizes it. JSS is a serious condition, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. It is important to seek the advice of a qualified physician to determine the best course of action for managing JSS. Treatment may include medications, lifestyle modifications, and physical therapy. With proper care, living with juvenile systemic scleroderma and maintaining a good quality of life is possible.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pediatric Scleroderma –Systemic and Localized Forms  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459339/\n*   Systemic Scleroderma in Childhood: A Case Report  \n    https://archivesofrheumatology.org/full-text/592\n*   Juvenile Scleroderma (Localized)  \n    https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/juvenile-scleroderma</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These types of movements, called tics and twitches, often affect the eyelids or face. They can, however, occur anywhere in the body. In most cases, tics and twitches are harmless and temporary. In some cases, though, they may be caused due to a tic disorder. Tic disorders can generally be managed with treatment and lifestyle changes.\n\n【2】What Is Chronic Motor Tic Disorder?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】A chronic motor tic disorder is a condition that involves small, uncontrolled, spasm-like movements or vocal outbursts (referred to as phonic tics), but not both. If an individual experiences both a physical tic and a vocal outburst, the condition is known as Tourette syndrome.\n\n【4】A chronic motor tic disorder is much more common than Tourette syndrome but less common than transient tic disorder. A chronic motor tic disorder is a temporary and self-limited disorder expressed in the form of tics. Another type is called dystonic tics, which presents as abrupt bursts of movement later followed by a sustained contraction.\n\n【5】Chronic motor tic disorder starts appearing before 18 years of age and usually resolves within four to six years. Treatment can help reduce the effect of this condition on school or work life.\n\n【6】What Causes Chronic Motor Tic Disorder?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】Doctors are not completely sure what leads to chronic motor tic disorder or why some kids develop it before others. Some suggest chronic motor tic disorder may be caused due to the result of physical or chemical abnormalities in the brain.\n\n【8】The chemicals that carry signals throughout the brain are called neurotransmitters. Sometimes they may not be working properly or not communicating correctly. This results in the same message being sent over and over again. It causes a physical tic.\n\n【9】**Who Has a Risk of Chronic Motor Tic Disorder?**\n\n【10】Children who have a family history of chronic tics or twitches are more predisposed to develop chronic motor tic disorder. In addition, boys are at higher risk of having chronic motor tic disorder than girls.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Chronic Motor Tic Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Individuals with a chronic motor tic disorder may exhibit the following symptoms:\n\n【13】*   Grimacing of the face (frowned appearance on the face).\n\n【14】*   Involuntary uncontrollable eye and face movements, such as repeatedly blinking, twitching of the nose, or jerking or clenching of the jaw.\n\n【15】*   Involuntary jerking of the arms, legs, or body muscles, but rarely the torso.\n\n【16】*   Producing certain sounds that can include grunts, coughs, sniffling, throat clearing, and contractions of the abdomen and diaphragm.\n\n【17】Some individuals experience strange sensations in the body before a tic occurs. They are usually capable of restraining their symptoms for short periods, but this requires effort. Giving in to a tic allows a sense of relief. They describe it as a response to an inner urge.\n\n【18】Tics may get worse due to:\n\n【19】*   Distress, anxiety, or embarrassment.\n\n【20】*   Lack of proper sleep.\n\n【21】*   Intense emotions.\n\n【22】*   Fever or illness.\n\n【23】*   Heat.\n\n【24】*   Fatigue.\n\n【25】*   Excitement.\n\n【26】How to Diagnose Chronic Motor Tic Disorders?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Tics are generally diagnosed during a regular appointment at a doctor’s office. Out of the following listed requirements, you or your child must meet two of the requirements to receive a diagnosis of chronic motor tic disorder:\n\n【28】*   Having an age less than 18 years when the tics began appearing.\n\n【29】*   Show one or more motor tics.\n\n【30】*   Have tics that often occur throughout the day, every single day, or occasionally sometimes as on and off for a minimum of a year.\n\n【31】*   Have not been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome.\n\n【32】*   Have tics that do not occur as a result of taking certain medications or other drugs and are not caused due to other medical issues.\n\n【33】Chronic motor tics are diagnosed only by physical examination, and no tests are generally needed.\n\n【34】How Is Chronic Motor Tic Disorder Treated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The treatment that a person receives for chronic motor tic disorder will depend mainly on the severity of the disorder and how it is affecting their life. Medications and talk therapy (behavioral therapy) are the treatment options when the tics have a significant effect on the daily activities of the child or an adult.\n\n【36】**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**\n\n【37】Cognitive behavioral therapy can prove helpful for a child to learn to restrain or control a tic for a short period of time. According to a study that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association in 2010, a treatment approach known as a comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) significantly improved symptoms of chronic motor tics in children.\n\n【38】In CBIT, children with chronic motor tics are trained and educated to recognize the urge of a tic and the use of a competing or replacement response instead of the tic.\n\n【39】**Medications**\n\n【40】Certain medications can help to control or reduce the tics. Medicines that doctors sometimes prescribe to control tics include the following:\n\n【41】*   Haloperidol (Haldol).\n\n【42】*   Risperidone (Risperdal).\n\n【43】*   Pimozide.\n\n【44】*   Topiramate (Topamax).\n\n【45】*   Aripiprazole (Abilify).\n\n【46】*   Guanfacine.\n\n【47】*   Clonidine.\n\n【48】*   Cannabis-based medications.\n\n【49】Cannabis-based products must not be given to children, adolescents, or pregnant, or lactating mothers. Other medical treatments may include a surgical procedure that involves the implantation of an electrical device in the brain. In addition, some individuals may get relief from the implantation of electrodes in the brain.\n\n【50】What Can Be Expected as the Long-Term Outlook (Prognosis) Of Chronic Motor Tic Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】Those children who develop chronic motor tic disorder between six and eight years of age often do very well. However, symptoms of this disorder may last for four to six years and then stop showing in the early teens without the need for any treatment. When the condition starts in older children and gets carried on into the 20s, then it may turn into a lifelong condition.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】A chronic motor tic disorder is a condition characterized by small, fast, uncontrollable muscle movements that can occur anywhere in the body but most commonly affects the eyelids, face, arms, and legs. These movements are spasm-like and are brief and temporary. It usually affects young children but sometimes may also occur in adults. Medications and behavioral therapy are the recommended treatment of choice for this disorder.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   MountSinai - Chronic motor tic disorder  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/chronic-motor-tic-disorder\n*   MedlinePlus - Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000745.htm\n*   ChildMind - Quick guide to chronic motor or vocal tic disorder  \n    https://childmind.org/guide/what-is-chronic-motor-or-vocal-tic-disorder/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

WBC-forming cells, the myeloid, and the lymphoid cells tend to exhibit hyperplastic changes that produce either immature or abnormally shaped WBCs. This results in a deterioration of the normal hematopoietic functions of blood.\n\n【2】Leukemia is divided mainly into two forms based on clinical characteristics:\n\n【3】**Acute Leukemia:** Acute leukemia is a fatal condition and if misdiagnosed or not treated in time can lead to severe complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage, or severe blood infections and sometimes death. Most untreated patients, especially in acute leukemia, usually face fatality within or less than one year.\n\n【4】Leukemia is further divided into lymphocytic and myelocytic forms based on cell histology.\n\n【5】*   **Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL):** It is much more prevalent amongst younger children; it contributes to nearly 50 percent of all global neoplasms and 80 percent of the leukemias occurring in childhood. The prognosis is considered poor, especially in patients older than 30 years.\n\n【6】*   **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):** In contrast to the lymphoid form, the incidence of the myeloid form usually increases in older individuals after the sixth decade of life, primarily as per case reports among people older than 65 age. Current cancer research also suggests that the incidence of AML has been on the rise over the past decade.\n\n【7】What Are the Oral Manifestations of Leukemia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Acute leukemia has a set of oral manifestations in particular.

According to Stafford et al. dentists should recognize the oral manifestations of leukemic patients, which would be helpful in an early diagnosis.\n\n【19】What Are the General Symptoms of Leukemia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】General clinical symptoms of leukemia include-\n\n【21】*   Malaise or fatigue.\n\n【22】*   Generalized body weakness.\n\n【23】*   Feelings of helplessness.\n\n【24】*   Depression mainly occurs within three months or before the disease's onset.\n\n【25】*   Loss of appetite or decreased weight.\n\n【26】*   Fever (seen in approximately 10 percent of the patients).\n\n【27】*   Spontaneous bleeding or rupture of the skin with a tendency towards easy bruising or bleeding.\n\n【28】Leukemia patients should also be screened again after diagnosis clinically and radiologically for observing additional oral manifestations that can have a detrimental impact on their treatment or general health (if not treated alongside conventional medicine by the oncologist).\n\n【29】What Are the Dental Management Strategies Employed By the Dentist?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   Gingival enlargement as such in leukemic patients is usually a self-limiting condition according to dental research; It means the inflammatory gingival disease tends to disappear without any specific treatment protocol or periodontal treatment plans.\n\n【31】*   But the most common issue in these patients is that the enlarged gingival tissues facilitate more plaque accumulation and food impaction.\n\n【32】*   This can further aggravate oral mucosal inflammation and irritation while complicating the maintenance of individual oral hygiene.\n\n【33】*   Patients may also be concerned about bleeding while brushing or mouth washing during their daily routine oral hygiene.\n\n【34】*   Dentists may also encounter varying degrees of periodontal diseases or chronic periodontitis that secondary clinical features may often aggravate due to a lack of professional aid or irregular dental follow-ups.\n\n【35】*   Regular procedures or follow-up like scaling, subgingival debridement, mouth rinsing or washing, extraction of teeth with a hopeless prognosis, and administration of antibiotics when needed should be done.\n\n【36】*   Before every dental sitting, a blood test or CBC (complete blood count), preoperative evaluation, and physician's consent would be mandatory to address all dental issues.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】To conclude, leukemic patients have specific oral manifestations that ideally need early recognition, especially by the dental surgeon, which would also aid in timely diagnosis with life-saving potential. Any possibility of oral tumors or malignancies, severity in the periodontal disease, and potential osteolytic lesions apart from gingival enlargement should be carefully observed and treated by the dentist or the maxillofacial surgeon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can be done at the beginning of a complicated major surgery or during the surgery itself. The brain is one of the body's largest and most complex organs. It controls all the functions, which makes it extremely important to protect it from external injuries; the skull does this. A bony structure envelopes the brain; however, in brain damage (due to an injury, tumor, or infection), an incision (cut) cannot be made in the skull to reach the brain.\n\n【2】The skull is very hard and needs a bone saw to section it. The risk with an electric bone saw is that no matter how trained the neurosurgeon is, it is difficult to control the blades without damage to the underlying brain, hence the burr holes. Think of them as connecting the dots; the neurosurgeon makes multiple holes with a drill, then uses a different tool to connect these holes and lifts a section of the skull (craniotomy), leaving a window for the surgeon to work on the brain. A burr hole can be a medical procedure to treat brain conditions such as hematoma (collection of blood often mixed with blood clots) to relieve intracranial pressure (pressure inside the brain).\n\n【3】What Is the Use of a Burr Hole?\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】A burr hole is used to access the brain; some of the reasons are-\n\n【5】*   **Subdural Hematoma** \\- It is bleeding within the skull but outside the brain. A normal brain is covered by meninges (dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater) which separate it from the skull. Blood vessels that supply blood to the brain also supply to these layers and the skull. When a traumatic brain injury occurs, the aforementioned blood vessels get ruptured, and blood starts leaking; if the leak happens between the meninges, it is called an acute subdural hematoma. If the same injury happens in old age due to brain shrinkage and stretching of thin blood vessels, it is known as a chronic subdural hematoma.\n\n【6】*   **Epidural Hematoma** - It is also called an extradural hematoma or intracranial hematoma; also seen in traumatic brain injury. Unlike subdural hematoma, the blood leaks into the space between the membranes and the skull.\n\n【7】*   **Hydrocephalus** - Hydrocephalus is caused due to an imbalance in the amount of CSF produced and absorbed back into the bloodstream resulting in pressure that can damage the brain tissue.It is mostly seen in infants, where excess fluid builds up in the brain and puts pressure on it. Normally, the tissues in the brain continuously produce a colorless fluid called the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to cushion the brain from shock or trauma.\n\n【8】*   **Cancer** \\- Burr holes as such can be used to take the biopsy of an underlying brain tumor; in a few cases, the neurosurgeon further extends the surgery to a craniotomy (sectioning of the skull) to remove the entire tumor.\n\n【9】*   **Infection** - Meningitis (inflammation of meninges) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) caused by bacteria and viruses also increase intracranial pressure, occasionally requiring surgical intervention.\n\n【10】How Is the Burr Hole Procedure Done?\n------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   A neurosurgeon maps out the location of the burr holes; they will use diagnostic imaging tests like computed tomography (CT) scans to assess the underlying condition and plan the treatment. It is done under general anesthesia; once the exact location for the burr holes is determined, the surgical team will shave and disinfect the area.\n\n【12】*   The neurosurgeon makes an incision into the scalp and exposes the skull; a special drill is used to create the burr hole. The drills are designed to stop drilling once the skull is penetrated, thus preventing injury to the brain.\n\n【13】*   The hole may be used immediately to drain blood or other fluids, causing pressure on the brain, often seen in ventriculostomy or decompression surgery. Depending on the underlying condition, it may be closed or left open to drain with a shunt.\n\n【14】*   If the holes are proposed for a craniotomy or a craniectomy, the surgeon will use specialized tools to section the skull using the holes as a guide. This gives access to a wider brain area to perform complex brain surgeries. Once complete, they put the sectioned skull back immediately (as in craniotomy) or at a later stage (done in craniectomy). The overlying scalp is placed into its normal position, and sutures or staples are used to close the incision.\n\n【15】What Is the Difference Between Burr Hole, Craniotomy, and Craniectomy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】All the procedures mentioned above are done to treat problems in the brain. To reach the brain, the neurosurgeon needs to access it by cutting the skull; based on how the skull is sectioned, the surgeries can be divided into the following:\n\n【17】1.  **Burr Hole Drainage**\\- A small hole measuring around 14 mm (standard diameter of an electric drill) is drilled into the skull to drain hematomas, and one hole is sufficient.\n\n【18】2.  **Craniotomy**\\- Pre-planned multiple burr holes are made and joined with a craniotome saw to remove a section of the skull, done in cases like cranial subdural empyema or tumor, etc. After the surgeon is done working on the brain, the sectioned skull is positioned back in its original location with plates and screws.\n\n【19】3.  **Craniectomy**\\- This also involves sectioning off the skull with the guidance of the burr holes. However, the surgeon does not immediately replace the removed piece; instead, the skull is left open until the underlying pressure comes down. This approach is mostly preferred in Chiari decompression surgery.\n\n【20】What Are the Complications of a Burr Hole Surgery?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Burr hole placement has significant risks; some of which are the following:\n\n【22】*   Bleeding of the brain.\n\n【23】*   Seizure.\n\n【24】*   Stroke.\n\n【25】*   Infection of the incision or brain.\n\n【26】*   Brain damage includes sensory changes, memory problems, coordination difficulties, and speech impairment.\n\n【27】*   Swelling of the brain and coma.\n\n【28】What Happens After a Burr Hole Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】The patient is observed till all the vitals are stable and then transferred to an ICU (intensive care unit), where the staff can closely monitor the patient. Disinfection at the incision site is of utmost importance because a secondary infection can easily reach the brain from the suture site. In most cases, prophylactic antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories will be given to manage the pain.\n\n【30】**Conclusion:**\n\n【31】Burr hole is a serious procedure done by a neurosurgeon, whether it is for decompression or to allow for more complicated surgery. Post-surgery, the patient is checked for vitals and may need to stay in the hospital for a few days or weeks, depending on the severity. Recovery requires a significant amount of time compared to typical surgical procedures.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Burr Holes  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/burr-holes\n*   Hydrocephalus  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocephalus/symptoms-causes/syc-20373604#:~:text=Hydrocephalus%20is%20the%20buildup%20of,the%20brain%20and%20spinal%20column\n*   Brain edema and increased intracranial pressure in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2498090/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a034eaa9-21bd-40f3-80e4-3d11c217fcce", "title": "Heart Disease Prevention in Postmenopausal Women", "text": "【0】Heart Disease Prevention in Postmenopausal Women\nWhat Is Menopause?\n------------------\n\n【1】Menopause is not an illness or a medical condition but a natural part of a woman’s life and refers to the end of the menstrual cycle in women. Clinically, the absence of menstrual cycles for 12 months is diagnosed as menopause, and the phase which occurs subsequently is known as the postmenopausal phase. Simply put, it is a phase in which women do not get any periods, and their ovaries lose their reproductive function.\n\n【2】Menopause occurs due to a decline in the production of follicles by ovaries. This transition usually begins in the fourth or fifth decade of their lives and lasts as long as 14 years. However, specific individuals can experience menopause much earlier in life. This can happen because of chemotherapeutic drugs (drugs used in cancer treatment), genetic causes, or surgical procedures like oophorectomy (a surgical procedure to remove ovaries) and hysterectomy (a surgical procedure done to remove the uterus).\n\n【3】Menopause, or the depletion of the follicles, leads to a significant decrease in the levels of estrogen and progesterone. They are hormones that play a vital role in maintaining women’s health.\n\n【4】What Are the Functions of Estrogen and Progesterone?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The hormones estrogen and progesterone (also known as female sex hormones) are steroid hormones. They have local effects (affecting the nearby organs) and systemic effects (involving the entire body). Starting at puberty, estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the maturation of the female reproductive organs. Estrogen also plays a vital role in developing secondary sex characteristics- the development of breasts, widening of hips, and distribution of fat at thighs and hips.\n\n【6】On a systemic level, estrogen protects the blood vessels and makes them flexible, helping them accommodate blood flow, which covers the cardiac system. It also helps regulate cholesterol in the body. Additionally, both hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, strengthen the bone by increasing bone density.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Menopause?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】Although the signs and symptoms can vary from one individual to another, the following symptoms are found in most women:\n\n【9】*   Hot flashes.\n\n【10】*   Irregular periods.\n\n【11】*   Weight fluctuations.\n\n【12】*   Mood swings.\n\n【13】*   Tenderness in the breasts.\n\n【14】*   Heavier or lighter periods.\n\n【15】*   Increased growth of facial hair.\n\n【16】*   Sleep disturbances.\n\n【17】*   Night sweats.\n\n【18】*   Joint pains.\n\n【19】*   Rapid or irregular heartbeats.\n\n【20】*   Headaches.\n\n【21】*   Muscle aches.\n\n【22】*   Hair fall.\n\n【23】*   Urinary incontinence.\n\n【24】*   Vaginal dryness.\n\n【25】*   Decrease in sex drive.\n\n【26】*   Dry skin.\n\n【27】What Are the Symptoms of Post-menopause?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】The majority of postmenopausal women experience residual menopausal symptoms. The symptoms are not as severe. In certain instances, they almost vanish. If the symptoms increase and affect the quality of life, one should contact their physician to rule out any underlying conditions or complications.\n\n【29】Why Should Postmenopausal Women Be Extra Cautious About Their Health?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Once the body stops producing estrogen and progesterone, women are more vulnerable to developing cardiovascular diseases as the cardio-protective functions are lost. The following changes occur when estrogen and progesterone are deficient:\n\n【31】*   Hypertension (increased blood pressure).\n\n【32】*   Increased bad cholesterol levels (LDL or low-density lipoprotein).\n\n【33】*   Decreased levels of good cholesterol (HDL or high-density lipoprotein).\n\n【34】*   Increased body weight (leads to obesity if not controlled).\n\n【35】*   Stiffening of the blood vessels.\n\n【36】Apart from being susceptible to developing cardiovascular diseases, postmenopausal women are also vulnerable to osteoporosis (a medical condition characterized by weak and brittle bones), vaginal atrophy (also known as atrophic vaginitis, a medical condition in which the lining of the vagina gets dry and thin), anxiety, and depression.\n\n【37】What Are the Risk Factors for Heart Disease in Postmenopausal Women?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   Hypercholesterolemia (increased cholesterol levels).\n\n【39】*   Diabetes (increased sugar levels in the blood).\n\n【40】*   Family history of premature heart disease.\n\n【41】*   Obesity (increased amount of body fat).\n\n【42】*   Tobacco and alcohol abuse.\n\n【43】What Are the Symptoms of Hospitalization?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【44】One should rush to the hospital if they have any of the following symptoms:\n\n【45】*   Uneasy sensation in the chest with pain radiating to arms, neck, and jaws.\n\n【46】*   Sudden sharp shooting pain in the back, between the shoulder blades.\n\n【47】*   Dyspnea or breathlessness, especially at rest.\n\n【48】*   Light-headedness.\n\n【49】*   Unusual or unexplained tiredness, even at rest.\n\n【50】*   Breaking out in a cold sweat.\n\n【51】It is important to understand that symptoms of a heart attack can also occur in the absence of chest pain. Hence, women should be wary of the following symptoms as well:\n\n【52】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【53】*   Nausea.\n\n【54】*   Back pain.\n\n【55】*   Vomiting.\n\n【56】In the event of the above-mentioned symptoms, women should rush to the hospital.\n\n【57】What Should Postmenopausal Women Do to Decrease the Risk of Heart Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】**Routine Body Check-Ups:**\n\n【59】In order to monitor heart health and overall health, it is essential to get regular body check-ups. It should include a screening of cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Blood pressure and weight fluctuations should also be monitored.\n\n【60】*   **Increase Physical Activity:** Since the body utilizes energy in different ways after menopause, it is easier for the body to accumulate more fat than usual. In order to prevent this, one should exercise regularly. One can go for regular walks, runs, jogs, or learn a new outdoor sport. Working out for at least 150 minutes per week helps improve heart health. Exercise improves muscular strength, body weight, lipid profile, and cardiorespiratory fitness. It also helps in the regulation of blood pressure.\n\n【61】*   **Making Dietary Changes:** One should have a low-salt diet and limit the consumption of saturated fats and sugars. Increasing the intake of whole grains and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables can also help improve heart and overall health. In addition, non-vegetarians should opt for lean meats (such as fish and chicken) instead of red meat (such as pork and lamb) as they have less fat.\n\n【62】*   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Blood vessels slowly become stiff with an increase in age. But this stiffness accelerates with smoking and alcohol consumption. Stiff blood vessels make an individual susceptible to heart disease. Hence avoiding such stimulants is advisable.\n\n【63】*   **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** It may be advisable for certain patients, but it works best when they are started as soon as the symptoms of menopause occur. One should consult a physician to understand the available options.\n\n【64】**Conclusion**\n\n【65】The risk of heart disease increases for every individual with age, but women are more susceptible to heart disease once they are in their postmenopausal phase. Menopause is not directly associated with heart disease, but it is a risk factor that makes women susceptible to poor heart health. This happens because the levels of hormones, namely estrogen and progesterone, decrease drastically, and significant changes occur in the body. The overall functioning of the body changes, fat cells work differently, and the body utilizes energy in different ways. It is easier for women to gain weight and has cholesterol problems, which puts their hearts at risk of developing a disease. Hence, it is crucial to identify the risk factors which may present with nontypical symptoms.\n\n【66】The sooner the risk factors are identified, the necessary interventions can be made, and heart diseases can be prevented in postmenopausal women.\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>*   Menopause and Heart Disease  \n    https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease/menopause-and-heart-disease\n*   Menopause Transition and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Implications for Timing of Early Prevention: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000912#d1e871\n*   Menopause  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/menopause</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can trigger many symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, coughing, chest pain, and fatigue. This disorder is not well understood, but it is suspected to be connected to a genetic mutation. The diagnostic process commonly includes imaging tests; a lung biopsy may sometimes be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment approaches vary based on the severity of the condition, with options ranging from medication and surgery to lung transplantation. Due to its rarity, patients need specialized care from a medical professional experienced in diagnosing and treating pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【2】What Is Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Pulmonary hemangiomatosis is an unusual condition involving abnormal lung blood vessel development. This growth can cause blood vessels to dilate abnormally, forming lung nodules or lesions. These nodules can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and fatigue by interfering with normal lung function. Although the exact cause of pulmonary hemangiomatosis is unknown, it is thought to be linked to a gene variant that affects the development and growth of blood vessels in the lungs. The condition is typically diagnosed using imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans, and a lung biopsy may be required to verify the diagnosis.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   The precise origins of pulmonary hemangiomatosis remain uncertain; however, it is believed to stem from a genetic mutation that disrupts the growth and development of blood vessels in the lungs.\n\n【6】*   In some cases, pulmonary hemangiomatosis may be associated with other medical conditions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or systemic sclerosis.\n\n【7】*   Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder that affects the development of blood vessels throughout the body.\n\n【8】*   People with HHT are more likely to develop abnormal blood vessels in their lungs, liver, and brain, which can lead to various complications, including pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【9】*   Systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the body's connective tissues, causing skin and internal organs to thicken and harden.\n\n【10】*   In some cases, systemic sclerosis can lead to the development of pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【11】*   In addition to hereditary variables and other medical disorders, environmental factors such as exposure to chemicals or radiation may play a role in developing pulmonary hemangiomatosis. However, greater research is needed to understand these factors completely.\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】However, the following are common symptoms of pulmonary hemangiomatosis:\n\n【14】1.  The most common symptom of pulmonary hemangiomatosis is shortness of breath, ranging from mild to severe. Patients may have difficulty breathing or feel a tightness in their chest.\n\n【15】2.  Another common symptom of pulmonary hemangiomatosis is a persistent cough. Patients may cough up blood in some cases.\n\n【16】3.  Patients may develop chest pain or discomfort due to the abnormal proliferation of lung blood vessels.\n\n【17】4.  Patients with pulmonary hemangiomatosis may experience fatigue and a reduced ability to perform daily activities.\n\n【18】5.  Because of the stress placed on the heart by the compromised lung function, pulmonary hemangiomatosis can cause an irregular or rapid heartbeat.\n\n【19】In severe cases, respiratory hemangiomatosis can result in the onset of pulmonary hypertension, a painful condition that can cause breathlessness, dizziness, and fainting.\n\n【20】How to Diagnose Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The following diagnostic procedures are used most commonly for pulmonary hemangiomatosis:\n\n【22】1.  **Imaging Testing:** Procedures such as chest X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans can assist in imaging the lungs and identify abnormalities, such as nodules or lesion growth.\n\n【23】2.  **Lung Biopsy:** A lung biopsy is performed to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hemangiomatosis, which entails extracting a small sample of lung tissue and analyzing it under a microscope.\n\n【24】3.  **Blood Testing:** Blood tests may be performed to assess the patient's overall health and rule out any underlying medical disorders related to pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【25】4.  **Pulmonary Function Testing:** These tests assess how effectively the lungs are working and can assist in determining the severity of the condition.\n\n【26】5.  **Genetic Testing:** It may be recommended in some situations to look for genetic mutations that may be linked to pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【27】It is essential to point out that due to the rarity of this ailment, it is best to seek treatment from a medical practitioner who has experience diagnosing and treating pulmonary hemangiomatosis.\n\n【28】What Is the Treatment Plan For Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis is typically treated with a mix of drugs and lifestyle changes. Among the possible treatments are:\n\n【30】1.  **Medications:** Doctors may administer corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or chemotherapeutic treatments to reduce inflammation, halt blood vessel expansion, and suppress the immune system.\n\n【31】2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Patients may require oxygen therapy to alleviate shortness of breath and increase blood oxygen levels.\n\n【32】3.  **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** It is a regimen of exercise and breathing exercises aimed to improve lung function, Reduce inflammation, slow blood vessel formation, and suppress the immunological system.\n\n【33】4.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Patients may require oxygen therapy to alleviate shortness of breath. Contacting a pulmonologist or a Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis expert is essential to build a specific treatment strategy that addresses individual needs and concerns and increases blood oxygen levels.\n\n【34】5.  **Surgery:** In severe situations, surgery may be required to remove hemangiomatosis-affected lung tissue or to control lung bleeding.\n\n【35】6.  **Clinical Trials:** For individuals who do not react to established therapy choices, clinical trials may be accessible. These trials may include experimental drugs or treatments to slow or reverse disease progression.\n\n【36】Contacting a pulmonologist or a Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis expert is essential to build a specific treatment strategy that addresses individual needs and concerns.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis is an uncommon disorder that causes severe respiratory symptoms and is difficult to detect and cure. Although no cure currently exists for this condition, the primary objective of treatment options is to alleviate symptoms, enhance the quality of life, and mitigate the progression of the disease. Medication, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, surgery, and participation in clinical trials may all be used in treatment. Collaborating closely with a pulmonologist or a Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis specialist is critical to design a tailored treatment strategy that meets unique requirements and concerns. Early detection and therapy can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for people with Pulmonary Hemangiomatosis.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pulmonary hemangiomatosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709648/\n*   Pulmonary haemangiomatosis  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-capillary-haemangiomatosis\n*   Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.855528</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The risk of developing urinary tract infections increases with age, and it is among the most common infections in elderly people, especially those above 65 years. It is also frequently seen in long-term care resident patients due to nursing home infections. The incidence is higher in women compared to men and may be challenging to treat compared to younger adults due to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB).\n\n【2】What Are Bladder Spasms?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Sudden involuntary contractions or tightening of the detrusor muscle (bladder muscle), causing an urgent sensation for urination, is a bladder spasm. It is sometimes associated with pain and burning sensation and can be embarrassing in some situations. If the contractions continue, it may even cause leakage of the urine. Bladder spasms can lead to social isolation and depression in some individuals; and impact the quality of life. However, bladder spasms are common with aging and may indicate health issues. Urinary tract infections may also lead to bladder spasms when bacteria enter the urinary tract. It is associated with pain in the lower abdomen and back, a burning sensation while urinating, and fever.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Bladder Spasms?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】Bladder spasms in elderly people can occur due to the following conditions:\n\n【6】*   Urinary tract infections in elderly people occur due to decreased immunity, exposure to nosocomial microorganisms (hospital or healthcare-associated infections), presence of a urinary catheter, and underlying comorbidities such as stroke, dementia, etc.\n\n【7】*   Enlarged prostate gland.\n\n【8】*   Diabetes.\n\n【9】*   Neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral palsy, etc\n\n【10】*   Interstitial cystitis.\n\n【11】*   Certain medications, such as Bethanechol, Furosemide, Valrubicin, etc.\n\n【12】*   Impaired kidney functions.\n\n【13】How Can Urine Infections in Elderly People Be Prevented?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Prevention of urinary tract infections can help reduce bladder spasms in elderly people. Antibiotic prophylaxis and non-antimicrobial therapies, such as estrogen therapy administered in females, can be beneficial.\n\n【15】*   Increasing the fluid intake can flush out the bacteria and reduce the infection.\n\n【16】*   Maintaining proper personal hygiene by washing and wiping the area after urination.\n\n【17】*   If the patients are on adult diapers, they must be regularly checked and replaced.\n\n【18】*   Regular exercises, meditation, adequate rest, and a healthy diet helps to improve immunity and prevent infections.\n\n【19】When Should Patients Seek Medical Help for Bladder Spasms?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Bladder spasms require immediate management if associated with fever, severe pelvic pain, and the presence of blood in the urine. Patients with bladder spasms associated with urine leakage must contact a doctor as early as possible and must get evaluated to determine the underlying cause. If the doctor suspects the bladder spasms are due to a urinary infection, a urine test and urine analysis are recommended, which helps in treatment planning.\n\n【21】How to Stop Bladder Spasms Associated With Urinary Tract Infections in Elderly People?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Management of bladder spasms in elderly people depends on the severity and the underlying cause. Combination therapy is usually preferred, and the doctor will treat the cause and symptoms, followed by the treatment of bladder spasms. The first line of treatment for bladder spasms due to UTI includes antimicrobial agents to treat the underlying cause.\n\n【23】The most common organism responsible for urinary tract infection is Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus mirabilis, etc. or some gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus.\n\n【24】**Treatment of UTI:** Nitrofurantoin monohydrate 100 mg is recommended twice daily for five days, or Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 169/800 mg twice daily for three days. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with chronic kidney disease; therefore, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole is preferred. The lower UTI is often managed with a three to a five-day regimen of any one of the following drugs:\n\n【25】*   Ciprofloxacin 250 - 500 mg every 12 hours.\n*   Ofloxacin 200 - 400 mg twice a day.\n*   Cephalosporins like Cephalexin 250 - 500 mg sixth hourly.\n*   Amoxicillin 500 mg with Clavulanic acid 125 mg.\n\n【26】The upper UTI needs more aggressive management with parenteral antimicrobial agents such as Ceftriaxone and Cefuroxime for around 10 to 14 days. Antimicrobials used for prophylaxis are Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, and Norfloxacin may be advised for long-term treatment.\n\n【27】**Treatment of Bladder Spasms:** Medications, such as antimuscarinic drugs, play a pivotal role in the management of bladder spasms in elderly people. Oxybutynin was used in the 1970s but led to side effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and dry mouth. This led to the discontinuation of the drug, and to overcome the same, specific muscarinic agents which act by blocking the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors were introduced after the year 2000. These include Solifenacin, Trospium, Fesoterodine, Darifenacin, etc. These drugs are more specific compared to Oxybutynin but were associated with similar adverse effects. Miracegron, a beta-agonist, has been approved recently to treat bladder spasms. It can be used alone or in combination with Solifenacin, which is known to reduce the symptoms more effectively when compared to monotherapy. These drugs relax the bladder muscles and prevent the leakage of urine.\n\n【28】With the administration of pharmacotherapy, the bladder spasms can be effectively managed; however, some patients with predominant symptoms of bladder spasms may require non-pharmacological interventions along with medications such as:\n\n【29】**Lifestyle Modifications:** Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and acidic foods may be recommended to regain control over the bladder. Pelvic floor exercises may be advised, which help to strengthen the pelvic muscles and help control urination.\n\n【30】**Electrical Stimulation:** Electrodes are inserted temporarily into the rectum or vagina, which act by stimulating and strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. It can also be effective for stress incontinence and may require treatment for a few months.\n\n【31】If medical treatments are ineffective in treating bladder spasms, drip collectors, pads, or protective garments are advised to help manage urine leakage and prevent discomfort. Drip collector devices have absorbent padding, which helps absorb the urine.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Sudden involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle, causing an urgent sensation for urination, is a bladder spasm. It can be caused due to various reasons, and one of those is urinary tract infections. It is associated with pain and burning sensation, can be embarrassing in some situations, and affects the quality of life.

The sexual activity of an individual majorly depends upon two factors. First is the acquired sexual response patterns present by birth or genetically inherited that develop gradually to fulfill the purpose of reproduction. Another is the extent and the types of influences exercised upon a person by the surrounding people or society as a way to express their sexuality. However, some people rarely get involved in particular or any sexual behavior at all. They are said to be in celibacy or abstinence.\n\n【2】Almost all kinds of sexual behaviors can be considered label-deviant, meaning a particular behavior may not be familiar in a certain community or society. However, they should not be judged morally as people of different places or communities vary in their sexual practices, so what is atypical in one society may be normal for another.\n\n【3】**What Are the Types of Sexual Behaviors?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【4】According to the type of activity that sexual behavior includes, they can be classified as intercourse sexual behaviors and non-intercourse sexual behaviors. Penetrative sexual behaviors carry the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases or infections (STDs or STIs). Non-intercourse sexual behaviors are practiced to maintain virginity and as a means of birth control. They can be further divided as per the number and gender of the participants involved, as solitary behaviors and sociosexual behaviors that may include one or more persons. Sociosexual behavior is generally sorted into heterosexual behavior (with the opposite gender) and homosexual behavior (with the same gender). If more than two individuals are a part of a behavior, then it can be a heterosexual and homosexual activity simultaneously.\n\n【5】**What Are Non-intercourse Sexual Behaviors?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Non-intercourse sexual behavior lists a group of sexual behaviors that are devoid of penetration into any organ or part of the human body. Such behaviors may include aspects of penetration but not actual penetration, like fingering. Instead, other forms of sexual or asexual activities are performed, like cuddling, kissing, mutual masturbation, etc.\n\n【7】**Solitary Behaviors:**\n\n【8】Among solitary sexual behaviors, self-masturbation is the most familiar. It involves stimulating oneself to cause sexual arousal and orgasm (the climax of sexual excitement). Usually, it is practiced in private and does not lead to further activities, but sometimes, it is done to expedite a sociosexual relationship.\n\n【9】Generally, people start masturbating at or near puberty. Masturbation is a repeated behavior mainly seen in unmarried, common among men, particularly young males. However, its frequency decreases or is completely stopped on the availability of the sociosexual activity. Females rarely masturbate and discontinue this practice upon engaging in sociosexual relationships. Its frequency varies from one person to another, so it is impossible to declare its normal range.\n\n【10】Sleep orgasm is seen only in humans. However, its causes are unknown. It was believed that it occurs due to the exertion of pressure from collected semen which could not be ejaculated. But, this idea was later discarded because it is not only men who experience nocturnal emissions but females also undergo orgasms during sleep. Sometimes, sleep orgasms happen as a compensatory phenomenon when the individuals abstain from other sexual activities. On the other hand, it may also be felt due to external stimuli, like sleeping in a prone position or clothes being stuck between an individual’s legs. It is the erotic dreams that generally accompany sleep orgasms.\n\n【11】Sleep orgasm is seen in most males, which begins and frequently occurs during adolescence and tends to discontinue later. On the contrary, fewer females feel orgasm during sleep but usually when they are full adults. Overall, sleep orgasm is experienced infrequently, rarely, occurring up to a dozen times for men and three to four times for females annually.\n\n【12】**Sociosexual Behaviors:**\n\n【13】Heterosexual activity is the most common of all sociosexual activities, which occurs between one male and one female. It often starts in late childhood as showing or examining genital organs or engaging in sex play. Sex play involves erotic caressing, which usually leads to sexual intercourse. With the advent of adolescence, dating supersedes sex play and generally involves physical touch leading to sexual arousal. This type of contact is called necking or petting.\n\n【14】Petting differs from hugging, kissing, a generalized touch of the clothed body, and genital stimulation techniques. Petting is usually done to express affection and pleasure and routinely precedes coitus. The last part of petting is called foreplay. In rare cases, petting causes orgasm and can even substitute coitus.\n\n【15】Frottage is also known as dry sex, as it involves the act of rubbing each other’s body parts like buttocks and breasts, particularly nipples (for females), thighs, genitalia, etc. It can be performed even with clothes on.\n\n【16】Some other types of non-intercourse sociosexual behaviors can be:\n\n【17】*   **Sharing a Sensual Massage:** This could be done with or without clothes with soft music, candles, lotion, or oils. Certain body areas are massaged with specific levels of pressure and frequency.\n\n【18】*   **Mutual Masturbation:** It involves masturbating each other’s genitalia by giving handjobs to males and fingering to females to cause sexual arousal or simply a feeling of pleasure with a gentle touch. Rarely feet can also be used for mutual masturbation.\n\n【19】*   **A Mutual Bath or a Shower:** It is a caressing act that creates awareness about one’s partner’s body while enjoying a daily chore.\n\n【20】*   **Phone or Facetime Sex:** With the advancement in technology, this is another kind of sexual behavior that is usually practiced between long-distance partners. But, it demands a lot of care with sharing or mishandling the recordings, if any.\n\n【21】*   **Kissing the Entire Body:** Kissing is not just confined to lips. Instead, the belly, arms, and legs can be included and normalized. French kissing is another form of intense kissing which causes genital organ stimulation.\n\n【22】**Conclusion:**\n\n【23】Non-intercourse sexual behaviors are another healthy, affectionate, and acceptable means of showering love and attraction toward one’s partner. They are simple and have the advantage of avoiding pregnancy. They can be routinely performed according to the needs and desires of the self and the partner.\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>*   The Relationship between Sexual Behavior and Non-sexual Risk Behaviors among Unmarried Youth in Three Asian Cities  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4235615/\n*   Non-Physical Sexual Behaviour  \n    https://nyaaya.org/legal-explainer/non-physical-sexual-behaviour/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

At times, the quality of the surgery may be jeopardized with or without the patients' knowledge. Such issues can occur due to human factors and other causes like environmental factors, resource availability, etc. Patient safety is ensured by following proper protocols and management. The fundamental duty of a physician is to treat the patient without mishap. As safe surgery should always be the primary concern, human factors, and patient safety come into play.\n\n【2】**What Are Human Factors in Surgery?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Generally, human factors are those that determine an individual's performance. In surgery, \"human factors\" include every person who helps with the treatment and how well they work as a group. Human factors can be grouped based on the type of work, the person, and the company.\n\n【4】1\\. Human factors based on the type of work include:\n\n【5】*   **Nature of the Task:** The task must match physical and mental strengths and the individual's limitations. An under-experienced surgeon can only manage a complex surgery at a time.\n\n【6】*   **Workload:** Proper scheduling of surgeries to balance the increasing workload of surgeries and considering emergency cases.\n\n【7】2\\. Human factors based on the individual include:\n\n【8】*   **Competency:** A learned trait to improve the quality of the surgical outcome.\n\n【9】*   **Skills**: Skills in assisting surgeons and co-surgeons, handling the latest instruments, and basic skills also come into consideration.\n\n【10】*   **Risk Perception**: The individual must be able to sense any upcoming risks so that the risks can be avoided.\n\n【11】3\\. Human factors based on the organization include:\n\n【12】*   **Communication:** Proper communication between all the surgeons, assisting nurses, and management of the organization, including the patient, is necessary.\n\n【13】*   **Resources:** Availability of resources can be beneficial in carrying out a procedure in less time.\n\n【14】*   **Teamwork:** As there are several different tasks to be performed in a single surgery, everyone involved in the treatment should be coordinated in their efforts.\n\n【15】**Why Are Human Factors Considered Important?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Most complications due to medical errors can be avoided. Approaching surgery while considering all the human factors is the key to safe health care delivery. The health factor is a minute but important aspect to be considered to reduce major mishaps.\n\n【17】**What Are Medical Errors?**\n----------------------------\n\n【18】These errors are preventable adverse effects of medical care that occur due to many reasons, like changes in the procedure to be carried out, unplanned action, infrastructure failure, environmental factors, human factors, and so on. A few examples of medical errors are -\n\n【19】*   Surgery at the wrong site.\n\n【20】*   Patient suicide.\n\n【21】*   Operative and post-operative complications.\n\n【22】*   Delay in treatment.\n\n【23】*   Medication error.\n\n【24】**How Are Medical Errors Prevented?**\n-------------------------------------\n\n【25】Medical errors can be prevented by following\n\n【26】*   Surgical checklist.\n\n【27】*   Proper training for healthcare professionals.\n\n【28】*   Recording the medical data.\n\n【29】*   Operating room briefing and debriefing.\n\n【30】**1\\. Surgical Checklist:** It effectively avoids medical errors and improves patient safety.\n\n【31】*   **Check 1:** The patient's identity, site marking, and correct patient labels are checked. After the approval of check one by a member of the ward staff and a member of the reception staff.\n\n【32】*   **Check 2:** The patient's identity, site documentation, the chief surgeon, and marked site, if not completed in the ward, are all verified. Then, after the consultant chief surgeon approves it, check number three begins.\n\n【33】*   **Check 3:** Confirmation of the correct patient, marking the correct surgical site, consent regarding the procedure to be performed, patient position, and availability of necessary resources and reports are checked. Check three is then signed by the consultant surgeon, head nurse, and senior anesthetist.\n\n【34】*   Such a checklist can be made and carried out for every surgery, which helps distribute the work and reduce the workload.\n\n【35】**2\\. Human Factors Approach Training for Healthcare Professionals:** Certain training programs are held for healthcare professionals to reduce human error. These programs aim at developing the non-technical, increasing adherence to safety standards, and improving decision-making within the team. Human factors approach training includes development in the following aspects:\n\n【36】*   Situation awareness.\n\n【37】*   Decision-making.\n\n【38】*   Teamwork.\n\n【39】*   Communication.\n\n【40】*   Leadership.\n\n【41】**3\\. Medical Data Recorded (MDR):**\n\n【42】*   All the procedures carried out are noted for future records.\n\n【43】*   The time of drug (medication) administration, the amount of IV (intravenous) fluids given, and the steps from the beginning of surgery to the end are recorded.\n\n【44】*   The visuals of the entire surgery are recorded, and the surgeons involved gather to brief the process as a record. In a few places, the hospital's management can also be involved.\n\n【45】**4\\. OR (operating room) briefing and debriefing:**\n\n【46】*   Most of the time, these talks are led by the surgeon and are meant to keep adverse events from occurring by making communication easier. Below are the discussion briefings:\n\n【47】    *   The role of each team member is allotted.\n\n【48】    *   Expectations for the operating procedure.\n\n【49】    *   Particular focus on problems that can arise.\n\n【50】Even though it's not the only way to eradicate medical mistakes, it can help reduce them and make patients safer.\n\n【51】**What Is Patient Safety in Surgery?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【52】*   The process of avoiding medical errors resulting from the healthcare process can be termed patient safety.\n\n【53】*   Patient safety is usually maintained by following a proper sterilization protocol and a professional quality approach to the surgery.\n\n【54】*   It includes creating a safe operating room with proper fumigation done.\n\n【55】*   A perioperative nurse is allotted to look after the patient before, during, and after the surgery.\n\n【56】**How Do Human Factors Affect Patient Safety in Surgery?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】Medical errors in surgery do not occur due to surgeons' insufficiency but mostly due to equipment, process, or system failures. Using the human factors approach to managing medical errors, patients will be safer, and their needs will be met.\n\n【58】Human factors, like being aware of the situation, making decisions, working as a team, communicating, and being a leader, will help the surgery go well.\n\n【59】**Conclusion:**\n\n【60】Every individual working on the team to perform a surgery carries a lot of responsibility and accountability. One's performance at any job is affected by the workload. The human factors approach can be used to improve the quality of the surgery and patient safety by the operating team, benefiting both the patient and the healthcare team. Every action and movement of the team during a particular task is considered for achieving a positive outcome of the treatment.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>*   Patient Safety in Surgery  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570547/\n*   Patient Safety in the Surgical Environment  \n    https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2010/09/patient-safety-in-the-surgical-environment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by brownish or reddish lesions, which are typically round or oval in shape. Diabetic dermopathy occurs in the shin, an area in front of the leg and below the knee. Hence, it is also known as shin spots or pigmented pretibial patches. Rarely it occurs on the thighs and arms. Diabetic dermopathy does not occur with any symptoms and is harmless.\n\n【2】People over 50 with prolonged diabetes are at higher risk for diabetic dermopathy. Males are more commonly affected than females. It is seen in almost 50 percent of diabetes patients. Cardiovascular disease is also considered a risk factor for diabetes dermopathy.\n\n【3】Other skin conditions associated with diabetes are:\n\n【4】*   **Vitiligo:** It is an autoimmune condition that causes patches of the skin to lose pigment.\n\n【5】*   **Scleredema Diabeticorum:** It is the thickening and hardening of the skin in neck, shoulders, arms, and upper back and is seen in some people with diabetes.\n\n【6】*   **Acanthosis Nigrans:** It is a skin condition that causes dark patches on the body due to diabetes or any hormonal changes.\n\n【7】What Are the Causes of Diabetic Dermopathy in Older People?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The underlying cause of diabetic dermopathy is not known. When the blood sugar level spikes in diabetes patients, the nerves of the skin and the blood vessels can get damaged. It commonly occurs in uncontrolled diabetes. This damage can lead to poor circulation, which over time results in delayed wound healing. When the person gets involved in leg injuries, shin spots can occur as a response to the trauma. It can also occur due to neuropathy or nerve damage when a person is exposed to a severe hot or cold environment.\n\n【9】Diabetic dermopathy is commonly found to be associated with the following diabetic complications:\n\n【10】*   **Diabetic Retinopathy:** When elevated blood sugar levels affect the retina of the eyes, diabetic retinopathy occurs. It is common in people with both type 1 and 2 diabetes for more than 20 years. Diabetic retinopathy, if not treated, can end up in vision loss and blindness.\n\n【11】*   **Diabetic Nephropathy:** It occurs when the high blood sugar level leads to progressive loss of kidney function. Diabetes can thicken and injure the nephrons in the kidney, which makes the filtration process less efficient. Diabetic nephropathy is also known as diabetic kidney disease. More than 40 percent of kidney failures occur due to diabetes.\n\n【12】*   **Diabetic Neuropathy:** When elevated blood sugar levels affect nerves, diabetic neuropathy occurs. It commonly affects the nerves of the legs and feet. In some people, the symptoms are mild. While in others, diabetic neuropathy can cause painful sensations.\n\n【13】What Are the Symptoms of Diabetic Dermopathy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Diabetic dermopathy presents with a lesion that has the following features:\n\n【15】*   Reddish or brownish macules or patches.\n\n【16】*   Round or oval in shape.\n\n【17】*   Size can range from several millimeters to two centimeters.\n\n【18】*   Scaly or slightly indented into the skin.\n\n【19】*   Asymmetrical pattern.\n\n【20】*   Appear either in one or both legs.\n\n【21】Besides shin, lesions can rarely appear on the arms, trunk, and thighs. Diabetic dermopathy lesions will not cause any pain, itching, or burning sensations or release fluids. Hence, they are asymptomatic. Diabetic dermopathy typically lasts for a few months to two years. In many cases, when the lesions begin to fade, new lesions start appearing.\n\n【22】How Is Diabetic Dermopathy Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【23】The doctor will perform a physical examination that involves analyzing the site, number, size, and color of lesions. They will also inquire about how long the lesion has been present, and whether it is painful or has any burning sensations. The doctor will also check for balancing, which involves pressing the lesion and seeing whether it becomes paler. This is followed by a blood test to check blood sugar levels. In many people, diabetic dermopathy occurs after they get diagnosed with diabetes for a long time. However, in rare cases, it can occur as an initial sign of diabetes. If the doctor diagnoses the lesion as diabetic dermopathy, a biopsy isn’t required. But if another skin condition is suspected, then it may be required.\n\n【24】Doctors will check for the following symptoms to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic dermopathy:\n\n【25】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【26】*   Increased thirst or hunger.\n\n【27】*   Weight loss.\n\n【28】*   Tiredness.\n\n【29】*   Tingling sensation in hands and feet.\n\n【30】*   Delayed healing of wounds.\n\n【31】What Is the Treatment of Diabetic Dermopathy in Older People?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】There is no specific treatment for diabetic dermopathy. However, keeping diabetes under control can prevent diseases and other complications associated with diabetes.\n\n【33】Even though no treatment is required for diabetic dermopathy. Its appearance can be managed in the following ways:\n\n【34】*   Applying makeup on the area of lesions.\n\n【35】*   Using moisturizer to improve the texture of lesions.\n\n【36】Diabetic dermopathy can be considered a sign of uncontrolled diabetes. It is also found that controlling diabetes does not accelerate the process of fading of lesions. Once it appears, it may take up to a few months or two years. But managing diabetes can prevent the reappearance of lesions.\n\n【37】How to Prevent Diabetic Dermopathy in Older People?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The prevention of diabetic dermopathy focuses on managing diabetes. Following are the measures to manage diabetes:\n\n【39】*   **Taking Prescribed Medications Regularly:** After getting diagnosed with diabetes, medications prescribed by doctors have to be taken regularly without fail.\n\n【40】*   **Regular Checking of Blood Sugar:** It can be done with a glucometer or by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Diabetic patients should check blood sugar before and after meals as well as before going to bed.\n\n【41】*   **Consulting Doctor Regularly:** Reach out to the doctor or healthcare professional for the treatment plan and ask for tips to manage diabetes.\n\n【42】*   **Regular Exercise:** Exercising daily has many benefits including improving insulin sensitivity, which helps to manage the levels of blood sugar. 30 minutes of workout for at least four days a week is beneficial.\n\n【43】*   **Healthy Diet:** Diabetes patients have to manage their diet by reducing the refined carbohydrates and sugars in their diet.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】Diabetic dermopathy occurs in patients with prolonged diabetes and commonly occurs in the shin of the leg hence the name shin spot. It's a benign condition that does not require any specific treatment. Although it's harmless, it shouldn't be ignored. The condition indicates the damage of nerves and blood vessels due to prolonged diabetes. It is often a warning sign of uncontrolled diabetes.

{"seq_id": "e50ac4af-7dd2-41ba-8eb8-035dcf1ec58e", "title": "Immunoglobulin G (IgG) - Functions and Deficiency", "text": "【0】Immunoglobulin G (IgG) - Functions and Deficiency\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】When a foreign substance or organism enters the body, the immune system identifies the attack and produces special proteins called immunoglobulins. These are made and released by plasma cells. Having fewer immunoglobulins in the body makes one susceptible to infections. Too many immunoglobulins in the body could indicate allergies or an overactive immune system.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Immunoglobulins?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】The body produces different types of immunoglobulins:\n\n【4】*   Immunoglobulin A (IgA).\n\n【5】*   Immunoglobulin G (IgG).\n\n【6】*   Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n\n【7】*   Immunoglobulin D (IgD).\n\n【8】*   Immunoglobulin E (IgE).\n\n【9】What Are IgG Antibodies?\n------------------------\n\n【10】Immunoglobulin G is the most common type of antibody, representing almost 75 % of the total serum antibodies. It is the main antibody in the blood and extracellular fluid and protects the body from infections by binding to bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Immunoglobulin G is the only immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta in mothers and is responsible for protecting the newborn during the first months of life. These are often used in immunological research and clinical diagnostics because of their relative abundance. IgG has four subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, named in order of their abundance in the serum.\n\n【11】What Are the Functions of IgG?\n------------------------------\n\n【12】Immunoglobulin G antibodies are the smallest but the most abundant in the body. They help in providing secondary immune responses in the body. Functions of IgG include:\n\n【13】*   IgG binds to the pathogen and causes their immobilization.\n\n【14】*   IgG coating on the pathogen surface helps the phagocytic cells recognize and ingest them.\n\n【15】*   IgG activates a pathway for a cascade of immune protein production that helps in pathogen elimination.\n\n【16】*   IgG helps neutralize toxins.\n\n【17】*   IgG is the only antibody that passes through the human placenta and helps protect the fetus in utero.\n\n【18】*   IgG is secreted in the breast milk, and the IgG that passes through the placenta helps provide the infant with humoral immunity before the immune system develops.\n\n【19】What Are IgG Deficiencies?\n--------------------------\n\n【20】IgG deficiency refers to a condition in which the body does not produce enough IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies. IgG protects the body against infections by binding to microorganisms, immobilizing and eliminating them. Hence, IgG deficiency makes the body more susceptible to infections, as the immune response against microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi gets impaired. The most common deficiency of IgG subclasses in early childhood is IgG2 deficiency, whereas, in adults, IgG1 and IgG3 deficiencies are more common. In addition, the development of IgG2 and IgG4 is slower in children compared to IgG1 and IgG3 levels. However, in some children, the complete development of the whole range of IgG subclasses can be delayed until the teenage years.\n\n【21】What Causes IgG Deficiencies?\n-----------------------------\n\n【22】The cause of primary immunoglobulin G deficiency is not apparent, but genetics may play a role.\n\n【23】IgG deficiency can be caused by:\n\n【24】*   Malnutrition.\n\n【25】*   Chemotherapy.\n\n【26】*   Long-term corticosteroids.\n\n【27】*   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\n\n【28】*   Aging.\n\n【29】What Are the Symptoms of IgG Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【30】IgG deficiency affects both children and adults. Infections that can affect people with the condition include:\n\n【31】*   Gastrointestinal infections.\n\n【32】*   Ear infections.\n\n【33】*   Pneumonia.\n\n【34】*   Sinus infections.\n\n【35】*   Respiratory problems.\n\n【36】*   Sore throat.\n\n【37】*   Bronchitis.\n\n【38】*   Severe and life-threatening infections.\n\n【39】How Is IgG Deficiency Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【40】The level of immunoglobulins in the body is diagnosed through a blood test. An immunoglobulin test helps measure the levels of different types of immunoglobulins in the body. An individual may have an optimum total IgG level; hence it is crucial to test the concentration of the subclasses of IgG as well. Children lower than 24 months of age cannot make IgG2 antibodies; therefore, measuring levels of IgG2 before this age is not recommended.\n\n【41】What Is an Immunoglobulin Test?\n-------------------------------\n\n【42】It is a test that measures the level of different types of antibodies or immunoglobulin in the blood. The body produces antibodies to protect against bacteria, viruses, and allergens. The immunoglobulin produced for each type of infection is different; for example, the antibodies against measles are not the same as the antibodies for mononucleosis. Hence diagnosing the antibody produced helps identify an infection in the body. Sometimes the body may produce antibodies against its cells and organs, which is an autoimmune disorder.\n\n【43】How Is IgG Deficiency Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【44】The treatment for IgG deficiency depends upon the time of onset of symptoms and their severity. Symptoms that appear later in life are harder to manage, and the person will also be susceptible to further infections. The primary objective of treatment includes the appropriate use of antibiotics to treat and prevent infections. The type of antibiotic used and the duration of treatment would depend on the type and severity of the infection. Intravenous administration of 300 - 600 mg/kg of IgG once every three to four weeks, or 100 - 200 mg/kg/wk subcutaneously, is the currently recommended therapy. In patients with chronic sinopulmonary infections, higher doses are more effective. Although IgG replacement therapy has shown to be effective in appropriate patients, intravenous IgG may have infusion-related adverse effects. For example, three to 12 % of the treated patients developed myalgia, headache, fever, chills, and mild nausea. However, subcutaneous IgG replacement therapy was associated with local infusion site reactions and free from systemic reactions. Patients with persistent IgG deficiencies and frequent infections with optimum anti-polysaccharide antibodies must also be treated using adequate prevention, vaccine, and antibiotic therapy.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】IgG is the smallest and the most abundant antibody in the serum and constitutes 75 % of the total serum. It helps in protecting the body from infections by binding to the microorganism, immobilizing, and eliminating the pathogen. It also helps neutralize toxins. Immunoglobulin G is the only antibody that can pass through the placenta; hence they play an essential role in the humoral immunity of the fetus in utero and during the first few months after birth. The deficiency of IgG antibodies makes a person more susceptible to infections, and an abundance than required of IgG develops allergies and an overactive immune response. IgG deficiency can be treated with IgG replacement therapy. If one is diagnosed with IgG deficiency, consult the healthcare provider whenever there is a sign of infection, including a minor cold.\n\n【47】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【48】* * *\n\n【49】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Functions of Immunoglobulin G?**\n\n【50】Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most common type and constitutes about 75 % of human antibodies. It helps prevent infections, so their decrease can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. They multiply among themselves and destroy any foreign substances entering the human body.\n\n【51】#### **2.**删除换行**What Does a High IgG Level Indicate?**\n\n【52】High levels of immunoglobulin G indicate an existence of a chronic infection, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, or plasma cell disorders. For example, the levels are higher in conditions such as multiple myeloma, multiple sclerosis, and long-term hepatitis.\n\n【53】#### **3.**删除换行**What Does an IgG Test Determine?**\n\n【54】The immunoglobulin G test determines the level of IgG antibodies present in the blood. This indicates if a person is immune to a condition or if their immune system is not working. In addition, immunoglobulin tests are used to determine allergies or autoimmune disorders.\n\n【55】#### **4.**删除换行**What Does a Low IgG Level Indicate?**\n\n【56】Immunoglobulins or antibodies are proteins produced by the plasma cells against a pathogenic attack. Therefore, IgG deficiency is considered a significant health concern where the body cannot produce enough IgG, possibly due to aging, malnutrition, chemotherapy, and infections. Hence, individuals with low IgG levels are prone to infections.\n\n【57】#### **5.**删除换行**Is Stress a Factor Causing High IgG?**\n\n【58】Studies reveal that individuals with high-stress perception show increased IgG, IgA, and IgM levels, but not under low-stress conditions. In addition, acute stress increases humoral and cellular-mediated immunity, thereby causing the resolution of infections.\n\n【59】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is an Ideal IgG Level?**\n\n【60】The immunoglobulin G levels vary in different age groups. They are between 688 and 1251 mg per 100 ml in males and from 720 to 1038 mg per ml in females. If IgG levels are less than 400 mg/ml, they are low, and if they are greater than 16 g/L, they indicate high levels of IgG.\n\n【61】#### **7.**删除换行**Can IgG Cause Inflammation?**\n\n【62】Immunoglobulin G has two opposite functions. One is to induce proinflammatory responses and establish immune cells when any infectious pathogen enters the body. The other one is to produce an anti-inflammatory treatment response when administered intravenously. However, the proinflammatory response is the advanced function of the two.\n\n【63】#### **8.**删除换行**How Common Is IgG Deficiency?**\n\n【64】IgG deficiency contributes to 10% to 15% of the world population and has a non-specific clinical significance. However, studies have shown that many patients with low levels of IgG are often asymptomatic, and only a few patients with selective IgG deficiency can be identified with severe infections.\n\n【65】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Age a Risk Factor for IgG Deficiency?**\n\n【66】A significant drop in immunoglobulin G levels can be noted in older individuals, whereas IgA levels show no major decline with aging.

It is not a life-threatening phenomenon, but it can affect body image in severe cases and cause some degree of urinary obstruction in milder cases. This article is created to help people understand everything they need to know if they have a webbed penis.\n\n【2】What Is a Webbed Penis?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】A webbed penis is a penis that is wholly or partially covered by a web of skin. This can occur due to a birth defect or an injury. A webbed penis is a rare condition characterized by a web of skin between the shaft and glans of the penis. This webbing can vary in severity; in some cases, it completely covers the glans. Treatment for a webbed penis is typically surgical, and it involves the release of the webbing to allow the penis to function normally.\n\n【4】A webbed penis can be a congenital condition, meaning it is present at birth or can develop later in life, affecting the development of genitalia. This can cause the penis to have a web-like appearance. The condition is relatively uncommon, and it is not known how many men are affected by it. No known health risks are associated with the state, and it does not affect a man's ability to have an erection.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of a Webbed Penis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】There are several possible causes of the webbed penis. The etiology of the webbed penis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a congenital condition that is present from birth or develops later in life. Sometimes, it may be due to an underlying medical condition, such as lymphedema (accumulation of lymph fluid). In some cases, the webbing may be extensive enough to cover the glans of the penis completely. It is a rare condition, and studies show that it has a prevalence of about four percent in 5881 newborns.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Please explain whether neurological disorder affects ejaculation.</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>I am taking medications for ED with no benefit.

In mild cases, the webbed tissue may not be noticeable and may not cause any problems. In more severe cases, the webbed tissue can make the penis appear shorter than usual and make it difficult to urinate. In extreme cases, the webbed tissue can cover the penis, making it seem small or absent.\n\n【14】What Are the Complications of a Webbed Penis?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The webbed penis can cause several complications, including,\n\n【16】*   Difficulty urinating and urinary tract infections.\n\n【17】*   Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction, penetration problems, and painful intercourse.\n\n【18】*   Skin infections in the penis, such as balanitis.\n\n【19】What Is the Diagnosis of a Webbed Penis?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【20】A webbed penis can be diagnosed by physical examination and may be associated with other abnormalities of the genitalia. Treatment is typically surgical and can often improve the appearance of the penis. Webbed penis cannot be prevented as it is a congenital condition.\n\n【21】What Is the Treatment of a Webbed Penis?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【22】A webbed penis is commonly treated by the transverse incision of the web and by closing the wound vertically. Some other methods include Byars preputial flaps, Z- Plasty, VY Plasty, and other flap methods. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the severity of the webbing and the surgeon's preference. In general, surgery aims to release the webbed tissue and create a more normal appearance. The complete healing takes place about six weeks after surgery, and it is better to avoid sexual intercourse till the complete healing of the wound.\n\n【23】**1\\. Byars Preputial Skin:** The Byars preputial skin flaps are a type of flap surgery used to treat various conditions of the penis. The surgery involves taking skin from the prepuce and using it to cover the glans (head) of the penis. This can be done to treat conditions such as hypospadias, webbed penis, and penile curvature. An incision is made for about 5 mm to 10 mm circumferentially below the coronal edge and urethral meatus. Then, the penile skin is retracted to the penile base. The prepuce is excised, and a longitudinal incision is made on the dorsal side of the prepuce. Then the skin flap is transferred to the ventral side to move the scrotal skin downwards.\n\n【24】**2\\. Diamond-Shaped Skin Flap:** At the penoscrotal junction, a diamond-shaped cut is made. Four triangular areas are made in the diamond-shaped skin. In that four triangular areas, two areas of skin were excised, and the other two were pulled to the opposite side and sutured in a Z shape with chromic catgut sutures.\n\n【25】**3\\. VY Plasty:** A VY Plasty is a surgical procedure where a V-shaped incision is placed at the penoscrotal incision to correct the webbed penis. The penile skin is pulled upwards. To preserve, an undercut is made on the penile skin to keep the underlying structures. The VY-shaped wound is closed with a 4-0 chromic gut. This can improve the appearance of the penis and also enhance sexual function.\n\n【26】**4\\. Transverse Incision With Vertical Closure:** A transverse incision with a vertical procedure involves making a transverse incision at the base of the penis and then closing the incision vertically. This procedure is effective in treating a webbed penis and can help improve the appearance of the penis.\n\n【27】**5\\. Parapenile Incision:** The parapenile surgical procedure is a procedure that is used to correct a webbed penis. The surgery involves making an incision in the penile tissue parallel to the penile shaft in the parapenile area. This surgery is usually performed on young boys to separate the penis from the scrotum.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Many men are curious about webbed penis and seek information on how this condition affects their sexual health. Webbed penis is very rare, and there is no specific treatment, as the condition is not considered a medical problem. In some cases, surgery may be considered to release the webbing, but this is usually only done for cosmetic reasons.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   National library of medicine - Webbed penis: A new classification  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952775/#:~:text=The%20webbed%20penis%20is%20a,appearance%20of%20the%20normal%20penis\n*   Cleveland clinic - Webbed penis (Penoscrotal webbing)  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24133-webbed-penis#:~:text=Webbed%20penis%20is%20when%20skin,and%20congenital%20penile%20scrotal%20fusion.\n*   Congenital webbed penis: Surgical outcomes of a simplified technique  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477513121003818</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "7403bba4-0982-4b7b-b480-632d559558e4", "title": "Pediatric Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)", "text": "【0】Pediatric Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)\nWhat Is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is when excess fat accumulates in the liver. It is the most common cause of liver disease in children in the United States. Though a mild condition with less visible symptoms, it can progress to a more severe form of liver disease that causes scarring of the liver tissue (cirrhosis) or liver cancer in adulthood if left untreated. The more severe form of the disease is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\n【2】How Common Is NAFLD in Children?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】NAFLD is the most common form of liver disease affecting about ten percent of children in the United States.It is the second most common cause of liver transplantation in the pediatric population. It has affected about 30 million children, of whom around 8.6 million have a more severe form of the disease, NASH.\n\n【4】Who Is at an Increased Risk of Developing NAFLD?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Risk factors for developing NAFLD include the following:\n\n【6】*   Boys have twice the risk of developing NAFLD when compared to girls.\n\n【7】*   Children of Hispanic origin followed by Caucasian descent.\n\n【8】*   Children who are obese.\n\n【9】What Are the Causes of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The exact cause of NAFLD is not known. Genetic factors also influence NAFLD, one gene, in particular, is the PNPLA3. However, researchers have reported that the following conditions can be the probable cause of NAFLD:\n\n【11】*   Obesity.\n\n【12】*   Prediabetes (a condition that develops before type 2 diabetes when the blood sugars are high without any other noticeable symptoms).\n\n【13】*   Type 2 diabetes.\n\n【14】*   Insulin resistance.\n\n【15】*   Hyperlipidemia (a condition in which all types of fats are high in the body).\n\n【16】*   Rapid weight loss.\n\n【17】*   Hepatitis C (a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver).\n\n【18】Initially, steatosis progresses to steatohepatitis to fibrosis and finally to cirrhosis.\n\n【19】What Are the Risk Factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The following are the risk factors for developing NAFLD:\n\n【21】1.  High cholesterol.\n\n【22】2.  High triglyceride levels.\n\n【23】3.  Sleep apnea (a condition in which there is an interruption to breathing during sleep).\n\n【24】4.  Metabolic disorders are a group of disorders that lead to increased heart problems and related issues.\n\n【25】What Are the Symptoms of Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】In most cases, NAFLD does not present any visible symptoms. On examination, the doctors may notice an enlargement of the liver or obesity, more predominantly in the waist area. Acanthosis nigricans, a condition in which there is discoloration of the neck and armpits, indicating insulin resistance, is also a symptom of NAFLD.\n\n【27】Routine check-ups of the child may show abnormal blood test readings. In some cases, the child may show symptoms like pain in the abdomen, tiredness, constipation, weakness, and weight loss.\n\n【28】What Are the Complications of Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】NAFLD being a chronic condition, requires regular medical care for the child’s entire life. The liver tissue begins to scar when NAFLD progresses to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). The soft and healthy liver tissue gets scarred, causing cirrhosis which prevents the liver from functioning properly. If left untreated, cirrhosis can lead to complications like portal hypertension (a serious complication in which there is pressure build-up in the blood vessels supplying the liver), liver failure, or cancer of the liver. These complications may require liver transplantation. Though serious, the complications can be prevented if the fat build-up in the liver cells can be slowed down or stopped. Extrahepatic manifestationslike cardiovascular disease, low bone mineral density, and type II diabetes can also be presented.\n\n【30】How Is Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The doctor diagnoses NAFLD based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, signs and symptoms, and blood tests. The following tests may be ordered by the health care worker to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n【32】*   **Blood Tests:** Kids with obesity and whose blood tests show higher than normal values of certain liver enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) have more chances of having NAFLD.\n\n【33】*   **Ultrasound Scan:** An ultrasound scan of the liver helps assess the structure of the liver. An ultrasound scan is a painless, non-invasive technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of body parts.\n\n【34】*   **Transient Elastography (Fibro Scan):** Transient elastography is a non-invasive technique used to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This technique also determines the amount of liver fat. It is done in patients with long-standing (chronic) liver disease.\n\n【35】*   **Liver Biopsy:** Liver biopsy, in which a needle is inserted through the skin to collect a small amount of liver tissue that is sent to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope. A biopsy helps detect the build-up of fat in the liver cells and scarring of the liver tissue. Liver biopsy is used to differentiate between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in children.\n\n【36】Children diagnosed with NAFLD require periodic monitoring to check the levels of the following:\n\n【37】*   Blood tests to check for the levels of liver enzymes.\n\n【38】*   Ultrasound scan of the abdomen.\n\n【39】*   Transient elastography.\n\n【40】*   Regular physical examination.\n\n【41】A check for prediabetes and high cholesterol levels is done. The doctors may also order tests to rule out other liver disorders like:\n\n【42】*   Autoimmune hepatitis (the body's immune system destroys liver cells, causing liver inflammation).\n\n【43】*   Viral hepatitis (inflammation of the liver caused due to viral infections).\n\n【44】*   Wilson’s disease (a genetic condition that causes copper accumulation in cells of the liver, brain, and other organs).\n\n【45】How Is Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Treated?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】*   There is no medicine or cure for NAFLD in particular. However, eating healthy, getting regular exercise, and managing weight are the key points that help prevent the progression of NAFLD into a more severe condition.\n\n【47】*   A team of doctors that includes GI (gastrointestinal) specialists for children, a dietician, and psychologists together can help in the better management of the condition.\n\n【48】*   Healthy eating is encouraged in children to help them lose weight. Foods rich in fiber and whole grains are emphasized, along with teaching the child to resist cravings for sugar-loaded foods. A weight loss of ten percent has been shown to improve the liver condition. Regular physical activity at least three to five times a week for 30 minutes each time is necessary.\n\n【49】*   Studies suggest the benefits of taking vitamin E and antioxidants. However, they are not a replacement for healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common form of liver disease in children in the United States. The most common reason is obesity. Early identification and necessary lifestyle changes, as suggested by the doctor, help prevent the condition from proceeding into a more severe form that may cause complications or a need for a liver transplant. Mindful eating, regular exercise, and an active lifestyle, along with keeping a check on weight gain, can give a positive outlook on the condition.\n\n【52】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【53】* * *\n\n【54】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Pediatric Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease?**\n\n【55】Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver, which does not occur due to alcohol consumption. The liver is not inflamed or damaged in pediatric NAFLD. It is not a life-threatening condition and does not progress to cause complications. The characteristic signs and symptoms include weakness, pain in the upper abdomen, shortness of breath, and jaundice.\n\n【56】#### **2.**删除换行**Does Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Occur in Children?**\n\n【57】Non-alcoholic liver disease may occur in children due to several medical conditions. However, it more commonly affects boys of 10 years of age or less. The main factors responsible for causing non-alcoholic liver disease in kids are:  \n\\- Lack of physical activity.  \n\\- Poor eating habits.  \n\\- Therefore excess fat accumulates in the liver, causing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children.\n\n【58】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Life-Threatening?**\n\n【59】Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not a severe condition. Moreover, it does not cause significant symptoms, but early treatment is essential in preventing severe liver damage. Lifestyle changes and proper diet may prevent one from its complications. However, certain risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, etc. increase the risk of cirrhosis and liver failure. These conditions are life-threatening and require liver transplantation for survival.\n\n【60】#### **4.**删除换行**What Causes Fatty Liver in Children?**\n\n【61】Fatty liver may occur in children due to the following factors:  \n\\- Genetic factors.  \n\\- High blood pressure.  \n\\- Type 2 diabetes.  \n\\- High cholesterol level.  \n\\- Malnutrition.  \n\\- Celiac disease.  \n\\- Certain medications.\n\n【62】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Features of Liver Problems in Children?**\n\n【63】The signs and symptoms of liver disease in children are as follows:  \nYellowish discoloration of the skin and other mucous membranes.  \n\\- Itching.  \n\\- Fatigue.  \n\\- Poor weight gain.  \n\\- Abdominal pain.  \n\\- Vomiting.  \n\\- Abnormal bleeding.  \n\\- Liver enlargement.  \n\\- Yellow urine.  \n\\- Accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\n【64】#### **6.**删除换行**Does Cirrhosis Occur in Children?**\n\n【65】Liver cirrhosis in children is possible due to various conditions like:  \n\\- Hepatitis.  \n\\- Genetic disorders.  \n\\- Fatty liver disease.  \n\\- Bile duct diseases.  \n\\- Certain medications like Isoniazid, excess vitamin A supplements, etc.\n\n【66】#### **7.**删除换行**Is It Possible to Reverse Fatty Liver in Children?**\n\n【67】Yes, it is possible to reverse fatty liver in children during the initial stage of the disease by:  \n\\- Take measures to reduce weight in children if they are obese. In turn, it helps decrease the inflammation and fibrosis of the liver.  \n\\- Avoid sweetened beverages.  \n\\- Increase physical activity in children.  \n\\- Avoid junk foods.\n\n【68】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Fatty Liver Normal in Kids?**\n\n【69】Several studies show that about one in ten children is affected by fatty liver. It remains to be the main reason for causing chronic liver disease. Fat accumulates in the liver, but damage and inflammation may not occur. If left untreated, the disease may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure in children. The lack of exercise and obesity in the long term leads to fatty liver in children. However, the disease is reversible with improved physical activity and a proper diet.\n\n【70】#### **9.**删除换行**At What Age Does Fatty Liver Occur?**\n\n【71】In the pediatric population, the non-alcoholic fatty liver more commonly occurs at 10 to 13 years of age. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. The risk factors for fatty liver include obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol. Fatty liver may also occur in children 2 to 18 years of age, mainly due to type 2 diabetes.

Even with a balanced diet and regular exercise, many women become demoralized when their breasts and bodies do not regain their pre-pregnancy shape.\n\n【2】What Is Mommy Makeover?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】The phrase 'mommy makeover' is commonly used to refer to a customized package of cosmetic operations designed to assist a woman in addressing common effects of motherhood and aging, seen mainly on the face, breasts, and body, and restore or enhance her post-pregnancy appearance. Cosmetic surgery, nonsurgical procedures, or a combination of both may be used in mommy makeovers.\n\n【4】What Are the Benefits of Mommy Makeover?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】A mommy makeover may make women feel more like themselves by resolving pregnancy-related changes and regaining their desired look, enhancing pleasure and self-confidence. Each patient has their unique objectives, which frequently involve one or more of the following:\n\n【6】*   Boost breast volume and treat sagging.\n\n【7】*   Better breast symmetry.\n\n【8】*   Fix a stretched or oversized nipple or areola.\n\n【9】*   Get rid of the extra, sagging skin on the abdomen.\n\n【10】*   Reconstruct strained or torn abdominal muscles (diastasis recti).\n\n【11】*   Reduce areas of fat that are resistant to diet and exercise.\n\n【12】*   Improve the fit of garments and swimwear.\n\n【13】**How to Choose a Plastic Surgeon?**\n\n【14】*   Before opting for a mommy makeover, choosing an experienced cosmetic surgeon is crucial.\n\n【15】*   Because mommy makeovers can need several operations, women should ensure that the cosmetic surgeon they select has both experiences doing the procedures individually and combining them.\n\n【16】*   Ask prospective cosmetic surgeons how many mommy makeovers they have completed when they meet them for a consultation.\n\n【17】*   Make sure to look at many before and after pictures, paying close attention to individuals with similar body types, problems, and surgeries.\n\n【18】When Should One Consider Having a Mommy Makeover?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Although the timing of the mommy makeover and the operations are primarily personal decisions between individual and their cosmetic surgeon, there are some things to take into account.\n\n【20】*   Before having surgery, one must be well recovered from childbirth.\n\n【21】*   Wait a few months after they have completed nursing if they are considering getting breast surgery so the breasts can stabilize in size and shape.\n\n【22】*   Some nonsurgical procedures, including injectables, may not be advised when the individual is still nursing the infant.\n\n【23】*   Surgery for 'lifting' (such as a tummy tuck, breast lift, or lower body lift) is typically best left until after finishing having children.\n\n【24】What Are Different Procedures Involved in Mommy Makeovers?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Mommy makeovers frequently involve breast augmentation and body contouring surgery because pregnancy and childbirth substantially impact the breasts and physique. However, any procedures that will assist in addressing specific issues may be included in mommy makeovers. The standard treatments that women select to have as part of a mother makeover are listed below.\n\n【26】**Surgical Techniques:** Patients who participate in mommy makeovers typically undergo one or more surgeries. Most of the time, numerous treatments can be carried out concurrently, allowing a patient to experience many improvements with a single procedure and recuperation period.\n\n【27】*   Breast augmentation with implants.\n\n【28】*   Breast lift.\n\n【29】*   Tummy tuck.\n\n【30】*   Liposuction.\n\n【31】*   Vaginoplasty.\n\n【32】**Nonsurgical Techniques:** Women are increasingly integrating nonsurgical procedures in their plans for mommy makeovers. Such procedures may be a viable choice for those who want to start a family again and those who are unable or unwilling to take time off work to recover from surgery. Nonsurgical procedures typically yield less dramatic outcomes than surgery, but suitable patients might still experience meaningful advancements.\n\n【33】*   Non-surgical fat reduction.\n\n【34】*   Procedures to tighten the skin.\n\n【35】*   Reducing cellulite.\n\n【36】*   Non-invasive female rejuvenation.\n\n【37】*   Botox and injectable fillers.\n\n【38】*   Treatments for skin resurfacing.\n\n【39】**How Is the Mommy Makeover Done?**\n\n【40】*   The mommy makeover involves many simultaneous treatments. Typically, the procedure takes three to five hours. Because each woman has different requests, the times vary.\n\n【41】*   A mommy makeover is generally performed as an outpatient procedure and one can return home after the surgery.\n\n【42】*   General anesthesia is the preferred choice of anesthesia.\n\n【43】*   Sometimes the surgeon might suggest an overnight recovery room if patients need more help in the first 24 hours.\n\n【44】What Are the Things to Follow After Mommy Makeover?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】*   After surgery, the recovery might last up to two weeks, during which time the patient will be painful, bruised, and swollen. The length of the recovery will depend on the individual treatments included in the mommy makeover.\n\n【46】*   Individuals will require assistance around the house because they will be worn out and sensitive for several days following the mommy makeover, making it difficult for them to complete simple tasks. Getting assistance from family members or friends can help.\n\n【47】*   Driving and household chores are prohibited for at least two weeks.\n\n【48】*   The surgeon will prescribe the appropriate analgesics for a smooth recovery; nevertheless, operating a motor vehicle using these drugs is not advisable.\n\n【49】*   While specific benefits of a mommy makeover can be seen right away, the whole impact of the procedure cannot be evaluated until all swelling has gone down, which can take anywhere from six months to a year.\n\n【50】*   No heavy lifting, even with infants. After mommy makeovers, individuals should refrain from strenuous activity and heavy lifting for at least six weeks, including carrying babies and kids who weigh more than ten pounds.\n\n【51】*   Smokers are not eligible for a mother makeover.

Proctitis is the inflammation of the rectum, and colitis is the inflammation of the colon. Proctocolitis is a painful condition and presents with symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and swelling of the rectum. It can be considered a part of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this condition, the inflammation of the colon can extend as far as 12 to 15 centimeters above the anus. Proctocolitis in infants occurs as a response to an allergic reaction to the formula or breast milk, and they present with symptoms such as rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. In adults, it commonly occurs due to irradiation, sexual transmission, vasculitis, ischemic colitis, and medications.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Proctocolitis in Older People?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Infections**: Organisms that can cause proctocolitis are Neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, shigella dysenteriae, herpes simplex virus, and campylobacter species.\n\n【4】*   **Sexual Intercourse**: Proctocolitis is common in people having anal sex with people infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\n\n【5】*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: IBD is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. It includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, anemia, etc. are the symptoms of IBD.\n\n【6】*   **Ischemic Colitis**: It occurs when blood flow to the colon is significantly reduced for a short time. The symptoms of ischemic colitis are, blood in feces, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and much more.\n\n【7】*   **Microscopic Colitis**: It is the chronic inflammation of the colon that occurs due to abnormal reactions in the immune system. A patient with microscopic colitis presents with abdominal distension, pain, bloating, fatigue, an urgency to empty the bladder, etc.\n\n【8】*   **Drug-Induced Colitis**: Drugs, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can induce colitis, which resembles inflammatory bowel disease. NSAIDs may cause inflammation and bleeding in the small intestine.\n\n【9】*   **Iatrogenic**: In some cases, proctocolitis occurs due to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Drug-induced colitis also comes under iatrogenic colitis.\n\n【10】*   **Idiopathic**: When proctocolitis arises from an unknown cause, it is known as idiopathic. Two types of idiopathic colitis are lymphocytic and collagenous colitis.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Proctocolitis?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Following are the signs and symptoms a person with proctocolitis presents with:\n\n【13】*   Frequent diarrhea.\n\n【14】*   Stools may contain blood, mucus, or pus.\n\n【15】*   Extreme tiredness.\n\n【16】*   Weight loss.\n\n【17】*   Frequent urge to empty bowel.\n\n【18】*   Perianal ulcers.\n\n【19】*   Mouth ulcers.\n\n【20】*   Arthritis or inflamed joints.\n\n【21】*   Irritation in eyes.\n\n【22】*   Rapid heartbeat.\n\n【23】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【24】*   Pale skin.\n\n【25】*   Brittle nails.\n\n【26】*   Involuntary spasms.\n\n【27】How Is Proctocolitis Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【28】The initial examination of proctocolitis is done with a medical device called a proctoscope. It is a thin tube-like device with a lens and light which is used to view the anus and rectum, and also to remove small tissue from these areas for biopsy. In a biopsy, the physician will scrape small tissue from the rectum to examine it under the microscope. Stool examination is also advised to detect the presence of any disease-causing microbes.\n\n【29】Anoscopy is another method where a small hollow device slightly wider than the finger is used to view the lining of the anus and rectum. It is commonly used to diagnose hemorrhoids, fissures, and rectal cancers. Biopsies and exudates can also be taken with the help of an anoscope.\n\n【30】Microscopic examination of the exudate is evaluated to detect polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The presence of herpes simplex virus, chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and treponema pallidum has to be evaluated in all cases of proctocolitis.\n\n【31】What Is the Treatment for Proctocolitis in Older People?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】If any bacteria or viruses are detected after the microscopic examination of the exudate or smear, treatment depends on the causative microbes. The most commonly recommended antibiotics are ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Other prescribed antibiotics are azithromycin and fluoroquinolones. If the patient is diagnosed with genital herpes, then the recommended antiviral drugs are acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.\n\n【33】In severe cases of herpes infection, an intravenous (IV) injection of acyclovir is administered. In acyclovir-resistant genital herpes, foscarnet is administered intravenously. Patients who acquire the disease through sexual contact are advised to abstain from any kind of sexual intercourse until they and their partners are completely treated. Topical corticosteroids are prescribed for pain and swelling.\n\n【34】Immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids, which include prednisolone or budesonide are given to patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which are considered an autoimmune condition. Suppositories or enemas are given to treat anal and rectal ulcers. Medicated mouthwashes and local anesthetic topical gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers that occur as a result of proctocolitis. Endoscopic procedures are performed to stop bleeding. When the medications fail to treat the condition, then surgery is indicated.\n\n【35】If left untreated, proctocolitis may result in formation of abscess, ulcers, fistula, anemia, etc.\n\n【36】What Is Corrosive Proctocolitis?\n--------------------------------\n\n【37】It is a type of proctocolitis that occurs due to the accidental contamination of endoscopes, especially with cleansing agents used in cleaning endoscopes, such as hydrochloric acid and ethoxylated alcohol. In some cases, people themselves administer hydrogen peroxide, herbal medicines, alcohol, and detergents rectally to treat constipation. But these chemicals may result in adverse reactions in the anal region like bleeding, severe pain, and burning sensation. Corrosive proctocolitis is treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluid replacement therapy.\n\n【38】How to Prevent Proctocolitis in Older People?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   Diet plays a major role in any diseases associated with the gastrointestinal tract. People who eat food rich in saturated fat and refined carbohydrates are at higher risk for proctocolitis.\n\n【40】*   Drink plenty of water. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks.\n\n【41】*   Eat smaller meals throughout the day.\n\n【42】*   Sexual transmission is another main cause of proctocolitis. Screening the partner's health and using condoms before sexual contact can prevent sexually transmitted proctocolitis to a certain extent.\n\n【43】*   Lactose intolerance patients can avoid milk and other dairy products.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Proctocolitis is a painful condition, if left untreated, can lead to several complications in older adults. Blood in feces, weight loss, ulcers in the anus and mouth, arthritis are some of the symptoms of proctocolitis. These symptoms can cause extreme discomfort and may affect a person’s daily activities. The treatment of proctocolitis depends on the cause. If it is due to bacterial or viral infections, then patients will be put under antibiotic or antiviral therapy. Suppositories or enemas will be given to reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are also administered in cases of autoimmune conditions that cause proctocolitis. Surgery is the only option when medications do not work. However, proctocolitis can be prevented by taking extreme precautions before sexual intercourse as it is one of the main causes. Avoiding unhealthy foods, drinks, and lifestyles can also prevent proctocolitis to a certain extent.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Successful Conservative Treatment of an Elderly Patient with Corrosive Proctocolitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6925915/\n*   Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/proctitis.htm#:~:text=Proctocolitis%20is%20associated%20with%20symptoms,examination%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20pathogen</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Please suggest.</u>\n\n【19】Who Should Take the Morning-After Pill?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【20】The morning-after pill can be taken in the following situations:\n\n【21】*   Unprotected sex without the use of birth control.\n\n【22】*   If the condom breaks during sex.\n\n【23】*   If the diaphragm slips out of place.\n\n【24】*   If you miss two or three active birth control pill consecutively.\n\n【25】*   If you forgot to insert a ring or apply the patch.\n\n【26】*   If your partner did not pull out in time.\n\n【27】*   Sexual assault.\n\n【28】When to Take the Morning-After Pill?\n------------------------------------\n\n【29】Emergency contraceptive pills can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex. But the sooner you take it, the more effective it will be. Ideally, it should be taken within 72 hours (3 days).\n\n【30】How Effective Is the Morning-After Pill?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【31】Pills containing Ulipristal acetate is more effective than Levonorgestrel pills. When used within 72 hours, Ulipristal is twice as likely as Levonorgestrel to prevent pregnancy. Depending on the time of administration, the effectiveness of both the pills in preventing pregnancy is given below.\n\n【32】Which Morning-After Pill Is Right for Me?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【33】As you would have already read, there are two types of morning-after pills available:\n\n【34】*   The pill with Ulipristal acetate - It is the most effective type, and can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, as it works almost the same on day 5 as it does on day 1. This is available on prescription only.\n\n【35】*   The pill with Levonorgestrel \\- If you are looking for emergency contraception because you missed taking your birth control pill, then this is a good option. They are available over-the-counter in most countries and should be taken within 72 hours. The sooner you take them, the more effective they are.\n\n【36】How Is the Morning-After Pill Taken?\n------------------------------------\n\n【37】Read and follow the pill’s instructions properly before taking the pill. If you feel that you need emergency contraception, take it as soon as possible. It will not work if you take it before unprotected sex. It has to be taken within 72 hours (3 days).\n\n【38】How Often Can the Morning-After Pill Be Taken?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【39】It is safe to take the morning-after pill whenever necessary, but it should not be used as an ongoing form of birth control methods like an intrauterine device (IUD), ring, or patch. Frequent use of emergency contraception can make your periods unpredictable or irregular or can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. So if you take more than three morning-after pills a month, it is advisable to consider other methods of birth control.\n\n【40】What Are the Contraindications of the Emergency Pill?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Do not take the pill if you suspect pregnancy. Get a home or blood pregnancy test done and then take the pill. As such, there is no absolute contraindication for the use of these pills. But the efficacy of the drug may reduce in the following situations:\n\n【42】*   Malabsorption syndrome.\n\n【43】*   Enzyme-inducing drugs.\n\n【44】*   Hypersensitivity to the pill.\n\n【45】*   Severe liver disease.\n\n【46】*   Obese woman.\n\n【47】*   Taking drugs that increase the gastric pH.\n\n【48】What Is the Other Form of Emergency Contraception?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Apart from morning-after pills, Copper intrauterine device (IUD) can be used for emergency contraception. Copper IUD if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex, can prevent pregnancy up to 99.9%. It is the most effective form of emergency contraception.\n\n【50】What Are the Side Effects of the Morning-After Pill?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】The possible side effects are:\n\n【52】*   Nausea.\n\n【53】*   Vomiting.\n\n【54】*   Breast tenderness.\n\n【55】*   Lower abdominal pain.\n\n【56】*   Abdominal cramps.\n\n【57】*   Headache.\n\n【58】*   Fatigue.\n\n【59】*   Menstrual changes.\n\n【60】*   Delay periods.\n\n【61】*   Dizziness.\n\n【62】*   Intermenstrual bleeding.\n\n【63】Call your doctor if you vomit within a couple of hours after taking the pill, as you might have to repeat the dose.\n\n【64】Is It Safe to Take Morning-After Pills During Breastfeeding and Pregnancy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【65】### Breastfeeding\n\n【66】Taking emergency pills containing Levonorgestrel during breastfeeding is safe. Some of the hormones in the pill can be passed to your baby through the milk, but it has shown no side effects on the baby. It will have no effect on the quantity and quality of your milk.\n\n【67】But it is not advisable to take emergency pills containing Ulipristal acetate during breastfeeding, as it is still unknown if it can affect your baby.\n\n【68】### Pregnancy\n\n【69】Emergency contraceptive pills will not cause abortion if you are already pregnant. The hormones present in the pill will not affect the developing fetus if implantation has already occurred. But it is advisable to get a pregnancy test done before you take the tablet.\n\n【70】Always choose other birth control methods as they are more effective in preventing pregnancy, and avoid using emergency contraceptive pills as much as possible. If you have missed your periods and have symptoms of pregnancy even after taking the pill, consult your gynecologist or book a real-time video consultation online.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Question**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**Can You Get Pregnant After Taking a Morning-after Pill?**\n\n【74】It is possible to get pregnant after taking a morning-after pill.

{"seq_id": "5139feb0-cda9-4d02-8fed-80dd339067ae", "title": "Disinfection of Dental Implants in Laboratory", "text": "【0】What Is the Need for Implant Disinfection?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【1】In the dental laboratory, during the customization and manufacturing process of a dental implant abutment, there is a microbial load accumulation on the titanium discs of either the implant abutment or on its surface. These microorganisms cannot only hamper osseointegration (bone-implant fusion) but also potentially contaminate the patient’s oral cavity and implant abutment fixing. Marginal bone loss (MBL) has been of paramount importance in dental implant success rate assessment; so, it has always been of great concern to preserve every tenth of a millimeter of alveolar bone around dental implants for which implant disinfection is primary in the laboratory.\n\n【2】C.albicans and E.faecalis have been detected in implant-abutment connection and peri-implant sulcus of implants affected by peri-implantitis, so most implantologists and researchers believe that implant-abutment connection site can be a potential microbial reservoir predisposing patients to periimplantitis. In addition to C.albicans and E.faecalis, A. baumannii has also been more frequently detected in the subgingival biofilm of seropositive HIV patients with periodontitis than healthy patients.\n\n【3】Surface disinfection not only helps eliminate pathogens on the implant surface but also reduces microbial load significantly. Er:-YAG, high-pressure steam, H2O2, and NaOCL groups could completely eliminate all the cultured microorganisms invivo or in-vitro studies as per current research. However, GaAIAs could not eliminate microorganisms completely. Descriptive results of microbial count after decontamination by diode laser are demonstrated in these studies, which proves that C.albicans was the only microorganism that was eliminated by all the decontamination procedures. Among resistant microorganisms, M.luteus and A.baumannii were the most resistant species.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>My gums are itchy after eating. Please help.</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>Disinfection of Dental Implants in Laboratory</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>I am 18 years old and my gums have receded because of improper brushing. Kindly help.</u>\n\n【9】What Are the Phases of MBL or Marginal Bone Loss?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Marginal bone loss (MBL) or bone loss around submerged implants occurs before implant-abutment connection, which seems to be inevitable but can be avoided by implant disinfection procedures in the dental laboratory. The second phase of MBL occurs after uncovering submerged implants until the delivery of the final prosthesis, and finally, the last but continuous phase of MBL occurs after the loading of implants or implant loading.\n\n【11】Proper soft tissue integration at the mucosal or transmucosal part of a dental implant is a prerequisite to seal the adjacent alveolar bone from the oral environment. Soft tissue attachment, as a barrier to the oral cavity, has a key role in preserving marginal bone height during the second phase and last phase of MBL. It is important to keep in mind that the quality of soft tissue attachment is influenced by the properties of the implant components that are in contact with the soft tissue.\n\n【12】During the fabrication procedure of the final prosthesis, implant abutments are sent to a dental laboratory and sent back to the dental office repeatedly. Hence, implant abutments become contaminated with various microorganisms and debris. Microorganisms and endotoxins can cause osteoclast activation (resorbing bone cell activation) and, consequently, subsequent bone resorption when there is a microgap due to debris that remained at the implant-abutment connection. Besides microgap formation, debris, such as titanium microparticles which are produced during abutment customization, can act as a foreign body and produce an inflammatory response, influencing soft tissue healing around implants to decontaminate abutments sent from dental laboratories before abutment connection to the implant.\n\n【13】What Are the Decontaminants Used for Surface Roughness and Implant Disinfection?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Decontamination of implant abutments may result in better soft tissue attachment and maintenance of marginal bone around implants because the application of a decontamination method can have an impact on different features of titanium surfaces. Higher surface roughness facilitates the accumulation of bacterial biofilm. It has also been shown that epithelial cells and fibroblasts adhere to machined titanium surfaces with higher strength when compared to rough surfaces.\n\n【15】Several studies have evaluated the effect of surface roughness on soft tissue integration on a microscale; however, there is a lack of evidence regarding the importance of nanoroughness in soft tissue integration. The key point in titanium abutment decontamination seems to be preserving and improving the chemical and topographic characteristics of the titanium surface while reducing or eliminating microorganisms at the same time.\n\n【16】As per current research, among the variety of different disinfectants, antimicrobial efficacy of plasma of argon and ultrasonic bath containing chemical decontaminants have been compared with high-pressure steam, which is commonly used in dental laboratories. Although both argon and ultrasonic cleaning plasmas could eliminate all the present microorganisms, unlike the high-pressure steam, these techniques have their own drawbacks. Ultrasonic cleaning is time-consuming; moreover, immersion of several abutments in a single ultrasonic bath may cause difficulty in finding the original site and direction of each abutment after decontamination. Despite the excellent antimicrobial and surface activation effect of plasma of argon, the device is not routinely present in dental clinics or laboratories. Hence, it seems necessary to evaluate other techniques that are more accessible and routinely used regarding their effects on microorganisms and titanium surface characteristics.\n\n【17】Chemical disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are relatively common and easy-to-use disinfectants in dental clinics. However, a laser which is a novel technology is widely used by clinicians, and it is present in many clinics nowadays. Besides, laser irradiation makes it possible to disinfect an abutment in 1 or 2 minutes without those difficulties mentioned about immersion techniques.\n\n【18】Plasma treatment increases titanium surface wettability, but this is not unique to plasma treatment. A similar effect was shown for NaOCL and H2O2 treatments, which enhances epithelial cell growth on machined titanium surfaces. Different concentrations of chemical solutions and different settings of lasers have been used in the literature to decontaminate titanium surfaces.\n\n【19】**Conclusion:**\n\n【20】Among all the methods that could decontaminate machined titanium surfaces, a complete microbial elimination can be achieved in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), high-pressure steam, and erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er: YAG) lasers, as they are demonstrated to be equally effective in decontamination as well. However, among these, NaOCL remains the most effective agent for surface roughness increase.

The backflow of this stomach fluid can cause stomach lining irritation, and individuals may experience acid reflux from time to time.\n\n【2】What Are the Symptoms of GERD?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】The most common signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disorder are\n\n【4】*   Regurgitation of food and sour liquid.\n\n【5】*   Upper abdominal or chest pain.\n\n【6】*   Dysphagia.\n\n【7】*   A lump in the throat sensation.\n\n【8】*   Burning and irritating sensation in the chest.\n\n【9】*   Heartburn that gets worse at night or by lying down.\n\n【10】At night one can also experience the following:\n\n【11】*   Ongoing cough.\n\n【12】*   Worsening or new asthma.\n\n【13】*   Laryngitis (inflammation of the vocal cords).\n\n【14】What Are the Risk Factors That Increase the Risk of GERD?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The risk factors that increase the risk of getting GERD are as follows:\n\n【16】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【17】*   Obesity.\n\n【18】*   Delayed stomach emptying.\n\n【19】*   Bulging of the upper area of the stomach.\n\n【20】*   Scleroderma (connective tissue disorder).\n\n【21】Other factors that aggravate acid reflux are\n\n【22】*   Certain fatty and fried foods.\n\n【23】*   Large meals, eating late or at night.\n\n【24】*   Smoking.\n\n【25】*   Alcohol consumption in excess.\n\n【26】*   Drinking excess amounts of beverages like coffee and aerated drinks.\n\n【27】*   Medications like Aspirin.\n\n【28】What Are the Foods That May Cause Acid Reflux?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Acid reflux and heartburn are caused due to relaxed esophageal sphincter and a delay in the digestive process. Food stays in the stomach cavity for a longer duration, and foods that are the main culprits are salt, spicy, and high-fat foods. Foods like:\n\n【30】*   Fast food.\n\n【31】*   Fried food.\n\n【32】*   Chili powder and pepper.\n\n【33】*   Pizza.\n\n【34】*   Potato chips and processed snacks.\n\n【35】*   Cheese.\n\n【36】*   Fatty meats like sausage and bacon.\n\n【37】*   Peppermint.\n\n【38】*   Chocolate.\n\n【39】*   Citrus foods.\n\n【40】*   Sauces like tomato sauce.\n\n【41】*   Carbonated drinks.\n\n【42】What Foods Help to Ease Acid Reflux?\n------------------------------------\n\n【43】No proven specific food helps to get rid of acid reflux, but these foods can help to actively relieve the symptoms. Following the diet can improve symptoms. Intake of high-fiber fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of GERD. The foods that help to relieve the symptoms of the condition are\n\n【44】**Vegetables:**\n\n【45】Vegetables are low in sugar and fat. Vegetables are the main source of fiber and are beneficial carbohydrates. Options include\n\n【46】*   Cauliflower.\n\n【47】*   Cucumber.\n\n【48】*   Green leafy vegetables.\n\n【49】*   Broccoli.\n\n【50】*   Asparagus.\n\n【51】*   Brussels sprouts.\n\n【52】*   Kale.\n\n【53】*   Potatoes.\n\n【54】*   Spinach.\n\n【55】**Fruits:**\n\n【56】Citrus foods cause and trigger symptoms of GERD. Fruits are a high source of fiber, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin C.\n\n【57】Fruits like\n\n【58】*   Melons.\n\n【59】*   Berries.\n\n【60】*   Bananas.\n\n【61】*   Apples.\n\n【62】*   Avocados.\n\n【63】*   Peaches.\n\n【64】*   Pears.\n\n【65】**Proteins:**\n\n【66】Lean protein is low in saturated fat, like\n\n【67】*   Skinless turkey.\n\n【68】*   Seafood.\n\n【69】*   Lentils.\n\n【70】*   Fish.\n\n【71】*   Beans.\n\n【72】*   Almonds.\n\n【73】*   Skinless Chicken.\n\n【74】*   Egg white is good, while egg yolks are rich in fat, worsening GERD symptoms.\n\n【75】**Fats:**\n\n【76】The most crucial step in treating GERD is to eliminate or significantly reduce the consumption of trans fats, dairy fats, and saturated fats from meat and processed foods. These healthy fats are\n\n【77】*   Olive oil.\n\n【78】*   Nut butter.\n\n【79】*   Avocado oil.\n\n【80】*   Fatty fish.\n\n【81】*   Nuts and seeds.\n\n【82】**Whole grains:**\n\n【83】A high source of fiber is present in whole grains. A high-fiber diet helps in reducing the risk of heartburn, and these foods include\n\n【84】*   Whole grain bread.\n\n【85】*   Brown rice.\n\n【86】*   Oatmeal.\n\n【87】What Are the Home Remedies for Acid Reflux?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【88】People with acid reflux commonly use antacids as over-the-counter medication to neutralize acid reflux. Certain home remedies are as follows:\n\n【89】*   **Milk****:** There are many controversies and misconceptions regarding milk as a home remedy for heartburn. Milk with less fat can act as a temporary buffer protecting the stomach lining and relieving heartburn symptoms.\n\n【90】*   **Ginger:** Ginger is considered the best digestive aid and has many beneficial effects like anti-inflammatory and easing gastrointestinal tract irritation.\n\n【91】*   **Lemon water****:** Lemon is acidic in nature. Lukewarm water along with lemon and honey can help neutralize the acids in the stomach, and honey works as a natural antioxidant that protects cells.\n\n【92】*   **Apple Cider Vinegar:** There is no more evidence that apple cider vinegar helps in acid reflux. But many people claim its benefits and consume small amounts mixed in lukewarm water with meals.\n\n【93】*   **Chewing Gum:** Chewing gum can help to increase saliva production, which can help to neutralize stomach acid and reduce acid reflux symptoms.\n\n【94】*   **Elevate the Head of the Bed****:** Raising the head of the bed by six to eight inches can help to prevent acid reflux symptoms by gravity reducing the flow of stomach acid into the esophagus.\n\n【95】What Recommended Diet Plans Can Be Followed to Control Acid Reflux?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【96】Experts recommend a Mediterranean diet or a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to help in reducing acid reflux. Some dietary plan ideas are\n\n【97】*   Avocado on whole grain toast.\n\n【98】*   Mixed salad greens with whole pita bread and hummus.\n\n【99】*   Steamed vegetables and salmon with brown rice.\n\n【100】*   Whole grain toast with poached eggs.\n\n【101】*   Berries with oatmeal.\n\n【102】*   Hummus and salad with grilled vegetable skewers.\n\n【103】*   Grilled vegetables, potatoes, and baked skinless chicken.\n\n【104】*   Whole grain pizza with low-fat cheese and vegetables.\n\n【105】*   Tuna and grilled vegetables with whole grain bread.\n\n【106】What Are the Lifestyle Tips to Control Acid Reflux?\n\n【107】Management of symptoms with lifestyle modifications is one of the lifestyle suggestions to control acid reflux symptoms with diet and nutrition. Tips to be followed are:\n\n【108】*   Maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n【109】*   Stop smoking.\n\n【110】*   Avoid alcohol.\n\n【111】*   Eat slowly, and do not overeat.\n\n【112】*   Taking antacids and medication to suppress acid production.\n\n【113】*   Avoid wearing tight clothes.\n\n【114】*   At least two hours stay upright after having food.\n\n【115】*   Chewing gum like peppermint and spearmint can be useful.\n\n【116】*   Raising the head on the bed at least four to six inches can reduce reflux symptoms while sleeping.\n\n【117】*   At least three to four hours before going to bed, meals should be taken.\n\n【118】**Conclusion**\n\n【119】No diet has been clinically proven to prevent GERD. Certain foods may help to ease symptoms in some individuals. Researches prove that increased fiber intake, mainly vegetables and fruits, may protect against GERD. But there is certain confusion on how fiber prevents GERD. Increasing fiber and diet can help reduce other risk factors along with reflux, like uncontrolled blood sugar, hemorrhoids, bowel issues, and high cholesterol. A dietician can help to develop a diet that can control and lessen acid reflux symptoms. If changes in lifestyle and medications fail to improve the condition, talk to the healthcare provider to help with the condition. In extreme cases, surgery is recommended.\n\n【120】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【121】无关删除-1:<u>*   GERD Diet: Foods That Help with Acid Reflux (Heartburn)  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/gerd-diet-foods-that-help-with-acid-reflux-heartburn\n*   Diet Changes for GERD  \n    https://aboutgerd.org/treatment/diet-lifestyle-changes/diet-changes-for-gerd/\n*   The role of diet in the development and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: why we feel the burn  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702398/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The physical and psychological changes that take place during this period are enormous. Also, the joy of the upcoming baby is very special. But abortion in that situation may be considered a difficult life event. Abortion is considered a common medical intervention. About 73 million induced abortions take place all over the world each year. The rate is even higher in developing countries. Post-abortion, a woman goes through a series of physical and psychological changes. Different types of intervention, like medical and psychological counseling, are needed to support women during this period. As a result, it is well understood that abortion care is an integral part of medical treatment.\n\n【1】What Is Abortion?\n-----------------\n\n【2】Abortion is the termination of pregnancy at a time when the when the mother is in the 28th week of pregnancy, or its weight is less than 500 grams. Abortion can be of several types. A spontaneous abortion is often related to physical complications related to pregnancy. In induced abortions, termination of pregnancy is done either through medical intervention or by self-managed methods. Accidental abortions are those where the loss of pregnancy occurs suddenly due to some factors.\n\n【3】**Spontaneous Abortion -** It is also termed miscarriage and is characterized by the loss of pregnancy naturally before twenty weeks of gestation. The cause of spontaneous abortions are:\n\n【4】*   **Medical Conditions -** Certain medical conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, celiac disease, and autoimmune conditions, like antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, are responsible for this. Infectious conditions like vaginitis, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, syphilis, and malaria are also associated.\n*   **Age Factors -** Increased age (over 35 years) or too little age (below 18 years) is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.\n\n【5】*   **Structural Anomalies of Genital Tract -** Anatomical abnormalities related to the female genital tract increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Abnormalities like fibroids, adhesions, or uterine scarring are responsible for this.\n\n【6】*   **Genetic Factors -** The presence of an extra chromosome or absence of one or more than one chromosome in the embryo is associated with miscarriage.\n\n【7】*   **Placental Problem -** Placenta is the portion of the mother's body into which the embryo grows. This helps to protect the embryo and apply nutrition to the embryo. Several placental problems like placenta previa (abnormal positioning of the placenta which covers the opening of the uterus), placental abruption ( placenta separates from the uterine wall before birth), chorioamnionitis ( a type of placental infection), and placenta accrete (placenta is attached too deeply in the uterus) may cause miscarriage.\n\n【8】*   **Habits -** Certain deleterious habits like smoking and alcohol consumption may cause miscarriage.\n\n【9】*   **Drug Factors -** Several drugs like Diclofenac, Misoprostol, Natalizumab, and Ergotamine are associated with miscarriage.\n\n【10】*   **Accidental Factors -** Accidental consumption of toxic metals like lead or toxic substances like pesticides are responsible for accidental miscarriage.\n\n【11】**Induced Abortion -** In induced abortion, termination of pregnancy is done either with the help of medication or with surgical intervention. The rate of induced abortion is very high. Every three out of ten pregnancies end in induced abortions. The types of induced abortions are:\n\n【12】*   **Medical Abortion -** Consumption of medication outside the medical faculty is self-induced abortion. The safe period for such abortions is nine weeks of pregnancy or less. If the duration of pregnancy is more than nine weeks, it should be done under medical supervision.\n\n【13】*   **Surgical Abortion -** Removal of the uterus surgically is known as surgical abortion. If the pregnancy lasts more than 12 weeks, surgical abortions are preferred to avert medical complications. In certain cases, surgical abortions safeguard the mother's life. This type of abortion is known as therapeutic abortion. The conditions required for therapeutic abortions are medication conditions that can be fatal to the mother's health, abnormal fetus (genetic or structural abnormality), and sudden medical treatment required to the mother, like chemotherapy.\n\n【14】What Is Abortion Care?\n----------------------\n\n【15】Any type of abortion can be challenging. Even elective abortion (abortion by the mother's choice) may cause medical complications after the procedure. According to data from the world health organization, 45 % of induced abortions done between the year 2010 to 2014 were unsafe. Popper medical screening before the abortion procedure and medical follow-up after the abortion process are necessary to overcome any adverse conditions. Also, psychological support is necessary for the mother during such situations. So abortion care must be divided into steps like pre-abortion care, post-abortion care, and medical consultation during pregnancy. The goal of abortion care are:\n\n【16】1.  Protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of the individual.\n\n【17】2.  Protect the law of the land and maintain legal transparency.\n\n【18】3.  Prioritize the health of the mother.\n\n【19】4.  Care of the mother post-abortion procedure.\n\n【20】What Is Medical Consultation During Pregnancy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】This is not related to abortion care, but medical consultation before pregnancy and during pregnancy can be life-saving. This helps to evaluate the prior medical condition of the mother, screening of the genital tract, and pregnancy education and planning. This step is very helpful in avoiding miscarriage, specifically in developing countries.\n\n【22】What Is Pre-Abortion Care?\n--------------------------\n\n【23】Evaluation of several factors before the abortion procedure is known as pre-abortion care. This includes:\n\n【24】*   **Determination of Gestational Age -** This is perhaps the most important stage of the abortion procedure. Gestational age determines the type of abortion suitable for the procedure and the medication needed.\n\n【25】*   **Ultrasound Scanning -** Ultrasound scanning help to determine the fetal condition and the pregnancy condition. This is very helpful for surgical abortions or in conditions like ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【26】*   **Medical History -** Proper medical history of the patient is necessary to avoid any medical complications. Necessary medical tests are also should be performed.\n\n【27】*   **Pre- Abortion Counseling -** Pre-abortion counseling is one of one most important aspects of abortion care. Counselors should understand the reason for abortion. In the case of elective abortion procedures, any medico-legal angle must be ruled out. Patients should be educated about contraception procedures and sterilization methods also. In the case of therapeutic abortion, the counselor needs to discuss the issue with the patient and also with her family. The method of the abortion and potential complications after the procedure must be discussed with the patient. Above all, all the necessary consent should be taken before the procedure keeping the legal aspect of the issue in mind.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Abortion can be induced or due to medical complications. Any type of abortion should be dealt with cautiously and empathetically. The probable complications of abortion must be discussed with the patients beforehand, and the patient’s consent should be taken. Proper medical evaluation before the procedure is also needed. During the whole process, the sociolegal aspect also should be considered. Moreover, psychological counseling of the patient is also needed.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   Abortion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518961/\n*   Abortion Complications  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430793/\n*   POST-ABORTION CARE  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK304195/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The overload of iron and its accumulation in hepatic cells and Kupffer cells is seen in hemochromatosis (a disorder characterized by excessive iron deposition leading to multiple organ failure) and hemosiderosis (excessive deposition of hemosiderin (iron) in the tissues, respectively. With the advent of new imaging techniques for liver diseases, there has been an increase in early and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【2】Ultrasound is an easy and simple imaging technique for diagnosing liver diseases. It is used as a complementary method along with more advanced techniques. In recent times, elastography has been adopted for measuring the stiffness and elasticity of the liver. Ultrasonography elastography makes it one of the most valuable techniques for diagnosing liver diseases because of its non-invasiveness, non-inferior diagnostic capability, and relative cost-effectiveness.\n\n【3】What Are the Imaging Modalities for Diagnosing and Managing Liver Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The primary imaging techniques for diagnosing liver disease include:\n\n【5】*   Liver ultrasonography.\n\n【6】*   Computed tomography (CT).\n\n【7】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【8】Postcontrast imaging helps to distinguish diseases depending on the degree of composition and vascularity. Postcontrast hepatic imaging can be divided into three distinct phases:\n\n【9】*   Arterial phase.\n\n【10】*   Portal venous phase.\n\n【11】*   Delayed venous phase.\n\n【12】Ultrasound is a method of choice as a screening technique. In most hepatic imaging, contrast-enhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) is a modality of choice. MRI shows a better characterization of the lesions with equivocal features on ultrasound and computed tomography.\n\n【13】How Is Ultrasound Used for Diagnosing and Managing Liver Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Ultrasonography is generally the first imaging technique for evaluating and screening for focal and diffuse liver diseases. The advantages of ultrasound include:\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Metastatic Adenocarcinoma - Causes, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Ways to Prevent Cancer</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>High-Tech Devices to Improve Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care - A Recent Update</u>\n\n【20】*   It is readily available.\n\n【21】*   It has a low cost.\n\n【22】*   It is non-invasive.\n\n【23】On ultrasound, the liver pathologies are seen with different patterns, such as generalized hypoechogenicity in the case of acute hepatitis and diffuse malignant lesions. Generalized hyperechogenicity is seen in diffuse hepatic steatosis and anechoic or hyperechoic lesions, as many benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) lesions. The following are some of the benign hyperechoic (increase in density of sound waves compared to surrounding structures in an ultrasound) lesions:\n\n【24】*   Hemangioma (noncancerous growths of blood vessels).\n\n【25】*   Hepatic adenoma (benign liver lesions associated with anabolic steroids and the oral contraceptive pill).\n\n【26】*   Focal nodular hyperplasia (a benign lesion or tumor formed in the liver).\n\n【27】Malignant hyperechoic lesions include:\n\n【28】*   Renal cell carcinoma (cancer involving the kidney cells).\n\n【29】*   Melanoma (cancer of the melanocytes or cells that are responsible for the color of the skin).\n\n【30】*   Cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile ducts).\n\n【31】*   HCC or hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).\n\n【32】Ultrasonography is used in combination with other techniques and tools and plays an essential role in diagnosing and treating different liver diseases like:\n\n【33】Ultrasound with color Doppler can provide information about the liver vasculature, such as the flow and direction of the portal vein. The portal vein blood normally flows away from the liver hepatomegaly flow. Therefore, retrograde flow from the periphery to the central area is suggestive of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Doppler ultrasound can evaluate the patency of the portal vein prior to transplant as well as hepatic artery thrombosis after the transplant.\n\n【34】A percutaneous liver biopsy can be performed under the guidance of ultrasound or CT. Ultrasound is the technique of choice for both focal, targeted biopsy and non-focal liver biopsy in cases with a good target window. A CT-guided biopsy is majorly reserved for lesions not clearly visible on ultrasound.\n\n【35】The indications for focal liver biopsies include:\n\n【36】*   Unknown focal liver lesions.\n\n【37】*   Presence of metastasis in the liver without a specific source.\n\n【38】The indications for non-focal liver biopsy include:\n\n【39】*   Primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【40】*   Staging of parenchymal diseases like cirrhosis.\n\n【41】*   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n【42】*   Assessment of hepatic storage disease.\n\n【43】*   Determining the presence of rejection after liver transplant.\n\n【44】*   Presence of abnormal liver function tests without any specific etiology.\n\n【45】How Is Computed Tomography Used for Diagnosing and Managing Liver Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Computed tomography imaging of the liver is performed with the following different protocols:\n\n【47】*   Unenhanced, single-phase.\n\n【48】*   Dual-phase.\n\n【49】*   Triphasic contrast-enhanced protocols.\n\n【50】All the above liver CT protocols are essential in evaluating various liver pathologies. The single-phase contrast-enhanced CT is generally the modality of choice; the liver has the maximum enhancement in the portal venous phase in CT, typically 70 seconds after intravenous contrast injection.\n\n【51】It primarily provides information about diffuse liver diseases, like hypovascular metastatic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. The primary imaging technique in the portal venous and late arterial phases is the dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT. It is obtained 35 seconds (approximately) after intravenous injection and provides better information about hypervascular lesions.\n\n【52】How Is Magnetic Resonance Imaging Used for Diagnosing and Managing Liver Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advantages and disadvantages compared to ultrasound and computed tomography. MRI is considered the best imaging technique for liver diseases because of the following reasons:\n\n【54】*   Higher cross-sectional resolution.\n\n【55】*   Lack of ionizing radiation.\n\n【56】*   Characterization of focal liver lesions.\n\n【57】*   Presence of extracellular and hepatocyte-specific contrast agents.\n\n【58】*   It provides better and more accurate information about the diffuse liver lesion.\n\n【59】The disadvantages include:\n\n【60】*   More expensive.\n\n【61】*   It takes longer to acquire images.\n\n【62】*   It requires patient cooperation, like breath-holding.\n\n【63】*   It has better and fewer motion artifacts.\n\n【64】What Are the Other Imaging Techniques for Diagnosing and Managing Liver Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【65】Another imaging technique for assessing liver diseases, like the presence and degree of hepatic steatosis, is gradient recalled echo (GRE) MRI. However, the gold standard method for evaluating the presence of early fibrotic and inflammatory changes is liver biopsy. Further, a newer technique called magnetic resonance elastography was introduced, which was originally known as ultrasound elastography. It helps to measure liver stiffness and the degree of fibrosis. Its sensitivity and specificity are better compared to ultrasound elastography, which has limited use in obese patients and patients with ascites.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a standardized system for reporting and classifying liver lesions at an increased risk of developing into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LIRAD helps in the categorization of lesions into probably benign, definitely benign, probably, or definitely malignant. It guides clinicians, radiologists, and surgeons for surveillance guidelines and recommendations if a biopsy is necessary.\n\n【68】Before initiating any treatment, the first step to evaluate liver pathology is dependent on the patient's clinical situation, availability of different imaging techniques, and technician and physician familiarity with the test. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans are the first choices of imaging modality to assess diffuse and focal liver lesions. Further treatment and imaging are performed based on the finding of ultrasound and CT scans.\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>*   Liver Imaging  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557460/\n*   Prediction of liver cirrhosis, using diagnostic imaging tools  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539400/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Pediatric dermatology was first recognized as a subspeciality in 2000. Newer technology in pediatric dermatology has evolved in recent times. Severe skin conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis need special care. Systemic therapy includes hormonal therapy, target drug delivery, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy is beneficial in treating childhood melanoma and other dermatitis conditions.\n\n【2】**What Is Systemic Therapy?**\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Systemic therapy is psychotherapy mostly given to children with psychological difficulties. Systemic therapy is different from other forms of therapy. Systemic therapy contains the chemical compounds that travel through the blood and reach the affected area to perform its action. Systemic therapy is advised for pediatric patients with severe chronic dermal conditions. Children beyond the treatment of typical therapy are primarily involved in systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is typically suggested in children with moderate to extreme conditions of atopic dermatitis. In some cases, topical and systemic therapy is also prescribed in pediatric dermatology.\n\n【4】What Are the Conditions That Require Systemic Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Systemic therapy is mainly performed in severe eczematous skin conditions. For example, atopic dermatitis, in addition to superinfections, needs systemic treatment. Pediatric dermatologists include allergy, immunology, cancer, superinfections, rheumatology, and plastic surgery. Some of the pediatric conditions involving systemic therapy are mentioned below.\n\n【6】*   Acne - Oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and drug-like Isotretinoin are systemic therapy.\n\n【7】*   Eczemas such as atopic dermatitis and systemic steroids are advised.\n\n【8】*   For birthmarks, such as hemangiomas, systemic Propranolol is used.\n\n【9】*   Target therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are involved in the systemic treatment of melanoma.\n\n【10】*   Skin connective disorder.\n\n【11】*   Contact dermatitis. Antibiotics are administered.\n\n【12】*   Alopecia.\n\n【13】*   For erythromelalgia, Aspirin is the main drug of choice.\n\n【14】*   Moles.\n\n【15】*   Psoriasis, systemic drugs like Retinoids, Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Apremilast, and immunotherapy.\n\n【16】*   Blood malformations.\n\n【17】*   Warts.\n\n【18】*   Pregnancy dermatomes.\n\n【19】*   Genetic disorders.\n\n【20】*   Skin cancer.\n\n【21】What Causes Skin Infections in Children?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【22】Skin is the natural barrier for any pathogens, but skin infections should be treated when infected. Skin infections can occur due to bacteria, viruses, and fungi. According to the severity of the disease, the appropriate treatment is given. Systemic therapy is advised in children with severe skin infections. Good hygiene is maintained to avoid most skin infections. Some skin conditions in children where systemic therapy is mandatory are given below.\n\n【23】*   Molluscum contagiosum.\n\n【24】*   Viral warts.\n\n【25】*   Impetigo.\n\n【26】*   Tinea capitis also known as scalp ringworm.\n\n【27】**Molluscum Contagiosum:**\n\n【28】Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral condition affecting children. Molluscum contagiosum is a self-limiting skin disorder caused due to human-specific poxvirus. The clinical features of molluscum contagiosum include the papules in dome shape with umbilication. Topical Imiquimod is advised, and cryotherapy is recommended in extreme cases.\n\n【29】**Viral Warts**:\n\n【30】Warts are the epithelial proliferations that happen due to the human papillomavirus. Viral warts are common cutaneous conditions that are more prevalent among children. Topical salicylic acids, cryotherapy, intralesional Bleomycin, topical immunotherapy, pulsed laser therapy, and photodynamic therapy are used for treating viral warts. The other types of viral warts are given below.\n\n【31】*   Common warts appear as smooth papules in flesh color.\n\n【32】*   Plantar warts, also known as verrucae. Plantar warts are painful skin lesions.\n\n【33】*   Mosaic warts are typically seen as small and discrete warts.\n\n【34】*   Plane warts are the flat papules usually seen on the face, extremities, and upper extremities.\n\n【35】**Impetigo:**\n\n【36】Impetigo is the most common cutaneous disorder affecting children. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the causative agents for impetigo. Impetigo is a contagious infection often seen in combination with atopic dermatitis in children. Systemic antibiotics in combination with topical antiseptics are administered in impetigo. Cephalosporins like Cephalexin are advised for the treatment of impetigo. Other drugs like Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, co-amoxiclav, are highly active against streptococcus aureus.\n\n【37】**Tinea Capitis:**\n\n【38】Tinea capitis is the scalp ringworm caused due to fungus caused by Microsporum canis. Tinea capitis is predominantly present in children. Symptoms of tinea capitis include patchy alopecia. Griseofulvin is an antifungal drug administered for treating tinea capitis. Other drugs found to be effective in treating tinea capitis include Itraconazole, Fluconazole, and Ketoconazole.

Other systemic therapy types include hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and target therapy. The indications of systemic therapy in pediatric dermatology are mentioned below.\n\n【52】*   Childhood melanoma.\n\n【53】*   Infantile atopic dermatitis.\n\n【54】*   Eczema.\n\n【55】*   Skin infectious conditions.\n\n【56】*   Boils and abscesses.\n\n【57】*   Cellulitis.\n\n【58】*   Impetigo.\n\n【59】*   Insect bites.\n\n【60】*   Scabies.\n\n【61】*   Fungal infections.\n\n【62】*   Measles or Rubeola.\n\n【63】*   Rubella or German measles.\n\n【64】*   Roseola.\n\n【65】*   Chickenpox.\n\n【66】*   Parasitic skin infections.\n\n【67】*   Herpes zoster infections.\n\n【68】*   Shingles.\n\n【69】*   Pityriasis rosea.\n\n【70】*   Warts.\n\n【71】*   Molluscum contagiosum.\n\n【72】*   Viral exanthematous condition.\n\n【73】**Conclusion**\n\n【74】Children are mostly subjected to various skin conditions or skin problems. The mild form of skin conditions in children will be spontaneously resolved. But systemic therapy is advised in severe dermal diseases like melanoma, eczema, and other infectious skin conditions. Systemic therapy is highly effective against various dermal conditions in children and prevents the recurrence of particular conditions. Systemic therapy in combination with topical treatment is also effective in children with skin disorders. Proper awareness is mandatory among parents about the detrimental effects of poor health in children. Pediatric care, protective measures, and doctor-guided treatment will avoid the risk of skin disorders.\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>*   Systemic Treatment of Adult Atopic Dermatitis: A Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5336433/\n*   Common skin infections in children  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC449820/\n*   Systemic therapy of atopic dermatitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039987/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a type of minimal intervention to maintain the life of the patient by relieving pressure in conditions of intra-abdominal hypertension. The abdomen can be left open so that a second look can be made to make sure that the needed changes, like stopping sepsis or bleeding, have been made. After inspection, the abdomen is temporarily sutured back using specific techniques. Fascial traction is one such technique used for the closure of the open abdomen.\n\n【2】What Is an Open Abdomen?\n------------------------\n\n【3】An open abdomen is a defect that can be caused on purpose by leaving an abdominal incision open during surgery or by opening the abdomen in emergencies like abdominal compartment syndrome or after an injury.\n\n【4】**When Is an Open Abdomen Condition Considered?**\n\n【5】*   Edema (swelling) with decreased space in the abdomen.\n\n【6】*   A deep infection in the abdomen necessitates drainage.\n\n【7】*   The open abdomen is indicated as a damage control surgery to manage abdominal trauma and abdominal sepsis.\n\n【8】*   The open abdomen is managed by a temporary abdominal closure technique.

Bogota bag (temporary mesh) placement was an older technique for temporary abdominal closure. Many new techniques have been introduced, including:\n\n【22】*   **Dynamic Therapies:**\n\n【23】    *   Dynamic fascial closure combined with negative pressure therapy.\n    *   Mesh-mediated fascial traction technique.\n    *   Dynamic retention sutures or abdominal reapproximation anchor (ABRA).\n    *   Vacuum-assisted wound closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction technique.\n*   **Static Therapies:**\n\n【24】    *   Sequential primary closure.\n\n【25】    *   Negative pressure wound therapy.\n\n【26】    *   Mesh bridging.\n\n【27】**What Are the Objectives of Abdominal Closure Techniques?**\n\n【28】*   To reduce the extent of initial surgery.\n\n【29】*   To temporarily close the abdomen, maintain a sterile, tension-free environment.\n\n【30】What Is the Fascial Traction Technique for Closing an Open Abdomen?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   Primary fascial closure is the foremost thing to be done in open abdomen cases.\n\n【32】*   Wound coverage can be done with the help of a Bogota bag or absorbable mesh.\n\n【33】*   The goal of temporary abdominal closure is to maintain the structure and prevent shrinkage.\n\n【34】*   A heavy-weight polypropylene mesh is divided into equal halves, and the first half of the mesh is sutured to one side of the incision edge. The same is followed on the other side of the incision, and the two mesh halves are brought together under tension and sutured at the midline.\n\n【35】*   This tension prevents the retraction of lateral muscles, which will facilitate closure.\n\n【36】*   A special foam with a tube connected to a negative pressure wound therapy device is placed through which the edges slide towards each other.\n\n【37】*   Using negative pressure, the internal layers of the abdomen are tucked in to prevent any adhesion between the abdominal contents and the layers.\n\n【38】*   A dressing is placed at the end, which is to be changed every 48 to 72 hours.\n\n【39】**What Is Done During a Dressing Change?**\n\n【40】1.  Removing the special foam.\n\n【41】2.  Opening the sutured mesh.\n\n【42】3.  Collecting fluids for culture.\n\n【43】4.  Washing out the abdominal cavity with a warm saline solution.\n\n【44】5.

A new special foam with a tube is placed.\n\n【46】Is the Fascial Traction Technique the Same for Critically Ill and Stable Patients?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The procedure can differ depending on the condition of the patient. For a stable patient, the procedure outlined above is followed. For a patient who is unstable (very sick), the procedure is broken up into the following two steps and carried out.\n\n【48】1.  **First Step:** Only intra-abdominal dressing is applied along with special foam of the negative pressure wound therapy device.\n\n【49】2.  **Second Step:** When the patient comes for a dressing change, the mesh is applied, and the dressing is changed.\n\n【50】What Is the Purpose of Various Techniques Used in the Treatment of Open Abdomen?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】*   Management of fascia (layers that cover the internal organs).\n\n【52】*   Management of viscera (internal organs).\n\n【53】*   Application of negative pressure wound therapy.\n\n【54】**What Facilitates Fascial Closure?**\n\n【55】1.  **Hypertonic Saline:** Hypertonic saline is used for resuscitation, facilitating early closure.\n\n【56】2.  **Botulinum Toxin A:** Chemical paralysis of the lateral abdominal wall having strong opposing forces helps in abdominal wall reconstruction.\n\n【57】**What Are the Indications of Fascial Traction Technique?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】*   Indicated for closure of the open abdomen without tension.\n\n【59】*   Indicated when the edges of the abdomen cannot be placed together.\n\n【60】**What Are the Factors Affecting the Outcome of the Fascial Traction Technique?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】*   The clinical condition of the patient.\n\n【62】*   Presence of intra-abdominal contamination: Any infection or sepsis persisting after the closure can lead the patient closer to the death bed.\n\n【63】*   Polytrauma or injuries to multiple body parts or organs.\n\n【64】**What Are the Contraindications of Fascial Traction Technique?**\n\n【65】When abdominal surgery is done and the abdominal cavity needs to be closed, the fascial traction technique cannot be used.\n\n【66】What Are the Postoperative Complications?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【67】*   **Wound Healing Problems (Infections)****:** There are chances of developing infections at the surgical wound site, which delay the wound healing process due to many factors.\n\n【68】*   **Prolonged Healing Period****:** As the surgery is carried out in critically ill patients, the body may not perform its normal functions due to organ dysfunctions and a lack of the body's ability to heal the wound naturally.\n\n【69】*   **Pain:** Though pain has been reported in a very less percentage of patients postoperatively, it can be relieved by using prescribed pain-relieving medications.\n\n【70】*   **Retracted Scar:** Unavoidable scar at the end of the process.\n\n【71】*   **Mesh Infection:** The mesh used to bring the edges together can also become infected, which can delay wound healing and increase pain. Chances of re-infection of the wound occur.\n\n【72】**Conclusion:**\n\n【73】The fascial traction technique, along with vacuum-assisted wound closure, is a promising treatment for open abdomen cases. Critically ill patients are recommended to undergo this surgery. This procedure has saved many lives. Nevertheless, some complications cannot be a reason for the denial of this surgery.\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>*   Temporary Abdominal Closure Techniques  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK564378/\n*   Dynamic closure techniques for treatment of an open abdomen: an update  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32020342/\n*   vTechniques for Abdominal Wall Closure after Damage Control Laparotomy: From Temporary Abdominal Closure to Early/Delayed Fascial Closure—A Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706912/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "eb2b8da0-71fd-4b50-a3b8-918521b48387", "title": "Perfusion Pressure", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Perfusion pressure refers to the pressure of blood flow within the organs, tissues, and cells. It plays a vital role in the efficient functioning of the body, especially the cardiovascular and neurological systems. Understanding the basic concept of perfusion pressure is highly important to diagnose and treat various diseases that affect the cardiovascular and cerebral systems.\n\n【2】What Is Perfusion Pressure?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Perfusion pressure is the difference between arterial and venous pressures in the circulatory system. This is the pressure that drives the blood flow and helps ensure an adequate supply of oxygen to all the organs, tissues, and cells. It reflects the pressure gradient in the circulatory system and determines the amount of blood flow. Failure to maintain an adequate perfusion pressure leads to insufficient blood supply, thus resulting in multiple organ failures.\n\n【4】*   **Coronary Perfusion Pressure vs. Cerebral Perfusion Pressure:** Coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures are pressure gradients that maintain adequate perfusion to the heart and the brain, respectively. These perfusion pressures are important for the diagnosis and management of various medical conditions. The normal perfusion pressure value ranges from 60 to 80 mm Hg.\n\n【5】What Is the Significance of Coronary Perfusion Pressure?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The heart is a highly oxygen-dependent organ that requires a constant supply of oxygen. Coronary perfusion pressure is the pressure gradient that drives blood flow in the coronary arteries that supply the heart, thus maintaining proper perfusion of the heart. This is the pressure that is responsible for supplying oxygen and other nutrients to the heart.\n\n【7】Coronary perfusion pressure is the difference between aortic diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The significance of this perfusion pressure lies in its role in maintaining sufficient blood flow to the heart muscle. If it falls below the threshold level, blood flow to the heart decreases, resulting in ischemia and myocardial infarction (a heart attack).\n\n【8】**Medical Conditions with Low Coronary Perfusion Pressure:**\n\n【9】*   **Coronary Artery Disease:** This occurs when the arteries that supply the heart muscles are narrowed or blocked due to the accumulation of fatty deposits or plaque. This reduces the blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart, thus causing a decrease in the perfusion pressure. This can lead to serious complications like chest pain (angina) and a heart attack (myocardial infarction).\n\n【10】*   **Heart Failure:** The pumping capacity of the heart is reduced and leads to a decrease in cardiac output and coronary perfusion pressure, resulting in heart failure.\n\n【11】*   **Cardiac Arrest:** A sudden loss of heart functions due to failure of the electrical activity of the heart can cause a complete cessation of blood flow, resulting in decreased perfusion pressure and cardiac arrest.\n\n【12】Treatment options for such conditions include:\n\n【13】*   **Medications:** Vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can help dilate the coronary arteries, improving blood flow and increasing coronary perfusion pressure. Other medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, may also be used to manage underlying conditions that contribute to low coronary perfusion pressure.\n\n【14】*   **Revascularization Procedures:** In patients with significant coronary artery disease, revascularization procedures, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), may be necessary to restore blood flow to the heart and increase coronary perfusion pressure.\n\n【15】*   **Mechanical Support:** In severe cases of low coronary perfusion pressure, mechanical support devices, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be used to assist the heart in pumping blood and improving the coronary perfusion pressure.\n\n【16】What Is the Significance of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Cerebral perfusion pressure is the pressure difference between mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure. This maintains adequate blood flow to the brain and helps in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. If the threshold falls below the normal values, blood flow to the brain reduces, resulting in ischemia and brain damage.\n\n【18】What Are the Conditions With Low Cerebral Perfusion Pressure?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Cerebral perfusion pressure may decrease due to a reduction in mean arterial pressure, an increase in intracranial pressure, or a combination of both. Some conditions causing low cerebral perfusion pressure include:\n\n【20】*   **Intracranial Hemorrhage:** Bleeding within the skull occurs commonly due to accidents like falls or domestic violence. Injury to the brain causes rupture of the cranial blood vessels and can cause intracranial bleeding.\n\n【21】*   **Traumatic Brain Injury:** This can cause intracranial hemorrhage, thus reducing cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral edema and stroke can also reduce cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\n【22】There are several treatment options for such conditions that aim to restore normal cerebral perfusion pressure by reducing the intracranial pressure and increasing the mean arterial pressure. Treatment options include:\n\n【23】*   **Intravenous Fluids:** Administering fluids can help increase blood volume, which in turn can increase mean arterial pressure.\n\n【24】*   **Vasopressors:** Medications such as norepinephrine or dopamine can be used to increase blood pressure, thereby increasing cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\n【25】*   **Inotropes:** Medications such as Dobutamine can help improve cardiac output and increase MAP.\n\n【26】*   **Sedation:** Sedatives can be used to decrease metabolic demands and lower Intracranial Pressure.\n\n【27】*   **Hyperventilation:** Hyperventilation can help reduce Intracranial pressure by lowering carbon dioxide levels in the blood.\n\n【28】*   **Osmotic Therapy:** Medications such as Mannitol or hypertonic saline can be used to decrease cerebral edema and lower intracranial pressure.\n\n【29】*   **Surgery:** In some cases, surgical interventions such as decompressive craniectomy or removal of a hematoma may be necessary to relieve intracranial pressure.\n\n【30】How Is Perfusion Pressure Measured?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【31】Several tests can be done to evaluate the perfusion pressure. This includes:\n\n【32】*   **Coronary Angiography:** A test that uses X-rays and contrast dye to visualize the coronary arteries and detect blockages or other abnormalities that may affect coronary perfusion.\n\n【33】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Measures the electrical activity of the heart and can detect abnormalities that may indicate poor coronary perfusion.\n\n【34】*   **Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound:** A non-invasive test that uses ultrasound waves to measure blood flow in the brain and detect abnormalities that may indicate poor cerebral perfusion.\n\n【35】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Use of magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the brain and detect abnormalities that may affect cerebral perfusion.\n\n【36】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) scan:** Detects abnormalities that may affect cerebral perfusion.\n\n【37】*   **Invasive Monitoring:** This is the most accurate and direct way to measure perfusion pressure. This uses invasive monitoring techniques that involve inserting a catheter or sensor directly into an artery or vein.\n\n【38】What Are the Complications of Inadequate Perfusion Pressure?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Inadequate perfusion pressure can cause a reduced blood supply to vital organs and lead to severe complications like:\n\n【40】*   Brain damage.\n\n【41】*   Respiratory failure.\n\n【42】*   Septic shock.\n\n【43】*   Limb ischemia.\n\n【44】*   Multiple organ failure.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Maintaining normal perfusion pressure is crucial for the proper functioning of organs and tissues within the body, and any significant variation from normal pressure can cause potentially life-threatening conditions. Understanding and monitoring perfusion pressure are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Coronary Perfusion Pressure  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551531/\n*   Cerebral Perfusion Pressure  \n    https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(17)31105-4/fulltext\n*   Cerebral Perfusion Pressure  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537271/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8e77b16f-6bda-44d5-a7cd-918e85b91efa", "title": "Acid Reflux", "text": "【0】What Is Acid Reflux?\n--------------------\n\n【1】The esophagus is the food pipe connecting the mouth to the stomach. It pushes the food down to the stomach by a rhythmic, involuntary wave-like movement of muscles, a process known as peristalsis.\n\n【2】Once the food is in the stomach, it releases acids such as hydrochloric acid to help digest the food and kill the bacteria. The stomach has special cells lining it to protect it from strong acids.\n\n【3】At the lower end of the esophagus, when it joins the stomach, there is a valve known as the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) that prevents the food from re-entering the esophagus back from the stomach. The special cells that protect the internal lining from acid attack are absent in the esophagus. Hence, if the food does reflux back, it leads to heartburn. The acids then erode the esophagus cells, causing inflammation and pain. The person experiences this as a burning sensation in the chest.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors of Acid Reflux?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Certain medical conditions and lifestyle choices make us more prone to experiencing acid reflux. They are:\n\n【6】**Hiatal Hernia:** A condition when the stomach bulges through the diaphragm into the chest.\n\n【7】**Overeating:** While one-off instances can cause heaviness, bloating, and gas, a long-term habit of overeating causes metabolic disorders such as obesity, heart diseases, and diabetes, apart from acid reflux.\n\n【8】**Lying Down Right After a Meal:** This can cause the meal to come back up in the throat and cause bouts of coughing and pain.\n\n【9】**Obesity:** Being obese can slow down your system and cause many digestion-related issues.\n\n【10】**Consumption of Acidic Foods:** Acidic foods such as citrus fruits, spices, etc. increase the chances of acid reflux in those already prone to hyperacidity. Alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated drinks cause an acidic environment.\n\n【11】**Smoking:** Nicotine in the cigarette is known to relax the LES and cause the acidic stomach contents to trickle back into the esophagus and cause heartburn.\n\n【12】**Pregnancy:** In pregnancy, the hormone progesterone plays an important role in gradually relaxing the smooth muscles to help ease the baby out smoothly at the time of birth. This hormone also causes the valve muscles to relax, thereby allowing the food to reach back into the food pipe. Also, the growing fetus competes for space with the stomach forcing the acid contents back up.\n\n【13】**Drugs:** Certain drugs such as NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are notorious for causing heartburn.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Acid Reflux Diseases?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】**Heartburn:**\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>How to Treat Heartburn?</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>I have ulceration on my penis years after a risky exposure.

Many patients often confuse it with chest pain due to a heart attack.\n\n【22】**Bitter Taste in the Mouth:**\n\n【23】Acid reflux can cause a foul and rancid taste in the mouth, giving a very unpleasant sensation.\n\n【24】**Bloating:**\n\n【25】It is a sensation of the belly feeling swollen and full, especially after eating.\n\n【26】**Belching or Burping:**\n\n【27】It is the forceful expulsion of gas from the upper stomach through the mouth.\n\n【28】**Nausea:**\n\n【29】Nausea is an uneasiness or unsettled feeling that gives a sensation you are about to vomit.\n\n【30】**Dryness of the Throat and Cough:**\n\n【31】Acid reflux can pass beyond the upper esophageal sphincter and go into the throat, causing dryness, hoarseness of voice, and cough.\n\n【32】**Dental Erosion:**\n\n【33】When the stomach acid contents regurgitate back into the mouth, they can erode the teeth' enamel and dentin layers, causing cavities and decay.\n\n【34】What Are the Complications of Reflux Disease?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【35】**Ulcers:**\n\n【36】Over some time, reflux can cause a break in the stomach's protective lining, causing intense pain.\n\n【37】**Internal Bleeding:**\n\n【38】If an ulcer perforates the entire layers of the stomach, there can be internal bleeding and infection.\n\n【39】**Esophageal Stricture:**\n\n【40】It is a scar formation and narrowing of the food pipe due to the acid effect.\n\n【41】**Barrett's Esophagus:**\n\n【42】It is a serious complication of repeated exposure to stomach acid contents. In this condition, the cells lining the food pipe change to abnormal cells resembling the intestines.\n\n【43】**Esophageal Cancer:**\n\n【44】It is a malignant change of the cells of the food pipe and occurs in a small percentage of those with recurrent exposure to acid.\n\n【45】How Is Acid Reflux Disease Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【46】Since heartburn causes pain in the chest, it is often confused to be a heart attack. Therefore, it is diagnosed by carrying out tests such as:\n\n【47】**X-Ray:**\n\n【48】An X-ray of your esophagus and stomach may be taken to visualize the internal organs structurally.\n\n【49】**Biopsy:**\n\n【50】A tissue sample may be taken for examination by passing a thin tube through the nose into your esophagus.\n\n【51】**Barium Swallow:**\n\n【52】It is a special X-ray procedure where you will be asked to swallow a barium solution before taking the radiograph to visualize the internal organs and problems better.\n\n【53】**pH Monitoring:**\n\n【54】In this method, a thin tube with a pH-sensitive end is passed into the esophagus to detect the pH level of your insides. It is left in place for 24 hours, and the doctor interprets the results after this period. A newer, wireless method is also available, which is more convenient for the patient.\n\n【55】How Is Acid Reflux Be Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【56】Treatment includes a combination of lifestyle modifications and medications. Sometimes, surgery may be indicated if the medication does not provide relief.\n\n【57】**1\\. Lifestyle Modification:**\n\n【58】*   Prefer smaller and lighter meals to heavy ones.\n*   Leave a gap of two to three hours between meal and bedtime.\n*   Avoid triggers such as alcohol, spicy food, and coffee.\n*   Stop smoking.\n*   Elevate the head of the bed by placing blocks under the legs on the head side.\n*   Avoid tight-fitting clothes.\n*   Avoid night-time snacking.\n*   Exercise regularly and stay physically active.\n*   Regular medications that you take may be causing your heartburn and need to be changed after consulting with your doctor.\n\n【59】**2\\. Medication:**\n\n【60】Antacids are usually available over-the-counter in the form of chewable tablets as well as liquids. They help relieve mild symptoms. They neutralize the excess acids in the stomach. They are mostly composed of a combination of aluminum, magnesium, and calcium. Apart from this, prescription drugs are available in two types such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors.\n\n【61】*   **H2 Blockers:** It is a class of drugs that help decrease the production of stomach acids. H2 blockers include Cimetidine, Ranitidine, and Famotidine. They start acting slowly compared to antacids but provide more lasting relief from acidity.\n*   **Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):** PPIs are medications that block acid production. They are the most effective medication and are recommended for patients with a more severe and frequent form of acid reflux. Some commonly prescribed PPIs include Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, and Rabeprazole.\n\n【62】**3\\. Surgery:**\n\n【63】If medication does not help or if symptoms have lasted very long, the doctor may recommend surgical procedures such as:\n\n【64】*   **Fundoplication:** In this procedure, the surgeon tightens the LES (lower esophageal sphincter) to help prevent reflux. It is usually done as a laparoscopic procedure. The uppermost portion of the stomach is known as the fundus. It is cut and sewn in such a way as to tighten the valve (lower esophageal sphincter). If a person suffers from reflux due to a hiatal hernia, the same procedure will also be used to provide relief.\n\n【65】*   **Linx Device:** A small ring made up of titanium beads with magnetic cores is surgically implanted at the stomach junction and food pipe (LES) to help tighten the valve. It keeps it closed so that the stomach contents do not regurgitate back into the esophagus even under pressure from gastric contents.\n\n【66】Know the Facts About Heartburn -\n--------------------------------\n\n【67】What Is the Best Way to Manage Acid Reflux in the Long Run?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Hence, although common, acid reflux is a troublesome condition that causes discomfort and pain in the short-term and more serious complications in the long term. Often lifestyle modifications are the first-suggested modes of treatment. If lifestyle changes, along with over-the-counter medications, do not help, and if symptoms last two weeks or longer, the doctor suggests a stronger prescription medication.\n\n【69】Irrespective of the severity of your condition, it is important to change your eating pattern. Many have reported that shifting to a healthier diet and adding physical exercise brings about positive changes.\n\n【70】**Conclusion:**\n\n【71】Acid reflux is a chronic digestive disease. These can be treated with OTC antacids, and some lifestyle changes can usually create relief. But when the heartburn occurs more than twice a week, and no lifestyle changes are giving you relief, you may be dealing with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). If left untreated, it can cause problems such as ulcers, strictures, and even cancer.\n\n【72】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【73】* * *\n\n【74】#### **1.**删除换行**How to Get Relief From Acid Reflux?**\n\n【75】\\- Eat small qualities.

{"seq_id": "acf0aec0-38ed-4dfe-8006-88af35756a3b", "title": "Friedreich’s Ataxia- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Friedreich’s Ataxia- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is Friedreich's Ataxia?\n----------------------------\n\n【1】Friedreich's ataxia is a rare, inherited disorder that damages the spinal cord, peripheral nerves (part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord), and cerebellum part of the brain. This disease has been mainly observed to develop in children and teenagers. It slowly gets worse over time. As the disease progresses, it causes awkward, unsteady movements and nerve injury leading to loss of feeling. Apart from nervous system symptoms, people with this disorder may also have other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\n【2】This rare condition is named after a German doctor, Nicholaus Friedreich, who discovered it during the 1860s. Ataxia is a term for lack of muscle control. It causes gait (pattern of movement) problems.\n\n【3】Friedreich’s ataxia affects around one in 50,000 people throughout the world. It is the most common disorder in a group of related disorders known as hereditary ataxias.\n\n【4】What Causes Friedreich's Ataxia?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited or hereditary disease. It is caused by a defect in a gene called FXN. This gene can be passed down in a family. However, it is a recessive genetic disorder. This means that a copy of the defective gene must be passed down from both parents to get affected by this disease. The FXN gene carries instructions for a protein called frataxin, and mutations in this gene result in reduced energy production in cells of the nervous system and the heart.\n\n【6】People having Friedreich’s ataxia running in their families are at greater risk of developing this disease. However, suppose the defective gene is passed down only from one parent. In that case, the person only becomes a carrier of the disease, meaning they just carry the gene but do not usually experience any symptoms of the disease.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Friedreich's Ataxia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The severity and sequence of symptoms in Friedreich's ataxia vary significantly from one person to another. The first symptom usually noticed is ataxia (loss of balance and coordination). However, other symptoms, including heart problems, may appear later.\n\n【9】**1\\. Ataxia, Weakness, and Spasticity:**\n\n【10】Ataxia usually affects the legs and torso, leading to frequent tripping and irregular walking patterns. As the disease progresses, it causes a decline in balance and coordination and weak muscles in the legs that are easily fatigued, making walking even more difficult.\n\n【11】Several years later, Friedreich's ataxia may cause difficulty with speech, leading to words coming out in a slow and jerky pattern. This problem is called dysarthria which is caused by weakness of the tongue and other facial muscles or difficulty in controlling these muscles. This is not related to the impairment of intellect or language skills.\n\n【12】Some people might develop difficulty in swallowing, which leads to the entry of food into the airway and causes choking or infections in the respiratory tract.\n\n【13】Spasticity (muscle tightness) is another complaint of people with Friedreich’s ataxia and may be especially prominent in late-onset cases.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Why do I feel my entire body and the head shake from inside?</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Urinary Retention in Babies - Types, Causes, Clinical Features, and Management</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Laryngeal Tremor - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【19】**2\\. Sensory Impairment:**\n\n【20】Loss of tactile (touch) sensation is often a fundamental symptom of Friedreich’s ataxia that is mainly detected through laboratory testing. The sense of vibration and position (awareness of the position of the body in space) get affected earlier in the disease, and perception of light touch, temperature, and pain may be affected later. Many people with Friedreich’s ataxia might also have diminished or absent reflexes in their legs, such as the knee-jerk reflex. A small fraction of people might also have a loss of hearing or visual impairment.\n\n【21】**3\\. Skeletal Abnormalities:**\n\n【22】Specific skeletal abnormalities are commonly seen in Friedreich’s ataxia. These include:\n\n【23】*   Inversion (inward turning) of the feet.\n\n【24】*   Pes cavus, shortened foot with a high arch.\n\n【25】These conditions can lead to painful blisters and calluses in those people who continue\n\n【26】to walk.\n\n【27】*   The curvature of the spine, or scoliosis. It can be painful, and because it alters the shape of the chest cavity, it also interferes with breathing.\n\n【28】**4\\. Cardiac Difficulties:**\n\n【29】Heart failure accounts for the leading cause of death in Friedreich’s ataxia. Heart abnormalities occur in about 75 percent of people with Friedreich’s ataxia, but the severity of the disease varies widely.\n\n【30】Some abnormalities are so mild that they can only be noticed through specialized laboratory testing, while others may have life-threatening complications.\n\n【31】These include:\n\n【32】*   **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy-** Enlargement of the heart muscle that shrinks the blood-filled chambers of the heart and decreases its ability to pump, leading to heart failure. This is the most commonly seen heart abnormality in Friedreich’s ataxia.\n\n【33】*   **Arrhythmia-** Too fast or too slow (abnormal) heartbeat. It can be life-threatening.\n\n【34】*   Extreme fatigue.\n\n【35】*   Pain in the chest.\n\n【36】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【37】*   Lightheadedness.\n\n【38】*   Heart palpitations (feeling of the heart beating too fast).\n\n【39】*   Pooling of blood in the ankles.\n\n【40】It is suggested that people with Friedreich’s ataxia should have regular checkups with a cardiologist.\n\n【41】**5\\. Diabetes:**\n\n【42】About ten percent of people affected with Friedreich's ataxia have diabetes, and about 20 percent have pre-diabetes, another form of diabetes called glucose intolerance. Both occur due to decreased production of insulin by the pancreas, which helps in the storage and utilization of sugar (glucose).\n\n【43】How Is Friedreich's Ataxia Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【44】Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is typically seen in childhood, between 10 and 15 years of age, but also has been diagnosed from 2 to 50 years of age. Later onset usually has a less severe course.\n\n【45】The diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia typically begins with a physical exam followed by the assessment of the personal and family history.\n\n【46】Other tests may include-\n\n【47】*   Test to check for reflexes, balance, coordination, and nerve sensitivity (electromyography).\n\n【48】*   Blood tests help identify treatable conditions causing ataxia.\n\n【49】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan.\n\n【50】*   Nerve conduction studies (nerve conduction velocity test) use electrical impulses to check nerve activity.\n\n【51】*   Heart tests to evaluate heart function.\n\n【52】*   Genetic tests to find the defective gene that causes the disorder.\n\n【53】How Is Friedreich's Ataxia Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【54】Currently, there is no cure for Friedreich’s ataxia, and the treatment aims to target specific symptoms rather than the disease itself.\n\n【55】These include-\n\n【56】*   Braces that support and strengthen the arms, legs, feet, and spine.\n\n【57】*   Physical therapy helps stretch tight muscles and enhance flexibility.\n\n【58】*   Speech therapy helps re-train the tongue and the facial muscles to improve speech and swallowing.\n\n【59】*   Surgery to treat the deformities of the feet and scoliosis (curvature of the spine).\n\n【60】*   Certain drugs such as ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers for heart symptoms, and insulin therapy for diabetes.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Friedreich's ataxia is a genetic neuromuscular disease that affects the nerves and muscles and causes heart problems and diabetes. There is no permanent cure for this condition, but the symptoms can be managed effectively by specific treatment options involving therapy, medications, and surgery.\n\n【63】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【64】* * *\n\n【65】#### **1.**删除换行**How Long Can a Person Live with Friedreich's Ataxia?**\n\n【66】Friedreich's ataxia is a progressive genetic disease that affects the nervous system and can lead to impaired movement, speech, and other complications. The life expectancy of individuals with Friedreich's ataxia can vary depending on various factors such as the age of onset, severity of symptoms, and overall health. However, on average, people with Friedreich's ataxia typically have a reduced life expectancy, and many may not survive beyond their 30s or 40s. Therefore, it's important to note that early diagnosis and management of symptoms can improve quality of life and potentially extend lifespan.\n\n【67】#### **2.**删除换行**Is it Possible to Treat Friedreich's ataxia?**\n\n【68】Unfortunately, Friedreich's ataxia is a genetic disorder, and there is currently no known cure. However, treatments and therapies can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and slow disease progression. For example, physical therapy and assistive devices can help with mobility and balance issues, while medications may be used to address other symptoms such as heart problems or diabetes. Researchers are also actively developing new treatments and potential cures for Friedreich's ataxia through various avenues, such as gene therapy and drug development.\n\n【69】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Friedreich's Ataxia?**\n\n【70】Some common early signs and symptoms may include the following:  \n - Frequent tripping or stumbling.  \n - Difficulty with balance and coordination.  \n - Impaired muscle control, particularly in the arms and legs.  \n - Slurred or unclear speech.  \n - Vision or hearing problems.  \n - Fatigue or weakness.\n\n【71】#### **4.**删除换行**Who Are Most Commonly Affected by Friedreich's ataxia?**\n\n【72】Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Friedreich's ataxia affects both males and females, and it is more common in people of European descent. However, the condition is relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.\n\n【73】#### **5.**删除换行**Is Friedreich's Ataxia Causes Pain?**\n\n【74】Friedreich's ataxia is not typically considered painful, but some individuals may experience pain or discomfort due to other associated symptoms or complications. For example, individuals with Friedreich's ataxia may experience muscle weakness, spasms, or contractures, which can cause discomfort or pain. They may also be at increased risk for developing conditions such as scoliosis, which can be painful.\n\n【75】#### **6.**删除换行**What Are the Trigger Factors for Friedreich's Ataxia?**\n\n【76】Genetic mutations primarily cause Friedreich's ataxia, some environmental and lifestyle factors may potentially worsen symptoms or accelerate disease progression. For example, individuals with Friedreich's ataxia may be more sensitive to oxidative stress, which can be caused by factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and exposure to toxins. In addition, physical or emotional stress may exacerbate symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia in some individuals.\n\n【77】#### **7.**删除换行**Can Friedreich's Ataxia Patients Have Children?**\n\n【78】Individuals with Friedreich's ataxia can have children, but there is a risk of passing on the condition to their offspring. Friedreich's ataxia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning a child must inherit two copies of the mutated FXN gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. With each pregnancy, there is a 25% chance that a child will develop Friedreich's ataxia if both parents are carriers of the mutated gene. Genetic counseling can guide on risks and options for family planning.\n\n【79】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Age of Friedreich's Ataxia Start?**\n\n【80】Friedreich's ataxia usually starts in childhood or early adolescence, typically between the ages of 5 and 15. The symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia tend to develop gradually and worsen over time, and the condition can significantly impact an individual's mobility, coordination, and quality of life. However, the age at which symptoms first appear can vary widely between individuals, and some people may only develop symptoms later in life. Additionally, the progression of Friedreich's ataxia can be highly variable, with some individuals experiencing a more rapid decline in function than others.\n\n【81】#### **9.**删除换行**How Does Friedreich's Ataxia Affect the Brain?**\n\n【82】Friedreich's ataxia primarily affects the nervous system, including the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and cerebellum. While the condition does not directly affect the brain, it can indirectly affect cognitive function. Individuals with Friedreich's ataxia may sometimes experience cognitive or behavioral changes, such as difficulty with attention, concentration, or executive function. These changes are related to the condition's impact on the cerebellum, which plays a key role in motor coordination and connects to cognitive function.\n\n【83】#### **10.**删除换行**Is Friedreich Ataxia a Type of Muscular Dystrophy?**\n\n【84】Friedreich's ataxia is not a form of muscular dystrophy, although it can cause muscle weakness and atrophy. Both Friedreich's ataxia and muscular dystrophy are genetic disorders that affect muscle function, but they are caused by different genetic mutations and affect different body parts. A muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that primarily affect the muscles, causing progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. In contrast, Friedreich's ataxia primarily affects the nervous system, including the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and cerebellum. This can cause progressive movement, coordination, balance, and speech difficulty.\n\n【85】#### **11.**删除换行**Does Friedreich's Ataxia Affect Speech?**\n\n【86】Yes, Friedreich's ataxia can affect speech. The condition can cause various motor and neurological symptoms that can impact an individual's ability to speak clearly and effectively. As Friedreich's ataxia progresses, individuals may experience a tremor or jerky movements in the muscles that control the mouth and throat, making it difficult to articulate words or control the volume and tone of their voice. They may also experience difficulty breathing, affecting their ability to sustain longer phrases or speak fluidly.\n\n【87】#### **12.**删除换行**Is Friedreich's Ataxia Can Affect the Eyes?**\n\n【88】Friedreich's ataxia can affect the eyes in a few different ways, although vision problems are not typically the primary symptom of the condition. One common eye-related symptom of Friedreich's ataxia is nystagmus, which is an involuntary movement of the eyes that can cause them to appear to \"bounce\" or \"jerk\" back and forth. Nystagmus can make it difficult to maintain visual focus on a particular object, especially when tracking moving objects or reading.\n\n【89】#### **13.**删除换行**Can Friedreich's Ataxia Disturb the Swallowing?**\n\n【90】Yes, Friedreich's ataxia can affect swallowing. As the condition progresses, it can cause weakness or spasticity in the muscles involved in swallowing, making it difficult to move food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. In addition, individuals with Friedreich's ataxia may experience a loss of coordination or control in the muscles involved in swallowing, leading to difficulties with timing, coordination, and accuracy. This can cause food or liquid to go down the \"wrong pipe\" and enter the airway, leading to choking or aspiration pneumonia.\n\n【91】#### **14.**删除换行**How Can Friedreich Ataxia Affect the Heart?**\n\n【92】Friedreich's ataxia can affect the heart in several ways. The most common cardiac manifestation of the condition is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that can impair its ability to pump blood effectively. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause various symptoms, including shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and palpitations. In severe cases, it can lead to heart failure or arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.\n\n【93】#### **15.**删除换行**What Are the Neuromuscular Disorders, and Give Examples?**\n\n【94】Many neuromuscular disorders can affect the nerves, muscles, or the junction between nerves and muscles. Some examples of neuromuscular disorders include:  \n - Muscular Dystrophy - a genetic disorder causing muscle weakness and wasting.  \n - Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.  \n - Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease - inherited disorders causing peripheral nerve damage and muscle weakness.  \n - Myasthenia Gravis - an autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness and fatigue.  \n - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - is a neurodegenerative disease causing muscle weakness, spasticity, and paralysis.  \n - Guillain-Barre Syndrome - an autoimmune disorder causing nerve inflammation and muscle weakness.  \n - Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system, causing various symptoms.  \n - Friedreich's Ataxia - a genetic disorder affecting the nervous system and causing muscle weakness, coordination problems, and cardiac complications.  \n - Peripheral Neuropathy - a disorder affecting the peripheral nerves and causing numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities.\n\n【95】#### **16.**删除换行**Is Friedreich's ataxia a Type of neurodegenerative disease?**\n\n【96】Yes, Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive damage and loss of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This degeneration leads to various symptoms, including muscle weakness, coordination problems, and complications affecting the heart and other organs. The degeneration of nerve cells in Friedreich's ataxia is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the production of a protein called frataxin, which is essential for the proper function of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells. The loss of frataxin leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and, ultimately, the death of nerve cells in various nervous system regions.\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【98】无关删除-1:<u>*   Friedreich's Ataxia  \n    https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/f/friedreichs-ataxia.html\n*   Friedreich's Ataxia  \n    https://www.mda.org/disease/friedreichs-ataxia/signs-and-symptoms\n*   Friedreich's Ataxia  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/friedreich-ataxia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A sudden cardiac arrest is uncommon in children. In children, cardiac arrest occurs as a secondary event precipitated by a different set of causes. It occurs after a deterioration of the circulatory or respiratory function leading to respiratory failure with hypoxia (absence of oxygen in the tissues), acidosis, and decreased blood flow to the tissues or hemodynamic collapse. Respiratory failure resulting in lower than normal oxygen levels in the blood, increased carbon dioxide concentration in the blood, and an exceedingly acidic environment is the most common pathway for cardiac arrest in young children.\n\n【2】When Is Pediatric Resuscitation Indicated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Pediatric resuscitation is indicated in the following cases:\n\n【4】*   If the child becomes cyanotic or bluish discoloration of the skin due to reduced oxygen supply.\n\n【5】*   If the child is asystolic (heart failure).\n\n【6】*   Heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute.\n\n【7】*   Shock.\n\n【8】How Is Pediatric Resuscitation Carried Out?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【9】**Pre-cardiac Arrest**\n\n【10】Slow heart rate in a child is a sign of cardiac arrest, and infants, neonates, and young kids are more likely to develop bradycardia or slow heart rate due to lower than normal oxygen levels in the body (hypoxemia), whereas older children have a tendency towards increased heart rate (tachycardia). An infant or young child with a heart rate of less than 60 per minute and signs of poor perfusion, which does not rise with ventilatory support, should undergo cardiac compressions.\n\n【11】**Chest Compression**\n\n【12】During chest compressions in infants and children weighing less than 55 kg, the chest should be compressed one-third of the anteroposterior diameter, which is around four to five cm. In adolescents or children weighing more than 55 kg, the compression should be around five to six cm. The compression rate in infants and children is 100 to 120 compressions per minute.\n\n【13】**Medications**\n\n【14】Epinephrine is the drug of choice after proper ventilation and oxygenation and should be immediately administered after the establishment of intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) access. 0.01 mg/kg of Epinephrine should be administered intravenously (IV), which can be repeated every three to five minutes. According to the present guidelines, immediate intraosseous access and Epinephrine administration for non-shockable rhythms should be given as the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the survival rate in children is related to the speed at which the first dose of Epinephrine is received.\n\n【15】If defibrillation or the use of electrical current for establishing the normal heart rhythm is unsuccessful after the administration of Epinephrine, then Amiodarone 5 mg/kg can be administered intravenously. It can be repeated up to two times for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). Lidocaine can be given at a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously, followed by a maintenance infusion of 20 to 50 mcg/kg/minute in case of unavailability of Amiodarone.\n\n【16】**Blood Pressure**\n\n【17】Blood pressure in children should be measured with an appropriate-sized cuff. Direct invasive arterial blood pressure should be monitored in severely compromised children. Children maintain their blood pressure longer because of stronger compensatory mechanisms such as increased systemic vascular resistance and increased heart rate. Once low blood pressure occurs, cardiorespiratory arrest follows rapidly. Treatment should be started when compensatory signs of shock such as cool extremities, increased heart rate, capillary refill of more than two seconds, and poor peripheral pulses are present but before low blood pressure develops.\n\n【18】**Equipment**\n\n【19】The size of the equipment, drug dosage, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation parameters all change with the age and weight of the children. Size-variable equipment includes ventilation bags, defibrillator paddles or electrode pads, masks, airways, endotracheal tubes, laryngoscope blades, and suction catheters. Weight should be correctly measured, or the commercially available measuring tapes calibrated to read the weight based on body length can be used. Some tapes come with the recommended drug dosage and equipment size for each weight.\n\n【20】**Management of Temperature**\n\n【21】Infants and kids are susceptible to loss of heat because of a larger surface area relative to body mass and less subcutaneous tissue. A neutral temperature is important during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and post-resuscitation. Hypothermia with a temperature lesser than 35 degrees Celsius makes resuscitation difficult. For children in a coma, the American Heart Association and American Association of Pediatrics guidelines advise therapeutic hypothermia of 32 to 36 degrees Celsius or normothermia of 36 to 37.5 degrees Celsius. Fever should be treated promptly.\n\n【22】**Airway and Ventilation**\n\n【23】The anatomy of the upper airway is different in children. The head is large with a small face, lower jaw, and nose, and the neck is relatively short. The tongue is large as compared to the mouth, and the larynx or sound box lies higher in the neck and is placed more anteriorly. The epiglottis is long, and some part of the wind pipe or trachea is inferior to the vocal cords, thus allowing the use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes. In infants and young kids, a straight laryngoscope blade gives a better picture of the vocal cords than a curved blade because the larynx is placed anterior, and the epiglottis is more floppy. In case of the absence of an advanced airway in infants and children undergoing resuscitation, the compression: ventilation ratio is 30:2. This is in contrast to adults where the compression: ventilation ratio is 30:2. With an advanced airway, usually one breath is given every six seconds (ten breaths per minutes) for infants, children, and adults.\n\n【24】**Defibrillation**\n\n【25】About 15 to 20 percent of pediatric cardiac arrests have ventricular defibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). The medication Vasopressin is not indicated. During defibrillation, the energy dose is less than what is used in adults. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) with adult cables may be used for children as young as one year old, but an automated external defibrillator with pediatric cables is preferred for children between the age group of one to eight years.\n\n【26】What Are the Complications of Pediatric Resuscitation?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The long-term treatment is restricted to child-specific centers. ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) or ECPR (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be considered early for in-hospital cardiac arrests.\n\n【28】Age is usually correlated with improved post-resuscitation outcomes, and post-arrest brain injury remains a cause of mortality and morbidity in young children. Therefore, electroencephalograms and seizure prophylaxis are recommended for such patients after the return of spontaneous circulation.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】Pediatric and neonatal resuscitation involves approaches to achieve the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), which is the same as adult cardiorespiratory resuscitation but requires special considerations with regard to medication, procedures, and aftercare. Cardiac arrest in children is rarely abrupt and is the end result of deterioration in respiratory function. The survival rate in pediatric patients with cardiac arrests has increased from 9 to 41 percent. These improvements are caused due to earlier detection and management of critical conditions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and medical emergency teams trained in acute resuscitation of pediatric patients.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pediatric Resuscitation  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.95.8.2185\n*   Pediatric And Neonatal Resuscitation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572069/?report=classic</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Red blood cells provide oxygen throughout the body for organs, tissues, and cells to maintain health and function effectively.\n\n【2】The MCV test is counted among a group of tests called the red blood cell index that evaluates certain characteristic features of red blood cell function. The MCV test also helps determine whether the red blood cells are too large or too small. The shift in red blood cell volume affects oxygen distribution throughout the body and can signify blood-related issues like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, or other illnesses.\n\n【3】What Is an MCV Blood Test?\n--------------------------\n\n【4】MCV (mean corpuscular volume) represents the average particle volume. The MCV blood test measures the average size of red blood cells in a blood sample. The MCV blood test is often part of a complete blood count, a routine screening test that measures various components of the blood, including red blood cells. This test shows the size of the red blood cells produced in the blood. In particular, red blood cells must be balanced and produced in adequate amounts.\n\n【5】Why Do I Need an MCV Blood Test?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】The health care provider may order a complete blood count, including an MCV test, as part of a routine checkup or if any blood disorder manifestations are present. The symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Fatigue or tiredness.\n\n【8】*   Abnormal bleeding or bruising.\n\n【9】*   Cold extremities (hands and feet).\n\n【10】*   Pale or lighter skin.\n\n【11】What Happens During an MCV Blood Test?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】The blood sample is usually taken from a vein in any of the arms using a small needle. The blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. There might be a little discomfort when the needle goes in or out.\n\n【13】How to Prepare for the MCV Test?\n--------------------------------\n\n【14】There are no special preparations required for an MCV blood test. However, if the health care provider has ordered more tests on the blood sample, like the thyroid profile, the patient may be restricted from eating or drinking for a few hours before the test. The health care provider will inform the patient if there are any special precautions to follow.\n\n【15】Are There Any Risks to the Test?\n--------------------------------\n\n【16】There is minimal risk associated with this blood test. The patient may have minimal pain or bruise at the needle's location, but most symptoms quickly disappear.\n\n【17】What Do the Results of an MCV Test Mean?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【18】If the results show that the red blood cells are smaller than average, it may indicate:\n\n【19】*   Iron deficiency anemia or other types of anemia.\n\n【20】    *   Anemia is said to be present when the blood contains a lower average amount of red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent form of anemia.\n\n【21】*   Thalassemia is an inherited disorder that can cause severe anemia.\n\n【22】If the results show that the red blood cells are larger than average, it may indicate the following:\n\n【23】*   A vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【24】*   Folic acid deficiency (another type of vitamin B).\n\n【25】*   Liver diseases.\n\n【26】*   Hypothyroidism.\n\n【27】If the MCV levels are not within the normal range, it does not necessarily mean that the patient has a medical problem needing treatment. Diet, activity level, medicines, a woman's menstrual cycle, and other considerations can affect the results. Talk to the health care professional to get the results interpreted.\n\n【28】Is There Anything Else to Know About an MCV Blood Test?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Suppose the health care provider suspects the patient has anemia or another blood disorder. In that case, they may order additional tests of the red blood cells, including a red blood cell count and hemoglobin measurements.\n\n【30】What Does an Abnormal MCV Level Mean?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【31】Remember that the level of red blood cells should be within the normal range to perform its function correctly. MCV levels will also determine if the patient is anemic. But aside from that, it would also interpret the reason for the abnormal red blood cell count and how to proceed with the treatment.\n\n【32】There are two abnormal findings seen in an MCV blood test. First, the count could be either too high or too low. A drop in the red blood cell volume is often associated with microcytosis (anemia due to smaller red blood cells). A low MCV would often result in tiredness and fatigue. These results are because the amount of oxygen delivered to the cells is too low as well. The opposite of this is macrocytosis. When too many red blood cells are generated, they are more prone to break on the tiny capillaries and might cause severe damage.\n\n【33】The MCV blood test value is measured in femtoliter and has a normal range of 80 to 100 fL. The normal range of MCV count in different age groups is as follows:\n\n【34】*   Newborn - 106 fL.\n\n【35】*   Three months of age - 95 fL.\n\n【36】*   One-year-old - 70 to 86 fL.\n\n【37】*   Three to six years - 73 to 89 fL.\n\n【38】*   10 to 12 years - 77 to 91 fL.\n\n【39】**High MCV Means -**\n\n【40】Different things or conditions may cause a high MCV. Knowing these are essential to avoid developing an increased red blood cell count, which include -\n\n【41】*   **Decreased Vitamin B12 Intake -** Vitamin B12 is one of the essential components required to form red blood cells and DNA. Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur due to excessive alcohol consumption and poor diet. If the doctor identifies that the patient has a little amount of vitamin B12 in the body, they are usually advised to take supplements to maintain the balance.\n\n【42】*   **Deficiency in Folic Acid -** The vitamin folic acid is also imperative in producing the appropriate red blood cells. Therefore, if the test indicates a low folic acid level, the patient may take the prescribed medicine to recover. One of these would be the replacement therapy of a 5 mg folic acid tablet to be consumed daily for at least four months.\n\n【43】*   **Increased Alcohol Intake -** If a person consumes excess alcohol than the acceptable quantity, it will damage the storage of vitamin B12. This would cause a high MCV.\n\n【44】**Low MCV Means** -\n\n【45】A low MCV count is more common than a high MCV. Therefore, knowing its causes is essential to providing the correct treatment, such as -\n\n【46】*   **Prolonged Blood Loss -** This condition usually arises in women with heavy bleeding during menstruation. This condition would also result in low iron levels, thus affecting the MCV count. If this happens often, prescribed pills or medicine should be asked by the doctor to remedy the problem.\n\n【47】*   **Anemia -** One of the significant components of hemoglobin is iron, so when a person has a meager iron level, the decrease in MCV value is inevitable. If anemia is confirmed with the laboratory tests, the doctor recommends an iron-rich diet to enhance the iron intake and may even prescribe supplements as an adjunct therapy.\n\n【48】*   **Thalassemia -** Unfortunately, this diagnosis is inherited and cannot be avoided once it is a part of your genes. The body cannot produce the correct amount of hemoglobin in this condition. The only treatment option available to treat thalassemia is bone marrow transplantation.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】MCV value helps diagnose anemia and other medical illnesses, particularly blood disorders. The healthcare provider will consider MCV alongside other things in a CBC to get a complete picture. In addition to anemia, MCV outside of the expected range can suggest poisoning, vitamin deficiency, and liver disease. MCV can also help determine a prognosis for certain cancers and chronic kidney disease. In addition, it may be used to evaluate cognitive function in older adults.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Mean Corpuscular Volume  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545275/\n*   MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/mcv-mean-corpuscular-volume/\n*   Understanding the complete blood count with differential  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12710004/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This disorder contains abnormally high levels of porphyrin precursors, and often porphyrins, due to a deficiency of certain enzymes essential for the formation (synthesis) of heme, parts of hemoglobin, and other heme proteins. Symptoms associated with different forms of porphyria are various. People with one type of porphyria do not develop a different kind of porphyria.\n\n【2】Porphyria is generally divided into two groups: liver type and erythropoiesis type. Porphyrins and porphyrin precursors and related substances are over-derived from the liver in the liver type and the bone marrow in the erythropoietic type. Porphyria with cutaneous symptoms is sometimes called cutaneous porphyria. Acute porphyria denotes porphyria, which can be accompanied by sudden pain attacks and other neurological symptoms. Most forms of porphyria are hereditary metabolic disorders. HCP is an acute liver-type porphyria.\n\n【3】What Is Hereditary Coproporphyria?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) belongs to porphyria, a disease associated with heme metabolism defects that lead to the hypersecretion of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. It is an inherited autosomal chromosome.\n\n【5】Though HCP is a rare disorder yet, it affects both genders in equal numbers. However, its manifestations are more commonly seen in females. The definite incidence and prevalence of HCP are still unspecified.\n\n【6】What Causes Hereditary Coproporphyria?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】Mutations in the CPOX gene predispose individuals to HCP. The CPOX gene produces the enzyme coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO). Therefore, mutations in the CPOX gene can reduce the activity of CPO in the body (about 50 % reduction), resulting in inadequate heme production and the accumulation of CPO precursors in the liver.\n\n【8】Many of the triggers for acute attacks increase the need for heme, raising concerns about CPO deficiency. Mutations in the genes underlying HCP limit the production of heme and increase the accumulation of porphyrin precursors in the body. Also, causing acute attacks. The problematic drug is not metabolized or eliminated from the body, causing acute attacks.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>ALAD Deficiency Porphyria - Causes, Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Can I take Carisoprodol as I am allergic to Ibuprofen?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>I feel tired and get upper abdominal pain if I eat my lunch late.

Pain in these areas is often the first sign of an attack.\n\n【17】*   At least 48 hours of nausea.\n\n【18】*   Family history of newly developed seizures.\n\n【19】*   Hyponatremia (occurs when the sodium level in the blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte and helps regulate the amount of water in and around the cell).\n\n【20】*   Porphyria (accumulation of certain chemicals associated with proteins in red blood cells).\n\n【21】Chronic cutaneous porphyria is suspected in individuals with blisters and fragility of the sun-exposed skin, resulting in depigmented scars. However, skin signs appear only in a few heterozygotes, even during acute relapse.\n\n【22】How Is Hereditary Coproporphyria Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The HCP diagnosis is based on identifying characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient and family history, thorough clinical evaluation, and various specialized tests.\n\n【24】*   The observation of reddish-brown urine free of blood indicates but is not conclusive acute porphyria. Patients with HCP may have elevated levels of urinary porphyrins, such as coproporphyrins, but it is not confirmatory (it can also be associated with other conditions).\n\n【25】*   Tolerance to drugs such as oral contraceptives also indicates acute porphyria.\n\n【26】*   Screening tests help diagnose HCP by measuring the levels of specific porphyrin precursors in the urine (such as porphobilinogen \\[PBG\\] and delta-aminolevulinic acid \\[ALA\\]). However, further testing is needed to exclude HCP from variegated or acute intermittent porphyria.\n\n【27】*   Fecal CP analysis is beneficial in making a diagnosis. This test can detect significantly elevated coproporphyrin levels in stool samples. This is a characteristic of HCP and confirms the HCP diagnosis.\n\n【28】*   Molecular genetic testing can identify the mutations in the CPOX gene. Therefore, families of people who favor the CPOX mutation may be advised to test for the mutation.\n\n【29】*   HCPs need to be counseled to contain the risk of future acute attacks.\n\n【30】How Is Hereditary Coproporphyria Treated?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【31】Treatment of HCP is based on the specific symptoms presented by each individual.\n\n【32】*   The first step includes ceasing medications that can potentially aggravate HCP or cause an attack. All triggering factors should be eliminated or changed. In addition, ensuring proper intake of carbohydrates, either orally or intravenously.\n\n【33】*   Treatment of HCP includes medicines that treat specific symptoms, such as certain analgesics (for pain), anxiety medicines, blood pressure-lowering medicines, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, and restlessness. An affected individual may also need medication to treat an infection that may occur simultaneously with the attack (co-infection).\n\n【34】*   Seizures may require treatment with antiepileptic drugs (anticonvulsants), but many of the standard options can exacerbate the seizures and are contraindicated. Short-acting Benzodiazepines or magnesium can be prescribed. Gabapentin and Propofol are safe choices for long-term seizure control.\n\n【35】*   For individuals who develop skin complications, avoiding sunlight is beneficial and may involve using two layers of clothing. However, avoiding sunlight can lead to vitamin D deficiency, and some individuals may need supplemental vitamin D.\n\n【36】*   Liver transplants have been used to treat some people with acute forms of porphyria and others with serious illnesses who have not responded to other treatment options. Liver transplantation in HCP patients is the last resort.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:**\n\n【38】Hereditary coproporphyria is a metabolic disease affected by a lack of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase. The enzyme deficiency causes the deposition of porphyrin precursors in the body. A mutation in the CPOX gene causes this enzyme deficiency. However, the lack alone is insufficient to bring out disease manifestations, and usually, people having CPOX gene mutation do not produce HCP symptoms.\n\n【39】Other factors like endocrine issues (hormonal changes), the use of certain drugs, regular alcohol consumption, recurrent infections, and drastic changes in the diet often trigger the onset of symptoms. Some patients experience acute seizures or episodes that develop over several days. The course and severity of the attack vary from person to person. In some cases, the condition can cause life-threatening complications, especially if not properly diagnosed and treated. CPOX mutations are autosomal dominant.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hereditary Coproporphyria  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/hereditary-coproporphyria\n*   Hereditary Coproporphyria  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114807/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It belongs to a class of drugs called platinum coordination complexes. Platinum coordination complexes (platinum-containing compounds) are a class of anti-cancer drugs that are typically categorized as alkylating agents, although they possess unique characteristics. It works by interfering with the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing and growing. The brand name of this drug is Paraplatin.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of Carboplatin?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Following are some of the uses of Carboplatin:\n\n【4】*   **Ovarian Cancer:** It is used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat ovarian cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\n【5】*   **Lung Cancer:** Carboplatin is used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n【6】*   **Head and Neck Cancer:** Carboplatin is used in combination with radiation therapy to treat certain types of head and neck cancer.\n\n【7】*   **Bladder Cancer:** Carboplatin is used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat bladder cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.\n\n【8】*   **Germ Cell Tumors:** Carboplatin is used to treat germ cell tumors, which are tumors that develop from germ cells, such as testicular cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\n【9】*   **Neuroblastoma:** Carboplatin is used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat neuroblastoma (a type of cancer that affects the nervous system).\n\n【10】What Is Carboplatin Toxicity?\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】Carboplatin toxicity refers to the adverse effects that may occur in patients who are receiving this chemotherapy drug. Carboplatin is used to treat various types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, and bladder cancer. While Carboplatin can be effective in fighting cancer, it can also cause toxic side effects in patients. Carboplatin toxicity manifests in different forms such as problems with blood cells, digestion, kidneys, and nerves.\n\n【12】Carboplatin is available in a powder form or liquid form as a solution for injection in various doses such as 50 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg generically. The normal dose of Carboplatin is usually calculated based on a patient's body surface area (a measure of the total surface area of the body). The most common dosing schedule for Carboplatin is once every three to four weeks. The starting dose of carboplatin for most cancers is 300-400 mg/m² of BSA (body surface area) per cycle. However, the dose may be adjusted based on kidney function and other individual health factors.\n\n【13】What Are the Causes of Carboplatin Toxicity?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Carboplatin toxicity can be caused by various factors, including the dosage and duration of the treatment, individual patient factors, and the way the drug is administered. Higher doses of Carboplatin can increase the risk of toxic side effects. Patients with pre-existing health conditions or impaired kidney function may also be at a higher risk of developing this toxicity. Additionally, the way this medication is administered, such as the speed of infusion, can also affect the likelihood of toxic side effects.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Carboplatin Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Symptoms of Carboplatin toxicity usually include:\n\n【17】*   **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Carboplatin can cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the body. This can result in fatigue, increased risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding problems.\n\n【18】*   **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Carboplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions are a common concern and have been observed in around 15 to 20 percent of women. Symptoms may include, rashes, itching swelling of the face, tightness in the chest, vomiting, and changes in blood pressure. The onset of these hypersensitivity reactions can vary, occurring either during or after the infusion.\n\n【19】*   **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Gastrointestinal toxicity can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which can be mild or severe, leading to dehydration and malnutrition.\n\n【20】*   **Kidney Problems:** Carboplatin can cause damage to the kidneys, resulting in decreased urine output, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\n【21】*   **Nervous System Problems:** Carboplatin can cause damage to the nerves, resulting in tingling, numbness, or weakness in the hands and feet.\n\n【22】*   **Ototoxicity:** Carboplatin can cause hearing loss, which can be temporary or permanent. Ototoxicity refers to the harmful effects that certain drugs or chemicals can have on the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems.\n\n【23】*   **Risk of Infection:** A decrease in white blood cells results in increased chances of infection. Common symptoms of this condition include muscle pain, headaches, feeling cold and shivery, changes in body temperature, and a general feeling of unwellness.\n\n【24】*   **Bleeding Gums, Bruising, and Nosebleeds:** Bleeding gums, bruising, and nosebleeds may develop due to a decrease in platelets in the bloodstream. Platelets play a crucial role in blood clotting, which helps prevent excessive bleeding from cuts. Individuals may notice nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing their teeth. Additionally, they may observe small red spots or bruises on their limbs, known as petechiae.\n\n【25】How Can Carboplatin Toxicity Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Carboplatin toxicity can be diagnosed with the help of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. Diagnostic methods used to detect Carboplatin toxicity include the following:\n\n【27】*   **Physical Examination:** If a patient is on Carboplatin chemotherapy, their healthcare professional will perform a physical examination to check for any signs or symptoms of its toxicity. These may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, kidney problems, nerve damage, hearing loss, and other symptoms.\n\n【28】*   **Blood Tests:** Blood tests are used to monitor the patient's kidney function and blood counts. Carboplatin causes bone marrow suppression, resulting in decreased levels of blood cells. Blood tests can detect changes in the level of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The healthcare professional adjusts the medicine dose accordingly.\n\n【29】*   **Urine Tests:** Urine tests are used to monitor the patient's kidney function. Carboplatin can cause damage to the kidneys, resulting in decreased urine output and increased levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine in the blood.\n\n【30】*   **Imaging Tests:** Imaging tests such as CT scans or MRIs may be used to monitor the size and progression of the cancer being treated. These tests can also detect any potential side effects or toxicity caused by this drug.\n\n【31】*   **Auditory Tests:** Auditory tests help to monitor the individual's hearing function. Carboplatin can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. These tests can detect changes in hearing function if any.\n\n【32】What Is the Treatment for Carboplatin Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Carboplatin toxicity can be managed with the help of the following methods:\n\n【34】*   **Supportive Care:** Patients with this toxicity may require supportive care to manage symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. This may include medications to control nausea and pain, as well as rest and hydration.\n\n【35】*   **Dose Adjustment:** The healthcare professional adjusts the dose of this medication depending on the severity of toxicity. They also delay the next cycle of treatment to allow the patient's body to recover.\n\n【36】*   **Blood Transfusions:** Patients with toxicity associated with bone marrow suppression may require blood transfusions to increase their red blood cell or platelet count.\n\n【37】*   **Kidney Support:** Patients with kidney damage may require kidney support, such as dialysis, to help remove toxins from their blood and improve kidney function.\n\n【38】*   **Hearing Aids:** Patients who experience hearing loss due to this toxicity may require hearing aids or other assistive devices to improve their hearing.\n\n【39】*   **Medications:** Sometimes, medications may be used to manage symptoms of this toxicity. Medications to stimulate the production of white blood cells or to reduce inflammation may be prescribed if necessary.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Carboplatin is a highly beneficial drug that is widely used in the treatment of various cancers. Healthcare professionals need to closely monitor patients receiving Carboplatin medication to minimize the risk of toxicity and adjust treatment as necessary. Early detection and management of Carboplatin toxicity can help minimize the risk of further complications in the future and ensure the safe and effective use of this drug.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Carboplatin  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548565/\n*   Limitations to the use of carboplatin-based therapy in advanced ovarian cancer  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683379/\n*   Carboplatin  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/carboplatin</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are applied through different methods to rehabilitate a wide range of diseases. It can be used before therapy and after therapy to improve the effects.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Heat Therapy?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】The following types of heat therapies are available:\n\n【4】1\\. Superficial methods.\n\n【5】2\\. Deep heating methods.\n\n【6】**What Are the Superficial Heating Modalities?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】In this type of therapy, the heat penetration depth is less than two centimeters.\n\n【8】**1\\. Whirlpool:** Water heated at 39 to 40 degrees Celsius is constantly kept whirling in the whirlpool bath. If immersed comfortably, it helps in assisting the active movement of the limb and joints. Patients benefit from overall comfortable healing due to warmth, gravity elimination, and water movement. It helps promote the active efforts of the patient and, therefore, is useful for postoperative mobilization.\n\n【9】**2\\. Infrared:** Infrared can be applied through infrared lamps that produce dry heat. It can be used for a duration of 18 to 20 minutes to produce the desired effect. It helps improve localized circulation and nutrition. Infrared relieves superficial pain, relaxes joints and muscles, and softens the superficial subcutaneous tissues and the skin.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Rezum Therapy for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Heat Treatments for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Is herniated disc a permanent disability?</u>\n\n【15】**3\\. Hydrocollator:** It is made of bentonite clay and other natural fillings. They help relieve inflammatory and joint pain, bruised tissue, congestion, and strains when applied to the skin. They are also used by arthritis patients. Hydrocollator improves blood circulation by enlarging the blood vessels, thereby promoting healing. Athletes who have developed overuse injuries and those in chronic pain may also find this relieving.\n\n【16】**4\\. Hot Packs:** Hot packs are the most common heating agents used in rehabilitation. Hot packs transfer heat energy to the body through conduction. Superficial heat usually produces temperature elevation in the underlying tissues to a depth of one centimeter. Adipose tissue acts as an insulating layer, decreasing heat depth. Commercial hot packs are canvas, usually filled with a hydrophilic substance, that is immersed in hot water with a temperature of 77 degrees Celsius. These hot packs can retain heat for up to 30 minutes. With superficial heat, local metabolism is increased, and local vasodilatation with hyperemia occurs. Initial vasoconstrictors are produced in deep tissue layers, followed by vasodilation. Hot packs also promote muscle relaxation as well as sedation of sensory nerve endings.\n\n【17】**Indications:** It can be used in subacute or chronic traumatic and inflammatory conditions and can also be used as a preheating method before electrical stimulation.\n\n【18】**Contraindications:** It cannot be used in the following conditions:\n\n【19】*   Patients with acute inflammatory conditions.\n\n【20】*   Patients who have a fever and high temperature.\n\n【21】*   Patients with possible metastases of malignancies.\n\n【22】*   It cannot be applied to areas having active bleeding.\n\n【23】*   Patients who have received radiation therapy.\n\n【24】*   Patients with peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【25】**5\\. Paraffin Wax:** Paraffin is another form of a heat-delivering method used to treat difficult areas like the distal extremities. A paraffin bath is a container holding a mixture of paraffin (approximately five pounds) and mineral oil (approximately one pint). The melted wax temperature is maintained at 125 to 127 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the low specific heat, a higher temperature of the paraffin can be tolerated compared to water. Paraffin and oil together not only produce heat but also help soften skin.\n\n【26】**Indications:** It is used in patients having chronic arthritis of the hands or feet and in patients with subacute and chronic traumatic inflammatory conditions.\n\n【27】**Contraindications:** Paraffin bath is contraindicated in wounds that are open and in lesions that are infected. It is not used in acute inflammatory joint disorders because interscapular heating may accelerate the destruction of articular cartilage.\n\n【28】**What Are the Deep Heating Modalities?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】In this type of therapy, the depth of penetration of heat is more than two centimeters.\n\n【30】**1\\. Microwave Diathermy:** Microwaves are electromagnetic radiation and will help deliver short pulses of high-intensity microwaves. It helps improve membrane permeability, collagen synthesis, pain threshold, and scar tissue resolution, relieving joint adhesions. It also helps in wound healing and scar remodeling.\n\n【31】**2\\. Shortwave Diathermy:** This produces deeper tissue heating for up to 30 to 50-millimeter depth through electromagnetic induction by high-frequency currents. It can never be used in acute injuries. This is ideal in deeper chronic pain joints and helps improve the concentration of white blood cells and antibodies in the application area. It helps reduce deeper localized pains due to neuromuscular pathology.\n\n【32】**3\\. Laser:** Low-frequency light waves produce photochemical reactions within the tissue cells. It helps relieve acute as well as chronic pain due to muscular and neuropathic injuries.\n\n【33】**4\\. Ultrasound:** Ultrasound is a deep heating agent commonly used in rehabilitation. Deep heating agents are capable of causing increased temperatures in tissues up to three to five centimeters deep. Ultrasound can be used as a pulsed wave, in which the intensity is periodically interrupted. Ultrasound produces increased extensibility of collagen fibers, decreased joint stiffness, decreased muscle spasm, pain modulation, increased blood flow, and a mild inflammatory response.\n\n【34】**Indications:** It can be used for soft tissue shortening in conditions like joint contractures and scarring. Ultrasound can be used in subacute and chronic inflammatory conditions. It can be used in conditions such as muscle spasms, trigger areas, muscle guarding, and neuroma.\n\n【35】**Contraindications:** Ultrasound should be avoided in the following situations:\n\n【36】*   Patients who have insufficient arterial circulation.\n\n【37】*   Injuries that have active bleeding.\n\n【38】*   Avoided in areas like the eyes and spinal cord as it may produce cavitation.\n\n【39】*   It should be avoided in pregnant women.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Thermotherapy is an easy and cost-effective method to help cure subacute or chronic inflammatory conditions. It helps in relieving chronic pain and muscle spasms. For patients with locomotion disabilities, exercise can be taught inside the water, and the joints can be moved to the end range of motion without any discomfort. It will provide a wide range of neuromuscular effects and helps in the development of tissue extensibility when used in the right way.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Heat and Cold Therapy: A Guide for Patients  \n    https://www.uhcw.nhs.uk/download/clientfiles/files/Patient%20Information%20Leaflets/Clinical%20Support%20Services/Physiotherapy/118403\\_Heat\\_and\\_Cold\\_Therapy\\_a\\_guide\\_for\\_patients\\_(1243)\\_-\\_DEc\\_18.pdf\n*   Physics and physiology of heat therapy : with special consideration of conversive heat  \n    https://digitalcommons.unmc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1784&context=mdtheses\n*   Therapeutic Heating Modalities  \n    https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/therapeutic\\_heating\\_modalities2017-1.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "402ba9ee-95ef-4c02-b7e8-d29532bcdbab", "title": "Bennett Fracture - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Bennett Fracture - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Bennett fracture is the most common fracture involving the thumb's base. This fracture usually refers to an intraarticular fracture that separates the palmar ulnar aspect of the first metacarpal base from the remaining first metacarpal. These fractures are unstable. The radiographs are necessary for the evaluation of these injuries and also to help in planning surgical approaches for reduction. The surgical treatment differs for these fractures. The surgical treatments include closed reduction with percutaneous pinning or open reduction with either pin or inter-fragment pinning. The clinical results are good when there is good alignment of the fracture fragments at post-surgical fixation.\n\n【2】What Is the Etiology of Bennett Fracture?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The cause of Bennett fracture is the axial load that occurs on the partially flexed metacarpal along with the fractures that involve adjacent carpal bone, and ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\n【4】What Is the Epidemiology of Bennett Fracture?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Thumb fractures are most commonly found in children and older people. Bennett fracture is a subtype of fracture that involves the thumb. Tubular bone fractures are observed in children between infancy and 16 years, and in older patients, 20% of hand fractures occur in the thumb. The thumb is the most common tubular bone fracture with oblique and intra-articular bone fractures.\n\n【6】What Is the Pathophysiology of Bennett Fracture?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The fracture pattern is distinct. The base of the first metacarpal is fractured with the intraarticular extension because of the palmar ulnar fragment of the first metacarpal, which is held in place by the ligamentous attachment to the trapezium during the axial loading. The rest of the metacarpal moves in the opposite direction, and the main fracture line occurs along the point of weakness. Because of this, the first metacarpal shaft subluxated proximally, dorsally, and radially due to the pull of the extensor pollicis longus, abductor pollicis longus, and extensor pollicis brevis, which remains attached to the fracture fragment.\n\n【8】The physical signs of Bennett fractures include pain and localized swelling to the base of the thumb.\n\n【9】How Is Bennett Fracture Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【10】The diagnosis of Bennett fracture is made using radiographs that include lateral, oblique, and anteroposterior views. If necessary, additional views of the thumb can be obtained to evaluate the injury. The accurate AP (anterior to posterior) view of the first carpometacarpal joint with hyper pronation of the forearm by an X-ray beam directed 90 degrees to the plate and by placing the dorsal aspect of the thumb against the radiographic plate. The second view is called Bett's, which is obtained by a beam directed 15 degrees proximal to the distal with the palm overpronated 20 degrees from flat against the radiographic plate. Finally, by pressing the radial aspect of the thumbs together on AP view stress, radiographs can be performed, demonstrating subluxation of the metacarpal base radially in relation to the trapezium on the symptomatic side. Based on radiographic appearance, Gredda classified Bennett fractures into three types, that is:\n\n【11】*   **Type 1 -** Fracture with single ulnar fragment and subluxation of the metacarpal base.\n\n【12】*   **Type 2 -** Impaction fracture without subluxation of the first metacarpal.\n\n【13】*   **Type 3 -** Injury with the small ulnar avulsion fragment concerning metacarpal dislocation.\n\n【14】What Is the Management of Bennett Fracture?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Avoiding thumb extension is recommended as it has been shown to cause displacement of the fracture in cases of Bennett fracture. In the 1970s, Bennett described the splinting and closed reduction as the preferred treatment method, which has shown good outcomes, although some studies have shown poor results.\n\n【16】The surgical treatment of Bennett fracture includes closed reduction with percutaneous pinning or open reduction using pins or interfragmentary screws. In addition, the methods of fixation have been proven effective. Treatment with closed reduction with intermetacarpal fixation from the first to the second metacarpal to the trapezium is often effective in reducing the first metacarpal shaft subluxation. Treating a fracture with open reduction is usually performed through a Wagner incision.\n\n【17】The way these fractures must be treated with either open or closed reduction is still a matter of debate. Some authors have found no correlation between the radiographic outcome and the quality of articular reduction. Still, biomechanical studies have found that two millimeters of articular surface step-off does not affect the contact pressure at the step-off location. So it has been concluded that bony apposition of the fragments within two millimeters and the correction of the joint subluxation can be tolerated without the increased risk of posttraumatic arthritis. Many studies have preferred anatomic reduction.\n\n【18】What Are the Differential Diagnoses of Bennett Fracture?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The differential diagnosis of Bennett fracture includes the following:\n\n【20】*   **Rolando Fracture:** This is a more severe form of Bennett fracture that involves the same area of the thumb. It is a comminuted fracture, which means that the bone is broken into multiple pieces.\n\n【21】*   **Scaphoid Fracture**: This is a fracture of one of the small bones in the wrist. The symptoms of a scaphoid fracture can be similar to those of a Bennett fracture, and it may be difficult to distinguish between the two without an X-ray.\n\n【22】*   **Metacarpal Fracture:** A fracture of the metacarpal bone, which is the bone that connects the wrist to the fingers, can also cause symptoms similar to those of a Bennett fracture.\n\n【23】*   **Ligament Injury:** A sprain or tear in the ligaments of the thumb can also cause pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the thumb.\n\n【24】*   **Arthritis:** Arthritis can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the thumb joint. It may be difficult to distinguish between arthritis and a Bennett fracture without an X-ray.\n\n【25】*   **Tendinitis:** Inflammation of the tendons in the thumb can cause pain and difficulty moving the thumb.\n\n【26】*   **De Quervain's Tenosynovitis:** This is a condition that causes pain and swelling in the tendons that run along the thumb side of the wrist. It can be caused by overuse or repetitive motions.\n\n【27】*   **Trigger Finger:** This is a condition that causes one of the fingers to become stuck in a bent position. It can also affect the thumb and cause pain and difficulty moving the thumb.\n\n【28】*   **Nerve Injury:** Injuries to the nerves in the hand or wrist can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the thumb and hand.\n\n【29】What Is the Prognosis of Bennett Fracture?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【30】About 86% of the patients with Bennett fracture had no residual symptoms with anatomic reduction, and 46% with sound reduction were asymptomatic. Different range of motion exercises may begin five to ten days after the screw fixation and four weeks after pinning. The long-term outcomes were based on the quality of fracture reduction. Unfortunately, definitive treatments are lacking due to a small number of patients, lack of randomized prospective data and lack of long-term imaging follow-up definitive therapies are lacking.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】The management of Bennett fracture is complex, and it is best done with the help of an interprofessional team that includes a physical therapist, orthopedic surgeon, nurse, and surgeon.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bennett Fracture  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500035/\n*   Bennett fracture  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bennett-fracture</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The fallopian tubes are an essential part of the female reproductive system.\n\n【2】What Is Tubal Ligation?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure performed in women, which involves getting the fallopian tubes blocked or cut. This procedure is also known as ‘female sterilization’ and prevents pregnancy.\n\n【4】For Whom Is Tubal Ligation Advised?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【5】Tubal ligation is generally performed for women who:\n\n【6】*   Have had multiple pregnancies and do not desire any children.\n\n【7】*   Do not want children; in order to avoid pregnancy and to engage frequently in sexual activity.\n\n【8】*   Are in a stable relationship where both partners do not want children.\n\n【9】*   Have a genetic disorder and fear their children might be diagnosed with the same. This also applies, if the male partner has a genetic disorder.\n\n【10】*   Cannot risk getting pregnant as it may affect their health negatively.\n\n【11】How Is Tubal Ligation Performed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure performed under either general or local anesthesia. It is carried out in a hospital or surgical clinic. Patients are usually discharged the same day.\n\n【13】**Procedure:**\n\n【14】The abdomen is inflated with either carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide gas through a needle insertion or an incision made through the belly button. Next, a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen, and other special instruments are inserted through the abdominal wall to either destroy some parts of the fallopian tubes or clip them. The gas is then removed, and the patient may go home a few hours after the procedure. Patients may experience abdominal bloating and pain, tiredness, and occasional dizziness or fainting spells as immediate side effects of the procedure that will soon wear away.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>My wife is 30 days pregnant.

It does not offer any form of protection against sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, using adequate protection like condoms or other STI prevention devices is a must even after tubal ligation; unless one is in a committed, monogamous relationship and both partners have tested negative for any STI.\n\n【28】Can the Tubal Ligation Procedure Be Reversed?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Tubal ligation is an effective permanent birth control option. Nevertheless, depending on the original ligation type and procedure, it may be possible to reverse a tubal ligation. However, it is complicated and does not guarantee a pregnancy. Reports on women getting pregnant after reattachment of tubes have ranged from 50 % - 80 % success rates. This means that the chances of getting pregnant after a tubal ligation are slim.\n\n【30】What Are the Side Effects of Tubal Ligation?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Side effects may include:\n\n【32】*   Symptoms arising after the procedure (that will wear off in time) such as abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, tiredness or fatigue, shoulder pain.\n\n【33】*   Risks or complications from the procedure include:\n\n【34】    *   Improper wound healing.\n\n【35】    *   Bleeding from the site.\n\n【36】    *   Bowel and bladder damage.\n\n【37】    *   Pelvic pain and raised temperature of about 100.4 F, among others.\n\n【38】    *   Improper closure that might increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\n【39】    *   Ectopic pregnancy (implantation of fertilized egg outside the uterus)\n\n【40】What Is Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【41】Some women may experience a series of characteristic symptoms following tubal ligation, referred to as post tubal ligation syndrome. On average, around 37 % of women face the possibility of developing the syndrome, of which younger women form the more significant part.\n\n【42】The symptoms associated with post tubal ligation syndrome include:\n\n【43】*   Pain during intercourse.\n\n【44】*   Menstruation troubles.\n\n【45】*   Absence of menstruation.\n\n【46】*   **Premenstrual Syndrome:** Signs and symptoms displayed by women in the week leading up to their periods. This includes breast tenderness, mood swings, irritability, and a general sense of fatigue.\n\n【47】*   Weight gain.\n\n【48】*   Depression and anxiety.\n\n【49】*   **Hemorrhage of the Uterus:** Abnormal bleeding from the uterus that lasts a long time.\n\n【50】*   Pelvic pain.\n\n【51】*   Increased frequency of headaches.\n\n【52】*   An ache in the lower back.\n\n【53】Can Pregnancy Occur Even After Tubal Ligation?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【54】While tubal ligation is a highly effective procedure, there is a 1 in 200 possibility of getting pregnant, especially in younger women. Women below the age of 28 show the most significant risk of getting pregnant even after tubal ligation, while women over 35 may be at a lower risk of getting pregnant. However, this comes with a complication of an ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus - usually in a fallopian tube). This type of pregnancy is dangerous and requires medical attention. It is also not possible or advisable to attempt carrying such a pregnancy to full-term.\n\n【55】What To Do if Pregnancy Is Desired After Tubal Ligation?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Pregnancy after tubal ligation may be facilitated in the following ways:\n\n【57】*   **Tubal Reversal Surgery:** A tubal ligation reversal procedure can be performed after tubal ligation if the woman changes her mind and wishes to get pregnant. However, this depends on how the tubal ligation procedure was performed. It is also a complicated procedure and may not be effective.\n\n【58】*   **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF):** The woman is stimulated with medications for the growth of multiple eggs, which are then taken from her ovaries, fertilized with sperm from the male partner outside in a laboratory, and then transferred back to her uterus. This may result in the implantation of one embryo in the uterus and subsequently bring about pregnancy.\n\n【59】Is Tubal Ligation Expensive?\n----------------------------\n\n【60】*   Tubal ligation is an expensive procedure in most countries.\n\n【61】*   When compared to tubal implants, tubal ligation surgery is undoubtedly more expensive.\n\n【62】*   Tubal ligation is also a costlier option than vasectomy (male birth control surgery that blocks the sperm from reaching the semen ejaculated by the penis).\n\n【63】What Are Some Alternatives to Tubal Ligation?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【64】*   **Use of Condoms:** This is the simplest, most economical, and most feasible solution. Additionally, condoms have a dual role. They can prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【65】*   **Vasectomy:** Male sterilization procedure that is more affordable, has fewer side effects, and cannot result in ectopic pregnancy for the female partner. Even if the procedure does fail and pregnancy occurs in the woman, the chances of ectopic pregnancy are negotiable, unlike tubal ligation.\n\n【66】*   **Birth Control Implant:** This device is implanted in the arm, and it releases hormones such as progestin to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【67】*   **Oral Contraceptive Pills.**\n\n【68】*   **Intrauterine Devices (IUDs):** A long-term, reversible option for birth control, where a coil-like device is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Tubal ligation is an intelligent choice for those who are sure that they do not want any children or those who cannot undergo pregnancy for medical and other reasons. It can be challenging work trying to make a decision, but with enough information and support from physicians and partners, it is possible to make informed decisions and choose what suits one’s physical and personal needs best.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Periods Occur After Tubal Ligation?**\n\n【74】Tubal ligation does not in any way affect a woman’s menstrual cycle. It only works to prevent eggs and sperm from traveling through the fallopian tubes. It blocks eggs from traveling to the uterus and sperm from traveling to the egg.

It is a chronic and severe mental illness that causes thinking, feeling, and behavior disturbances. This disorder typically emerges between the ages of fourteen and sixteen and is characterized by an impaired ability to interpret reality. Schizophrenia can vary in severity but may include hearing voices, delusions, disorganized speech, difficulty with concentration and attention, social withdrawal, unusual or disorganized behavior, and depression. It is also associated with physical problems such as poor coordination, delayed development, and a weakened immune system. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve the prognosis and quality of life for those affected. This article will discuss the latest research on childhood schizophrenia, its causes, symptoms, and treatments.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Childhood Schizophrenia?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact cause of childhood schizophrenia is still unknown; some experts say that the following factors are involved in the development of childhood schizophrenia:\n\n【4】*   **Genetic Factors**: Schizophrenia is often seen to run in families, indicating that genetics may play a role.\n\n【5】*   **Environmental Factors:** Stressful events and poor living conditions during childhood can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.\n\n【6】*   **Brain Chemistry:** An imbalance in neurotransmitters like dopamine and glutamate could cause changes in the brain and lead to schizophrenia.\n\n【7】*   **Abnormal Brain Development**: It is believed that certain changes in brain structure and functioning due to abnormal development could cause schizophrenia.\n\n【8】*   **Neurodevelopmental Factors:** Certain factors during a person's developmental years, such as viral infections or other complications during pregnancy, could increase the risk of schizophrenia.\n\n【9】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Childhood Schizophrenia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Early childhood schizophrenia (sometimes called infantile schizophrenia) typically presents before five. Symptoms can include:\n\n【11】*   Disorganized speech and behavior.\n\n【12】*   A decline in development.\n\n【13】*   Lack of emotion.\n\n【14】*   Floppy arms and legs.\n\n【15】*   Delay in crawling, walking and talking.\n\n【16】*   A limp or slumped posture.\n\n【17】*   The long period in which they are sluggish or inactive.\n\n【18】*   Hallucination which a child may see things or hear voices that are not real.\n\n【19】*   They may also need help understanding language, abstract concepts, or interacting with peers.\n\n【20】Symptoms in older children include:\n\n【21】*   **Unusual Behavior:** Children with infantile schizophrenia may demonstrate behaviors that are not typical for their age, such as spinning around, standing still for long periods, rocking or banging their heads, and talking to themselves.\n\n【22】*   **Lack of Communication:** Infantile schizophrenia can cause children to be less engaged in social interactions or to have difficulty communicating effectively. They may appear to lack facial expressions, remain silent, or even refuse to speak.\n\n【23】*   **Delusions and Hallucinations:** Delusions are false beliefs, while hallucinations involve seeing or hearing things that are not there. Children with infantile schizophrenia may have both experiences, which can be frightening and disruptive to their everyday lives.\n\n【24】*   **Sleep Disturbances:** Insomnia, difficulty sleeping, and nightmares are all common symptoms of childhood schizophrenia.\n\n【25】*   **Poor Academic Performance:** Due to the disruptions caused by their symptoms, children with schizophrenia may experience difficulty concentrating in school, leading to poor academic performance.\n\n【26】Experts divided the symptoms of schizophrenia among children into three categories, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.\n\n【27】**Positive Symptoms:** They are psychotic behavior. A person is disconnected from reality during psychosis. They may include:\n\n【28】1.  Delusions.\n\n【29】2.  Hallucinations.\n\n【30】3.  Disorders of movement (unusual movements or behaviors).\n\n【31】4.  Mental disorders (unable to organize and control thinking).\n\n【32】**Negative Symptoms:** It involves disturbed behaviors and emotions and may include:\n\n【33】1.  Isolation.\n\n【34】2.  Limited or showing no emotion.\n\n【35】3.  Speaking little.\n\n【36】4.  A feeling of no pleasure in life.\n\n【37】5.  The problem in starting and finishing activities.\n\n【38】**Cognitive Symptoms:** The symptoms may reflect the differences in thinking and memory that may include:\n\n【39】1.  Trouble focusing on tasks.\n\n【40】2.  Difficulty in understanding and making decisions.\n\n【41】3.  Poor attention span.\n\n【42】How Is Childhood Schizophrenia Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【43】The diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia requires careful assessment and observation by a mental health professional. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should include an interview with the child, a review of medical history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms such as a head injury, drug use, or thyroid disorder.\n\n【44】Any diagnosis must be made only after extensive testing. Generally, a diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia will not be made until the child has had at least six months of consistent symptoms, including at least two weeks of delusions or hallucinations. In addition to these criteria, the mental health professional may assess for speech disturbances, social withdrawal, odd behavior, and changes in functioning.\n\n【45】*   **Physical Examination -** When diagnosing childhood schizophrenia, a physical examination is conducted to rule out any physical health problems that could be causing the symptoms. They include taking vital signs and performing a complete neurological exam.\n\n【46】*   **Tests and Screenings** - The doctor will also look for signs of psychological distress. Tests and screenings such as an EEG (electroencephalogram), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or CT (computed tomography) scan may also be done to help rule out other causes of the child’s symptoms.\n\n【47】*   **Psychiatric Evaluation** \\- Once these tests have been completed, the doctor may refer the child to a psychiatrist or psychologist for a more thorough evaluation. During the evaluation, the professional will use standardized tests and interview the patient and parents to understand their condition better.\n\n【48】The doctor will look for specific criteria to diagnose schizophrenia, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms (such as lack of emotion and flat affect), and social and occupational functioning impairment. If these criteria are met, the diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia can be made.\n\n【49】How to Treat Childhood Schizophrenia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【50】The treatment of childhood schizophrenia includes:\n\n【51】**1\\. Medications:** One of the primary treatments for infantile schizophrenia is an antipsychotic medication. This medication alters the balance of chemicals in the brain and helps reduce hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and other psychotic symptoms associated with the disorder. The most common antipsychotics used to treat infantile schizophrenia are typical or first-generation antipsychotics and atypical or second-generation antipsychotics.\n\n【52】*   Typical or first-generation antipsychotics block dopamine, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and thought processes. Examples of first-generation antipsychotics include Haloperidol, Fluphenazine, and Chlorpromazine.\n\n【53】*   Atypical or second-generation antipsychotics, such as Risperidone, Olanzapine, Aripiprazole, and Quetiapine, also block dopamine and target other brain receptors.\n\n【54】**2\\. Psychotherapy:** There are other treatment options available for childhood schizophrenia, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family therapy, and psychotherapy. CBT can help children learn new coping skills and the healthy ways to deal with their symptoms, while family therapy can help parents better support their children. Psychotherapy can help children explore the root cause of their illness and better understand themselves.\n\n【55】**3\\. Life Skill Training:** Specialized classes can teach the child social skills and how to complete daily tasks. They can also get advice on overcoming challenges in life or at school.\n\n【56】The goal of treatment for infantile schizophrenia is to manage the disorder's symptoms and help children live happy and productive lives. Finding the right combination of medication and therapies may take some time, but with patience and dedication, children with infantile schizophrenia can lead a fulfilling life.\n\n【57】What Are the Complications Associated with Childhood Schizophrenia?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】Schizophrenia, if left untreated, can cause problems in childhood and later life. An example of these are:\n\n【59】*   Other mental illnesses.\n\n【60】*   Suicide or self-harm.\n\n【61】*   Drug or alcohol addiction.\n\n【62】*   Isolation and conflict with family and friends.\n\n【63】*   Legal and financial issues.\n\n【64】*   Having difficulty living alone, attending school, or working.\n\n【65】Can Childhood Schizophrenia Be Prevented?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【66】Unfortunately, the exact cause of childhood schizophrenia is still unknown, so there is currently no way to prevent it. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the impact of this disorder on a child's life. Studies have suggested that proper nutrition, social interaction, and avoiding stress during early childhood development may help protect against certain mental health issues. Parents should pay attention to their child's development and talk to their doctor if they have any concerns.\n\n【67】**Conclusion**\n\n【68】Childhood schizophrenia is a complex and difficult disorder to diagnose, manage and treat. Treatment is typically tailored to the individual and may involve a combination of medications, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes. While there is currently no known cure for childhood schizophrenia, many children can still lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support and treatment. Early intervention and support are key to managing symptoms and improving outcomes. With the help of healthcare professionals, parents, and support groups, children with schizophrenia can lead meaningful and productive lives.\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>*   Childhood Onset Schizophrenia and Early Onset Schizophrenia spectrum disorders  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771646/\n*   A Review of Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6526799/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The renal tubules are small ducts in the kidneys that filter the nutrients, fluids, and other substances from the blood through the kidneys. This condition occurs when there is a lack of oxygen and vascular supply to the kidney tubules.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Renal Tubular Degeneration?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Renal tubular degeneration is often associated with a lack of blood supply and oxygen to the kidney tissues. The frequent causes may be a stroke or a heart attack. It may also occur if a poisonous or chemically harmful substance damages and degenerates the renal cells.\n\n【4】The internal structures of the kidney, particularly the tissues and renal cortical epithelial cells of the kidney tubule, become damaged or degenerated. Renal tubular degeneration is one of the most common cytoplasmic structural changes in the renal tubular epithelial cells that might lead to vacuolation of the cytoplasm and pyknosis (necrosis) of the cell nuclei. These degenerative changes might lead to acute renal failure.\n\n【5】What Is the Pathogenesis of Renal Tubular Degeneration?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Renal tubular degeneration is a nonspecific entity that can arise from many etiologies that alter cell function. It is often considered an early indicator of acute renal necrosis. Degeneration is usually preceded by cytoplasmic vacuolation. In particular, degeneration is characterized by many morphological and variable cellular features. These features include cellular swelling with or without cytoplasmic vacuolation, pale staining, and degenerated cytoplasm. However, it is important to differentiate degeneration from apoptosis, representing the normal cell turnover process in the kidneys.\n\n【7】On the other hand, renal necrosis generally includes cell swelling, nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis (destructive fragmentation of the nuclei), and sloughing of cells. Degeneration can be either reversible or irreversible.\n\n【8】Clear, empty vacuoles characterize cytoplasmic vacuolation in the cortical epithelial cells in renal tubules. Pathologic vacuolation can be observed anywhere along the length of the renal tubule segments and collecting ducts. However, this morphological phenomenon is more commonly observed in the proximal convoluted renal tubular epithelium. This type of vacuolation may be associated with the macrovesicular or microvesicular phenomenon. Cytoplasmic vacuolation in the renal tubules may be related to phospholipidosis-inducing chemicals. In most cases, the condition is reversible.\n\n【9】Who Is at Risk for Renal Tubular Degeneration?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Renal tubular degeneration is a leading cause of renal failure in patients who are hospitalized. Risk factors for renal tubular degeneration include\n\n【11】*   Blood transfusion reactions.\n\n【12】*   Muscular injury or trauma that degenerates the muscles.\n\n【13】*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) lasts for a longer duration of time.\n\n【14】*   Major surgery on the affected patient has been done recently.\n\n【15】*   Septic shock (a fatal condition that occurs when an infection spreads widely in the body). This often leads to dangerously remarkable low blood pressure.\n\n【16】*   Certain liver diseases occurring due to diabetes may lead to diabetic nephropathy, thereby making a person more prone to renal tubular degeneration.\n\n【17】*   A few pharmacological drugs or medicines that are toxic to the kidneys can cause renal tubular degeneration. These drugs include aminoglycoside antibiotics and Amphotericin (an antifungal drug).\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Renal Tubular Degeneration?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Symptoms may include any of the following:\n\n【20】*   Reduced urine output.\n\n【21】*   Loss of consciousness, coma, rapid confusion, drowsiness, and lethargy.\n\n【22】*   General swelling, fluid retention, edema, or bloating.\n\n【23】*   Nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【24】*   Tiredness and delirium.\n\n【25】How Is the Diagnosis of Renal Tubular Degeneration Made?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The healthcare professional usually performs a medical exam. Abnormal sounds may be heard by the doctor when a stethoscope is placed on the heart and lungs. This occurs due to excessive fluid accumulation in the body.\n\n【27】The following tests may be carried out:\n\n【28】*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen**\\- It measures the amount of urea nitrogen present in the blood.\n\n【29】*   **Serum Creatinine**\\- The serum creatinine level is in the normal range of 0.74 to 1.35 milligrams per deciliter for a normal male.\n\n【30】*   **Kidney Biopsy**\\- The biopsy of the affected kidney will reveal cytoplasmic vacuolation of the renal tubular cells along with pyknotic nuclei in most cases.\n\n【31】*   **Urinalysis**\\- It is the morphological, chemical, and histological examination of urine.\n\n【32】*   **Urine sodium**\\- This test measures the amount of sodium in the urine.\n\n【33】What Is the Treatment of Renal Tubular Degeneration?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】In most people, renal tubular degeneration is reversible. The treatment aims to prevent acute renal failure's fatal complications. Treatment mainly focuses on preventing the buildup of fluids and toxic wastes while allowing the kidneys to heal. Diuretics (medicines to increase urination) and potassium-controlling drugs are usually prescribed to help eliminate fluid from the body. Certain dietary restrictions are made, such as limiting dietary salt intake and restricting fluid intake. The underlying pathology should be treated. Also, temporary renal dialysis can be deployed to eliminate excessive waste products and fluids. This helps to alleviate the symptoms. Dialysis is generally not required for all people but is often lifesaving in patients if the potassium level is dangerously high.\n\n【35】Therefore, dialysis might be preferred in the following cases:\n\n【36】*   State of delirium or confusion.\n\n【37】*   Excessive fluid deposition.\n\n【38】*   Increased potassium levels.\n\n【39】*   Removal of waste products that are dangerous to the kidneys.\n\n【40】*   Absence of urine production.\n\n【41】*   Excessive buildup of nitrogen waste products.\n\n【42】What Is the Prognosis of Renal Tubular Regeneration?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Renal tubular degeneration is a reversible condition that can last a few days to seven weeks or more. Kidney function usually returns to normal, but many other severe problems and complications may occur if the condition is not treated.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Renal tubular degeneration is a nonspecific pathological entity that can occur due to several causes. Reduced oxygen and blood supply often lead to degeneration of the renal tubular cells.\n\n【46】Therefore, prompt efforts to improve the oxygen and blood supply should be made to reverse the condition. Diabetes, liver problems, and heart issues must be managed well to reduce the risk of renal tubular degeneration. The healthcare provider should immediately perform certain tests to diagnose the disease and start immediate treatment modalities. Also, more research should be carried out at the molecular and clinical levels to detect more effective therapeutic procedures.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Kidney, Renal Tubule – Degeneration  \n    https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/nnl/urinary/kidney/rtdegen/kidney-tubule-degeneration-pdf\\_508.pdf\n*   Renal tubular degeneration.

{"seq_id": "2fa2427d-0ba7-4bcf-8526-a0aee1f1c641", "title": "Gynecomastia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Gynecomastia - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The swelling of male breast tissue is known as gynecomastia. It is a non-cancerous disorder that affects males of all ages. Even though gynecomastia is common, it is rarely discussed since some individuals, particularly boys, feel it degrading. In addition, men with gynecomastia frequently experience anxiety. Gynaecomastia symptoms and size range from modest, firm breast tissue growth to a larger, more feminine-looking breast. One or both breasts may be affected by gynecomastia. Personalized therapy alternatives include lifestyle counseling, reassurance, medicinal treatment, and surgical correction.\n\n【2】Why Do Men Develop Boobs?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】While in the womb, breast tissue develops. Boy's breast tissue is identical to girls until they reach puberty and adolescence. When they enter puberty, however, rising hormone levels impact the breast tissue's development. The hormone estrogen stimulates breast growth in females. During puberty, boys have higher quantities of estrogen, but by the end of their adolescence, they usually have significantly higher testosterone levels. As a result, estrogen's impact on breast tissue is inhibited, and the breasts flatten out. The essential feature of gynecomastia is a hormonal imbalance between estrogens and androgens.\n\n【4】What Causes Gynecomastia in Men?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】Physiological reasons, endocrine tumors or dysfunctions, non-endocrine disorders, drug use, or idiopathic causes are all possible causes of gynecomastia.\n\n【6】*   **Aging -** People tend to gain more body fat as they age, creating estrogen. Furthermore, as men age, they produce less testosterone. Breasts can enlarge due to a combination of increased estrogen and decreased testosterone.\n\n【7】*   **Puberty -** The growing testes produce more estrogen than testosterone during puberty, which can cause gynecomastia. Gynecomastia of this sort is frequently self-resolving, but it might occasionally last longer.\n\n【8】*   **Overweight** \\- A person's body produces more estrogen the more fat cells they have. As a result, breast tissue may expand.\n\n【9】*   **Endocrine Disorders** - Various disorders or ailments that impact the estrogen-to-testosterone ratio. These illnesses are uncommon. However, they can involve hereditary issues and chronic diseases (especially kidney and liver disease).\n\n【10】*   **Drugs and Medicines** \\- Some medications can lead to gynecomastia. This could be because they contain estrogen, which raises the hormone's level or stops testosterone production, lowering testosterone levels in the body. Medications for hypertension (high blood pressure), heart disease, psychological disorders, stomach ulcers, cancer medications, antibiotics, and anabolic steroids (muscle-building drugs) can all induce gynecomastia.\n\n【11】*   **Alcohol Intake** \\- Alcohol in large doses stimulates the liver and might cause hormonal imbalances. The liver stops breaking down the circulating estrogen, so testosterone levels drop, but estrogen levels rise. This signifies that breast tissue can expand.\n\n【12】How Is Gynecomastia Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【13】*   **Physical Examination and History** \\- A doctor will diagnose gynecomastia by collecting a medical history (asking questions) and performing a physical exam. Questions are usually asked regarding breast tissue development, medical and drug history, and whether any health concerns run in the family. Breast tissue, abdomen, and genitalia are all evaluated during a physical examination. A rubbery or stiff mound of tissue beneath or around the nipple is familiar in gynecomastia-affected breasts.\n\n【14】*   **Blood Investigations**\\-Testosterone and estrogen levels in the blood may reveal whether or not there was a hormonal imbalance that resulted in gynecomastia. Few other hormones, such as,\n\n【15】*   LH (Luteinizing Hormone).\n\n【16】*   FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone).\n\n【17】*   HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin also provides an insight into the condition.\n\n【18】*   **Ultrasound Examination-** Indicated, especially if any lumps or swelling are present.\n\n【19】*   **Mammogram** - A mammography is recommended to check for any malignancies linked to breast cancer.\n\n【20】*   **Needle Aspiration and Core Tissue Biopsy -** A fine needle aspiration is a procedure that involves taking a sample of cells with a thin needle and syringe and examining them under a microscope. A core tissue biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of breast tissue using a hollow needle and examining it under a microscope.\n\n【21】Is Gynecomastia Linked to the Development of Breast Cancer in Men?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Men are much less likely to develop breast cancer than women. Breast cancer and gynecomastia are linked because both are associated with excessive estrogen levels. However, breast cancer differs from gynecomastia-caused breast cancer in women. It is usually complex and irregular (rather than soft), occurs in one breast (rather than both), and may include nipple deformity or discharge and lumps in the armpit. Breast cancer is more common in males with Klinefelter syndrome than in other men, but it is still uncommon.\n\n【23】What Is the Treatment for Gynecomastia?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【24】Which treatment is best depends on the underlying reason for gynecomastia, if the changes are expected to go away, and whether there are any cosmetic issues. Mere observation, medicines, or surgery can all treat gynecomastia.\n\n【25】**1\\. Medications** \\- Although the success rates are inconsistent, drugs can be used to treat gynecomastia in men who have no underlying hormonal abnormalities.\n\n【26】*   **Tamoxifen** \\- Tamoxifen reduces the quantity of estrogen in the body and reduces the breast size in men, making it an effective treatment for painful gynecomastia. It can cause various adverse effects, including nausea and libido loss (sex drive).\n\n【27】*   **Danazol** \\- Danazol is used to treat gynecomastia that is painful and tender. It works by lowering the estrogen generated in the testicles, which shrinks the breasts and improves symptoms. Weight gain, acne, and voice changes are all possible adverse effect.\n\n【28】2\\. **Surgical Therapy** - Surgery may be done to treat gynecomastia that has been present for a long time or when medicine has failed.\n\n【29】*   **Liposuction** - A surgical technique in which fat from the afflicted area is removed.\n\n【30】*   **Mammoplasty**\\- A surgical breast reduction operation.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】Gynaecomastia can be upsetting, humiliating, and alienating for those who suffer from it. In addition, Gynaecomastia is not age-specific. Boys going through puberty and other bodily changes may find it difficult to talk about their developing or painful breasts with others. Older men may be concerned that their breast changes are a symptom of malignancy. Even though gynecomastia does not enhance the risk of breast cancer, it is essential to pay attention to your breasts and be aware of the disease prevalence.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Gynaecomastia  \n    https://breastcancernow.org/information-support/have-i-got-breast-cancer/breast-lumps-other-benign-conditions/gynaecomastia\n*   Gynecomastia  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2012/0401/p716.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In reconstructive surgery, the surgeon uses routine skin substitutes and tissue flaps with or without skin grafting. It is helpful in trauma, burn, and cancer patients, give better surgical results, and helps facilitate a better quality of life.\n\n【2】What Is the Anatomy of Skin?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】The largest organ of the human body is the skin. It helps maintain homeostasis, regulates body temperature, provides immunity as an attachment point, and envelops deep structures, connective tissue, and subcutaneous tissue. Skin is a sign of aging, beauty, and outward appearance. Skin divides into two layers.\n\n【4】*   **Epidermis:** The outermost layer is called the epidermis and can regenerate. The epidermis's five sublayers are the basal, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum, and corneum. The corneum is present on the topmost layer. The dermis and the epidermis separate the basal layer. At the dermo-epidermal junction, cells form pigment.\n\n【5】*   **Dermis -** The skin comprises an inner layer known as the dermis, responsible for the skin's elasticity, flexibility, and neurovascular supply.\n\n【6】What Are the Types of Skin Grafts?\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】Different skin graft procedures include:\n\n【8】1.  **Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) -** In this graft, a portion of the skin's second layer (dermis) and the epidermis are harvested. Large patches of damaged or missing skin are typically covered by providers using STSG. Usually, they remove healthy skin from the back, abdomen, bottom, or thighs. Typically, donor skin (the area from where the skin is removed) recovers in one to two weeks.\n\n【9】2.  **Full Thickness Skin Graft (FTSG) -** The top layer (epidermis) and the second layer of skin (dermis) are entirely removed and transplanted during a full-thickness skin graft (FTSG). Due to the thicker transplanted skin, FTSG treatments take longer to heal than STSG. FTSG is used for areas like the face that are typically not covered by clothing. For FTSG, medical professionals frequently remove healthy skin from the groin, arm, or collarbone region and immediately close the incision.\n\n【10】3.  **Composite Graft:** Medical professionals transplant soft tissues like cartilage or skin during this operation. Composite grafts are used where damage is incurred to the nose, fingertips, and ears.\n\n【11】What Happens Before Skin-Graft Surgery?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】The healthcare practitioner may stop some medications for skin graft surgery (such as blood thinners). The smokers are advised to stop smoking several weeks before surgery. Smokers are more prone to experience difficulties after a skin graft. Smoking hinders the ability of the skin to recover from surgery.\n\n【13】A visit to the surgeon is recommended to arrange for the procedure and identify the donor site. The tone and texture of the graft site should match the donor site and be selected for harvesting for transplant. First, a surgical healthcare team removes a portion of healthy skin from the donor spot. Then, the graft site will be transplanted with healthy skin (the damaged or missing skin).\n\n【14】What Happens During a Skin Graft Surgery?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【15】The procedure is done under anesthesia in a sterile setting in a hospital.\n\n【16】*   **Anesthesia -** Minor grafts can be performed under local anesthesia. Major surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia (under a completely unconscious state patient).\n\n【17】*   **Extraction of graft -** The surgeon will extract healthy skin from the donor site by incising. They may remove healthy skin from the abdomen, chest, back, bottom, groin region, clavicle region (collarbone), forearm, hip, outer thigh, or inner thigh.\n\n【18】*   **The meshing of graft -** The surgeon places a few crisscrossed cuts or tiny perforations into the healthy skin before transplanting it. This process is known as meshing up. Healthy skin will resemble a fishnet. A doctor can stretch the skin over larger areas with this approach. It also aids in the recovery process following surgery.\n\n【19】*   **Placement of graft-** The healthy skin is applied on top of the injured or missing skin, and a dressing is applied and sewn or stapled to keep it in place. After surgery, the graft and the donor sites will recover. The graft site, however, will probably need a longer time to recover.\n\n【20】What Happens After Skin Graft Surgery?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【21】Typically, a skin graft requires two surgical sites (the donor site and the graft site). The patient is monitored by a professional health caregiver, who will look for well-being, and infections and ensure both sites are healing appropriately. A person may have to stay in the hospital for up to two weeks following the surgery. The type of skin transplant surgery determines the length of the patient's stay in the hospital after surgery. On returning home, the patients should follow the below recommendations:\n\n【22】*   **Cover the Wounds With a Bandage -** A healthcare professional will instruct how long should the wound dressing be on, whether it can get wet, and how frequently it needs to be changed. A doctor may advise applying antibiotic ointment or aloe vera cream (such as bacitracin). Use these creams as directed by a healthcare provider.\n\n【23】*   **Protect the Wound -** Staying away from physical activity that can harm the graft site while healing. Avoid stretching the skin for three to four weeks or engaging in intense exercise.\n\n【24】*   **Use Painkillers to Control Pain -** The doctor may recommend painkillers to help the individual feel better post-surgically. Patients may also require additional medications to minimize inflammation or stop an infection.\n\n【25】*   **Visit Doctor for Additional Appointments -** On further appointments; the doctor will examine the skin to assess the healing. They may also suggest physical therapy (PT) regimen to increase the skin's elasticity and avoid scar tissue formation at the graft site.\n\n【26】What Are the Benefits of Skin Grafts?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【27】*   Skin grafts can restore function and replace missing skin while enhancing the appearance of injured skin.\n\n【28】*   Skin loss occurs due to various disorders and can be effectively treated with a skin graft.\n\n【29】What Are the Complication Associated With Skin Graft Surgery?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Skin transplants are generally successful. However, occasionally the transplanted skin may not take, and a second skin graft may be required. Typically, a skin graft fails for the following reasons:\n\n【31】*   A collection of blood or pus under the skin graft.\n\n【32】*   Infection.\n\n【33】*   Injury or graft site damage due to moving the newly transplanted skin too much during the healing period.\n\n【34】*   The problem in blood circulation impedes wound healing (this happens more often in people who smoke).\n\n【35】*   Bleeding is one of the side effects of skin graft surgery.\n\n【36】*   Contracture refers to the shrinking and inward pulling of the grafted skin.\n\n【37】*   Skin that is uneven, patchy, or colored.\n\n【38】*   Loss of sensation or increased pain sensitivity.\n\n【39】*   Persistent discomfort (chronic pain).\n\n【40】*   Scar tissue formation around graft location.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】Skin grafting is a technique medical professionals use to repair damaged skin, restore lost skin, and speed up the healing of major wounds. Skin grafting surgery provides healthy skin from one area of the body to the other. Damaged or absent skin is covered or replaced by healthy skin. Burns, accidents, illness, or infection can all cause skin loss or injury. After surgery to remove skin cancer, the providers may suggest a skin graft. Surgery for skin grafts is generally successful. However, the donor skin may not always adhere to the graft location. If that occurs, the patient may need a second skin graft. A patient should follow the post-surgery directions to reduce the chance of rejection or graft failure.\n\n【43】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【44】* * *\n\n【45】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Four Stages of Skin Graft Take?**\n\n【46】The four stages of skin grafting are:  \n\\- Imbibition.  \n\\- Revascularization.  \n\\- Regeneration.  \n\\- Reinnervation. \n\n【47】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Location of an Autograft Skin?**\n\n【48】Autograft skin refers to tissue surgically removed from one part of a person's body and transplanted to another that needs skin replacement, such as in cases of burns or skin injuries. Therefore, the location of autograft skin depends on the specific area (mostly the lateral thigh) of the body where the skin was harvested and where it was transplanted.\n\n【49】#### **3.**删除换行**On What Principle Is Skin Grafting Done?**\n\n【50】The principle of skin grafting is to provide a new layer of skin to cover and protect the wound, promote healing, and prevent infection. The success of a skin graft depends on the ability of the transplanted skin to establish a blood supply and attach to the recipient site. This is known as \"taking\" and is essential for the survival of the graft. The skin graft is typically held with sutures or staples and covered with a dressing until it has fully healed and integrated with the surrounding tissue.\n\n【51】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Limitations of Autografts?**\n\n【52】The limitations of autografts include:  \n\\- Limited availability.  \n\\- Additional surgery.  \n\\- Increased operative time.  \n\\- Site morbidity.  \n\\- Variability in quality.  \n\\- Risk of disease transmission.\n\n【53】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Pain Be Expected During the Skin Grafting Procedure?**\n\n【54】Skin grafting can be a painful procedure, but the amount of pain experienced can vary depending on various factors, such as the size of the graft, the location of the body, the individual’s pain tolerance, and the type of anesthesia used. Skin grafting is done under local or general anesthesia and can have discomfort, swelling, and tenderness after the procedure.\n\n【55】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Thickness of a Skin Graft?**\n\n【56】The thickness of a skin graft varies depending on the size and location of the graft, as well as the specific technique used for harvesting and transplanting the skin. However, skin grafts are relatively thin, ranging from 0.2 mm to 0.8 mm.\n\n【57】#### **7.**删除换行**In What Ratio Is Skin Grafting Done?**\n\n【58】The ratio of skin grafting can vary depending on the injury's extent and severity and the affected area's location. Skin grafting can be done in different ratios, such as 1:1 (where the size of the skin graft matches the size of the wound), 1:2 (where the size of the skin graft is double the size of the wound), or other ratios as deemed appropriate by the medical professional.\n\n【59】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Reason for the Term ‘Skin Graft’?**\n\n【60】The term \"skin graft\" refers to a surgical procedure where skin tissue is removed from one part of the body and transplanted into another. It is called a \"skin graft\" because it involves grafting or transplanting skin tissue. \n\n【61】#### **9.**删除换行**Name Two Signs of Skin Graft Rejection.**\n\n【62】Two signs of skin graft rejection are:  \n\\- Redness and Swelling: One of the earliest signs of skin graft rejection is the appearance of redness and swelling around the graft site. The skin may feel warm to the touch, and there may be pain or discomfort.  \n\\- Blistering and Peeling: As the rejection reaction progresses, the skin may blister and peel. The blisters may be filled with fluid, and the skin may become itchy or tender. Sometimes, the skin graft may slough off, leaving behind an open wound.\n\n【63】#### **10.**删除换行**Which Fluid Is Found Under the Skin Graft?**\n\n【64】The fluid under a skin graft is called a seroma. It is a pocket of clear or yellowish fluid that can accumulate under the skin after surgery, including skin grafts. Seromas typically form when lymphatic vessels are damaged or removed during surgery, leading to the buildup of lymphatic fluid in the area.\n\n【65】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is Another Name for a Skin Transplant?**\n\n【66】Skin transplant is also called dermatoplasty or a skin graft. It is a surgical procedure involving skin transplantation from one body area to another. The purpose is to replace the lost or damaged skin. The skin for transplantation can be taken from the patient’s body (autograft) or a donor (allograft).\n\n【67】#### **12.**删除换行**Is Skin Grafting a Major Surgical Procedure?**\n\n【68】Yes, skin grafting is a major surgical procedure that involves removing healthy skin from one area of the body (the donor site) and transplanting it to another area (the recipient site) that has damaged or lost skin due to injury, disease, or surgery. Skin grafting is typically performed under general anesthesia and can be a complex and lengthy procedure, depending on the extent of the damage and the graft size.\n\n【69】#### **13.**删除换行**Is Skin Grafting an Expensive Procedure?**\n\n【70】The cost of skin grafting can vary depending on various factors such as the graft's size, the graft, the location of the graft, the complexity of the procedure, and the specific techniques the surgeon uses. Additionally, the cost can also depend on the location of the surgery and the healthcare provider performing the procedure. In general, skin grafting can be a costly procedure, especially if it requires multiple surgeries or extensive tissue reconstruction.\n\n【71】#### **14.**删除换行**Do Skin Grafts Heal Completely?**\n\n【72】Skin grafts can heal with time and proper care fully. However, the healing process can vary depending on the size and location of the graft, the individual's overall health, and the specific techniques the surgeon uses. During the first few weeks after the grafting procedure, the graft may appear discolored or raised, and discomfort or pain may occur. However, the graft should blend over time with the surrounding skin and become less noticeable.\n\n【73】#### **15.**删除换行**Can Skin Grafts Leave Scars?**\n\n【74】Yes, skin grafts typically leave scars. After a skin graft procedure, there will be a scar at both the donor and recipient sites. The size and appearance of scars depend on factors such as size, location, type of graft, type of skin used, patient’s healing ability, and the surgeon's skill.\n\n【75】#### **16.**删除换行**What Is the Success Rate of Skin Grafts?**\n\n【76】According to the American Academy of Dermatology, success rates for skin grafts typically range from 70 to 90 percent. However, factors that can increase the risk of graft failure include infection, poor blood supply to the area, inadequate graft preparation, and underlying medical conditions that affect wound healing.\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>*   Quick Overview of Skin Autografting  \n    http://ijmscr.org/index.php/ijmscrs/article/view/396\n*   Skin graft  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/surgery/skin-graft\n*   skin autograft  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532874/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Lack of nutritional therapy poses the risk of underfeeding in the postoperative course after major surgery resulting in malnutrition. The principle behind nutritional therapy is to shield both nutritional elements and the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept by focusing on the special nutritional needs of patients undergoing major surgery to prevent complications and enhance a high recovery rate.\n\n【2】1\\. The integration of nutrition therapy for the overall management of the patient.\n\n【3】2\\. Preoperative fasting.\n\n【4】3\\. Early oral feeding after surgery.\n\n【5】4\\. Initiating nutritional therapy immediately. If a nutritional risk becomes evident, then it is essential to keep metabolic control, like\n\n【6】1.  Blood glucose level.\n\n【7】2.  Reduction of factors that aggravate stress-related catabolism or disturb gastrointestinal function.\n\n【8】3.  Early mobilization stimulates protein synthesis and muscle function.\n\n【9】What Is the Need for Metabolic and Nutritional Care?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The metabolic strategy reduces perioperative stress and improves outcomes. Thus, prehabilitation may contribute to decreased postoperative complication rates and shortened hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing major surgery. Still, the fact is that nutritional therapy comprises all active elements and protein and carbohydrates required by the body that has undergone a stress-induced procedure or major surgery. An inadequate nutritional supply will reduce muscle mass (sarcopenia). Thus, malnutrition is associated with bad outcomes, and major surgical stress and trauma will induce catabolism. The extent of catabolism is linked to the magnitude of surgical stress and the outcome.\n\n【11】Is Preoperative Fasting Necessary?\n----------------------------------\n\n【12】Patients undergoing surgery, where the surgeon guides them for having no specific risk of aspiration, can drink clear fluids until two hours before anesthesia, and solids can be allowed until six hours before anesthesia. Patients at special risk undergoing emergency surgery and those with known delayed gastric emptying or gastroesophageal reflux having a great incidence of aspiration, regurgitation, or associated morbidity or mortality are exempted.\n\n【13】Can We Use Preoperative Metabolic Preparation Using Carbohydrates in Diabetic Patients?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】For perioperative discomfort, including anxiety or low blood glucose level, it is required to provide oral preoperative carbohydrates instead of overnight fasting or the night before and two hours before surgery should be administered. Thus evaluation of preoperative carbohydrates or blood glucose levels in patients undergoing major surgery is essential.\n\n【15】Preoperative intake of a carbohydrate drink with 800 ml the night before and 400 ml before surgery does not increase the risk of aspiration, or it is better to switch to fruit-based lemonade as a safe alternative with no difference in gastric emptying time. Thus oral carbohydrates have been documented to improve postoperative outcomes and control blood sugar levels.\n\n【16】How to Fulfill the Nutritional Demand of the Surgery Patient Who Cannot Receive from an Oral Route?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Enteral nutrition (EN) provides essential macro and micronutrients to patients unable to maintain adequate oral intake to satisfy their nutritional needs. EN is typically needed for neurological conditions impairing swallowing, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, or in case of inability to swallow due to mechanical ventilation and altered mental status. Many commercial EN formulas are available from standard formulations, disease-specific, peptide-based, and blenderized formulas. Enteral nutrition (EN) is crucial for individuals who cannot maintain sufficient nutritious input orally.\n\n【18】EN is used instead of parenteral nutrition (PN), which is associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects such as increased blood sugar level, electrolyte abnormalities, and infection rates, as well as complications such as PN-associated liver and metabolic bone disease. On the other hand, EN is more physiological and helps sustain gut integrity, supporting immune function and protecting against gut atrophy.\n\n【19】What Are the Indications for Enteral Approach?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【20】A variety of physiological or medical reasons may cause inadequate intake.\n\n【21】*   Dysphagia.\n\n【22】*   Parkinson's disease.\n\n【23】*   Conditions such as head and neck cancers.\n\n【24】*   Enormously altered mental status due to dementia.\n\n【25】*   Mechanical ventilation.\n\n【26】*   Hepatic or metabolic encephalopathy.\n\n【27】*   Short bowel syndrome (SBS).\n\n【28】*   Gastroparesis, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\n\n【29】*   Age above 70 years.\n\n【30】*   Supine position (head of bed not elevated).\n\n【31】*   Impaired gastric motility.\n\n【32】What Are the Sites of the Enteral Approach?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Enteral nutrition is required to maintain adequate nutritional status if the patient cannot achieve the nutrition through the oral route. But, if the patient does not tolerate (EN) enteral nutrition, switch to the parenteral route. EN feeding sites are either gastric or post-pyloric. The post-pyloric sites are duodenal or jejunal (behind the ligament of Treitz). The definitive site for feeding relies on several aspects, including the desired EN modality, risk for aspiration, and specific medical conditions. For example, jejunal feedings may be chosen in patients with severe acute pancreatitis to bypass stimulating the pancreas and gallbladder. Based on the enteral approach, the feeding site has specific types of feeding tubes like gastric and post-pyloric. Based on the duration of feeding, it is categorized as short-term and long-term.\n\n【34】What Are the Enteral Formulations?\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】Enteral formulas differ in caloric content from 1.0 to 2.0 kcal/mL. Formulas are composed of different sources like:\n\n【36】*   **Carbohydrates**: Provides 30 % to 60 % energy carbohydrates with standard or polymeric formulas obtained from sucrose, fructose, solids, or sugar.\n\n【37】*   **Protein**: Formulas deliver 10 % to 25 % energy from protein sources, including milk, whey, casein, caseinates, or soy.\n\n【38】*   **Fat**: Provides 10 % to 45 % energy from fat sources, including canola oil, soy lecithin, safflower oil corn oil.\n\n【39】Based on the formulations:\n\n【40】*   **Semi-Elemental Formula**: Partly hydrolyzed and used for dysfunction in individuals' GI (gastrointestinal) tract.\n\n【41】*   **Elemental Formula**: Fully hydrolyzed and used only for people unable to tolerate semi-elemental formulas.\n\n【42】*   **Disease-Specific Enteral Formula**: Special formulas are known for medical conditions including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wound healing, chronic kidney disease, liver failure, and compromised immune system. These products have variable macronutrient and micronutrient ranges established on specific disease states (like high protein for wound healing).\n\n【43】**Conclusion:**\n\n【44】Metabolism is the principle cycle of the body, which requires essential nutrients to carry out the physiological process and synthesis of the body's building blocks and provide energy. Thus, in major surgery, the body becomes stressed; however, the stress-induced body is more prone to release catabolic hormones and chemical mediators. Thus glycolysis (breakdown of the protein glucose to maintain the energy supply to the vital organ) requires more nutrients to maintain the physiological balance.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   ESPEN guideline: Clinical nutrition in surgery  \n    https://www.espen.org/files/ESPEN-guideline\\_Clinical-nutrition-in-surgery.pdf\n*   Perioperative Nutritional Support: A Review of Current Literature  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9030898/\n*   Role of nutrition in gastroenterological surgery  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6422822/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "257136cc-5233-46e1-915a-20a62f299781", "title": "Laron Syndrome - Prevelance, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management", "text": "【0】Laron Syndrome - Prevelance, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Laron syndrome, also known as Laron-type dwarfism, is a rare genetic disorder in which there is a deficit of response to growth hormones. People with Laron syndrome have short stature and other physical features, caused by mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene.\n\n【2】What Is Laron Syndrome?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Laron syndrome, also known as growth hormone sensitivity syndrome, is an uncommon disorder characterized by the body's inability to effectively utilize growth hormones. The typical characteristic of Laron syndrome is dwarfism or short stature. The pituitary gland, located in the brain, produces a chemical substance called growth hormone, which plays a crucial role in facilitating growth and development. People affected with Laron syndrome are of normal size at birth, but they show delayed growth from childhood resulting in short stature. If the condition is left untreated for long, males attain a maximum height of 4.5 feet, and females reach a height of four feet.\n\n【4】What Is the Prevalence of Laron Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Laron syndrome or Laron dwarfism is a rare disorder. Only 350 people in the world have been diagnosed with this condition. The largest group of people who were diagnosed with this condition live in Southern Ecuador. However, studies have suggested that people diagnosed with Laron syndrome are less likely to acquire cancer and type 2 diabetes. In addition, despite obesity, people with Laron syndrome are less likely to develop other diseases. However, the lifespan of these individuals is less than that of unaffected individuals.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Laron Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】Laron syndrome is a genetic disorder and is caused by mutations or defects in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene. This gene contains information and instructions for synthesizing a protein known as the growth hormone receptor. Usually, this receptor is present on the outer membrane of the liver cells. As the name suggests, the growth hormone receptor binds to the growth hormone, and the two fit together like a lock and key. When the growth hormone binds to its receptors, it stimulates cell growth and division. The production of insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) from the liver cells is also stimulated by the growth hormone. Growth hormone and IGF-1 have several effects on the growth and function of the different parts of the body. The problem arises due to variations or mutations in the GHR. These mutations impair the abilities of the receptors to bind the growth hormone or trigger signaling of the cells. As a result, the cells cannot respond even if the growth hormone is available. This inability of the cells to respond to the growth hormone is known as growth hormone insensitivity. As a result of this insensitivity, the growth and functions of many areas of the body get disrupted. However, the mechanism by which mutations in the GHR gene occurs is still a topic of research. Growth hormone insensitivity also alters the mechanism of action of insulin. As a result, people with Laron syndrome have increased insulin sensitivity and are less likely to develop diabetes.\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Laron Dwarfism?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome vary from person to person. Laron syndrome symptoms that are commonly seen include the following:\n\n【10】*   Truncal obesity (accumulation of fats around the abdomen).\n\n【11】*   Tooth agenesis (absence of one or more teeth or the failure of tooth development).\n\n【12】*   Short stature.\n\n【13】*   Micrognathia (a condition in which the lower jaw is small in size).\n\n【14】*   Microdontia (decreased size of the tooth).\n\n【15】*   Hypoplastic or small nasal bridge.\n\n【16】*   Increased height of the forehead.\n\n【17】*   Delayed rate of skeletal maturation.\n\n【18】*   Delayed tooth eruption.\n\n【19】*   Underdevelopment or absence of the nose or its parts.\n\n【20】*   Endocrine system abnormalities.\n\n【21】*   Abnormal morphology of the face.\n\n【22】*   Underdeveloped eyebrows.\n\n【23】*   Short or stubby toes.\n\n【24】*   Delayed motor development.\n\n【25】*   Underdeveloped penis.\n\n【26】*   Delayed pubertal growth.\n\n【27】*   The fingers or toes appear short.\n\n【28】*   Abnormality in the elbow joints.\n\n【29】*   The patient appears aged.\n\n【30】*   Degeneration or wear of the articular cartilage.\n\n【31】*   Poor intellect.\n\n【32】*   Excessive sweating.\n\n【33】*   High-pitched voice.\n\n【34】*   Bluish discoloration of the sclera.\n\n【35】*   Abnormal morphology of the skull bones.\n\n【36】What Is the Inheritance Pattern of Laron Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Laron syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern meaning both copies of the GHR gene are mutated or defective. The parents of the individual having an autosomal recessive condition carry one copy of the defective gene. However, they do not present with any signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\n【38】How Is Laron Syndrome Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】Laron syndrome diagnosis begins with a thorough medical history of the patient’s condition. The diagnostic procedures are described below:\n\n【40】*   **Medical History -** A medical history is a verbal communication between the doctor and the patient. It helps the doctor recognize the patient’s illness and gives him a general idea about his medical condition.\n\n【41】*   **Physical Examination -** The physical examination allows the doctor to check the physical signs of Laron dwarfism. For example, a patient suffering from Laron dwarfism appears small in height and has a characteristic facial appearance.\n\n【42】*   **Laboratory Tests -** Laboratory tests are done to check a sample of the patient’s blood, urine, and body tissues to diagnose diseases. Patients suffering from Laron syndrome usually present with hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) and hypercholesterolemia (elevated blood cholesterol levels).\n\n【43】*   **Genetic Analysis With Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -** It is the gold standard for diagnosing Laron syndrome. A sample of the patient’s tissues will be taken and tested in the laboratory for mutations in the GHR gene.\n\n【44】How Is Laron Syndrome Managed?\n------------------------------\n\n【45】Currently, there are no medications or treatment plans available for Laron syndrome. However, the treatment aims to improve the growth of the affected individual. The only treatment option available to manage Laron syndrome is subcutaneous injections of IGF-1. This is because IGF-1 stimulates brain growth, height, and metabolic abnormalities produced by IGF-1 deficiency. It also helps increase blood glucose levels, lowers cholesterol, and increases muscle strength. Therefore, IGF-1 and growth hormone levels must be carefully monitored in patients undergoing the treatment. The following medications help manage Laron syndrome:\n\n【46】*   **Mecasermin -** This medication helps in the long-term treatment of growth failure in children suffering from severe deficiency of IGF-1 or the deletion of the growth hormone genes.\n\n【47】*   **Mecasermin Rinfabate -** It is used to treat growth failure in children with IGF-1 or growth hormone deficiency.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】Laron syndrome is a rare genetic condition that mainly affects children. The typical facial and bodily appearance of the patient makes it easier for the doctors to diagnose this condition. Predicting the prognosis of the disease is challenging, as only a limited number of individuals have been diagnosed with this condition. In addition, there is no specific cure for this disease, but certain drugs are available to help overcome the symptoms of this condition and improve growth hormone levels.

When someone consumes this chemical, they develop calcium hydroxide poisoning. Calcium hydroxide can be found in these products. Cement, limewater, numerous industrial solvents and cleaners (thousands to a million different construction products, flooring strippers, brick cleaners, cement thickening chemicals, and many others), several hair relaxers and straighteners, and slaked lime are just a few examples.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Routes of Exposure to Calcium Hydroxide?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The different routes of exposure to calcium hydroxide are:\n\n【4】*   **Ingestion:** According to the National Institutes of Health, accidentally ingesting calcium hydroxide can result in severe throat pain, a burning sensation in the mouth, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody feces or vomit, rapidly dropping blood pressure, and collapse. Additionally, this kind of poisoning can cause blood pH to become excessively alkaline, which can harm organs. If calcium hydroxide is unintentionally ingested, call poison control or other emergency services right away. The victim should be given water or milk to drink right away unless they are vomiting or displaying other symptoms that would make swallowing challenging, or unless a doctor or poison specialist instructs them otherwise.\n\n【5】*   **External Exposure:** Depending on the precise position and strength of the calcium hydroxide solution, external exposure to the substance can result in a number of issues. If the skin gets exposed, it can result in burns, excruciating irritation, and necrosis, while exposure to the eyes can result in excruciating discomfort and either temporary or permanent vision loss. Calcium hydroxide should be cleaned off excess amounts with a cloth, and the affected skin should be regularly rinsed with water if it has been exposed to the skin. Contaminated clothing should also be removed. Although all cases of external exposure should get rapid medical attention, victims of calcium hydroxide exposure to the eyes should flush them with water constantly for the first 15 minutes after exposure. In accordance with Absolute Astronomy, calcium hydroxide is frequently utilized in no-lye hair relaxer treatments; however, the FDA emphasizes that improper use of these products could result in burning and harm to the hair and scalp.\n\n【6】*   **Inhalation:** Calcium hydroxide inhalation through the mouth or nose can also result in acute, severe, and sometimes fatal consequences. Inflammation of the throat and nasal passages can cause pain and swelling, which can narrow airways and make breathing difficult or impossible. Breathing may become more difficult if calcium hydroxide particles enter the lungs. Emergency services should be informed promptly after transferring victims of this kind of exposure to a fresh air environment. It might be necessary to administer oxygen and provide emergency breathing support.\n\n【7】*   **Chronic Exposure:** Calcium hydroxide's material safety data sheet states that prolonged skin contact could have negative health effects. Since certain hair relaxers contain calcium hydroxide as an active ingredient, these symptoms may appear with lengthy, frequent usage of those products. Severe skin irritation and dermatitis are frequent signs of this kind of exposure.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Calcium Hydroxide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The signs of calcium hydroxide poisoning in various body regions are listed below.\n\n【10】**1\\. Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Problems:**\n\n【11】*   Vision loss.\n\n【12】*   Throat ache is quite bad.\n\n【13】*   Severe ache or burning in the lips, tongue, ears, eyes, or ear canal.\n\n【14】**2\\. Intestines and Stomach:**\n\n【15】*   Stool with blood.\n\n【16】*   Burns in the esophagus, the food pipe.\n\n【17】*   Intense stomach discomfort.\n\n【18】*   Vomiting.\n\n【19】*   Throwing up blood.\n\n【20】**3\\. Blood and Heart:**\n\n【21】*   Collapse.\n\n【22】*   Rapidly lowering blood pressure (shock).\n\n【23】*   Severe alteration in the blood's pH equilibrium causes harm to all of the body's organs.\n\n【24】**4\\. Airways and Lungs:**\n\n【25】*   Respiratory difficulties (due to chemical inhalation).\n\n【26】*   Swelling of the throat (which may also make breathing difficult).\n\n【27】**5\\. Skin:**\n\n【28】*   Burns.\n\n【29】*   Holes (necrosis) in the tissues or skin below.\n\n【30】*   Irritation.\n\n【31】What Should Be Done When Someone Has Calcium Hydroxide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】*   Seek immediate medical attention. Unless a medical professional or poison control center instructs them to avoid making the patient vomit.\n\n【33】*   For at least 15 minutes, flush with water if the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes.\n\n【34】*   Unless otherwise directed by a clinician, give the patient water or milk right away if the substance was ingested. If the patient is experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, or a loss of consciousness, one should not offer them water or milk.\n\n【35】*   If they inhale the toxin, move the person to get fresh air.\n\n【36】What to Expect in the Emergency Room?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】The patient's vital indicators, such as temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure, will be measured and observed by the healthcare professional. As necessary, symptoms will be treated. The following tests may be performed:\n\n【38】*   During a bronchoscopy, a camera is inserted down the throat to check for burns in the lungs and airways.\n\n【39】*   A chest X-ray.\n\n【40】*   ECG or heart tracing.\n\n【41】How Is Calcium Hydroxide Toxicity Treated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Treatment for calcium hydroxide toxicity may include the following:\n\n【43】*   Fluid administration (IV) through a vein is one form of treatment.\n\n【44】*   Medication for symptom management.\n\n【45】*   Gastric lavage involves passing a tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash it out.\n\n【46】*   Irrigation of the skin, either daily or once every few hours.\n\n【47】*   Skin burn removal surgery.\n\n【48】*   Breathing assistance, such as a tube inserted through the mouth into the lungs and attached to a ventilator.\n\n【49】What Is the Prognosis of Calcium Hydroxide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Depending on how much poison was ingested and how promptly treatment was given, the patient's prognosis will vary. The likelihood of recovery is improved the sooner medical assistance is provided.\n\n【51】Such toxins can have negative impacts on many bodily organs when ingested. Even months after the material was initially ingested, burns in the airway or digestive system might result in tissue necrosis, which can cause infection, shock, and death. These tissues may develop scars, which could cause breathing, swallowing, and digestion problems in the long run.\n\n【52】Calcium hydroxide can cause serious, potentially permanent lung damage if it is inhaled (aspiration). A chemical burn to the eye might leave a person permanently blind.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Calcium hydroxide will irritate and burn the skin when it comes into touch with the eye and skin, which will lead to eye damage. When calcium hydroxide is breathed in, it irritates the nose, throat, and lungs, resulting in coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulties. Calcium hydroxide can lead to issues like emphysema, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues when inhaled. Therefore, calcium hydroxide must be handled carefully. When it comes in contact with the skin, wiping it off right away can lessen the calcium hydroxide's effects.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hazardous Substance Factsheet  \n    https://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/0322.pdf\n*   Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Calcium Hydroxide  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0092.pdf\n*   Calcium Hydroxide Poisoning  \n    https://ufhealthjax.org/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contentID=002910&projectTypeID=1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It affects both the lungs and heart. Hence, this infection is also known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The mortality rate of hantavirus infection is relatively higher than other virus infections. This viral infection cannot spread from one individual to another. Hence, it is not contagious. Rodents act as a carrier of hantavirus infection. There are several types of rodents. The spread of hantavirus occurs from mammals like rats and mice to humans. Hantavirus infection is an airborne infection.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Hantavirus Infection?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Hantavirus infection is most commonly present in the Northern and Southern parts of America.\n\n【4】*   The deer mouse present in Central America acts as a common carrier. It causes kidney-related disorders through saliva or droppings.\n\n【5】*   People who reside in areas containing rice rats are infected with hantavirus infection because it contaminates the food with saliva and urine.\n\n【6】*   White-tailed mice spread the infection to a human through the air from their excreta and fluids. The infection also spreads if the mice bites or scratch the individual. These viruses circulate in the blood and reach the heart and lungs and cause dysfunction.\n\n【7】*   Cotton rat is the common cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The disease becomes severe during spring and summer. If the individual touches the things contaminated by rodents and touches the nose, mouth, and eyes without washing the hands, it results in infection.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Hantavirus Infection?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The hantavirus infection progresses rapidly and causes life-threatening conditions. The symptoms of hantavirus infection are similar to the symptoms of normal flu. They are as follows;\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Wifi Family: Does your family connect with emotional bonds between them?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Viral Pneumonia - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>What precautions should I take if I tested positive for swine flu?</u>\n\n【15】*   **Fever -** The hantavirus affects the immune system and increases the body temperature. High fever results in headaches.\n\n【16】*   **Chills** \\- The hantavirus infection causes chills during the night with trouble breathing.\n\n【17】*   **Muscle Pain -** The hantavirus affects the muscle and causes pain, especially in the lower abdomen.\n\n【18】*   **Vomiting -** The hantavirus infection causes indigestion and vomiting.\n\n【19】*   **Cough -** The hantavirus infects the upper respiratory tract and causes cough with mucus production.\n\n【20】*   **Respiratory Illness -** If the hantavirus infection spreads to the lobes of the lungs, it causes fluid accumulation. This interferes with lung function and causes shortness of breath.\n\n【21】*   **Low Blood Pressure -** The body becomes severely dehydrated due to a hantavirus infection, which results in low blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.\n\n【22】What Are the Risk Factors for Hantavirus Infection?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   The farmers who store grains in closed sheds for a longer period increase the proliferation of rice rats. The workers involved in pest control are exposed to the hantavirus infection.\n\n【24】*   The rodent nests are present in buildings that are locked and left unused for a long time. Workers involved in cleaning the cabins are at higher risk of exposure to hantavirus infection.\n\n【25】*   There is a high chance of hantavirus infection spread through seasonal cabins.\n\n【26】*   The mice might enter the unprotected shelters made by the people during the camp or hiking and spread the infection.\n\n【27】*   The basements present in the construction sites are piled up with unused materials. It increases the risk of rat multiplication.\n\n【28】How to Prevent Hantavirus Infection?\n------------------------------------\n\n【29】The individual should take necessary precautions at home and the workplace to prevent hantavirus infection.\n\n【30】*   **Cover the Holes -** The rodents can enter the holes that are small as six millimeters. These holes should be sealed with mesh wires or cement. The gap left in the wraps during camp should be blocked with metal flashing.\n\n【31】*   **Clean the Storage -** The workers should maintain hygiene in the food storage cabinets by frequent cleaning methods. The utensils must be cleaned after every use to prevent infection from spreading through food.\n\n【32】*   **Airtight Containers -** The food grains must be stored in airtight containers to prevent rodents. The garbage must be stored in cans with closed lids.\n\n【33】*   **Prevent Nesting -** The materials such as garden waste, grass, and brushes must be cleared to prevent nesting.\n\n【34】*   **Traps -** Use traps with springs to capture the rodents. Extreme caution should be taken while using poison baits. The individual should wash their hands after using these traps.\n\n【35】*   **Stay Away -** The compost bins and woodpiles should be kept away from the living area to prevent hantavirus infection.\n\n【36】*   **Ventilation -** The unused cabins should have proper ventilation and must be opened frequently to avoid droppings, smell, and infection spread.\n\n【37】How Is Hantavirus Infection Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【38】The hantavirus infection usually causes illness after two to three weeks of exposure to the hantavirus.\n\n【39】*   **Blood Test -** It is usually diagnosed using a blood test. The sample is collected from the individuals exposed to rodents. These blood samples are sent to the lab for microscopic examination. The presence of antibodies against the hantavirus in the blood sample indicates the hantavirus infection.\n\n【40】*   **Culture Test -** The mucus is collected from the patients suspected of hantavirus infection. It is examined using a culture test. The proliferation and growth of the hantavirus can be detected using the culture medium.\n\n【41】What Are the Treatment Methods for Hantavirus Infection?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The treatments for hantavirus infection are as follows;\n\n【43】*   **Oxygenation -** Severe infection might contaminate the blood and reduce the oxygen supply. In such conditions, the patient has ensured oxygen supply. The carbon dioxide is removed, and oxygen is supplied through blood.\n\n【44】*   **Ventilatory Support -** Some patients who have trouble breathing due to a hantavirus infection require artificial ventilation for respiration. The flexible tube is inserted through the windpipe to open the airways and proper functioning of the same.\n\n【45】*   **Medication -** There is no specific medication for a hantavirus infection. The fever due to the hantavirus is treated with antibiotics. However, antimalarial drugs like Chloroquine are used in the earlier stage of hantavirus infection to prevent further spread.\n\n【46】**Conclusion -**\n\n【47】The workers involved in cleaning the droppings should follow certain measures like wearing gloves and masks. The gloves made up of thick rubber or plastic prevent hantavirus infection to a greater extent. These gloves must be washed with disinfectants after every use. The mice that are found dead should be collected after using a bleach solution or alcohol disinfectant. Spray the household disinfectant over the droppings or nest and wait for five to ten minutes. Use thick disposable napkins to collect this waste and dispose of them in the garbage. Mop the area with an antiseptic soap solution to prevent hantavirus infection. The individual should consult a medical professional if he is exposed to rodents. The employer must conduct medical camps once in three months for the employees who work on construction sites. This helps to notice the infection at an earlier stage and reduces the mortality rate.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hantavirus Infections  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/hantavirusinfections.html\n*   Hantavirus Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513243/\n*   A Global Perspective on Hantavirus Ecology, Epidemiology, and Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863364/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is located in the pelvis and shaped like a pear. The uterus holds the developing baby during pregnancy. It can stretch through the pregnancy to accommodate the baby and shrink back in size after delivery. Uterine prolapse occurs when the uterus slips or sags from its original position and into the vagina.\n\n【2】What Is Uterine Prolapse?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Uterine prolapse is a condition where the supporting structures of the uterus, like pelvic floor muscles and ligaments, become weak over time. As a result, the uterus drops down or protrudes out of the vagina. The severity of the prolapse can vary depending on the weakening of the uterus' supporting system. Usually, mild uterine prolapse does not require any treatment, but treatment is required in a severe prolapse where the uterus may have slipped into the vagina. This prolapse generally creates a bulge or lump outside of the vagina.\n\n【4】What Can Cause Uterine Prolapse?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】The uterus is held in position by a group of pelvic muscles and ligaments. These muscles are known as the pelvic floor muscles. When these muscles and the ligaments weaken, they can not hold the uterus in position, which can lead to sagging of the uterus. This can occur due to a number of reasons:\n\n【6】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【7】*   Obesity.\n\n【8】*   Difficult labor or trauma during the time of delivery.\n\n【9】*   Giving birth to a large baby.\n\n【10】*   Aging causes loss of muscle tone leading to pelvic muscle weakness.\n\n【11】*   Chronic coughing or straining.\n\n【12】*   Chronic constipation.\n\n【13】*   Low level of estrogen after menopause.\n\n【14】*   Continuous weight lifting.\n\n【15】*   Major surgery in the pelvic area leads to loss of external support.\n\n【16】*   Smoking.\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Uterine Prolapse?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【18】There will be no obvious symptoms in mild cases of uterine prolapse. But, in severe cases, as the uterus slips further out of position, it can cause pressure on other pelvic organs like the bowel or the bladder. The symptoms can worsen when women walk or stand for long periods because gravity puts extra pressure on the pelvic muscles. The symptoms of uterine prolapse are as follows:\n\n【19】*   A feeling of pressure or heaviness in the pelvic region.\n\n【20】*   Pain during intercourse.\n\n【21】*   Pain in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower back.\n\n【22】*   Uterine tissue slips through the opening of the vagina.\n\n【23】*   Frequent bladder infections.\n\n【24】*   Urination problems include urine frequency (the need to urinate frequently), urine incontinence (involuntary loss of urine), inability to empty the bladder completely, or urine urgency (sudden urge to urinate).\n\n【25】*   Constipation.\n\n【26】*   Excess or unusual vaginal discharge.\n\n【27】*   The sensation of looseness in the tone of vaginal tissue during sex.\n\n【28】How Is Uterine Prolapse Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】During diagnosis, a pelvic examination is carried out, in which a doctor asks to bear down as in having a bowel movement which helps the doctor assess the severity of uterus prolapse. They may also ask to tighten the pelvic muscles as if trying to stop a stream of urine. This will help to check the strength of the pelvic muscles.\n\n【30】*   The doctor will also examine the patient while they lie down, stand, and cough or strain to check the increased pressure in their abdomen.\n\n【31】*   In ureteral obstruction cases due to complete prolapse, renal sonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) will be performed.\n\n【32】*   In severe incontinence cases, the doctor might recommend tests to measure bladder functions called urodynamic testing.\n\n【33】*   An ultrasound scan will be performed to rule out other pelvic problems.\n\n【34】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sometimes done if there is more than one prolapsed organ.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment for Uterine Prolapse?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【36】There are two options for treating uterine prolapse: nonsurgical and surgical. The doctors will provide treatment based on the severity of the prolapse, age, general health, and plan for childbirth. Treatment options can include the following:\n\n【37】**1) Nonsurgical Treatments:**\n\n【38】*   **Lifestyle Modifications** - If the uterine prolapse causes mild or no symptoms, simple lifestyle modifications may help prevent the worsening of the prolapse and prevent complications. Lifestyle modifications include performing Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles, treating constipation, and losing weight.\n\n【39】*   **Vaginal Pessary** \\- A vaginal pessary is a rubber or plastic ring inserted into the vagina to support the sagging tissues. A doctor will fit a pessary, and it must be removed frequently for cleaning.\n\n【40】**2) Surgical Treatment:**\n\n【41】*   **Hysterectomy** - Uterine prolapse can be treated by surgically removing the uterus; this procedure is called a hysterectomy. This surgery is done through an abdominal incision (abdominal hysterectomy) or the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy). This is major surgery, and it is often a safe surgery, but removing the uterus means pregnancy is not possible after that. So the woman becomes infertile.\n\n【42】*   **Prolapse Repair Without Hysterectomy** \\- This surgical procedure involves placing the uterus back into its original position. This surgery is typically approached through the vagina, but in some cases, it can be done through the abdomen. This may be done by grafting the patient's own tissue, donor tissue, or synthetic material in the weekend pelvic floor tissues. This will provide support to the weekend pelvic structures.\n\n【43】How to Prevent Uterine Prolapse?\n--------------------------------\n\n【44】Preventing uterine prolapse is not always possible, but there are many ways to reduce the risk of developing uterine prolapse. A few lifestyle variations that can reduce the risk of prolapse include:\n\n【45】*   Maintaining a healthy body weight.\n\n【46】*   Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, so perform them regularly. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any exercise program.\n\n【47】*   It is essential to have a healthy diet to treat and prevent constipation. Drink plenty of water and eat high-fiber foods like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole-grain cereals. Consult a nutritionist for the best diet plan to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【48】*   Take treatment for coughing or respiratory disorders. Avoid smoking which can also cause severe cough.\n\n【49】*   Use proper lifting techniques and avoid heavy lifting. Use the legs instead of the back or waist when lifting heavy weights.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Uterine prolapse can occur due to many reasons, but old age is one of the most common etiology. In most cases, uterine prolapse does not cause any symptoms, but in severe cases, the symptoms can arise, which cause pain and discomfort, and other complications. Consult a physician when symptoms arise.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Uterine prolapse  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001508.htm\n*   Uterine Prolapse  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/uterine-prolapse</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "7ae8a73f-f69c-4192-8598-b5a7b79b425f", "title": "Central Venous Access - Indications, Types, and Complications", "text": "【0】Central Venous Access - Indications, Types, and Complications\n**Introduction :**\n\n【1】Central venous access (CVA) is when a long, thin, hollow plastic tube called a 'catheter' or 'line' is placed in a vein. It gives a way of putting regular intravenous (IV) medication. The advantage is that there is no need for further IV access sites.\n\n【2】The long catheter is put into a vein in the chest's arm, neck, or front. The catheter extends into a 'central vein' next to the heart. The larger central vein can endure the catheter line better than a small vein. As a result, the catheter can stay in place safely for weeks or months, even more than a year.\n\n【3】What Is a Central Venous Catheter?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】It helps take out blood and provides intravenous fluids, drugs, or blood transfusions. In a vein below the collarbone, a small, extensible tube is placed. It is inserted into the superior vena cava, a large vein located above the right side of the heart. A needle is placed into a port outside the body for blood collection or fluid administration.\n\n【5】What Are the Main Sites for Central Venous Catheters?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The three primary access for the placement of central venous catheters are :\n\n【7】*   The internal jugular vein.\n\n【8】*   Common femoral vein.\n\n【9】*   Subclavian veins.\n\n【10】These are the preferred sites for temporary central venous catheter placement. In addition, the basilic and brachial veins are utilized for mid-term and long-term central venous access. Finally, the internal jugular vein (IJ) is picked chiefly because of its definitive anatomy, accessibility, low complication rates, and the ability to employ ultrasound while performing the procedure.\n\n【11】What Are the Indications for Central Venous Catheters?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   There is a need for multiple infusions that might conflict with peripheral intravenous access, such as vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, and other medications.\n\n【13】*   Inability to earn venous access in emergencies.\n\n【14】*   Extracorporeal therapies, like hemodialysis (a process that purifies blood when kidneys do not function properly), plasmapheresis (removal, treatment, and exchange of blood plasma or other components from and into the blood circulation.), and continuous renal replacement therapy (restores kidney’s blood filtering function).\n\n【15】*   Hemodynamic monitoring.\n\n【16】*   Venous interventions include thrombolytic therapy, transvenous cardiac pacing, and intra-venous stenting.\n\n【17】What Medications Are Given Through CVA?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【18】There are different types of IV medications that are given repeatedly over a long period:\n\n【19】*   Intravenous antibiotic treatment.\n\n【20】*   Chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells).\n\n【21】*   Haemodialysis.\n\n【22】What Are the Different Types of CVA?\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】Various central venous access devices are available, with their own risks and benefits. Central venous access devices are usually classified based on the following:\n\n【24】*   **Duration of Use of a Catheter** - Dwell time; short-term, mid-term, long-term.\n\n【25】*   **Type of Insertion** - Central, peripheral.\n\n【26】*   **Location of Insertion** - Jugular, brachial.\n\n【27】*   **The Number of Lumens** -Single, double, or triple.\n\n【28】*   Whether the catheter is implanted or not, and to what extent, like tunneled, totally invested.\n\n【29】1.  **Nontunneled Catheters:** Nontunneled centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs) are placed percutaneously with the catheter leaving the skin in the region of the venous cannulation site. It may be single, double, triple, or quadruple lumen.\n\n【30】2.  **Implanted Catheters:** These are semi-permanent and can be removed if complications occur, or the device is no longer needed (completion of chemotherapy), or for patient comfort. Two types of implanted central venous devices are available: tunneled catheters and implantable venous access devices.\n\n【31】3.  **Tunneled Catheters:** Traverse a subcutaneous tunnel between the cathected vein and the skin exit site. The tunnel refers to the passage of a short length of the catheter from the site of skin entry to venous puncture, either with or without a cuff to anchor it in place and limit bacterial access.\n\n【32】4.  **Implantable (Ports):** These catheters pass from the cannulated vein under the skin and attach to a subcutaneous infusion port or reservoir placed into a subcutaneous pocket. Most often placed in the upper chest of adult patients, but in the upper extremity, abdominal wall, and lower extremity is also possible. They are typically used for shorter durations compared to other implanted ports.\n\n【33】5.  **Coated and Impregnated Catheters:** Antibiotic or antiseptic-impregnated CICCs and PICCs also Heparin-bonded catheters decrease complication rates like bacterial colonization and catheter-related infection.\n\n【34】6.  **Antimicrobial-Impregnated Catheters:** Coated catheters like Chlorhexidine-silver Sulfadiazine (CHSS) and Minocycline-Rifampin (MR) have an apparent benefit of antimicrobial. However, the efficacy and role in clinical care remain uncertain.\n\n【35】What Are the Complications of CVA?\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】Central line insertion can cause several complications, but the benefits should outweigh the risk of complications. Some of the difficulties are as follows:\n\n【37】1.  **Pneumothorax:** Pneumothorax is a condition that occurs when there is an air leakage in the spaces present between the chest wall and the chest lungs. Its incidence rate is the highest. A chest X-ray will be recommended if pneumothorax is doubted. The risk of pneumothorax is minimized using ultrasound guidance.\n\n【38】2.  **Vascular Perforation:** Perforation of vasculature by a catheter is a scary and potentially life-threatening complication. The incidence is extremely rare, particularly when lines are positioned guided by an ultrasound.\n\n【39】3.  **Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections:** All catheters can result in bacterial invasion in the bloodstream, which results in severe conditions that can be life-threatening in around 25% of cases.\n\n【40】4.  **Occlusion:** Venous catheters can become occluded by kinks in the catheter, and the backwash of blood into the catheter leads to thrombosis.\n\n【41】5.  **Misplacement:** Misplacement is expected when the person's anatomy is different or challenging due to injury or past surgery.\n\n【42】6.  **Venous Air Embolism:** Entry of air into venous circulation may cause a venous air embolism. It is a rare complication. However, it can be fatal (causing death).\n\n【43】How to Prevent Complications?\n-----------------------------\n\n【44】The recommendations regarding the risk reduction for infection of CVCs include:\n\n【45】*   The preferred site of insertion: To avoid the femoral vein if possible.\n\n【46】*   The selection of catheters: Includes those with minimal ports.\n\n【47】*   Use sterile gloves.\n\n【48】*   Use sterile drapes, caps, and masks.\n\n【49】*   Monitoring of catheter sites visually and with palpation regularly.\n\n【50】*   Use clean, non-sterile gloves while changing the dressing of intravascular catheters.\n\n【51】*   Both Chlorhexidine and Povidone-iodine are good skin cleansers and are safe to use.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】Central venous access is a frequently performed procedure, with approximately eight percent of hospitalized patients needing the same. Since they are commonly used, careful and regular surveillance is required to avoid infections. Keeping in mind the cons and pros of CVA, it has been proven life-saving for several people.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Central Lines (Central Venous Catheters)  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/central-lines.html\n*   Central Venous Catheter  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557798/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There can be single or multiple kidney cysts. The simple kidney cysts are mostly round or oval. Their size ranges from a pea to a golf ball. It is the most common kidney cyst and is generally non-cancerous or benign. These cysts are generally asymptomatic, but infections can make them symptomatic. They are accidentally detected during the diagnostic radiological examination of the abdomen. Simple kidney cysts are usually harmless; they do not enlarge the kidneys or reduce the kidney function, unlike the cysts in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that leads to chronic kidney disease.\n\n【2】**What Causes Simple Kidney Cysts?**\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Simple kidney cysts are not hereditary but are acquired. The exact cause of a simple kidney cyst is not known. Males are more likely to get kidney cysts. Their incidence increases with increasing age. The kidneys have very small tubules which collect freshly formed urine. When these tubules get blocked, small pouches may form on them. These pouches may detach and become simple kidney cysts. Certain medical conditions, such as polycystic kidney disease, can cause the cysts to grow in size. Medical conditions that cause simple or complex kidney cysts:\n\n【4】*   **Chronic Kidney Disease -** This disease impairs kidney function leading to kidney damage.\n\n【5】*   **Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease -** This is an inherited condition affecting the kidneys. It leads to scarring and reduced kidney function.\n\n【6】*   **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease** \\- This is a genetic disorder with the growth of several cysts within the kidney.\n\n【7】*   **Von Hippel-Lindau Disease -** This is an inherited disorder that causes the growth of tumors and cysts in some parts of the body.\n\n【8】*   **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex -** This is a rare multi-system genetic disease that causes the growth of non-cancerous tumors in the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin.\n\n【9】**What Are the Symptoms of Simple Kidney Cysts?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Usually, kidney cysts are asymptomatic. Rarely because of infections or other conditions, they enlarge in size, causing:\n\n【11】**Hematuria -** The presence of blood in the urine.\n\n【12】*   The cyst in the upper abdomen or back can become large, cause pain, and press against the bone and other organs.\n\n【13】*   Fever and chills.\n\n【14】*   Pain.\n\n【15】**Hypertension -** An increase in blood pressure.\n\n【16】*   In case the cyst blocks the ureters (the tube connecting the kidneys with the bladder), difficulty in passing urine is evident.\n\n【17】*   Presence of mass in the abdominal area.\n\n【18】**What Is the Epidemiology of Simple Kidney Cyst?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Simple renal cysts are very common. Their incidence increases with increasing age. Around 25% of individuals who are forty years or above and around 50% of those who are fifty years or above have simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts can double in size over a period of ten years. They are detected accidentally and are usually asymptomatic. More than one simple kidney cyst is seen in individuals with chronic renal disease who are on dialysis.\n\n【20】**How Are Simple Kidney Cysts Diagnosed?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Simple kidney cysts are often detected in radiographic imaging tests to diagnose other conditions. For detecting simple kidney cysts:\n\n【22】**Medical History -** The doctor will inquire about the medical problems that one had in the past. A detailed history of the development of any symptom is also noted.\n\n【23】**Imaging Tests-** They help to distinguish between a simple and complex cyst. Tests are:\n\n【24】*   **Kidney Ultrasound -** Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves and echoes to create images of the kidney and other organs.\n\n【25】*   **Kidney CT (computed tomography) Scan -** CT scan uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce images of the internal organs. This scan uses dyes or contrast media to differentiate the fluid-filled cysts from the tumors.\n\n【26】*   **Kidney MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) -** This technique uses magnetic fields, radio waves, and computer technology to create images of internal organs. They usually do not use dyes or contrast media.\n\n【27】The radiologist will differentiate between simple and complex cysts with the help of these radiographic images. At times they use the Bosniak CT system to rate the cysts. It divides the cysts into five categories, I, II, II-F, III, and IV. These ranks are based on complexity and possible malignancy. A cyst ranked in the I category does not need any imaging. Kidney cysts that fall into higher categories might need more imaging and treatment. Category IV cysts are most likely linked to cancer. If the diagnosis still remains unclear even after performing the imaging tests, then genetic testing is recommended. It can rule out conditions such as polycystic kidney disease.\n\n【28】**Lab tests include**\n\n【29】*   Urine Test.\n\n【30】*   Blood Tests.\n\n【31】**How Are Simple Kidney Cysts Treated?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Simple kidney cysts that are asymptomatic do not need any treatment. However, regular ultrasounds are advised to keep a check on the shape and size of the cysts. Cysts causing symptoms, such as pain or blockage of urine flow, should be treated.\n\n【33】*   **Drainage -** Few studies suggest draining or removing the cysts might help individuals with high blood pressure related to simple kidney cysts.\n\n【34】*   **Sclerotherapy -** Sclerotherapy is a procedure where a long needle is inserted through the skin into a cyst with the help of ultrasound used as a guide. It is used to drain a cyst. The cyst is drained with the help of a needle and injected with an alcoholic solution. This solution hardens the cyst. Thus, it cannot fill with fluid again. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia.\n\n【35】*   **Surgery -** In the case of a large cyst, laparoscopic surgery is recommended for removal. Laparoscopic surgery, also called keyhole surgery, is a minimally invasive technique involving several small cuts. It uses a laparoscope, thin tube-like equipment with a small video camera, and tiny instruments. The cyst is drained at first and then removed or burned away. This process is carried out under general anesthesia. The hospital stay is around one or two days.\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】Simple kidney cysts are small fluid-filled pouches within one or both kidneys. They are quite common. Usually, simple kidney cysts are asymptomatic, but in the presence of other conditions, they become symptomatic. The diagnosis is usually based on radiological findings. Asymptomatic cysts are not treated, while treatment is required for symptomatic cysts. The treatment involves drainage or surgery based on their size. The outlook is excellent after surgery, with very few complications.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Simple Renal Cyst  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499900/\n*   Simple Kidney Cysts  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/simple-kidney-cysts</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0e1884bd-e4ad-4059-a650-25b8f8479cfc", "title": "Bleach Ingestion - Mechanism, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Bleach Ingestion - Mechanism, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Bleach can be either a chlorine-based or a peroxide-based chemical. It is a compound used in most homes and workplaces as a disinfectant and whitening agent because of its ability to kill a wide variety of pathogens and being cost-effective, it is used worldwide.\n\n【2】This widespread nature of the chemical increases its chances of an accidental and potentially toxic ingestion. Different concentrations of bleach are available in the market; typical household bleach ranges from three to five percent at this level. It does not cause any damage beyond local irritation and minimal gastrointestinal effects. However, higher concentrations of bleach (up to 35 %) have been known to be used in industries and hospitals, and at this level, it has the potential to cause caustic injury. Although it is not life-threatening, it can cause severe complications like strictures, perforations, hypernatremia (excess sodium in the blood), etc.\n\n【3】For household bleach ingestions, conservative home management and supportive care would be sufficient, but ingestion of a higher dose of bleach would require emergency care.\n\n【4】What Is the Mechanism Behind the Action of Bleach?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Bleach has two functions-\n\n【6】1.  **Discoloration** \\- The commonly used household bleach causes discoloration or whitening by a mechanism called oxidation. Oxidation, by definition, means a gain in oxygen, the chlorine in the bleach reacts with the water (from the atmosphere or when diluted) and forms hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is unstable in nature, and it easily dissociates to form an acid and nascent oxygen. This oxygen molecule breaks the chemical bonds of the pigments, resulting in a loss of color. Some chemicals cause bleaching by reduction, too, but they are not used in regular households.\n\n【7】2.  **Denaturation**\\- This is the disinfecting part of the bleach. The acid and the oxygen released when the bleach comes in contact with water also denature (break the bonds) the proteins in bacteria. As a result, the molecules in the organism start to clump and liquefy, leading to its death, called liquefactive necrosis. The denaturation depends on the concentration of the bleach; for example, one percent of hypochlorite bleach can kill coronavirus in a minute. These effects of bleach are magnified when combined with other chemicals; for example- bleach is often mixed with ammonia to kill weeds, preserve cut flowers, etc.\n\n【8】How Does Bleach Ingestion Occur?\n--------------------------------\n\n【9】The ubiquitous nature of bleach makes individuals easily susceptible to its ingestion. The different forms of bleach that can cause its exposure is-\n\n【10】1.  **Aerosol** - Aerosolized form of bleach is preferred by many individuals due to its ease of application. When sprayed, the bleach molecules can be inhaled easily, affecting the lungs, eyes, and skin.\n\n【11】2.  **Immersion** \\- Bleach is a common disinfectant used for cleaning swimming pools. Accidental bleach overdose while cleaning can affect the swimmers' eyes, skin, and stomach (if swallowed).\n\n【12】3.  **Ingestion** \\- Some individuals intentionally ingest bleach due to emotional instability; often, they mix it with other chemicals like toilet bowl cleaners and other household cleaners. This can cause asphyxiation (oxygen deprivation), which can be life-threatening.\n\n【13】4.  **Aspiration** \\- Occasionally, bleach can be inhaled accidentally, which will cause damage to the lungs.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Bleach Ingestion?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Diluted bleach causes only mild-stomach irritation; however, industrial strength, which is at higher concentration, will cause serious symptoms, some of which are-\n\n【16】*   Burning of the eyes.\n\n【17】*   Burns in the windpipe.\n\n【18】*   Tightness in the chest.\n\n【19】*   Coma.\n\n【20】*   Cough due to the fumes.\n\n【21】*   Irritation of the exposed skin.\n\n【22】*   Low blood pressure.\n\n【23】*   Swelling of the throat will cause difficulty in breathing.\n\n【24】*   Bradycardia (reduced heartbeat).\n\n【25】*   Vomiting.\n\n【26】*   Weakness.\n\n【27】*   Stomach pain.\n\n【28】*   Drooling.\n\n【29】*   Gagging sensation.\n\n【30】*   Delirium.\n\n【31】*   Shock.\n\n【32】The symptoms depend on the concentration of the product, volume of ingestant, duration of exposure, and potential co-ingestants.\n\n【33】How Is Bleach Ingestion Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【34】Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms. If the ingestion is accidental and the symptoms are not severe, treatment can be done at home; this includes-\n\n【35】*   Flush the eyes.\n\n【36】*   Wash the exposed area with water and soap.\n\n【37】*   Drinking water or milk will be soothing if the chemical is swallowed.\n\n【38】If the symptoms are severe, the individual must be admitted to a hospital where the provider will measure and monitor the person’s vital signs. The following investigation will be done to assess the damage-\n\n【39】*   **Blood and Urine Tests** \\- These are done to check for signs of inflammation that might take place after ingestion.\n\n【40】*   **Bronchoscopy**\\- Done to check for any burns in the airway.\n\n【41】*   **Endoscopy** \\- This is performed to check for burns in the esophagus (food pipe) and the stomach.\n\n【42】*   **Chest X-ray** \\- This will help to confirm tracheal (windpipe) inflammation and pulmonary (lungs) edema (swelling).\n\n【43】*   **Computerized tomographic (CT) scan** - It is a less invasive procedure than endoscopy to detect organ burns.\n\n【44】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** \\- to check for any signs of bradycardia (reduced heart rate).\n\n【45】Based on the investigations, the patient may receive the following:\n\n【46】1.  In case of accidental exposure to the eyes, the patient will be given a topical anesthetic like Tetracaine or Proparacaine to help control the pain. Additionally, the eyes will be irrigated with copious amounts of saline to prevent or reduce corneal edema.\n\n【47】2.  Albuterol is given to patients who inhale bleach and show signs of bronchospasm (narrowing of the muscles in the lungs). More aggressive treatment will be necessary for asthmatics (individuals suffering from asthma).\n\n【48】3.  In patients who have ingested bleach, inducing vomiting through activated charcoal or other methods is contraindicated due to the risk of secondary burns and aspiration.\n\n【49】4.  Patients should be given plenty of water or milk to reduce the bleach concentration.\n\n【50】Apart from these, patients should be placed on a cardiac monitor, and venous access should be obtained. Careful attention should be paid to the airway, breathing, and circulation, and if the patient is suffering from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, intravenous bicarbonate or buffer solutions can be started.\n\n【51】Can Bleach Ingestion Be Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【52】*   Bleach ingestion is a preventable injury; individuals are advised to familiarize themselves with safety precautions before using it.\n\n【53】*   Proper labeling and storage are mandatory while handling strong chemicals; care should also be taken not to mix chemicals.\n\n【54】*   While handling bleach, it is advised to wear safety goggles, long-sleeved garments, and gloves to prevent exposure.\n\n【55】*   Adequate ventilation is necessary while bleaching indoors, and pets and children should be kept away from the bleached area for at least 8 hours to 12 hours.\n\n【56】*   Patients with known lung conditions should avoid using bleach, as the fumes will only worsen the preexisting condition.\n\n【57】**Conclusion:**\n\n【58】Bleach ingestion is often accidental, with many recovering without any residual effects. The major organs affected are the skin, eyes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Skiing and eye irritation can be resolved with thorough irrigation with water, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract; however, they will need medical intervention. Long-term follow-up is advised in these patients to prevent complications.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bleach Toxicity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441921/\n*   Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Scan in Detection of Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Injuries Following Caustic Ingestion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5585831/\n*   The clinical toxicology of sodium hypochlorite  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30689457/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Argyria is a rare dermatological disorder caused by exposure or the ingestion of silver particles. Silver is used in day-to-day activity in jewelry, present in water content and medications. Discoloration of the skin depends upon the amount of silver exposure, a small amount of silver for a prolonged or a large amount of silver for a short time. The hypopigmentation leads to a state of gray, grayish-blue, or metallic silver color, and the change is permanent.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Argyria?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The amount of silver deposition causes argyria; it can turn the skin, mucosal membrane, eyes, and even internal organs into grayish-blue color, especially in the areas which mostly have sunlight exposure.\n\n【4】The types of causes can be related to -\n\n【5】1. **Occupational Exposure** - The worker working in silver mining, silver refining, and silver metal alloy has a lot of exposure to silver particles; in the factories, silver particles are present in the air that the worker inhales, and from the lungs, the blood carries the particles and deposits them into the skin, causing argyria.\n\n【6】2. **Medication and Drugs** - The administration of drugs having silver salts like-\n\n【7】*   Silver nitrate is used for the treatment of varicose veins and bleeding gums.\n\n【8】*   Silver salts are used for irrigating urethral, gastric lavage, and wound dressing.\n\n【9】*   Silver Sulfadiazine ointments are used in infections and burns.\n\n【10】3\\. **Diseases** - Colloidal silver dietary supplements are indicated for the treatment of cancer, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), arthritis, and diabetes.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>How to treat skin issues in the foreskin?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Neuronal Migration Disorders - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Hemimegaloencephaly: Understanding the Rare Brain Disorder</u>\n\n【16】4\\. **Silver Restorations** - Surgical and dental procedures using silver sutures and silver restorations used for dental cavities.\n\n【17】5\\. **Sensitive Skin** \\- Some people with highly sensitive skin may have a high chance of developing argyria by wearing silver ornaments and ear or nose piercings with silver-coated needles.\n\n【18】6\\. **Smoking** \\- Silver Acetate is advised for quitting smoking.\n\n【19】What Are the Clinical Features of Argyria?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Argyria can be generalized or localized pigmentation, and it can be related to the areas that are more exposed to sunlight.\n\n【21】*   In generalized argyria, the hypopigmentation starts with a small stain and gradually involves the large areas.\n\n【22】*   The pigmentation depends on the silver salts deposited on the skin, the degree of exposure to sunlight, and the amount of melanin production that results in skin discoloration.\n\n【23】*   More silver exposure with a short period of time and a small amount of silver with prolonged exposure affects the skin and lead to grayish-blue discoloration.\n\n【24】*   By ingestion, silver gets collected in the stomach, and the acid in the lining of the stomach walls erodes the silver particles, through which the silver travels in the bloodstream and deposits in the skin, and affects the internal organs.\n\n【25】*   Localized argyria depends on the site of the exposure; it can occur in the white of the eyes by prolonged use of eyedrops containing silvers, also known as - Argyrosis.\n\n【26】*   Discoloration can be seen in nails and earlobes.\n\n【27】*   The localized argyria can be an initiation of generalized argyria.\n\n【28】**What Is Silver Toxicity?**\n\n【29】Silver toxicity occurs due to the excessive deposition of silver particles in the bloodstream. The inhalation or ingestion of silver particles, depending on the amount of silver and the period of exposure, leads to the accumulation of silver in the different internal organs. The excessive silver particles can be excreted out from the body in the form of feces. Silver toxicity is unusual, as silver particles are present in day-to-day life, whether it is used as an ornament or in dietary supplements.\n\n【30】What Happens to Skin When Silver Particles Get Deposited?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The silver deposition in the skin leads to histopathological changes in the skin structure.\n\n【32】Presence of numerous small blue-black granules in the basement membrane involving elastic and collagen fibers within the dermis. These tiny granules can be seen by taking a section of the skin and staining it with hematoxylin and eosin under a microscope. This condition is not precancerous or cancerous.\n\n【33】What Is the Investigation for the Diagnosis of Argyria?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The argyria can be evaluated by recording the patient's past medical and personal history and physical examination. The hematological biopsy is a confirmation investigation for argyria.\n\n【35】Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy is a non-invasive investigation that can also help diagnose argyria.\n\n【36】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Argyria?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Discoloration of the skin can be related to some other disorders as well; therefore, argyria can be diagnosed as some other skin diseases such as -\n\n【38】1.  **Melanoma** - Discolouration of the skin caused due to excessive deposition of melanin.\n\n【39】2.  **Cyanosis** - Skin color turning blue due to lack of oxygenated blood supply.\n\n【40】3.  **Exogenous Ochronosis** - Hypopigmentation due to prolonged use of cosmetic products for skin brightening.\n\n【41】4.  **Chrysiasis** - Excessive use of gold salts for medication purposes.\n\n【42】5.  **Hemochromatosis** - Excessive absorption of iron by the body.\n\n【43】6.  **Methylene Blue Poisoning** - Methylene blue is used as a therapeutic agent, but its long-term use can cause toxicity.\n\n【44】What Is the Treatment of Argyria?\n---------------------------------\n\n【45】Argyria is an irreversible skin discoloration disorder and not so curable; however, there are some medical modalities for treating argyria.\n\n【46】1.  Chelation therapy and depigmentation agents are advised but cannot help much.\n\n【47】2.  The use of 5 % of Hydroquinone can fade the discoloration of the skin.\n\n【48】3.  Laser therapy with Q-switched Neodymium Doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd: YUG) is done to remove the hyperpigmentation of the skin. This method is the most effective.\n\n【49】What Are the Complications of Argyria?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【50】Argyria is not a fatal skin disorder; overexposure to the silver particle by ingestion or inhalation can lead to systemic problems involving other organs like the liver and kidneys. This can also lead to necrosis of bone, pulmonary embolism, and hemorrhage. The skin discoloration may lead to psychological disturbances; a person may feel low self-stream and less confidence and may undergo depression and anxiety.\n\n【51】What Are the Preventions for Argyria?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【52】Argyria is not a life-threatening disorder, but it can be prevented.\n\n【53】1.  Limiting sun exposure.\n\n【54】2.  Apply sunscreen while stepping out.\n\n【55】3.  Avoiding dietary supplements containing silver particles.\n\n【56】4.  Preventing the prolonged administration of silver-containing medications, eyedrops, and lozenges.\n\n【57】5.  The workers in the factories exposed to silver particles can inform the government help center like OSHA (occupational safety and health administration) and MSHA (mine safety and health administration).\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】Argyria is a rare, non-fatal skin disease caused by exposure to or ingestion of silver, resulting in depigmentation of the skin. It can be localized or generalized, turning the skin color grayish-blue. It is irreversible skin discoloration, but it can be prevented. Silver toxicity can be considered a fatal condition if the amount of silver exposure is higher than 50 mg causing pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis of bone marrow, liver, and kidneys. A person suffering from such a condition should seek medical attention and consult a dermatologist.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   Argyria  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563123/\n*   Argyria  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/argyria</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This might occur at any age and affect the individual's understanding level because they cannot interpret what others say or realize the accurate sounds surrounding them.\n\n【2】What Is Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Hearing is not a simple process because sound waves from the environment travel into the ears and they are converted into vibrations in the middle ear. These vibrations then enter the inner ear, where the sensory cells create electrical signals that travel to the brain through the auditory nerve. These signals are analyzed and processed into sounds in the brain.\n\n【4】People who have an auditory processing disorder will have a problem with the above-mentioned process. Their brains do not function to interpret the sounds captured by the ear. Hence, normal hearing function is affected. But, this should not be considered as a hearing loss or learning disorder because the ears function well in capturing the sounds and carrying those signals to the brain.\n\n【5】It is often seen in childhood, and it is more likely to develop in boys when compared to girls. However, it could also develop in the later stages of life. Such children will face a delay in grasping things than ordinary children. They must be given extra care from parents and teachers.\n\n【6】This disorder is also known as a central auditory processing disorder, and it does not occur as a result of some other conditions such as autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But in some cases, auditory processing disorder could occur along with these conditions.\n\n【7】What Causes Auditory Processing Disorder?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【8】The exact cause of auditory processing disorder (APD) is not known, but they may be linked to the following conditions:\n\n【9】*   Hereditary.\n\n【10】*   Head injury.\n\n【11】*   Premature birth.\n\n【12】*   Due to aging, there are some neurological changes.\n\n【13】*   Delayed development of the area of the brain that helps to process the sounds.\n\n【14】*   When there are recurring or chronic ear infections, such as otitis media.\n\n【15】*   Lack of oxygen to the brain.\n\n【16】*   Jaundice.\n\n【17】*   Some diseases and infections like multiple sclerosis and meningitis cause neurological damage.\n\n【18】*   Lead poisoning.\n\n【19】What Are the Clinical Signs of Auditory Processing Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The symptoms of auditory processing disorder are:\n\n【21】*   Trouble in understanding what others speak, especially in places where there is high noise or when two or more people speak simultaneously.\n\n【22】*   As APD-affected people do not understand clearly, they frequently ask to repeat what people say or might respond often with words like \"what,\" \"pardon,\" or \"sorry.\"\n\n【23】*   Mostly, they perceive it in a different way from what is being said.\n\n【24】*   During a conversation, APD-affected people need a longer response time.\n\n【25】*   They do not know from where they hear the sound, so they have trouble telling where the sound is coming from.\n\n【26】*   Unable to pay attention or concentrate on things.\n\n【27】*   They might have a problem distinguishing the words that have similar sounds.\n\n【28】*   People with this disorder may find difficulty in following rapid speech or remembering instructions, especially when there are multiple steps.\n\n【29】*   They have trouble learning or listening to music.\n\n【30】The above symptoms indicate that people with APD have difficulty in hearing. It affects the way they speak, read, write and spell. They mix up the words, especially when presented verbally, and they find it hard to talk with other people or to come up with a quick response.\n\n【31】How Is Auditory Processing Disorder Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Auditory processing disorder does not have a specific diagnosis. It is normally started with a complete medical history, and this helps to evaluate the other symptoms and checks for any risk factors.\n\n【33】**1) Multidisciplinary Approach:**\n\n【34】Auditory processing disorder can occur along with multiple conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is followed to make a diagnosis. This helps the healthcare provider to rule out the potential causes of auditory processing disorder. For example, a variety of hearing tests are conducted by an audiologist, cognitive functioning is checked by a psychologist, the speech-language therapist assesses the oral and written communication skills, and feedback on learning challenges is offered by teachers.\n\n【35】**2) Assessment Tests:**\n\n【36】With the help of information from the multidisciplinary team from the tests they have performed, the audiologist will come to a diagnosis. Examples of tests that would be performed are:\n\n【37】*   **The Hearing Test -** It is done to see whether the issue is due to a hearing loss or auditory processing disorder, so an audiologist will do a series of listening tests. In these tests, the person or the child is asked to listen and respond to different sounds when they hear them. It is assessed in different scenarios such as:\n\n【38】*   With background noise.\n\n【39】*   Rapid speech.\n\n【40】*   Competing speech.\n\n【41】*   The child could also be asked to identify the subtle changes in the words, such as intensity or pitch.\n\n【42】*   **Electrode Test -** Also, to check how the brain responds to the sounds, the doctor attaches painless electrodes to the ears; this is the easy way to help measure the brain's activities. It is said that until seven years of age, the children are not tested for auditory processing disorder because they might not respond well to the listening test.\n\n【43】How Is Auditory Processing Disorder Treated?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Till now, there is no cure for auditory processing disorder, and the treatment differs for each person depending upon the intensity of APD. Normally, the treatment will focus on the following areas:\n\n【45】**1) Teachers Support -** In order to make the child hear the teacher more clearly, electronic devices such as frequency modulation can be given. To avoid the background noises from causing distraction, the teacher should suggest the child get seated at the front desk to help seek more attention.\n\n【46】**2) Other Learning Skills -** Help the child with things such as memory problem solving and other extracurricular activities to deal with APD.\n\n【47】**3) Speech Therapy -** It helps the child to make a difference with the sounds and improves the conversation skills.\n\n【48】**4) Reading Support -** Make the child read under supervision, this can improve the focus on specific areas where the child faces trouble.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】In addition to helping the child with auditory processing disorder, making some changes in the home, such as limiting the volume of the television, radio and covering floors with rugs to reduce echos would benefit the child.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Auditory processing disorder (APD)  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/\n*   Auditory Processing Disorder  \n    https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/auditory-processing-disorder#:~:text=Auditory%20processing%20disorder%20(APD)%20describes,or%20electronic%20information%20on%20APDs\n*   Auditory Processing Disorder: Symptoms & Signs  \n    https://www.medicinenet.com/auditory\\_processing\\_disorder\\_symptoms\\_and\\_signs/symptoms.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "bb644c17-bef8-496f-b478-fa56e7797e5d", "title": "Radiological Presentation of Mediastinal Abnormalities", "text": "【0】Radiological Presentation of Mediastinal Abnormalities\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The mediastinum is located in the chest cavity. The thoracic or chest cavity is a part of the upper trunk located below the neck and above the abdomen. The mediastinum is bounded laterally by a pleural cavity, superiorly by the thoracic outlet, and inferiorly by the diaphragm. The mediastinum is classified into different compartments.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Compartments of Mediastinum?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】1) According to Felson, the mediastinum is classified into:\n\n【4】*   **Anterior Compartment** \\- Extends anteriorly to the sternum and posteriorly to the posterior margin of the heart.\n*   **Middle Compartment** - Extends anteriorly to the posterior margin of the heart and posteriorly to a vertical line drawn 1 cm behind the anterior margins of thoracic vertebrae.\n*   **Posterior Compartment** - Extends anteriorly to a vertical line drawn 1 cm along the thoracic vertebrae and posteriorly to the costovertebral junction.\n\n【5】2) According to the International thymic malignancy interest group (ITMIG), the mediastinum is classified into:\n\n【6】*   **The Prevascular Compartment** - Bounded anteriorly by the posterior surface of the sternum and posteriorly by the anterior aspect of the pericardium. This compartment contains the thymus, fat, lymph nodes, and left brachiocephalic vein. Almost 50 percent of the mediastinal masses are found in the prevascular compartment.\n*   **The Visceral Compartment** \\- Located posterior to the prevascular compartment. It contains the heart, trachea, esophagus, ascending and descending aorta, superior vena cava, thoracic duct, and pulmonary artery. It is bounded anteriorly by the pericardium and posteriorly by the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine.\n*   **The Paravertebral Compartment** \\- Located posterior to the visceral compartment. It is bounded anteriorly by the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine and posteriorly by vertical lines along the posterior margin of the chest wall. It contains the thoracic spine, paravertebral soft tissues, sympathetic trunk, and hemiazygos venous system.\n\n【7】What Are the Common Abnormalities of Mediastinum?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】**1\\. Anterior Compartment** -\n\n【9】*   Lipoma (noncancerous tumor of fat tissues).\n\n【10】*   Thymoma (thymus gland tumor).\n\n【11】*   Thymolipoma (noncancerous tumor of the thymus that contains fatty tissues and thymus cells).\n\n【12】*   Germ cell tumor (tumor of the reproductive cells).\n\n【13】*   A thymic cyst (fluid-filled sac in the thymus).\n\n【14】**2\\. Middle Compartment** \\-\n\n【15】*   A bronchogenic cyst (cyst arising from the primitive foregut).\n\n【16】*   Neurenteric cyst (cyst arises from the remnants of the neurenteric canal).\n\n【17】*   Lipoma.\n\n【18】**3\\. Posterior Compartment** \\-\n\n【19】*   Extramedullary hematopoiesis (abnormal production of blood cells outside the bone marrow).\n\n【20】*   Meningocele (neural tube defect).\n\n【21】*   Schwannoma (tumor of the nervous system).\n\n【22】*   Neurofibroma (nerve tumor).\n\n【23】What Are the Radiological Findings Associated With Mediastinal Abnormalities?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】1.  **Mediastinal Widening** - If the posterior-anterior (PA) view of the chest X-ray shows an increase in the width of the mediastinum by more than 8 cm, it refers to the mediastinal widening. It indicates mediastinal hematoma, aortic aneurysm, or mediastinal tumors.\n\n【25】2.  **Hilum Overlay Sign** - If the hilar structures are visible through the mediastinal masses, it indicates that the mass might be present anterior or posterior to the hila. It is more common in thymoma.\n\n【26】3.  **Right Paratracheal Stripe** \\- It is a line passing through the superior vena cava. When the thickness of the line increases more than 4 mm, it is suggestive of lymphadenopathy in this region.\n\n【27】4.  **Silhouette Sign** - The silhouette sign refers to the loss of silhouette. Silhouette is the clear differentiation of tissues with different densities. Sometimes, the abnormal mediastinal mass shares its boundary with normal structures of the mediastinum. As the radiodensity of both the normal structure and abnormal masses are the same, the normal structure loses its clear margin, which helps in locating the mediastinal mass.\n\n【28】5.  **Paraspinal Lines** - This line is located between the lungs and pleura over the vertebral bodies. Left paraspinal lines are more common than right. This line is disrupted by the diseases of vertebrae and intervertebral disc or neurogenic tumors.\n\n【29】6.  **The Hilum Convergence Sign** - The sign used to differentiate mediastinal mass from the enlarged pulmonary artery. If the pulmonary artery branches converge towards the central mass, it indicates an enlarged pulmonary artery. If the pulmonary artery branches converge towards the heart, it indicates a mediastinal tumor.\n\n【30】7.  **Cervicothoracic Sign** - This sign is used to determine the location of the mediastinal masses. Anterior mediastinum has its superior end near the clavicle. The middle and posterior mediastinum has their superior end above the clavicle. If the mediastinal mass extends above the clavicle, it indicates its location in the middle or posterior mediastinum.\n\n【31】8.  **Thoracoabdominal Sign** - Any sharply outlined mediastinal mass extending below the dome of the diaphragm must be in the posterior compartment, and any mass that ends at the dome of the diaphragm must be in the anterior mediastinal compartment. This sign is most common in lipoma.\n\n【32】9.  **Right Paratracheal Stripe** - The para tracheal stripe is located between the right lung and the trachea. The normal width of the paratracheal stripe ranges from 1 to 4 mm. If the right paratracheal stripe is 5 mm or greater in width, it indicates the widening of the paratracheal stripe.\n\n【33】10.  **Azygoesophageal Recess** - Azygoesophageal recess is located between the right lung and pleura with an azygos vein posteriorly and an esophagus anteriorly. Deviation in the recess line indicates abnormalities in the middle and posterior compartments.\n\n【34】11.  **Anterior Junction Line** \\- This line is seen in the PA chest X-ray view and CT chest. The presence of anterior mediastinal masses can cause obliteration of the anterior junction line. It is formed by the joining of parietal and visceral pleura anteromedially. The thickness of the line varies with the thymus in young patients or increased fat tissues between the pleural layers.\n\n【35】12.  **The Posterior Junction Line** - This line is located behind the pleura posterior to the esophagus and in front of the vertebral bodies. This line can be seen above the clavicles. The bulging or displacement of the line may indicate mediastinal abnormalities such as neurogenic disease or esophageal malignancy.\n\n【36】What Are the Imaging Techniques Used for the Examination of Mediastinum?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   **Chest Radiograph**: The chest radiograph is the initial imaging technique advised for mediastinal masses. For examining the mediastinum, a posterior-anterior (PA) view and lateral view of chest X-rays are taken. For patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), an anterior-posterior view (AP) is taken. The chest X-ray is easily available and cost-effective. It has less sensitivity and specificity when compared to contrast-enhanced imaging techniques.\n\n【38】*   **Computed Tomography (CT)**: CT chest is the most effective imaging modality for mediastinal investigation. Contrast-enhanced CT is commonly performed for the investigation of mediastinal abnormalities. It is performed in a supine position with the arms of the patient above the head level. In emergency conditions, multidetector CT is used to detect mediastinal pathology.\n\n【39】*   **Ultrasonography**: Ultrasound can detect heart function and mediastinal masses. Anterior mediastinal mass can be indicative of a germ cell tumor. Ultrasound with a frequency range of 5 to 10 MHz is used for infants, and 2 to 4 or 4 to 7 MHz is used for children and adults. Ultrasound has limited effect in the diagnosis of mediastinal abnormalities.\n\n【40】*   **Nuclear Medicine**: PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) is used to detect the malignancy of mediastinal such as lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer. It is also helpful for assessing the response to cancer treatment. PET - CT is performed with the help of a radioactive substance called 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose. I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine is used for the detection of pheochromocytoma.\n\n【41】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging**: MRI or magnetic resonance imaging is used to detect congenital heart disease and can differentiate thymic hyperplasia from thymoma. This scan is advised for patients who cannot undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan due to renal failure or contrast allergy. As MRI does not use ionizing radiation, it is considered safe for young patients.\n\n【42】**Conclusion**:\n\n【43】Chest X-ray and CT chest are the most effective imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of mediastinal pathology. Other techniques, such as PET-CT and MRI, provide only additional details of the mediastinal abnormalities. MRI produces images of the soft tissues with increased resolution than the images of CT. But, an MRI scan is a time-consuming procedure and is not affordable for many patients.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579993/\n*   Chest and Mediastinal Imaging  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559145/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3dd05c49-35a9-4fae-a279-8c901c3a7e7d", "title": "Monkey Fever", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Monkey fever, scientifically known as Kyasanur forest disease, is a viral fever that is caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae and is carried by ticks and birds. Hence, it is categorized as a vector-borne disease. It mainly affects monkeys and human beings. It was first noted in the Kyasanur forest in Karnataka, India in March 1957 where lots of monkeys died because of this. Hence, commonly known as monkey fever or disease. Infection to the human was later reported in Bandipur while handling infected dead monkeys. The condition is a major concern in India. The disease can progress and cause neurological symptoms such as coma, seizures, and confusion. Improved surveillance, public awareness campaigns, and preventive measures can control the spread of the disease. The article discusses monkey fever, its causes, risk factors, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Monkey Fever?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Monkey fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks or birds. The disease can also spread via contact with the tissues or blood of the infected animals such as monkeys. The virus that causes the disease is known as the Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV). The virus is commonly found in the monkeys and ticks that feed on these monkeys. Humans can get infected when they come in contact with infected ticks or the tissues or blood of infected animals.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors of Monkey Fever?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The risk factors of monkey fever are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Living or Working in the Forested or Rural Areas:** People who live in these areas where the KFD virus is present are at high risk of being exposed to infected animals or ticks.\n\n【7】*   **Contact With Ticks or Infected Animals:** The KFD virus is present in monkeys and ticks. People who come into contact with these infected animals or ticks are at high risk of developing the condition.\n\n【8】*   **Seasonal Factors:** The risk of having the disease is higher during the months of December to May. During these months the tick activity is very high.\n\n【9】*   **Age and Gender:** Males are more likely to get affected than females. People over the age of 40 years are at more risk of developing the condition.\n\n【10】*   **Occupational Exposure:** People who work in agricultural fields or forests like farmers are more likely to be exposed to ticks and infected animals and are at high risk of contracting disease.\n\n【11】*   **Lack of Awareness:** People who are unaware of the preventive measures or risk factors are at high risk of developing the condition.\n\n【12】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Monkey Fever?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Initially, the symptoms represent chills, and fever with headaches in the frontal region after an incubation period of three to eight days. These are followed by bleeding from the nose, throat, gingiva (gums), and even stomach (gastrointestinal bleeding) after three to four days of onset of initial symptoms, along with abnormally low blood pressure, decreased platelets, red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC).\n\n【14】It can be associated with the following other symptoms, especially neurological symptoms at the beginning of the third week in some patients with fever, such as:\n\n【15】*   Nausea, vomiting.\n\n【16】*   The stiffness of the muscles.\n\n【17】*   Mental disturbances.\n\n【18】*   Tremors.\n\n【19】*   Absence of reflexes.\n\n【20】*   A severe headache.\n\n【21】*   Vision problems.\n\n【22】*   Tremors.\n\n【23】*   Giddiness.\n\n【24】*   Altered sensorium.\n\n【25】Being a viral fever, in some patients the condition gets cured on its own within one to two weeks without any complication, but the recovery period is prolonged and can extend to several months. The affected person may feel weak accompanied by muscle pain that might hinder day-to-day activities.\n\n【26】How Can Monkey Fever Be Transmitted?\n------------------------------------\n\n【27】Monkey fever is transmitted through the vector Haemaphysalis spinigera which is a forest tick and a variety of animals play the role of reservoir like rats, squirrels, etc. Humans get the infection from the bite of nymphs (immature form) of ticks. People who handle or come into contact with the tissues or blood of infected animals are at high risk. In rare cases, the disease can be transmitted through the inhalation of infected materials like aerosolized tissues or the blood of infected animals. The human-to-human transmission is rare.\n\n【28】How Can Monkey Fever Be Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】Monkey fever can be diagnosed on symptoms, history of exposure, or laboratory diagnosis. Earlier, the methods used included hemagglutination inhibition assays (HI), complement fixation tests, neutralization tests, and injecting mice with a serum of infected individuals. The following diagnostic tests are used to diagnose the condition.\n\n【30】*   **Serological Tests:** The test detects the antibodies against the KFDV in the blood of the infected person. The most commonly used serological test for the detection of KFDV is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n【31】*   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test:** The test finds the genetic material of the virus in the blood of an infected individual. It is a highly sensitive test used for the detection of viruses in the early stages of infection.\n\n【32】*   **Viral Culture:** The test is not commonly used for the detection of KFDV because of the risk of infection to laboratory personnel. The test is done by taking and isolating the blood or tissues of the infected person.\n\n【33】How Can Monkey Fever Be Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【34】There is no specific treatment for the condition but early hospitalization along with fluid level management, the management or precautions for bleeding disorders, complete rest, and a diet rich in protein may help. Some home remedies believed to be beneficial include garlic, ginger, turmeric, green tea, and mushrooms by boosting immunity.\n\n【35】How Can Monkey Fever Be Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】The prevention measures are as follows:\n\n【37】*   Vaccination.\n\n【38】*   Wearing protective clothing.\n\n【39】*   Tick control.\n\n【40】*   Use of insect repellants.\n\n【41】*   Avoid contact with infected animals.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Monkey fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks to humans. The symptoms include fever, pain, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the gums, nose, and other body parts. There is no specific treatment for the condition. Supportive care can manage the symptoms. People should adopt preventive measures to manage the condition.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Causes of Monkey Fever?**\n\n【47】Flaviviridae, a virus that is transmitted by monkeys, is the major cause of monkey fever.

{"seq_id": "e91b9a76-8fde-481b-82fc-bda93e28ad0f", "title": "Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Hereditary interstitial kidney disease is a kidney disorder caused by the inflammation of spaces between the kidney tubules. This hampers kidney function and leads to end-stage renal disease. It is a type of autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by chronic kidney disease with bland urinary sediment and low-grade or no proteinuria. There are three subtypes of the disease-\n\n【2】1.  **Mutation in the Gene UMOD -** Patients with mutations in the gene encoding uromodulin suffer from gout in addition to chronic kidney failure. Genetic screening is required for the diagnosis.\n\n【3】2.  **Mutations in REN Gene -** Patients with mutations in the gene encoding renin suffer from anemia in childhood, mild hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and progressive kidney disease.\n\n【4】3.  **Idiopathic -** The third form of hereditary interstitial kidney disease for which the cause has not been found.\n\n【5】What Causes Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The hereditary interstitial kidney disease can be acute or chronic depending upon the cause and can get worse over time. The various causes include-\n\n【7】*   Side-effects of certain drugs\n\n【8】*   Allergic reaction to a drug.\n\n【9】*   Autoimmune disorders include anti-tubular basement membrane disease or Kawasaki disease.\n\n【10】*   Side-effects of antibiotics like Ampicillin, Penicillin, and Sulphonamide.\n\n【11】*   Hypokalemia.\n\n【12】*   Hypercalcemia.\n\n【13】*   Hyperuricemia.\n\n【14】*   Infections.\n\n【15】*   Long-term use of drugs like Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n【16】*   Side effects of other medicines such as Omeprazole, Triamterene, Furosemide, Thiazide diuretics, and Allopurinol.\n\n【17】What Is Acute and Chronic Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   **Acute Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease -** This form of the disease occurs quickly and spreads rapidly. It can be caused by bacteria and infection and the symptoms can be pain while urinating, back pain, and fever.\n*   **Chronic Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease -** This form of the disease appears gradually and develops symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, itchiness, and breathing issues. The symptoms can present like kidney failure.\n\n【19】What Are the Types of Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Inherited tubulointerstitial kidney diseases are separated into autosomal-recessive and autosomal-dominant conditions. Autosomal-recessive conditions are known as nephronophthisis and are the outcome of mutations in several proteins found in the renal tubular cilia. A number of patterns of nephronophthisis are described. Affected people generally suffer from anemia, salt wasting, and progressive kidney disease in childhood, ending in dialysis in the teenage years. The specific patient with this disorder presents in childhood and can have siblings with the disease, but the parents are unaffected. This is generally manageable to distinguish from autosomal dominant interstitial kidney diseases, in which many family members usually are affected, and one of the parents is almost always affected.\n\n【21】There are several types of hereditary interstitial kidney disease, each with different genetic causes and clinical features. They are as follows-\n\n【22】*   **Alport Syndrome:** It is a genetic disorder that affects the collagen proteins in the kidneys, leading to progressive kidney damage and eventual kidney failure. The disease can also affect the ears and eyes.\n\n【23】*   **Fabry Disease:** It is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. The disease leads to the buildup of a type of fat called globotriaosylceramide in the kidneys and other organs, leading to progressive damage.\n\n【24】*   **Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease:** This type of HIKD is caused by genetic mutations that affect the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidneys. The disease leads to progressive kidney damage and eventually kidney failure.\n\n【25】*   **Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease:** Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that causes the formation of cysts in the kidneys, leading to progressive kidney damage and eventual kidney failure.\n\n【26】*   **Nephronophthisis:** Nephronophthisis is a genetic disorder that affects the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidneys, leading to progressive kidney damage and eventually kidney failure.\n\n【27】What Are the Symptoms of Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   Nausea.\n\n【29】*   Vomiting.\n\n【30】*   Fever.\n\n【31】*   Rashes.\n\n【32】*   Rise in BP.\n\n【33】*   Mood swings.\n\n【34】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【35】*   Weight gain.\n\n【36】*   Swelling or information throughout the body.\n\n【37】*   Reduced amount of urine.\n\n【38】*   Hematuria (blood in urine).\n\n【39】*   Coma.\n\n【40】*   Hyperuricemia (increased amount of urea in the blood that occurs in the early stages of the disease).\n\n【41】*   Gout.\n\n【42】How Is Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】*   **Genetic Screening -** Genetic screening is beneficial in finding out if other family members have the same disease. The mutations in the UMOD gene can confirm the presence of disease.\n\n【44】*   **Blood Analysis -** The presence of the excess amount of urea (hyperuricemia), calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), and reduced levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalaemia) can be confirmed by blood analysis. A complete blood count can be done to measure the average red blood cell size, hemoglobin, and hematocrit volume.\n\n【45】*   **Kidney Ultrasound -** Kidney ultrasound reveals normal to the smaller size of kidneys or contracted kidneys in the later stage. In addition, the presence of a medullary cyst can be seen.\n\n【46】*   **Urine Analysis -** To check for the presence of factors that confirms chronic progressive kidney failure. Urine analysis can reveal bland urinary sediment and less than 1 g of urinary protein.\n\n【47】*   **Kidney Biopsy -** Kidney biopsy is a diagnostic procedure in which a small piece of tissue from an organ is exercised and studied under a microscope. The two most common types of kidney biopsy are percutaneous and open kidney biopsy. The results from the biopsy reports can help in deciding the treatment modality.\n\n【48】How Is Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease Treated?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   **Allopurinol -** The use of allopurinol is found to slow the progression of kidney disease and is used extensively. It is generally indicated in young men or other patients who develop gout because the uric acid buildup increases over time, and Allopurinol prevents the development of crippling gout.\n\n【50】*   **ACE Inhibitors -** Angiotensin-converting enzyme innovators, can decrease the production of uromodulin; hence, abnormal uromodulin leads to apoptosis (cell death). Losartan can be preferably used because of its hypouricemic effect.\n\n【51】*   **Dialysis -** It is necessary to filter the blood artificially in order to remove all the waste in the blood. Therefore, dialysis is used as a supportive measure to carry out life. It is usually required in acute cases where the disease progression has led to its peak.\n\n【52】*   **Kidney Transplantation -** In case of extensive kidney damage where dialysis cannot reverse the condition, kidney transplantation can give a better prognosis. However, hereditary interstitial kidney disease is a genetic disease and it can affect the transplanted kidney. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the overall health status, the extent of kidney damage, and the presence of any other health conditions in the patient that may affect the success of the transplant.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Hereditary interstitial kidney disease is the inflammation between the space of kidney filters. The condition is autosomal dominant and requires genetic screening for diagnostics. The symptoms include fever, rash, drowsiness, rise in blood pressure, and gout. Diagnosis is based on a blood profile that reveals hyperuricemia, Hypercalcaemia, and hypokalaemia. On the kidney, ultrasound contracted or smaller size kidneys can be seen. Treatment with allopurinol, ACE inhibitors, and dialysis or kidney transplant can be required based on the stage of the disease.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Improving the Recognition of Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease  \n    https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/20/1/11\n*   Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4264385</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are blood tests that help healthcare professionals assess the presence and severity of inflammation.\n\n【2】ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are two commonly used blood tests that provide information about inflammation in the body. While both tests are useful, they measure different aspects of the inflammatory process and serve different purposes. This article will explore the uses, and comparisons of ESR and CRP to understand their respective roles in clinical practice.\n\n【3】What Is ESR?\n------------\n\n【4】ESR stands for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is defined as a simple blood test used to measure the rate at which red blood cells settle to the base of a test tube over a specified period of time. It is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and is often used as an indicator of the presence or severity of certain diseases. The ESR result is reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that separate from the red blood cells at the top of the column after one hour.\n\n【5】*   **Indications:** ESR is used as a nonspecific marker to detect and monitor inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatic, and temporal arteritis. It can also be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring certain infections, such as tuberculosis and endocarditis. ESR may be used in combination with other tests to provide a more comprehensive assessment of a patient's condition.\n\n【6】*   **Procedure:** The ESR test involves collecting a blood sample from a vein, typically in the arm. The blood is mixed with an anticoagulant to prevent clotting and is then placed in a tall, thin tube called a Westergren tube. The tube is positioned vertically and left undisturbed for a specific period, usually one hour. The red blood cells gradually settle to the bottom of the tube, and the amount of clear fluid (plasma) above them is measured and reported as the ESR value.\n\n【7】*   **Complications:** ESR is a relatively simple and safe test, and complications are rare. However, as with any blood draw, there is very less risk of bleeding, bruising, or infection at the site where the needle is inserted. Some people may experience mild discomfort or a brief lightheaded feeling during or after the procedure.\n\n【8】*   **Results:** The ESR result is reported in millimeters per hour (mm/hr). A higher ESR value indicates increased inflammation or other underlying conditions. However, it is important to note that ESR alone cannot diagnose a specific disease but rather serves as an indicator that further investigation may be needed. The interpretation of ESR results should be made in conjunction with other clinical findings and additional diagnostic tests.\n\n【9】What Is CRP?\n------------\n\n【10】CRP is known as C-reactive protein, which is produced by the liver in response to infection or inflammation. It is a commonly measured blood test that helps assess the presence and severity of inflammation in the body. CRP is an acute-phase reactant protein that is discharged into the blood in response to inflammation or infection. It plays a role in the body's immune response and is one of the key markers of inflammation.\n\n【11】*   **Indications:** CRP is used as a non-specific marker to assess the presence and monitor the progress of inflammatory conditions, infections, and tissue damage. It is commonly used to diagnose and monitor various inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasculitis. It can also be helpful in assessing the severity of infections and monitoring the response to treatment.\n\n【12】*   **Procedure:** The CRP test involves collecting a blood sample from a vein, typically in the arm. The collected blood is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. There are two main methods for measuring CRP: the high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test and the standard CRP test. The hs-CRP test is more sensitive and is used to detect lower levels of CRP, making it useful in assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The standard CRP test is used in the evaluation of general inflammation.\n\n【13】*   **Complications:** The CRP test is a relatively simple and safe procedure, and complications are rare. Similar to other blood tests, there is a small risk of bleeding, bruising, or infection at the site where the needle is inserted. Some people may experience mild discomfort or a brief lightheaded feeling during or after the procedure.\n\n【14】*   **Results:** CRP levels are measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Higher levels of CRP indicate increased inflammation in the body. However, it is important to note that CRP levels alone cannot diagnose a specific disease but rather serve as an indicator that further investigation may be needed. Interpretation of CRP results should be done in conjunction with other clinical findings and additional diagnostic tests.\n\n【15】What Is the Comparison Between ESR and CRP?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【16】ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are two blood tests that are commonly used as markers of inflammation in the body. While both tests provide information about inflammation, there are some differences between ESR and CRP. Here's a comparison of the two:\n\n【17】*   **Measurement:** ESR measures the rate at which red blood cells settle at the base of a test tube over a specific time period (usually one hour), and the result is reported in millimeters per hour (mm/hr). CRP measures the level of a protein called C-reactive protein in the blood, and the result is reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L).\n\n【18】*   **Sensitivity:** CRP is generally considered to be a more sensitive marker of inflammation compared to ESR. CRP levels can rise more rapidly in response to inflammation, whereas ESR may take longer to increase and may not always reflect acute or rapid changes in inflammation.\n\n【19】*   **Specificity:** ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation, meaning it can be elevated in various conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. CRP is also a non-specific marker, but it tends to be more specific to inflammation and is often used to monitor acute inflammation and infection.\n\n【20】*   **Clinical Utility:** Both ESR and CRP have clinical utility in diagnosing and monitoring inflammatory conditions. However, the specific choice of test may depend on the clinical scenario and the condition being evaluated. CRP is commonly used in assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease, while ESR is often used in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases.\n\n【21】*   **Interpretation:** Interpretation of ESR and CRP results should be made in conjunction with other clinical findings and additional diagnostic tests. Elevated levels of ESR or CRP indicate increased inflammation in the body, but they do not provide a specific diagnosis. Further investigation and evaluation are typically required to determine the underlying cause of inflammation.\n\n【22】**Conclusion**\n\n【23】In conclusion, ESR and CRP are blood tests used to assess inflammation in the body. ESR measures the rate of red blood cell settling, while CRP measures the level of C-reactive protein. CRP is more sensitive and specific to acute inflammation, commonly used for cardiovascular risk assessment and monitoring infections. ESR is often utilized in rheumatic diseases and provides a broader assessment of inflammation. Elevated levels of ESR or CRP indicate increased inflammation, but further evaluation is needed for a specific diagnosis. Both tests are often used together for a comprehensive evaluation. Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial for accurate interpretation and guidance.\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>*   C-Reactive Protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Testing  \n    https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/esr\n*   Comparative Value of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Testing in Combination Versus Individually for the Diagnosis of Undifferentiated Patients With Suspected Inflammatory Disease or Serious Infection: A Systematic Re  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333366/\n*   C-Reactive Protein versus Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate: Implications Among Patients with No Known Inflammatory Conditions  \n    https://www.jabfm.org/content/34/5/974</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is common for individuals to shift and move to every side after going to bed. Usually, these movements slow down after settling into a comfortable position and falling asleep. However, in individuals with sleep-related movement disorders, the frequency of these movements increases as compared to the normal individual. These abnormal movements hamper the sleep quality of individuals suffering from these disorders and as a result, they can not get sufficient rest. This condition leads to daytime fatigue and a lack of concentration at school or work.\n\n【2】What Are Sleep-Related Movement Disorders?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】International classification of sleep disorders (ICSD-3) defines sleep-related movement disorders as a subtype of sleep disorder in which repetitive movements interfere with sleep. These repetitive movements include jerky and twitching movements. However, they are completely different from movements like sleepwalking and night terrors. One such sleep-related movement disorder is benign neonatal sleep myoclonus. This disorder is seen in infants and is characterized by jerky and twitching movements only during sleep.\n\n【4】What Is Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Parents often find it fascinating to see their newborn babies sleeping. However, it can be disturbing if newborn babies show repetitive abnormal movements like twitching during sleep. This condition is called benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, a sleep-related movement disorder.\n\n【6】Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus appears in very young infants. The specific feature of benign neonatal sleep myoclonus is the appearance of abnormal jerky movements in infants starting from the first day of life to the age of three months. These rapid and repetitive jerks of infants' arms, legs, and torso muscles occur during sleep. These jerks are not goal-directed, unlike sleepwalking or other sleep disorders. In addition, these jerks or movements are uncontrollable and short, commonly referred to as 'myoclonus' in medical language. Another example of myoclonus is hiccups and hypnic jerks.\n\n【7】In benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, these jerky movements appear several times when the infant sleeps. Although it seems disturbing to the parents, this condition is usually not harmful to babies. However, without measuring brain waves, many times, it can be mistaken for epilepsy.\n\n【8】The important thing to notice in this sleep disorder is the disappearance of this abnormal movement after the newborn is awakened.\n\n【9】Since this disorder is thought to resolve without further complications within three months, treatment is typically not indicated. However, a 2010 study found that in one-third of infants, benign neonatal sleep myoclonus did not go away by the time they were three months old. Therefore, more research is needed on this disorder.\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   The cause of benign newborn sleep myoclonus is unknown. Researchers believe the abnormal motions occur when the protective sheath around a baby's spinal cord is not fully grown. This circumstance may cause the body to carry out impulses that might otherwise be blocked or resisted.\n\n【12】*   Benign newborn sleep myoclonus may tend to run in families. Myoclonic jerks in babies can be induced by repetitive noises or rocking.\n\n【13】*   Although most cases of benign neonatal sleep myoclonus occur in newborns born to women who do not use drugs, the disorder is common among babies born to moms who are addicted to opioids. Therefore, the use of opioids can be considered a risk factor for this disorder.\n\n【14】*   The development of this condition could be influenced by transient serotonin imbalance and hereditary factors.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】According to the international classification of sleep disorders, revised: diagnostic and coding manual (ICSD-2, ICSD-3), the symptoms of benign neonatal sleep myoclonus are as follows:\n\n【17】*   Repetitive myoclonic jerks involve the whole body, hands, legs, or trunk (the body part to which the head, arms, and legs attach. It consists of the buttocks, back, lower abdomen, shoulders, and chest).\n\n【18】*   Movements arise in early infancy, generally from birth up to six months.\n\n【19】*   Movements that arise only during sleep (when a newborn is sleeping).\n\n【20】*   Movements that stop suddenly and consistently when the child is awakened.\n\n【21】*   A disorder with no other explanation for the movements, such as drug usage, a neurological problem, or a sleep issue.\n\n【22】In addition, researchers examined brain and muscle activity in newborns with benign neonatal sleep myoclonus using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). The results suggest that even though muscles show twitches resembling those seen during seizures, brain waves in benign neonatal sleep myoclonus do not resemble seizures.\n\n【23】What Are the Differential Diagnosis of Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Differential diagnosis means conditions that exhibit similar symptoms as benign neonatal sleep myoclonus. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus can be confused with the following conditions:\n\n【25】*   Neonatal seizures.\n\n【26】*   Hyperekplexia.\n\n【27】*   Benign non-epileptic infantile spasms.\n\n【28】*   Drug withdrawal\n\n【29】*   Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).\n\n【30】What Is the Treatment of Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】There is no need for treatment because benign newborn sleep myoclonus events or attacks and the disorder itself typically cure on its own. However, controlling the baby's limbs or administering anticonvulsant medications may aggravate symptoms. On the other hand, parents or caregivers may want to safeguard the area surrounding the baby, so they do not injure themselves with their abnormal, involuntary movements.\n\n【32】What Is the Prognosis of Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The prognosis of benign neonatal sleep myoclonus is excellent because this condition is considered self-limiting and usually resolves in two to seven months.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Neonatal sleep myoclonus is a harmless syndrome identified by myoclonic jerks that occur only during sleep and manifest themselves soon after birth or in the first month of life. There are no connections with abnormal growth, mental abnormalities, or seizures.\n\n【36】The electroencephalogram (EEG) comes normal for these babies, and there is no link between it and the myoclonic jerks. Myoclonus occurs in all sleep stages. However, its frequency varies by state and is highest during peaceful sleep. As previously thought, it is not related to an arousal response.\n\n【37】The development of this condition may be influenced by transient serotonin imbalance and hereditary factors. In addition, involuntary movements can be triggered by the noise or rocking of the baby. This is a self-limiting condition that resolves on its own with no treatment requirement.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus  \n    https://www.sleepfoundation.org/baby-sleep/benign-neonatal-sleep-myoclonus\n*   Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus: experience from the study of 38 infants  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17574462/\n*   Benign Neonatal Sleep Myoclonus: Is it so Uncommon?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921997/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "af4065fe-9308-499a-813e-8bc4aef581dc", "title": "Ophthalmologic Anesthesia - Structure, Preoperative Evaluation, Indications, Complications.", "text": "【0】Ophthalmologic Anesthesia - Structure, Preoperative Evaluation, Indications, Complications.\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Nowadays, many ophthalmic surgeries are being performed based on ophthalmologic anesthesia used in the surgeries. The technique used to perform ophthalmologic anesthesia also plays an essential role in surgery as the method used is individualized based on the needs of the patient, the nature, and the extent of eye surgery. The goal of anesthesia during surgery is to focus on patient safety. It provides a patient with a pain-free experience and forms a surgical procedure to work coordinately with fellow members.\n\n【2】What Is Ophthalmologic Anesthesia?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Anesthesia is used in surgeries related to eye function, structure, or eye disease. Surgeries of the eye require anesthesia to comfort the patient in terms of pain. Anesthesia used in these surgeries is local or topical and regional anesthesia. Lidocaine, 2 percent, and Bupivacaine, 0.5 percent, are usually used. Techniques used to give anesthesia, like Akinetic and non-akinetic, also play an essential role in ophthalmic surgeries. Techniques depending on the patient's requirements and safety are used.\n\n【4】What Is Present Inside an Eye?\n------------------------------\n\n【5】The structure of an eye has many different muscles and nerve supplies. An eye contains:\n\n【6】*   **Orbit -** The orbit is an irregular four-sided pyramid having a medial wall, a lateral wall, a roof, and a floor. The medial walls of each orbit are toward the nasal cavity and parallel to each other. The lateral walls of each orbit are perpendicular to each other—a roof towards an eyebrow.\n\n【7】*   **Globe -** The globe is present in the anterior part of the orbital cavity, closer to the roof than the floor and nearer to the lateral wall than the medial wall. It has three outer layers containing cornea and sclera in one; iris, ciliary body, and choroid in the second; retina in the last layer. The globe has a large posterior segment containing the optic nerve and retina and a small anterior segment. The axial length of the globe is 24mm, but larger (26 mm) in myopic and shorter (<20 mm) in hypermetropia.\n\n【8】*   **Muscles of the Eye** - Extraocular muscles control the globe movements by rectus muscles (inferior, lateral, medial, superior) and oblique muscles (superior and inferior). These muscles form an incomplete cone.\n\n【9】*   **Nerve Supply** \\- Within the cone, optic nerve, oculomotor nerve, abducens nerve (nerves from the brain), ciliary ganglion with nerves, and blood vessels are present. The trochlear nerve is present outside the cone. These different nerves supply different muscles of the eyes.\n\n【10】What Is the Preoperative Evaluation for Ophthalmic Anesthesia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The important aspects of being considered in ophthalmologic anesthesia are:\n\n【12】*   Physical examination of the patient with detailed history.\n\n【13】*   Previous history of ophthalmic surgery.\n\n【14】*   The axial length of the eye of the patient.\n\n【15】*   Presence of any staphyloma.\n\n【16】*   Relationship between the globe and eye.\n\n【17】*   Whether the patient has glaucoma or not.\n\n【18】*   B-scan echography.\n\n【19】*   Blood sugar and blood pressure should be under control.\n\n【20】*   Patients for cataract surgery should go for antiplatelets and diopter power circulation.\n\n【21】*   The patient should receive oxygen 2 liter/min by nasal catheters.\n\n【22】*   The patient's oxygen levels and blood pressure is checked before giving anesthesia.\n\n【23】What Are the Techniques for Anesthesia Administration?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The doctor follows a few techniques to insert anesthesia in ophthalmic cases. The techniques are:\n\n【25】*   Sub-Tenon's Nerve Block:\n\n【26】*   Surgical technique with a blunt cannula.\n\n【27】*   Non-surgical technique with a blunt cannula.\n\n【28】*   Non-surgical technique with a sharp needle.\n\n【29】*   Improvised cannula technique.\n\n【30】*   Retrobulbar Anesthesia:\n\n【31】*   Classical technique.\n\n【32】*   Modern techniques.\n\n【33】*   Peribulbar Anesthesia: It involves the orbit with anesthesia being deposited in the orbicularis oculi muscle. It blocks the ciliary nerves, oculomotor nerve, and trochlear nerve.\n\n【34】What Is Retrobulbar Anesthesia?\n-------------------------------\n\n【35】*   Retrobulbar anesthesia is a technique in which a small volume of anesthetic is injected inside the muscular cone.\n\n【36】*   The doctor uses this technique earlier in time. This technique damages the globe's structures, so it requires technique modification. This technique is also called Atkinson.\n\n【37】*   During this technique, the patient is asked to look up and down. The needle is inserted into the skin at the lateral and medial orbital edge junction. The needle is moved to the apex of the orbit, and an anesthesia solution of 2 to 4 ml is injected. And an additional nerve block to stop the blinking of the eyelid is required.\n\n【38】*   Altogether, it is still not so suitable as an additional facial block requirement, and globe damage makes it risky too.\n\n【39】What Is Sub-Tenon's Nerve Block?\n--------------------------------\n\n【40】This technique is an alternative to the retrobulbar technique. After the topical anesthesia is used, the bulbar conjunctiva is handled with forceps. Small scissors create openings in the conjunctiva and tenon's capsule. A plastic cannula is inserted into the space to allow injection. Little modifications have been made to this technique. The modifications are:\n\n【41】*   **Non-surgicalTechnique With Blunt Cannula** - This technique uses a blunt cannula and prevents the conjunctiva (white part of the eye) from cutting as it gives a scar on the conjunctiva.\n\n【42】*   **Non-surgicalTechnique With Sharp Needle** - This technique uses a sharp bevel needle between the conjunctiva and the globe. The needle is shifted slightly medially and posteriorly, and anesthesia is injected in large quantities.\n\n【43】*   **ImprovisedCannula Technique** - This technique uses a short intravenous cannula to inject anesthesia.\n\n【44】Which Is the Better Technique for Ophthalmologic Anesthesia?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】The peribulbar and retrobulbar have the same effect on injecting the anesthesia. But the risks in cases of retrobulbar are more, so out of these two, peribulbar is better. The best among the three-technique is the sub tenon's nerve block which provides more safety to the patients with less complication.\n\n【46】What Are the Indications and Complications of Ophthalmologic Anesthesia?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】**Indications:**\n\n【48】*   Cataract surgery.\n\n【49】*   Corneal surgery.\n\n【50】*   Refractive surgery.\n\n【51】*   Glaucoma surgery.\n\n【52】*   Oculoplastic surgery.\n\n【53】*   Extraocular muscle surgery.\n\n【54】*   Vitreoretinal surgery.\n\n【55】*   Open-globe surgery.\n\n【56】*   Ophthalmic oncology.\n\n【57】**Complications:**\n\n【58】**Complications Related to the Eye:**\n\n【59】*   Globe perforation (outer surfaces of the eye are disrupted by trauma).\n\n【60】*   Retrobulbar hemorrhage (accumulation of blood in the retrobulbar space).\n\n【61】*   Optic nerve damage (the optic nerve of the eye gets damaged).\n\n【62】*   Subconjunctival edema (presence of fluid in the conjunctival).\n\n【63】*   Venous hemorrhage (blood gets accumulated in the vein).\n\n【64】*   Decreased visual acuity (decreased ability to see).\n\n【65】*   Myotoxicity (side effect of statin therapy).\n\n【66】**Systemic Complications:**\n\n【67】*   Seizures.\n\n【68】*   Respiratory or cardiac arrest.\n\n【69】*   Pulmonary edema.\n\n【70】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【71】**Conclusion**\n\n【72】Ophthalmic anesthesia is used in eye surgeries to give a pain-free experience to patients. The surgeries include retinal, corneal, cataract, and optic nerve surgery. Various techniques inject anesthesia into the eye. However, using the sub-tenon's nerve block and its modification significantly improves surgery results. In addition, sub-tenon is safer than retrobulbar and peribulbar, which risk the patients.\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anesthesia For Eye Surgery  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572131/\n*   Anaesthesia For Ophthalmic Surgery Part 1 – Anatomy & Physiology – Regional Techniques  \n    https://resources.wfsahq.org/atotw/anaesthesia-for-ophthalmic-surgery-part-1-anatomy-physiology-regional-techniques-anaesthesia-tutorial-of-the-week-135/\n*   Ophthalmic regional anaesthesia: A review and update  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658342/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Joe Vincent Meigs and John W Cass were the first to describe the association of benign ovary tumors with ascites and pleural effusion. The condition was later named Meigs’ syndrome by Rhodes and Terrel.\n\n【2】What Is Meigs Syndrome?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】A syndrome is a collection of different signs and symptoms. The classical indications for Meigs’ syndrome are as follows:\n\n【4】*   **Benign ovary tumor:** A non-cancerous growth on the ovaries such as fibroma, thecoma, and Brenner tumor.\n\n【5】*   Ascites refer to abnormal fluid build-up in the abdomen, primarily due to underlying liver damage.\n\n【6】*   **Pleural effusion:** Fluid collection between the lungs and chest cavity is called pleural effusion.\n\n【7】*   Pericardial effusion is abnormal fluid accumulation in the sac surrounding the heart. It occurs with other signs of Meigs’ syndrome in a few individuals.\n\n【8】*   The ascites and pleural effusion clear off after removing the ovarian tumor.\n\n【9】*   It is also known as Demons-Meigs’ syndrome.\n\n【10】What Is Atypical Meigs Syndrome?\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】Rarely, in a few women, either pleural effusion or ascites occurs in association with benign ovarian tumors. It is called atypical or incomplete Meigs’ syndrome.\n\n【12】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【13】The typical symptoms of Meigs syndrome are listed below:\n\n【14】*   **Benign Ovarian Tumor:** It rarely occurs in children and adolescents associated with Gorlin syndrome (a condition that affects various body parts and increases the risk of developing cancer or non-cancerous growth).\n\n【15】1.  The ovarian tumor produces little or no symptoms in women until it starts secreting hormones. If the tumor produces excess androgen hormone, it increases the development of male characteristics (virilization) in women.\n2.  If estrogen is produced in excess, it causes abnormal bleeding, endometrial cancer, and early puberty in children.\n3.  The other features include fatigue, weight loss, swollen feet, the abdomen swells due to an enlarged ovarian tumor, leaking of urine (urinary incontinence), and uterine prolapse (the pelvic muscles weaken and do not provide support to the uterus).\n\n【16】*   **Pleural Effusion:** The fluid usually builds up on the right side of the chest cavity. However, it can occur on the left side or both. It causes dry cough, breathing difficulties, and pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue that separates the lungs from the chest wall).\n\n【17】*   Ascites cause abdominal swelling.\n\n【18】How Is Meigs Syndrome Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【19】*   **Physical Examination:** It is essential to examine women showing ascites and pleural effusion features. The critical aspects that are evaluated during physical examination are:\n\n【20】1.  Palpable abdominal masses.\n\n【21】2.  Abnormal breath sounds and changes in the quality of voice are detected using a stethoscope.\n\n【22】3.  Abdominal swelling.\n\n【23】4.  Dullness of the chest and bulged neck veins are a few other signs of ascites that the physician evaluates.\n\n【24】5.  Skin is also examined for any skin cancer, especially in children.\n\n【25】6.  The ascites and pleural effusion are checked for resolution after removing the ovarian tumor, the hallmark of Meigs’ syndrome.\n\n【26】*   **Laboratory Investigations**: Blood and urine are analyzed to detect any abnormality that indicates liver failure, anemia, heart failure, and excess excretion of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The blood is examined for complete blood count, prothrombin time, cholesterol levels, and pro-BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide). The high levels of pro-BNP are suggestive of heart failure. CA 125 (cancer antigen 125) is a specific protein found to be increased in the serum of women with ovarian cancer.\n*   **Radiographic Investigations:** The various imaging modalities used to diagnose Meigs’ syndrome are:\n\n【27】1.  Ultrasound of the pelvis aids in determining any small lesions in the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tube, etc.\n2.  Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is taken to evaluate any other cause for ascites like cancer, liver disorders, etc.\n3.  Chest X-ray is more commonly used in the diagnosis of pleural effusion. It also helps in determining any cancer spread.\n4.  Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is also essential in differentiating Meigs’ syndrome from other cancers.\n\n【28】*   **Thoracentesis** is a minimally invasive procedure of removing fluid around the lungs and examining it for protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. It also gives temporary relief to the patients as fluid is removed.\n\n【29】*   **Paracentesis** involves removing fluid in the abdomen, and it is analyzed for protein levels. It helps in determining the cause of ascites.\n\n【30】*   **Endoscopy:** A thin, long tube with a camera is passed through the mouth to view the digestive tract. It aids in diagnosing any gastrointestinal tumor.\n\n【31】What Are the Related Disorders?\n-------------------------------\n\n【32】The disorders that have to differentiate from Meigs’ syndrome are listed down:\n\n【33】*   **Liver Cirrhosis:** It is severe liver damage that occurs due to scarring of liver tissue. The individual suffers from fatigue, weight loss, jaundice, swelling of legs and feet, and ascites. Laboratory tests and biopsy are used in the diagnosis.\n\n【34】*   **Pseudo-Meigs’ Syndrome** is characterized by abdominal or pelvic tumors, ascites, pleural effusion, and benign ovarian tumors.\n\n【35】*   **Ovarian Cancer:** Malignant tumor of the ovaries occurs due to an unknown cause. It leads to weight loss, abdominal swelling, back pain, and an urge to urinate. It is usually treated by surgical removal of ovaries and or uterus.\n\n【36】How Is Meigs Syndrome Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【37】The treatment of Meigs’ syndrome is carried out after the diagnosis is confirmed. It involves:\n\n【38】*   **Paracentesis:** Removing fluid from the abdomen relieves patients from breathing difficulties and abdominal discomfort.\n\n【39】*   **Thoracentesis:** The fluid around the lungs from the chest cavity is removed at regular intervals to help in managing breathing difficulties.\n\n【40】*   **Surgery:** The various abdominal surgery carried out in women with Meigs’ syndrome include:\n\n【41】1.  Total hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the whole uterus and ovaries, and fallopian tubes on both sides. It is carried out in women over 50 years of age who have attained menopause.\n2.  Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the surgical excision of the ovaries and fallopian tubes on one side. It is suggested for younger women in whom fertility preservation is essential.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Meigs’ syndrome is rare and accounts for 1% of all ovarian tumors. However, the pleural effusion and ascites completely resolve after the excision of the ovarian tumor. The affected women show a good prognosis and lead a normal life post-surgery. Therefore, the healthcare specialist must diagnose such conditions appropriately.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Meigs Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559322/\n*   Meigs syndrome  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/meigs-syndrome?lang=us\n*   So-Called “Meigs' Syndrome” Associated with Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors  \n    https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/70.4.578</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "819933f1-4b2c-4388-94d7-2ceadc520029", "title": "Psychodynamic Therapy - History, Benefits, Techniques, Principles, and Stages", "text": "【0】Psychodynamic Therapy - History, Benefits, Techniques, Principles, and Stages\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Various approaches exist to treat depression and mental illness experienced by adults and older adults worldwide. The psychodynamic approach works correspondingly to classic psychoanalytical therapy. The intervention aids in changing the quality of life and guides them better understand the way they think and express themselves. Psychodynamic theory is based on the art of Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis.\n\n【2】What Is Psychodynamic Therapy?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Psychodynamic psychotherapy is an in-depth talk therapy offering a helping hand to those in trouble with social relations. Here, the professional therapist communicates with the clients and makes them sound out their experiences and emotions. This intervention relieves unconscious conflicts, is basal for anxiety and depression, and calms the mind of emotional distress through several sessions. The change in unconscious belief would reflect in the client’s behavior. The intervention is accessible to individuals, families, and groups.\n\n【4】**History of Psychodynamic Therapy.**\n\n【5】The current theory of psychodynamics is the modulated version of the traditional psyche and dynamics. In 1874, Von Bruke, a german physician and physiologist, framed the principle of psychodynamics. Carl, Alfred, Otto, and Melanie enhance application spots and applications in psychology. Freud conceived them with the human psyche.\n\n【6】What Are the Benefits of Psychodynamic Therapy?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Psychodynamic therapy targets people encountering depression and who have lost the meaning of their lives. Like psychoanalytical therapy, psychodynamic therapy is also evident-based and intensive. Primarily, the treatment treats depression and alleviates the symptoms of other psychological disorders. In addition, the therapy benefits the following common illness.\n\n【8】*   Anxiety.\n\n【9】*   Eating disorders.\n\n【10】*   Depression.\n\n【11】*   Borderline personality disorders.\n\n【12】*   Interpersonal and socio-relational problems.\n\n【13】*   Substance use disorder.\n\n【14】*   Psychological distress.\n\n【15】*   Social anxiety disorder.\n\n【16】*   Anorexia nervosa.\n\n【17】Besides, the following conditions are less likely to have benefited from psychodynamic therapy.\n\n【18】*   Psychosis.\n\n【19】*   Obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n【20】*   Post-traumatic stress.\n\n【21】*   Social phobia.\n\n【22】*   Panic disorder.\n\n【23】*   Indescribable chronic pain.\n\n【24】How Does Psychodynamic Therapy Work?\n------------------------------------\n\n【25】Psychodynamic therapy has a unique component compared to other psychological therapies. That includes acknowledging and expressing the patient’s contradictory feelings and improving them. This intervention also targets people who are aware of their issues but cannot resolve them. For instance, people with depression and psycho-related conditions analyze their early experiences and resolve their hardships in behavior and environmental circumstances. Psychotherapy is short-term and long-term related to the patient’s symptoms. Short-term incorporates 25-30 sessions for six to eight months, while long-term is about 50 sessions for more than a year.\n\n【26】What Includes the Principles and Characteristics of Psychodynamic Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The psychodynamic approach works based on several fundamental principles. The following are the typical principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy.\n\n【28】*   A fact that psychopathology progresses from early childhood experiences.\n\n【29】*   Unconscious conflicts like social pressure and psychic status could affect conscious thoughts and behavior.\n\n【30】*   Expanding the client-therapist relationship would make the clients address their life issues and dynamics comfortably.\n\n【31】*   The main objective of the client-therapist relationship is transference and countertransference. There, the client transfers their feelings to a therapist, and the therapist, in turn, redirects toward the client.\n\n【32】*   Identifying the defenses and working on them would remit unpleasant consequences.\n\n【33】*   Experiences configure personality and thus, the response to those incidents.\n\n【34】*   Enhancing insights is vital for the therapy to succeed.\n\n【35】*   Letting the clients free of the past could take them to a bright future.\n\n【36】*   Using the aids like association would better explore one’s internal conflict and issues.\n\n【37】What Encloses the Stages of Psychodynamic Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The psychodynamic intervention is about listening to the patient and then reflecting on those ideas by understanding the conflicts and information. Then, finally, intervening in the therapeutic alliance. Indicated below are the four stages of psychodynamic therapy.\n\n【39】*   **The Beginning or Evaluation Phase.** This is the phase of assessment and history-taking. In this initial phase, the therapist enquires about family history, childhood experiences, fantasy beliefs, and substance use.\n\n【40】*   **The Induction Phase**. The intervention and the client-therapist relationship begin in this phase. The therapist will set goals and guide the client in practicing psychodynamic therapy.\n\n【41】*   **Mid-Phase****.** The most extended phase of the therapy. The goals set during the induction phase are achieved here.\n\n【42】*   **Termination-Phase**. Here, this phase evaluates the changes so far and the future. Cessation of treatment and relationship. And also, the therapist plans for future therapy.\n\n【43】How Effective Is Psychodynamic Therapy?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【44】The efficiency of psychodynamic and psychoanalytical therapies is evident and clinical-trials based. A meta-analyzed study proved the psychodynamic theory is more promising than other approaches and anti-depressants. Furthermore, the American Journal of Psychiatry manifested that psychodynamic therapy is productive. In 2017, another meta-analyzed stated the treatment was as efficacious as cognitive behavioral therapy. But the personality changes resulting from psychodynamic treatment are still a bias.\n\n【45】**Know More About Psychodynamic Therapy.**\n\n【46】Firstly, address the issue and the thoughts on or off the psychodynamic therapy to one’s doctor. Then, here are several useful tips about the intervention to look at.\n\n【47】*   Each session has different stuff.\n\n【48】*   When one has nothing to talk about, one must indulge in sharing something about the experience and emotions.\n\n【49】*   Never neglect any session. Pay attention to every session.\n\n【50】*   Express anything in mind, as the entire hour is one.\n\n【51】*   The theme is ‘free association,’ so it’s never wrong to be off-topic.\n\n【52】*   Psychodynamic therapy, in some instances, takes many years.\n\n【53】*   The therapy works by any means, only with full attention and involvement.\n\n【54】*   One will see the swap even after thinking it will not work out.\n\n【55】*   Never leave somewhere unless the content is not yet arrived.\n\n【56】*   Be patient and express the thoughts that pop into the mind to the therapist. And he is there to alleviate the symptoms and thoughts.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】Of all therapies, psychodynamic therapy is more likely to have a robust client-therapist relationship which is known to be a demand to understand the psychological aliments of the patient. Interventions to address the underlying desires, dreams, fantasies, fears and primary causes of illness are examined. The therapy then fixates the actual cause.\n\n【59】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【60】* * *\n\n【61】#### **1.**删除换行**What Conditions Does Psychodynamic Therapy Treat?**\n\n【62】Numerous diseases, such as depression, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, trauma-related disorders, and interpersonal issues, can be successfully treated using psychodynamic therapy. It focuses on examining unconscious processes, unresolved issues, and early life experiences to foster understanding, self-awareness, and emotional healing.\n\n【63】#### **2.**删除换行**What Do Psychodynamic Therapies Aim to Achieve?**\n\n【64】A deeper awareness of the unconscious drives, conflicts, and behavioral patterns that fuel emotional discomfort is the goal of psychodynamic therapy. These treatments aim to bring about long-lasting psychological change and enhance general well-being by encouraging insight, self-awareness, and the resolution of unsolved concerns.\n\n【65】#### **3.**删除换行**What Distinguishes Behavior Therapy From Humanistic and Psychodynamic Therapies?**\n\n【66】Humanistic and psychodynamic therapies, in contrast to behavior therapy, focus on the patient's subjective experience, personal development, and examination of unconscious processes, respectively. Behavior therapy emphasizes observable behaviors and uses procedures like conditioning and reinforcement.\n\n【67】#### **4.**删除换行**What Conditions Are Suitable for Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【68】People with various mental health challenges, such as depression, anxiety disorders, relationship issues, personality disorders, unresolved trauma, and identity problems, may benefit from psychodynamic treatment. People looking for personal development, self-discovery, and better knowledge of their emotions and actions may also find it helpful.\n\n【69】#### **5.**删除换行**Who Is the Ideal Patient for Short Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【70】Someone drove to change, seeking targeted, time-limited treatment, and having particular goals or concerns they intend to address is the ideal candidate for brief psychodynamic therapy. People with relatively well-defined issues or distinct areas of difficulty that may be studied in a shorter treatment period benefit the most from this method.\n\n【71】#### **6.**删除换行**What Distinguishes Modern Psychodynamic Therapy From Traditional Psychoanalysis?**\n\n【72】Traditional psychoanalysis differs from contemporary psychodynamic therapy in several ways. It often lasts less time, concentrates more on particular problems, and includes a more collaborative and involved therapy interaction. Modern psychodynamic therapy frequently incorporates cutting-edge research and ideas from other therapeutic modalities, such as cognitive-behavioral treatments, to increase effectiveness and better serve current clients.\n\n【73】#### **7.**删除换行**What Changes Have Occurred Over Time in Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【74】Psychodynamic treatment has changed from traditional psychoanalysis's lengthy and passive nature to something more time-limited, focused, and interactive. To accommodate the variety of client demands, there has also been a more robust integration of empirical research, the incorporation of cognitive-behavioral approaches, and improved cultural awareness.\n\n【75】#### **8.**删除换行**What Does Psychology Mean by Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【76】Psychodynamic therapy, as used in psychology, is an approach that seeks to understand a person's emotional and psychological functioning by examining unconscious processes, early experiences, and interpersonal relationships. Its goals are to reduce distress and foster personal development. It emphasizes how unconscious drives and unresolved conflicts influence attitudes, feelings, and actions.\n\n【77】#### **9.**删除换行**What Makes Psychodynamic Treatment \"Depth Therapy\"?**\n\n【78】Because it probes under the surface of symptoms to examine underlying unconscious dynamics, unresolved conflicts, and early life events that lead to psychological discomfort, psychodynamic therapy is regarded as \"depth therapy.\" It seeks to elucidate hidden patterns, meanings, and motivations to thoroughly understand the person's inner world and promote long-lasting psychological development.\n\n【79】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Differences Between Psychodynamic Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?**\n\n【80】While Acceptance and Commitment treatment (ACT) focuses on accepting and controlling uncomfortable thoughts and emotions and taking dedicated action toward personal ideals, psychodynamic treatment stresses unconscious processes and unresolved conflicts.\n\n【81】#### **11.**删除换行**What Types of Inquiries Are Made in Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【82】In psychodynamic therapy, questions about unconscious beliefs, earlier relationships, early experiences, and coping strategies are asked to understand current behavior and address underlying issues.\n\n【83】#### **12.**删除换行**What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Psychodynamic Counseling?**\n\n【84】\\- Benefits: Psychodynamic therapy can lead to profound self-reflection, an understanding of unconscious processes, and the possibility of long-lasting change.  \n\\- Cons: It may not be appropriate for people looking for rapid symptom alleviation or for those who prefer a more structured and prescriptive approach because it can be time-consuming and involves numerous sessions.\n\n【85】#### **13.**删除换行**Which of the Following Is True Regarding Psychodynamic Therapy's Use in the Treatment of Unipolar?**\n\n【86】Although there is limited research to support its use as a stand-alone therapy, psychodynamic therapy can be helpful in the treatment of unipolar depression by examining underlying unconscious conflicts and unresolved issues that may contribute to depressive symptoms.\n\n【87】#### **14.**删除换行**What Changes Have Been Made to Psychodynamic Therapy?**\n\n【88】Psychodynamic therapy has changed to meet contemporary clients' demands and align with evidence-based methods.

It involves the administration of large volumes of solution either orally or via a nasogastric tube to clean the gastrointestinal tract. Whole bowel irrigation can be safely used in pediatric patients also. They are also safe for use in pregnancy.\n\n【2】What Are the Indications for Whole Bowel Irrigation?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】This procedure is usually performed to prepare the patients before surgery or for patients with drug or substance overdose.\n\n【4】The procedure is performed under the following conditions:\n\n【5】*   Prior to intestinal surgery, colonoscopy, or a barium enema to clean the bowel.\n\n【6】*   Ingestion or overdose of some life-threatening sustained-release or enteric-coated medications.\n\n【7】*   Ingestion or overdose of some life-threatening medications not absorbed by activated charcoal.\n\n【8】*   Ingestion of illicit drugs.\n\n【9】*   Ingestion of whole skin patches.\n\n【10】*   Whole bowel irrigation may lessen the need for more invasive procedures such as hemodialysis in sustained-release lithium or potassium chloride overdose.\n\n【11】What Are the Contraindications for Whole Bowel Irrigation?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Whole bowel irrigation is not done in the following conditions:\n\n【13】*   Uncooperative patient.\n\n【14】*   Patient with uncontrolled vomiting.\n\n【15】*   In whom a nose tube cannot be placed.\n\n【16】*   Patients with decreased consciousness.\n\n【17】*   Patient with compromised airway.\n\n【18】*   With intestinal obstruction.\n\n【19】*   With unstable vital signs.\n\n【20】*   A patient who is ventilated or intubated.\n\n【21】*   A person with a risk of seizure.\n\n【22】*   Abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【23】What Solutions Are Used in Whole Bowel Irrigation?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Initially, a solution of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate was used, but this solution was absorbed by the body, sometimes leading to complications. Later, a specialized irrigation fluid was developed, consisting mainly of an iso-osmolar solution of macrogol. With the macrogol solution, there is negligible absorption into the body.\n\n【25】How Do These Solutions Work?\n----------------------------\n\n【26】Current methods of gastrointestinal decontamination (emesis, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal administration) focus primarily on decontaminating the stomach. But the toxins are mostly absorbed in the small intestine. Sustained-release medications liberate drugs when they pass through the intestine and are absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【27】Infusion of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution decreases the contact time with the gastrointestinal mucosa. This reduces the absorption of the drug or toxin throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and also the solution is specifically designed to prevent electrolyte and fluid shifts.\n\n【28】What Are the Preparatory Steps to Be Done Before the Procedure?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】All necessary equipment should be placed at the bedside and assembled before beginning the procedure.\n\n【30】The equipment used for whole bowel irrigation includes:\n\n【31】*   10 % Lidocaine solution.\n\n【32】*   2 % Lidocaine jelly for lubrication.\n\n【33】*   Nasogastric tube of appropriate size.\n\n【34】*   Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution.\n\n【35】*   Reservoir bag to hold the irrigation solution.\n\n【36】*   Intravenous pole to hang the bag.\n\n【37】*   Bedside commode.\n\n【38】Explain the procedure, its risks, benefits, and alternatives to the patient. Informed consent should be obtained for toxin ingestion in suicidal cases. Inspect the nasal passages and oropharynx to rule out any anatomic abnormalities or obstructions that would obstruct the passage of a nasogastric tube.\n\n【39】How Is a Nasogastric Tube Inserted?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【40】Place the patient in the upright or semi-upright position. The patient’s vitals are monitored throughout the procedure. First, 1 mL of 10 % Lidocaine solution is sprayed into each nostril. Then the nasogastric tube is lubricated with Lidocaine jelly—this reduces patient pain and discomfort during the insertion of the nasogastric tube.\n\n【41】A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach. Flexion of the neck may facilitate passage of the tube into the esophagus and avoid endotracheal insertion. The conscious and cooperative patient may be asked to swallow water through a straw or swallow saliva to facilitate the passage of the tube. Stridor, cough, or cyanosis may indicate endotracheal passage and should result in the removal of the tube. If resistance is felt during the insertion of the nasogastric tube, do not insert it forcefully.\n\n【42】Try the following steps, which can help in nasogastric tube insertion:\n\n【43】*   Warm water helps soften the tip of the nasogastric tube and thereby makes insertion easier.\n\n【44】*   Tie a knot at the tip of the nasogastric tube, which creates a curve and makes insertion easier.\n\n【45】*   Curve the tip of the nasogastric tube and place it in a cup of ice for some minutes and insert the stiffener tube.\n\n【46】A plain abdominal film should be taken to confirm the placement of the nasogastric tube before the irrigation solution is administered.\n\n【47】What Happens During the Procedure?\n----------------------------------\n\n【48】The patient should be comfortably seated on the bedside commode. When administered to adults to prepare for surgery, colonoscopy, or any other procedure, the solution is given orally unless oral administration is contraindicated. The patient is given Metoclopramide intravenously to minimize vomiting.\n\n【49】A large volume of the nonabsorbable solution called Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte is usually given. Orally, the solution is taken at a rate of 240 mL every ten to 20 minutes. Nasogastrically, the solution is given at a rate of 500 mL per hour in children of nine months to six years, 1000 mL per hour in children six to 12 years, and 1500 to 2000 mL per hour in adults. The procedure may take up to six hours until the fecal discharge is clear.\n\n【50】If vomiting occurs during the procedure, the rate of administration is slowed. The procedure is stopped if the patient has abdominal distension or loss of abdominal sounds. Once the procedure is completed, the tube is removed, and the patient is kept under observation and monitoring.\n\n【51】What Are the Complications of Whole Bowel Irrigation?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】Whole bowel irrigation is a risky procedure.\n\n【53】The complications include:\n\n【54】*   Nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea.\n\n【55】*   Pulmonary aspiration of the solution.\n\n【56】*   Abdominal bloating.\n\n【57】*   Injury to the digestive tract or organs.\n\n【58】*   Anal irritation.\n\n【59】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【60】*   Swelling of lips.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Whole bowel irrigation is a technique to decontaminate the gut after acute toxic ingestion. Unfortunately, full bowel irrigation is a poorly tolerated procedure. It causes discomfort and can lead to complications in some cases. So, doctors should always analyze the patients thoroughly, get a proper history, and check if the patient would tolerate the procedure before performing this procedure.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   Whole-bowel irrigation in cases of poisoning: A retrospective multicentre study of feasibility, tolerability, and effectiveness  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35490109/\n*   Toxicology - Whole bowel irrigation  \n    https://aci.health.nsw.gov.au/networks/eci/clinical/procedures/procedures/576212\n*   Bowel Movement  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/bowelmovement.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The weakening of the bladder ligaments and the muscles present between the urinary bladder and vagina characterizes this condition. As a result, the bladder falls into the vagina, so this condition is also known as the fallen bladder. The vagina is a muscular organ that forms an integral part of the female reproductive system and links the uterus to the outside of the body. The urinary bladder is a bag-like organ that acts as a storage site for urine.\n\n【2】What Is a Cystocele?\n--------------------\n\n【3】Cystocele is a condition that arises due to the weakening of the pelvic floor muscles resulting in excessive pressure upon it, ultimately causing the drop of the bladder into the vagina. The pelvis is a structure present in the lower part of the body between the legs and the stomach. The organs present within the pelvic cavity are listed below:\n\n【4】1.  Organs that are involved in reproduction.\n\n【5】2.  Urinary bladder (a bag-like structure that stores the urine).\n\n【6】3.  Ureters (the tube-like structures responsible for carrying the urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder).\n\n【7】4.  Urethra (tubes responsible for carrying the urine outside the body).\n\n【8】**The three grades of cystocele are listed in the table below:**\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Pelvic Organ Prolapse - Types, Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Enterocele and Massive Vaginal Eversion - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>I am just 27, and my vaginal walls are lying outward. Why?</u>\n\n【14】The function of the pelvis is to provide support to the organs mentioned above so that they remain in their proper position. However, in conditions such as pregnancy, weight lifting, and constipation, pressure increases upon the pelvic floor, which causes the weakening of the muscles to present within the pelvis. This results in the wall between the pelvis and bladder collapsing, ultimately causing the bladder to fall into the vagina. Cystocele should not be confused with rectocele as the former occurs when the bladder slips into the vagina, and the latter arises when the rectum (the organ that holds the stool) falls into the vagina.\n\n【15】What Are the Causes and Risk Factors of a Cystocele?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】There are certain conditions due to which pressure develops on the pelvic floor, causing the weakening of the muscles, connective tissues, and ligaments present within the pelvis. These conditions are also the risk factors for cystocele, and they are listed below:\n\n【17】*   **Vaginal Delivery:** It is the most common and the safest mode of childbirth. The term that doctors often use is \"normal delivery,\" which implies this vaginal delivery. It is the most preferred method of child delivery worldwide compared to a cesarean section or C-section. However, sometimes, due to trauma or multiple pregnancies, the muscles that form the pelvic floor and support the vagina get strained so that they cannot support the urinary bladder. As a result of which, the bladder sinks into the vagina. This situation most commonly arises in vaginal delivery and has been reported in more than 35 percent of women.\n\n【18】*   **Obesity:** Excessive body weight (obesity) increases the risk of bladder prolapse because it increases the pressure within the abdomen resulting in the weakening of the muscles that comprise the pelvic floor. When the muscle becomes weak, there is no support left for the bladder, and it drops into the vagina.\n\n【19】*   **Weight Lifting:** Women who lift heavy objects or weights repeatedly are always at the risk of uterine prolapse. Lifting weights more than the capacity of the body strains and weakens the muscles of the pelvic floor, which support the uterus causing it to slip into the vagina.\n\n【20】*   **Constipation:** The condition in which the bowel moments are not regular, and the patient passes less than three stools a week. The stools remain within the body resulting in pressure on the floor of the pelvis.\n\n【21】*   **Coughing:** During coughing, the muscles present within the stomach and pelvis contract vigorously. These contractions cause pressure on the bladder and the pelvic muscles.\n\n【22】*   **Menopause:** It is the period in which the menstrual cycle (periods) ends in the life of a woman at the age of 45 to 50 years. The hormone level within the body changes, and mainly, the estrogen hormone levels go down. Estrogen is responsible for regulating the reproductive functions in females and provides strength to the pelvis muscles. The lowered estrogen levels weaken the pelvic muscles, increasing the risk of bladder prolapse.\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of a Cystocele?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【24】Cystoceles do not present with symptoms in mild cases, but if the condition persists for a prolonged period, it can present with the following symptoms:\n\n【25】1.  There is a constant feeling of heaviness in the vagina and lower part of the abdomen (near the pelvis). Also, a bulge in the vagina is both seen and felt.\n\n【26】2.  There are several problems that a patient faces related to urinary flow, and they are listed below:\n\n【27】*   Difficulty in the passage of urine.\n\n【28】*   The patient rushes to the bathroom frequently for urination because of the constant feeling that the bladder is not empty.\n\n【29】*   Difficulty in starting the flow of urine, and the flow of urine stops before the bladder becomes empty.\n\n【30】*   Due to the frequent need to urinate, urine might leak, resulting in urinary incontinence. - Pressure is felt in the pelvic region throughout the day during activities like standing, coughing, or lifting something. -The patient might feel pain at the time of sex as there is discomfort within the vagina due to the bladder prolapse.\n\n【31】How Is a Cystocele Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【32】The diagnosis of cystocele involves the following steps:\n\n【33】**Medical History Form:** The doctor asks the patient to fill out a medical history form to get an idea about the condition of the disease and the health of the patient. The questions are based on the following:\n\n【34】*   Any symptoms of fullness or heaviness in the vagina or pressure felt in the lower abdominal region (pelvic region).\n*   History of pregnancy to further evaluate the condition because vaginal delivery is one of the risk factors for cystocele.\n*   Family history to check if anyone in the family has been diagnosed with this condition.\n*   Bladder and bowel habits to know if the patient has difficulty passing out urine or stools to rule out constipation.\n*   Information is also needed about the drugs the patient is consuming.\n\n【35】**Physical Examination:** The doctor examines the patient both in the standing and the supine (lying down) position. The physical examination involves the following:\n\n【36】*   Examination of the vagina is done to check if there is any tissue bulging into it. For example, in the case of cystocele, the bladder bulges into the vagina so that the doctor will feel it upon examination.\n*   The doctor usually asks the patient to sit in a similar position during a bowel movement to check how far the bladder has slipped into the vagina.\n*   To assess the strength of pelvic muscles, the doctor asks the patient to tighten them, just like holding the flow of urine.\n\n【37】**Urine Tests:** One of the symptoms of cystocele or bladder prolapse is difficulty in the passage of urine as the urine remains retained within the bladder and the patient frequently rushes to the bathroom for urination. Therefore, the following tests are carried out as a urine examination:\n\n【38】*   **Post-void Residual Urine Test:** The patient is asked to pass urine and empty the bladder. The doctor then evaluates the amount of urine remaining in the bladder by the following methods:\n*   **Ultrasound:** An imaging test in which X-ray images of the bladder and vagina are obtained on the screen. These images help the doctor understand the amount of urine present within the bladder.\n*   **Catheterization:** In this method, the doctor inserts a tube known as a catheter to drain the urine present within the bladder. The doctor then measures the amount of urine drained out from the bladder and compares it with the standard values.\n*   **Voiding Cystourethrogram:** An imaging test in which the bladder is filled with a particular type of liquid. X-ray images are used to see when the bladder is filled with liquid and when the patient passes out urine. In addition, it allows the doctor to check if the bladder and the kidneys are working correctly or not.\n\n【39】What Are the Treatment Options for Cystocele?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Not all cases of cystocele present with symptoms and need to require treatment urgently. The doctor will suggest the treatment only if the condition is severe and the patient is symptomatic. The treatment options include:\n\n【41】*   **Kegel Exercises:** These exercises target the pelvic muscles (the muscles used to stop the urine flow) and strengthen them. The stronger the muscles of the pelvic floor, the better they support the bladder and other organs. It is important that the patient follows the instructions given by the doctor and only then performs these exercises. In these exercises, the patient must tighten the pelvic floor muscles and focus only on them for five to ten seconds, and they are relaxed again.\n\n【42】*   **Vaginal Support Device:** The device inserted into the vagina for support is known as a pessary. The device is a plastic or rubber ring inserted by the doctor to support the bladder. It will only provide relief from the symptoms and in no way work to cure the disease.\n\n【43】Is It Required to Do Surgery?\n-----------------------------\n\n【44】Surgery is required in only those cases where the patient is under constant discomfort due to the symptoms, and the doctor might recommend the following surgical treatments:\n\n【45】1.  **Anterior Colporrhaphy:** This procedure is meant to repair the cystocele. This method involves shifting the bladder back to the place and tightening the muscles that support the bladder with the help of stitches.\n\n【46】2.  **Urethral Suspension Surgery:** This surgery mainly supports the urethra (tubes that carry urine outside the body) to prevent urine leakage.\n\n【47】3.  **Obliterative Surgery:** In this procedure, the inner walls and all other parts of the vagina that support the bladder are closed to prevent it from bulging inwards.\n\n【48】**Lifestyle Changes:** The following lifestyle changes can help prevent the development of pressure upon the muscles of the pelvis:\n\n【49】1.  Foods rich in fibers like bananas, apples, and beans help proper bowel movement and prevent constipation.\n\n【50】2.  Coughing produces unnecessary pressure on the pelvic muscles, so the patient needs to manage the cough to prevent anterior bladder prolapse.\n\n【51】3.  The patient should avoid lifting heavy objects or weights because that strains the pelvic muscles and weakens them.\n\n【52】4.  It is important to maintain a correct body weight because obesity or excessive body weight increases the pressure upon the abdominal muscles.\n\n【53】What Are the Complications of a Cystocele?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【54】The complications of cystocele mainly arise when the patient is not responding well to the treatment or the condition has progressed to an advanced stage. In the advanced case, the muscles supporting the pelvis become strained to such an extent that they cannot support the uterus, and it ultimately slips into the vagina or bulges out of the vagina. This condition is known as procidentia. One of the symptoms of bladder prolapse is urine retention; this increases the risk of urinary tract infection as the urine present within the body becomes a medium for bacterial growth. In rare cases, the condition recurs.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Cystocele is not a life-threatening condition, but the condition can become severe if not treated at the right time. Women find it difficult to urinate and experience other symptoms related to the urinary system. The patient needs to consult the doctor as soon as any such symptoms are noticed to make a timely diagnosis, and the patient lives a healthy life ahead. An important point that needs to be remembered is that no treatment is required in mild cases, and only lifestyle modifications can help the patient cure the condition.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   What Is PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE  \n    https://www.nafc.org/pelvic-organ-prolapse/\n*   Cystocele  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK564303/\n*   Cystocele  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/cystocele#complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Anybody can snore at some point in life. For example, while some individuals breathe heavily while sleeping, others make a soft whistling sound. Snoring occurs when air cannot flow easily through the nose or mouth. Snoring can disrupt sleep quality and be a nuisance for the bed partner.\n\n【2】**Is Snoring Ever Normal?**\n\n【3】Almost everyone snores now and then, but it can be a chronic problem for some people. Snoring does not necessarily mean a medical condition but can sometimes indicate a serious sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is described by loud snoring followed by a few seconds of quietness due to a pause in breathing.\n\n【4】**How Common Is the Problem?**\n\n【5】As many as 45 % of individuals snore sometimes, and 25 % snore almost all the time. Men, especially those above 50 years, overweight or obese, are more likely to snore than women.\n\n【6】Why Do People Snore?\n--------------------\n\n【7】If the airway is restricted, tissues such as the soft palate, tonsils, adenoids, and tongue vibrate against each other as one forces air through the mouth or nose. These vibrations produce a rumbling, rattling noise.\n\n【8】Several factors and conditions can block airflow. Here are some of them:\n\n【9】*   Alcohol and other sedatives can relax the throat and tongue muscles, restricting airflow and contributing to snoring noises.\n\n【10】*   Bulky soft tissue, like enlarged adenoids, tonsils, or tongue.\n\n【11】*   Certain seasonal allergies or sinus infections can make some individuals' noses stuffy and cause them to snore.\n\n【12】*   Being overweight can lead to the narrowing of the air passages. That is why people who are overweight tend to snore.\n\n【13】*   Pregnancy hormones can cause inflammation in the nose.\n\n【14】*   Poor muscle tone and muscle weakness in the nose, tongue, or throat. Nose, throat, and tongue muscles can be too relaxed, which causes them to collapse into the airway.\n\n【15】*   Deviated nasal septum (when the thin wall that divides one nostril from the other is off-center) or nasal polyps (a painless non-cancerous growth on the nose lining or sinuses) can also obstruct the airways.\n\n【16】*   Structural differences in the nose, mouth, or throat decrease the size of the airway.\n\n【17】*   Sleeping on the back can make one snore. Sleeping on a pillow that is too soft or too large can also be one of the factors for snoring.\n\n【18】*   The throat muscles might relax too much if a person is not getting enough sleep.\n\n【19】What Are the Symptoms of Snoring?\n---------------------------------\n\n【20】Snoring sounds can range from quiet whistles or vibrations to loud grumbling, snorting, or rumbling. Snoring is frequently associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. Not everyone who snores has this condition, but if any of the following symptoms accompany snoring, it can be a hint to see a healthcare provider for evaluation.\n\n【21】*   Excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\n【22】*   Breathing pauses during sleep.\n\n【23】*   Difficulty concentrating and moodiness.\n\n【24】*   Morning headaches.\n\n【25】*   Sore throat upon awakening.\n\n【26】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【27】*   Chest pain at night.\n\n【28】*   Restless sleep.\n\n【29】*   Gasping or choking at night.\n\n【30】*   In children, behavioral issues, poor attention, or poor performance in school can cause snoring.\n\n【31】**What Are the Complications of Snoring?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Snoring can sometimes be more than just a nuisance to the bed partner. Apart from disrupting the bed partner's sleep, if snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea, it can cause problems, including:\n\n【33】*   Poor night's sleep can make one feel sleepy during the day, interfering with the quality of life.\n\n【34】*   Difficulty concentrating.\n\n【35】*   Frequent frustration or anger.\n\n【36】*   High blood pressure, stroke, and heart conditions.\n\n【37】*   Children with obstructive sleep apnea have a high risk of behavior problems, like aggression or learning difficulties.\n\n【38】*   Frequent waking from sleep.\n\n【39】*   Waking up several times at night disrupts the pattern of sleep.\n\n【40】How Is Snoring Diagnosed?\n-------------------------\n\n【41】The healthcare provider reviews the signs, symptoms, and medical history to diagnose the condition. The provider can also perform a physical examination to look for the things blocking the airways, such as chronic nasal congestion due to rhinitis, sinusitis, deviated septum, or swollen tonsils. Additionally, the provider might ask your partner questions about when and how you snore to help evaluate the severity of the problem.\n\n【42】They may also order some tests, including:\n\n【43】*   **Imaging Test:** The provider may recommend an imaging test, such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These imaging tests help check the structure of the airway for problems like a deviated septum.\n\n【44】*   **Sleep Study:** The provider may order a sleep study called a polysomnogram to evaluate sleep patterns. One can do a sleep study at home or may need to spend the night in a sleep center to undergo an in-depth analysis of breathing during sleep. A sleep study assesses:\n\n【45】    *   Brain wave activity.\n\n【46】    *   Breathing patterns.\n\n【47】    *   Heart rate and oxygen levels.\n\n【48】    *   Eye, arm, or leg movements during sleep.\n\n【49】    *   Sleep cycles and snoring.\n\n【50】What Are the Treatments for Snoring?\n------------------------------------\n\n【51】The provider recommends treatments for improving the posture or opening the airways during sleep. Remedies for snoring include:\n\n【52】**Home Remedies:**\n\n【53】*   Avoid drinking alcohol before bed.\n\n【54】*   Changing the sleep position. Sleep on the side rather than on the back.\n\n【55】*   Maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n【56】*   Establish regular sleeping patterns, like, try going to bed at the same time every night.\n\n【57】*   Improve eating habits.\n\n【58】*   Avoiding sleep deprivation.\n\n【59】*   Use nasal strips. These flexible bands stick to the outside of your nose, which helps keep nasal passages open.\n\n【60】*   Wear an oral appliance when sleeping to keep your jaw in the proper position so air can flow. Mouth devices or mouth guards are such oral appliances.\n\n【61】**Medications:** For mild cases of snoring due to swelling of the lining of the nose, the provider may prescribe a steroid nasal spray to take before going to sleep. Cold and allergy medications alleviate nasal congestion and help in breathing freely.\n\n【62】Surgical procedures or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be prescribed for severe cases of snoring due to sleep apnea.\n\n【63】**Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP:** This is the most effective and reliable treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea that involves wearing a mask over the nose or mouth during sleep. This mask delivers pressurized air from a small bedside pump to the airway to keep it open during sleep. CPAP stops snoring and is commonly used to treat snoring when associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).\n\n【64】**Surgical Treatments:** In some cases, snoring and sleep-disordered breathing are treated with surgery to shrink or remove extra tissue or correct a structural problem.\n\n【65】*   **Laser-Assisted Uvulapalatoplasty (LAUP):** It reduces tissue in the soft palate and enhances airflow.\n\n【66】*   **Septoplasty:** This approach straightens a deviated nasal septum. It improves airflow through the nose by reshaping the bone and cartilage.\n\n【67】*   **Radiofrequency Ablation:** This minimally invasive technique utilizes radiofrequency energy to shrink excess tissue in the tongue and soft palate.\n\n【68】*   **Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy:** The surgery involves removing the excess tissue from the back of the throat (tonsillectomy) or the back of the nose (adenoidectomy).\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Snoring can be annoying and disruptive. Sometimes it can also be a symptom of a larger underlying medical problem. Talk to a healthcare provider if snoring lasts longer than a few nights or is very loud. Long-term snoring can cause serious health issues, including heart attack, stroke, and other health problems. Snoring can be reduced by staying healthy and active, losing weight, avoiding alcohol, and adopting other lifestyle changes. Discuss with a healthcare provider the available treatments to help one breathe easier, sleep better, and feel more rested.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Ways to Stop Snoring?**\n\n【74】The ways to stop snoring may include the following:  \n\\- Treating nasal congestion.  \n\\- Sleeping on the side.  \n\\- Using nasal strips.  \n\\- Avoiding alcohol and smoking.\n\n【75】#### **2.**删除换行**Why Is Snoring So Annoying?**\n\n【76】If a person gets unduly annoyed with snoring, the fault may only partially be on the person who snores. If a person gets annoyed with sounds like snoring, screeching, or squeaking, they may suffer from misophonia. This condition is known as the hatred of sound.\n\n【77】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Snoring Curable?**\n\n【78】Yes, snoring is curable. The treatment depends on the cause of snoring. The doctor may recommend a device called continuous positive airway pressure to treat snoring. It helps maintain the air pressure in the lungs and prevents snoring.\n\n【79】#### **4.**删除换行**How to Sleep With a Snoring Partner?**\n\n【80】Ways to sleep with a snoring partner include:  \n\\- Using ear plugs.  \n\\- Avoid focusing on snoring.  \n\\- Listening to music or white noise.   \n\\- Encouraging the partner to visit a doctor.\n\n【81】#### **5.**删除换行**Why Is Snoring Considered Unhealthy?**\n\n【82】Snoring is considered unhealthy as it may signify some underlying conditions. It may be caused due to conditions such as obesity, alcohol, and smoking and hence considered unhealthy.\n\n【83】#### **6.**删除换行**Do Snorers Hear Themselves?**\n\n【84】No snorers usually do not hear themselves. While sleeping, their brain does not perceive sensory information. Hence a person cannot hear their own snores. However, a snorer may occasionally hear their own snoring.\n\n【85】#### **7.**删除换行**For How Long Do People Snore?**\n\n【86】Research among Americans has shown that a person snores about two or three times at night. The snoring can last between 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The snoring duration varies slightly among men and women.\n\n【87】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Reason Behind Excessive Snoring?**\n\n【88】Snoring, to a certain extent, is acceptable. However, excessive snoring is associated with certain underlying conditions. For example, conditions such as sleep apnea can cause excessive snoring. However, this may not be the case in all cases, and it is better to obtain a medical opinion.\n\n【89】#### **9.**删除换行**What Are the Risk Factors of Snoring?**\n\n【90】The risk factors of snoring include  \n\\- Obesity.  \n\\- Smoking and alcohol habits.  \n\\- Nasal congestions.  \n\\- Family history of sleep apnea.  \n\\- Men are at greater risk than women.\n\n【91】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Most Effective Treatments for Nasal Congestion?**\n\n【92】The most effective ways to treat nasal congestion are:  \n\\- Using nasal dilators.  \n\\- Losing weight.  \n\\- Sleeping on the side.   \n\\- Avoid smoking and alcohol.   \n\\- Treating nasal obstruction.\n\n【93】#### **11.**删除换行**When Should Snoring Be a Cause of Concern?**\n\n【94】Snoring should be a cause of concern when it is associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition with a pause in breathing while sleeping. It is also associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Hence a doctor should be consulted when there is obstruction of breathing and snoring.\n\n【95】#### **12.**删除换行**Is It Normal to Snore every day?**\n\n【96】Most of the population snored at some point or another in life. However, snoring becomes a chronic issue if it occurs every day. Snoring every day can cause sleep disturbance and also disturb their partner's sleep. Hence chronic snoring should not be taken lightly. It is also observed that snoring worsens with age.\n\n【97】#### **13.**删除换行**Which Sleeping Posture Avoids Snoring?**\n\n【98】Sleeping posture can have a significant impact on the snoring of a person. Sleeping on the side can significantly affect the snoring of a person. Sleeping on one side causes lesser air compression, hence reduced snoring.\n\n【99】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【100】无关删除-1:<u>*   Snoring  \n    https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Snoring\n*   How to Stop Snoring?  \n    https://www.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/snoring-tips-to-help-you-and-your-partner-sleep-better.htm\n*   Snoring  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15580-snoring</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "f4171e4f-8ac2-447b-a6a4-9e81eb8bf9e6", "title": "Parts of Knee - An Overview", "text": "【0】Parts of Knee - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The knee is a complex joint that is the largest weight-bearing joint in the body. It consists of three parts: the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and patella (kneecap). The kneecap helps protect the knee from wear and tear while providing a surface for ligaments and tendons to attach to the bones. The knee is made up of several different muscles, ligaments, and tendons that work together to allow the knee to move and bear weight. These components work together to provide stability and mobility, allowing us to perform everyday activities such as walking, running, and even climbing stairs.\n\n【2】What Are the Parts of the Knee?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The knee is a complex structure and one of the body's most stressed joints. It is the most significant joint, essential for movement, and prone to injury. It is made up of bones, menisci, ligaments, and tendons.\n\n【4】**1\\. Bone:** The knee joint consists of three bones called as\n\n【5】*   Femur - It is an upper leg bone, also called the thigh bone.\n\n【6】*   Tibia - It is a front lower leg bone or shin bone.\n\n【7】*   Patella - Also known as the knee cap, is a small triangular-shaped bone that sits over the other bone at the front of the knee joint.\n\n【8】**2\\. Cartilage:** There are two types of cartilage in the knee joint\n\n【9】*   **Meniscus Cartilage:** It is a C-shaped cartilage in the knee joint. It cushions between the thighbone (femur) and shinbone (tibia) and helps distribute body weight. They also contain nerves that help improve balance and stability. There are two types of the meniscus:\n\n【10】**Medial -** It is the largest of the two present on the inner side of the knee\n\n【11】**Lateral-** Present on the outer side of the knee\n\n【12】*   **Articular Cartilage:** The articular cartilage covers the femur, top of the tibia, and back of patella bones at the end of the knee joint. It acts as a shock absorber and provides a smooth surface for movement.\n\n【13】**3\\. Ligaments:** Ligaments connect the bone to the bones. The four ligaments in the knee provide stability and hold the joint in place. These ligaments include:\n\n【14】*   Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) - It is located in the center of the knee. It prevents the femur from sliding backward on the tibia and the tibia from sliding forward on the femur.\n\n【15】*   Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) - It is also located in the center and prevents backward shifting of the knee.\n\n【16】*   Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) - It provides stability to the knee's inner part and prevents side-to-side movement of the femur.\n\n【17】*   Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) - Provides stability to the outer part of the knee. It also prevents side movement of the femur.\n\n【18】**4\\. Tendons:** Tendons connect muscles and bones. The quadriceps tendon connects the front thigh muscles to the kneecap. The largest tendon in the knee is the patellar tendon which runs from the kneecap to the shinbone.\n\n【19】**5\\. Muscles:** Although muscles are not technically part of the knee joint, the hamstrings, and quadriceps are the muscles that strengthen the leg and aid in knee flexion.\n\n【20】*   **Hamstrings -** There are three muscles at the back thigh that run from the hip to just below the knee and help to bend the knee.\n\n【21】*   **Quadriceps -** Four muscle in front of the thigh that runs from the hip to below the knee. They help to straighten the knee joint.\n\n【22】*   **Gluteal -** The gluteal muscles, also known as the glutes, are located in the buttocks and play an important role in knee positioning.\n\n【23】**6\\. Joint Capsule:** A joint capsule is a bag of membranes that surround the knee joint. It is filled with synovial fluid, a liquid that lubricates and nourishes the joint.\n\n【24】**7\\. Bursa:** Bursas are tiny fluid-filled sacs in the knee joint. They act as cushions between the bones and other structures, helping reduce friction and wear. The bursa in the knee can become inflamed from overuse or injury and cause pain and discomfort.\n\n【25】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Knee Problems?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The symptoms of knee problems vary depending on the condition. Common symptoms include :\n\n【27】*   Pain - It may be localized to the knee or radiated down into the leg.\n\n【28】*   Swelling - Swelling is usually more prominent in the morning and after activity.\n\n【29】*   Stiffness- Stiffness is most often felt after sitting or lying down for an extended period.\n\n【30】*   Locking or Catching - can occur when certain pieces of tissue within the knee are damaged, resulting in a temporary inability to straighten or bend the leg.\n\n【31】*   Instability and Weakness - Instability or weakness can make walking or performing daily activities difficult. If a person experiences any of these symptoms, they must contact the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【32】What Are the Some Common Knee Problems?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【33】The knee is comprised of numerous vital structures, any of which can be injured. The following are some of the more common knee problems.\n\n【34】**1\\. Chondromalacia:** Also called Patellofemoral syndrome, This is a condition in which the cartilage on the underside of the kneecap becomes soft and starts to wear away. They can cause pain and swelling in the knee and grinding sensations when moving the knee.\n\n【35】**2\\. Knee Osteoarthritis:** This condition affects the joints of the knee, causing them to become stiff and painful. Symptoms include joint swelling, tenderness, stiffness, and difficulty moving the knee.\n\n【36】**3\\. Knee Effusion:** Fluid buildup inside the knee due to inflammation, arthritis, and injuries to the knee can cause knee effusion.\n\n【37】**4\\. Meniscal Tear:** This is an injury to one of the two rubbery discs between the knee's shin bone and thigh bone. Symptoms include pain, swelling, and locking or catching the knee joint.\n\n【38】**5\\. ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Strain or Treat:** The ACL is responsible for a large portion of the knee's stability. An ACL tear frequently results in the knee \"giving out,\" which may necessitate surgical repair.\n\n【39】**6\\. PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament) Strain or Tear:** PCL tears can result in pain, swelling, and instability in the knee. These injuries are less common than ACL tears; physical therapy is usually preferable to surgery.\n\n【40】**7\\. MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament) Strain or Tear:** Injury to the MCL may cause pain and instability to the inner side of the knee.\n\n【41】**8\\. Knee Bursitis:** Knee bursitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and warmth in any knee bursae. Bursitis is frequently caused by overuse or injury.\n\n【42】**9\\. Patellar Subluxation:** The kneecap slides abnormally or dislocates along the thigh bone during the activity. As a result, there is knee pain around the kneecap.\n\n【43】**10\\. Patellar Tendonitis:** Tendon inflammation connects the kneecap (patella) to the shin bone. It is most common in athletes as a result of repeated jumping.\n\n【44】**11\\. Rheumatoid Arthritis:** An autoimmune disorder that can result in arthritis of any joint, including the knees, if left untreated, can cause permanent joint damage.\n\n【45】**12\\. Baker’s Cyst:** It is a fluid accumulation in the back of the knee. A persistent effusion in the condition of arthritis typically causes Baker's cysts.\n\n【46】**13\\. Gout:** A type of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in a joint. The knees may be affected, resulting in severe pain and swelling.\n\n【47】**14\\. Pseudogout:** A type of arthritis similar to gout in which calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposit in the knee or other joints.\n\n【48】**15\\. Septic Arthritis:** An infection inside the knee caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungus may cause inflammation, pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the knee.\n\n【49】How to Prevent Knee Injuries?\n-----------------------------\n\n【50】Knee injuries are some of the most common types of sports injuries, and they can range from minor to severe. To avoid knee injuries, following a few simple safety steps is essential.\n\n【51】*   Warm up properly before physical activity. Warming up increases blood flow to the muscles, which helps to prevent injuries.\n\n【52】*   Stretching before and after exercise is also essential for loosening muscles and reducing strain on the knee joint.\n\n【53】*   Maintain leg muscle strength by using the stairs, riding a stationary bicycle, or lifting weights.\n\n【54】*   Avoid abrupt changes in exercise intensity.\n\n【55】*   Maintain a healthy weight to avoid putting additional strain on the knees.\n\n【56】*   Wear the seatbelt at all times and also wear knee guards.\n\n【57】In addition, proper footwear is essential for knee injury prevention. Shoes should fit correctly and provide adequate support. For more intense activities, such as running or playing sports, specialty shoes may be beneficial for additional shock absorption and cushioning.\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】The knee is a complex joint critical for mobility and stability. Know the parts, disorders, and injuries associated with the knee. Common knee disorders include osteoarthritis, tendonitis, and ligament tears. Prevention measures include proper form, wearing appropriate protective gear, and taking breaks. If a person experiences symptoms of knee problems, it is best to seek medical advice from a professional.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anatomy of the Knee  \n    https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/about-arthritis/where-it-hurts/anatomy-of-the-knee\n*   about-your-knee.pdf  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/pdfs/about-your-knee.pdf\n*   Knee Pain and Problems  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/knee-pain-and-problems</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is caused due to lifelong exposure to hypoxia (lack of oxygen). People living above 2500 meters all over the world are at a higher risk of developing this condition. It has been found that more than 140 million people live above 2500 meters of sea level worldwide and approximately about five to ten percent of people are at a greater risk of acquiring this disease.\n\n【2】Chronic mountain sickness is characterized by severe symptomatic excessive erythrocytosis (higher than normal red blood cells in the blood) and increased hypoxemia (lower levels of oxygen levels in the blood), which are commonly related to pulmonary hypertension (pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lungs is very high). In more advanced cases, the condition may progress to cor pulmonale (a condition in which the right side of the heart fails) and congestive heart failure.\n\n【3】What Is the Etiology of Chronic Mountain Sickness?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Chronic exposure to lower levels of blood oxygen (hypoxia) is widely suggested as the main underlying cause of chronic mountain sickness. The loss of ventilatory acclimatization (the process whereby the rate of breathing increases at high altitude)to altitude hypoxia that causes central hypoventilation (inadequate breathing during sleep) has been suggested as the principal mechanism responsible for causing prolonged hypoxemia and the subsequent excessive erythrocytosis.\n\n【5】Evidence also suggests a genetic basis for chronic mountain fever. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the SENP1 (sentrin-specific protease 1) gene has recently been discovered to be responsible for encoding a protease that regulates erythropoiesis.\n\n【6】What Are the Risk Factors Associated With Chronic Mountain Sickness?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】A medical history of chronic mountain sickness along with the history of loss of ventilatory acclimatization, lack of respiratory sensitivity to reduced blood oxygen levels, sleep apnea (sleep disorder where breathing stops and starts repeatedly), and all hypopnea (reduction in ventilation), aggravated hypoxemia, older age group, male gender, post-menopausal women, and obesity are all predisposing and risk factors for chronic mountain sickness.\n\n【8】What Is the Epidemiology of Chronic Mountain Sickness?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】It is believed that native Tibetans and Ethiopians are the most adapted ethnic groups that are most frequently affected by the disorder when compared with Andeans and Han immigrants. Men are more commonly affected than females. The disease is more prevalent in advanced age and postmenopausal women. Usually, inhabitants living above 2500 meters of sea level are at a higher risk of developing this condition.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>The Surprising Link Between Swimming Pools and Hepatitis</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Abdominal Migraine - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Medical Conditions Affecting Sexual Health in Men</u>\n\n【15】What Are the Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Mountain Sickness?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The following clinical signs and symptoms can be seen:\n\n【17】*   Excessive erythrocytosis (increased red blood cell count) where the hemoglobin becomes more than 19 grams per deciliter for women and more than 21 grams per deciliter for men. Ideally, the hemoglobin for women should be 11.6 to 15 grams per deciliter, and for men, it should be between 13.2 to 16.6 grams per deciliter.\n\n【18】*   Hypervolemia (a condition where excessive fluid volume is present in the body).\n\n【19】*   Generalized dilatation of blood vessels.\n\n【20】*   Typical clubbing of fingers and toes.\n\n【21】*   Mucous membranes of the mouth and throat exhibit deep cyanosis (skin starts showing blue discoloration in individuals whose blood has very low oxygen levels).\n\n【22】*   Watery eyes.\n\n【23】*   Conjunctival hyperemia with profound capillary distensions (a pathological response of the blood vessels in response to inflammation due to infectious and non-infectious causes).\n\n【24】*   Dilated retinal vessels.\n\n【25】*   Severe bone and joint pain.\n\n【26】*   Decreased stamina for exercise.\n\n【27】*   Dyspnea (lack of breathing).\n\n【28】*   Insomnia (lack of sleep).\n\n【29】*   Headache.\n\n【30】*   Dizziness.\n\n【31】*   Mental confusion.\n\n【32】*   Paresthesias (prickling sensation in the hands and feet).\n\n【33】*   Hypertension.\n\n【34】*   Congestive heart failure.\n\n【35】How Is the Diagnosis of Chronic Mountain Sickness Made?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Firstly the causes of chronic pulmonary diseases are discarded because they can also cause hypoxemia. Once these causes have been ruled out, diagnosis of primary chronic mountain sickness is based on the presence of clinical symptoms, including dizziness, breathlessness, insomnia, tiredness, bluish discoloration of the skin, prickling in the hands and feet, dilatation of veins, muscle, and joint pain, loss of appetite, unable to concentrate, and memory loss.\n\n【37】Clinical signs include severe hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension. Lung function tests should be carried out to assess normal respiratory functions.\n\n【38】What Is the Treatment of Chronic Mountain Sickness?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   Non-Pharmacological Treatment - The clinical signs and symptoms of chronic mountain sickness gradually disappear after coming to lower altitudes or sea levels, and they will reappear after returning to a high altitude. Although this is an effective practice in managing the syndrome, it is a temporary solution unless the patient permanently shifts and moves to a lower-altitude site or location. It has been suggested that periodic travels to lower altitudes prevent hemoglobin levels from reaching excessive levels. Phlebotomy (surgical puncture of a vein in order to withdraw blood) is another medical practice that is performed frequently to reduce red blood cell mass and hemoglobin concentration. Mild and moderate physical exercise has been suggested as a noninvasive practical alternative therapy to improve hypoxemia and decrease excessive erythrocytosis. Periodic health check-ups are necessary for up to one year to check hemoglobin concentration and related comorbidities.\n\n【40】*   Pharmacological Treatment - Several drugs have shown promising results. Among these, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, dopaminergic antagonists, and ventilatory stimulants such as medroxyprogesterone have been found to be effective in reducing hypoventilation. Pharmacological treatment with Acetazolamide (250 milligrams per day) is safely recommended for up to six months. Advanced disease cases should permanently shift to a lower altitude or sea level.\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】Millions of people all over the world live at higher altitudes. Many of these people are at a greater risk of chronic mountain sickness. It is a progressive incapacitating syndrome that is caused by prolonged exposure to severe hypoxia, often resulting in pulmonary hypertension. However, there are several risk factors that may trigger the condition. It is important to identify the clinical signs and symptoms of the syndrome to establish the diagnosis and promptly enable treatment. It is advisable to permanently shift to a lower altitude in order to improve the health condition.\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   Microbial Adherence to Contact Lenses and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a Model Organism for Microbial Keratitis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36422634/\n*   Bacterial Colonization of Disposable Soft Contact Lenses Is Greater during Corneal Infiltrative Events than during Asymptomatic Extended Lens Wear  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC87615/\n*   Contact lens associated microbial keratitis: practical considerations for the optometrist  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30214344/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The function of this muscle is to help with the lifting and also help in the rotation of the arm. A tear in this muscle can cause significant pain and limit the range of motion in the shoulder. In this article, we will discuss the management of supraspinatus tears.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of a Supraspinatus Tear?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The following are the causes of a supraspinatus tear, including:\n\n【4】*   **Overuse**: Repetitive overhead movements, such as those performed by athletes in sports like baseball, tennis, or swimming, can put a lot of stress on the supraspinatus muscle, leading to a tear.\n*   **Trauma:** A sudden trauma, such as a fall or a direct blow to the shoulder, can cause a supraspinatus tear.\n*   **Degeneration:** As people age, the supraspinatus muscle can degenerate, making it more prone to tears.\n*   **Impingement:** It occurs when the space between the humerus (upper arm bone) and the acromion (part of the shoulder blade) becomes narrow, and puts pressure on the supraspinatus muscle.\n*   **Poor Posture:** Poor posture, including slouching or hunching over a desk, leads to extra strain on the shoulders, and causes a supraspinatus tear.\n*   **Genetics:** Some people are more prone for a supraspinatus tear due to the genetics.\n\n【5】What Are the Symptoms of a Supraspinatus Tear?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The symptoms of a supraspinatus tear depends on the severity of the tear, but here are some common symptoms:\n\n【7】*   **Pain:** The most common symptom of a supraspinatus tear is pain in the shoulder. The pain may be mild to severe and may worsen with movement or activity, especially with overhead movements.\n*   **Weakness:** Weakness in the shoulder is another common symptom of a supraspinatus tear. Lifting or rotating the arm may be difficult, and the shoulder may feel unstable.\n*   **Limited Range of Motion:** A supraspinatus tear may limit the range of motion in the shoulder. Reaching behind the back or lifting the arm above the head may be difficult.\n*   **Clicking or Popping:** Some people with a supraspinatus tear may experience clicking or popping sounds in the shoulder when moving it.\n*   **Swelling:** In some cases, a supraspinatus tear may cause swelling in the shoulder.\n*   **Tenderness:** The affected area may be tender to the touch.\n\n【8】How to Make a Diagnosis of a Supraspinatus Tear?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】A physical exam and imaging tests are usually used to diagnose a supraspinatus tear. The physical exam may involve a series of tests to assess the shoulder's range of motion and strength. Imaging tests, such as X-rays, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be used to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the tear.\n\n【10】How to Treat a Supraspinatus Tear?\n----------------------------------\n\n【11】A supraspinatus tear can be treated in the following ways:\n\n【12】**Conservative Management -** Not all supraspinatus tears require surgery. Conservative management can be effective in managing symptoms and improving shoulder function. This may include:\n\n【13】*   **Rest:** Rest is essential to allow the injured muscle to heal. Avoiding activities that cause pain or discomfort is important.\n*   **Ice:** Application of ice to the affected area helps in the reduction of pain and inflammation. Ice application for 20 minutes several times a day is enough.\n*   **Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy improves the shoulder's range of motion and strength. Specific exercises may be prescribed to target the supraspinatus muscle.\n*   **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, including Acetaminophen, can manage pain.\n\n【14】**Surgical Management -** Surgery may be necessary if conservative management fails to improve symptoms or if the tear is severe. Different surgical approaches can repair a supraspinatus tear. The approach will depend on the size, severity and location of the tear.\n\n【15】*   **Arthroscopic Surgery:** It is a minimally invasive surgical procedure. It involves making small incisions in the shoulder. Then using a camera and with the help of surgical tools, a tear can be repaired. This approach is often preferred because it results in less pain, a shorter recovery time, and a lower risk of complications.\n*   **Open Surgery:** Sometimes, open surgery is necessary. It involves giving a larger incision in the shoulder to get access to the torn muscle. Open surgery may be preferred for larger tears or if there are other shoulder injuries that need to be repaired.\n\n【16】**Rehabilitation -** After surgery, rehabilitation is essential to help regain strength and mobility in the shoulder. The rehabilitation program will be tailored according to the individual and may include:\n\n【17】*   **Physical Therapy:** Specific exercises will be prescribed to target the supraspinatus muscle and improve overall shoulder function.\n*   **Rest and Protection:** The shoulder may need to be immobilized for some time to allow the muscle to heal. A sling or brace may be used to protect the shoulder.\n*   **Gradual Return to Activities:** Activities that involve overhead movements, such as throwing a ball or lifting weights, should be avoided until the shoulder has fully healed. Gradual return to activities should be done under the guidance of a physical therapist or doctor.\n\n【18】What Are the Preventions of Supraspinatus Tears?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】There are several steps that can be taken to help prevent a supraspinatus tear from occurring in the first place:\n\n【20】*   **Warm-up Properly:** Before any physical activity, it's important to warm up properly. This can include stretching, light cardio, and some mobility exercises to prepare the muscles for movement.\n*   **Strengthen the Shoulders:** Strengthening the muscles in the shoulders, including the supraspinatus muscle, can help prevent injury. Exercises, including shoulder presses, and lateral raises, can all help build strength.\n*   **Use Proper Form:** Whether lifting weights, playing a sport, or simply carrying groceries, it's important to use proper form to avoid putting undue stress on the shoulders.\n*   **Avoid Overuse:** Overuse can be a major cause of supraspinatus tears, so it's important to avoid repetitive overhead movements whenever possible.\n*   **Maintain Good Posture:** Poor posture can put extra strain on the shoulders, so it's important to maintain good posture throughout the day, whether sitting, standing, or walking.\n*   **Take Breaks:** If a person is engaging in physical activity for an extended period, such as playing a sport or doing yard work, take breaks every so often to give the muscles a chance to rest.\n\n【21】**Conclusion:**\n\n【22】Supraspinatus tears can cause significant pain and limit shoulder function. Management of this condition may involve conservative measures, such as rest, ice, physical therapy, and pain relief. Surgery may be necessary for more severe tears. Rehabilitation is essential to help regain strength and mobility in the shoulder after surgery. With proper management, most people with supraspinatus tears can regain full shoulder function.\n\n【23】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>*   Rotator Cuff Tears  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/rotator-cuff-tears/\n*   Partial Rotator Cuff Tear  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/partial-rotator-cuff-tear\n*   Rotator Cuff Tears: Surgical Treatment Options  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/rotator-cuff-tears-surgical-treatment-options/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Decreased iron reserves in the body are one of the main causes of this type of anemia. The reduced iron content in the body may be due to poor iron intake in the diet, poor iron absorption from the intestine, prolonged blood loss, or increased demand for iron in pregnancy or after major trauma.\n\n【2】Hypochromic microcytic anemia is a medical condition where the normal transport of iron in the cells is impaired. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the substance red blood cells use to carry oxygen to all the cells and tissues of the body. In such a condition, the iron reserves are depleted in the blood. The red blood cells cannot access the iron, leading to a decrease in red blood cell synthesis (anemia).\n\n【3】In turn, the red blood cells synthesized are abnormally smaller than their usual size (microcytic) and pale in color (hypochromic). This anemia can lead to pale skin (pallor), fatigue, and retarded growth. In hypochromic microcytic anemia, red blood cells do not utilize iron. Iron is deposited in the liver, which can also gradually impair liver function over time. The liver problems become evident in early adulthood.\n\n【4】What Are the Other Synonyms of Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Microcytic anemia and hepatic iron overload.\n\n【6】*   Microcytic anemia with liver iron overload.\n\n【7】*   Hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload.\n\n【8】What is the Frequency of Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Hypochromic microcytic anemia is a rare disorder. Hypochromic microcytic anemia is more frequently present in premenopausal females because of the blood loss in each menstrual cycle. Approximately 42 % of all pregnant women suffer from anemia, while 30% of premenopausal women struggle with anemia. Men are usually resistant to developing anemia due to the circulating testosterone levels. Pre-school kids also suffer from anemia due to a lack of iron in their primary diet.\n\n【10】What Is the Etiology of Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Hypochromic microcytic anemia most commonly occurs due to reduced iron reserves in the body. The reduced iron content in the body may be due to multiple reasons, such as poor iron intake in the diet, decreased iron absorption from the gut, acute blood loss, or increased iron demand in pregnancy, major surgery, or after major trauma.\n\n【12】Genetic factors are also found to play a role in etiology. Mutations in the SLC11A2 gene are found to cause hypochromic microcytic anemia. This gene is responsible for providing instructions to synthesize a protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), whose primary role is transporting the iron atoms (ions) within cells.\n\n【13】Genetic mutations in the gene SLC11A2 lead to decreased synthesis of the DMT1 protein, thereby diminishing the amount of iron transported within the cells. As a result, healthy red blood cell development is impaired. The absorbed iron, which is not utilized by the red blood cells, accumulates in the liver, thereby causing liver function impairment.\n\n【14】It is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the individual carries two mutated copies of the gene in each cell from both parents.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Hypochromic microcytic anemia symptoms may include:\n\n【17】*   Increased loss of blood in the menstrual cycle.\n\n【18】*   Tiredness.\n\n【19】*   Weakness.\n\n【20】*   Spinning head.\n\n【21】*   Skin pallor.\n\n【22】*   Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat).\n\n【23】*   Increased respiratory rate.\n\n【24】*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\n【25】*   Spoon-shaped nails.\n\n【26】*   Conjunctivitis.\n\n【27】*   Glossitis (inflamed and swollen tongue).\n\n【28】How to Diagnose Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Healthcare professionals may advise the following blood tests to diagnose hypochromic microcytic anemia:\n\n【30】*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** CBC will help to provide information about the hemoglobin levels and various aspects of the blood cells.\n\n【31】*   **Iron Levels in Blood:** TIBC (total iron binding capacity) and ferritin levels are usually assessed in the blood. TIBC usually increases in iron deficiency anemia, while transferrin saturation is considerably reduced in iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin levels below 12 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) indicate iron deficiency anemia. As there is a fall in iron levels, there is a compensatory rise in transferrin levels.\n\n【32】*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:** This test examines blood cells under a microscope. Red blood cells will be small-sized with pencil cells. In the microcytic cells, there will be a large zone of central pallor in the microcytic cells with a thin rim of hemoglobin at the periphery.\n\n【33】What Is the Treatment of Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Iron replacement therapy is considered the initial treatment. Three hundred twenty-five milligrams of ferrous sulfate is given orally thrice a day. However, nausea and constipation are common side effects related to this therapy. Gradually the treatment dose is increased while the patient is monitored for side effects to increase compliance. The effect of this treatment is usually observed after three weeks.\n\n【35】The iron preparation with sorbitol is gradually infused over a period of five minutes. The parenteral dose calculated is the iron deficit plus one extra gram of iron to replenish the body's iron reserves. Close follow-up is necessary to keep a check on the patient’s blood indices.\n\n【36】Is Hypochromic Microcytic Anemia a Serious Condition?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】In hypochromic microcytic anemia, when there is increased iron overload, it can lead to pallor skin, fatigue, and retarded growth. In this type of anemia with heavy iron overload, the iron that is not being utilized by the red blood cells accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation in the liver can impair its function over a period of time.\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】Hypochromic microcytic anemia is marked by the presence of smaller than normal (microcytic) red blood cells with diminished red color. An interprofessional team consisting of a primary health care professional, a gynecologist, a blood specialist, a general surgeon, and a gastroenterologist must identify and manage the condition effectively. It is very important to identify the cause of anemia. The patient should be advised to eat healthy and nutritious food and keep himself hydrated. Iron replacement therapy is the mainstay treatment to cure the condition. Regular follow-up is required by the patient to check the hematocrit levels by the doctor.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   National library of medicine - Microcytic Hypochromic Anemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470252/\n*   Medicineplus - Hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/hypochromic-microcytic-anemia-with-iron-overload/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It includes abnormalities in the blood vessels. It is known to affect the internal organs like the digestive system and the respiratory system. Most of the clinical signs of this condition are seen in the skin. Many blisters that are filled with fluid will be visible on the skin. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation sometimes. It was explained by William Bean in 1958 for the first time. It is also known as Bean syndrome. This condition is mostly a venous malformation. In some patients, it is related to hemangioma. The term nevus refers to a non-cancerous mole on the skin. They do not cause any harm, and it does not require any particular treatment.\n\n【2】Where Does It Occur?\n--------------------\n\n【3】As it is mostly a skin disorder, the presentations of this disease are seen on the skin. Some lesions are seen in the intestine. Other sites where the lesion could be found are:\n\n【4】*   Large intestine.

It affects both male and female gender equally.\n\n【8】What Are the Causes of Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The exact cause of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is not known. Genetic causes have been identified in many patients. Severe chromosomal abnormalities can result in blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. It is a syndrome that is sporadic in type. It is known to recur at regular intervals.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The symptoms might vary from one person to another. Some patients show only skin lesions. Some patients are known to report gastrointestinal symptoms. The extreme complication of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients who are diagnosed with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome are known to suffer from intensive bleeding in complicated conditions. This has resulted in death in some patients.\n\n【12】How Is Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The disease is very rare, and there are poor sources for doctors and research scientists to work on the information on this condition. So, this syndrome becomes highly unpredictable. Except the complications, the syndrome is generally not very harmful. The initial stage of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome would be the clinical diagnosis of the skin lesions and lesions on the other organs. Angiomas present in the scalp and sole of the feet is known to be a suspecting factor.\n\n【14】On clinical examination, the physician might indicate that the lesion is soft, rubbery, and tender on palpation. The characteristic feature of this lesion is that it is usually compressible, hemorrhagic, and is known to refill after compression.\n\n【15】The lesions in the gastrointestinal tract can be primarily identified by endoscopy. The gastrointestinal tract can be visualized by illumination in the tract.\n\n【16】The internal organs can be diagnosed using other methods. They are:\n\n【17】**Ultrasound:** It is a technique that uses ultrasound waves for imaging and visualization purposes. This imaging technique is also called sonography. The ultrasound diagnostic technique uses an instrument called a sonogram. It serves as a good aid for diagnosing the internal structures. Some radiologists recommend you to come after fasting for 10 to 12 hours so that the undigested food particles do not block the sound waves.\n\n【18】**Computed Tomography:** It is an essential diagnostic method of visualizing the soft tissues, blood vessels, and cutaneous regions. It is highly technique sensitive. The patient will be asked to lie down in a medical laboratory setup. Huge tunnel-like instruments will be made to rotate at various angles. Cross-sectional images of the particular organs can be obtained. Recent advances have helped in obtaining three-dimensional images of the required organ in different angulations.\n\n【19】**Magnetic Resonance Imaging:** It is a popular imaging technique that uses high magnetic field waves to generate images of the organs.\n\n【20】What Are the Treatment Options for Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The treatment should be recommended according to the severity of the blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. The lesions that are present in the gastrointestinal tract does not need to be removed until your doctor strongly recommends it.\n\n【22】**The common treatment options are:**\n\n【23】**Surgical Removal:** This would be the most preferred option for most surgeons, especially if the lesion is very disturbing to the patient. This would require highly skilled doctors to perform surgery. It does not require hospitalization for more than two days. It is necessary to get an opinion from your doctor before discharge. Surgical options are safe for removal of the lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【24】**Laser:** It is the best non-invasive procedure. This treatment option will have less pain for the patient. Laser therapy uses light amplification devices in its therapeutic procedures. The only disadvantage of this treatment option is that some patients report a recurrence of the lesion even after the treatment. It is also not economical for all cases.\n\n【25】**Electrodesiccation:** In this procedure, high-frequency waves are applied with the help of the electrodes. It also uses curettage. The surgical method of electrodesiccation removes the nevus cells by a scraping mechanism.\n\n【26】**Cryotherapy:** Cryotherapy is recommended for patients who are experiencing pain. This treatment is best for curing localized lesions. This treatment method is also known as cold therapy.\n\n【27】**Sclerotherapy:** Sclerotherapy is a process of injecting the medications directly into the lymph vessels and blood vessels. The medication is known to cause shrinkage of the vessels. It is the best option for vascular malformations. It is a safe and effective treatment method for children.\n\n【28】Supplementation of iron would be one of the conservative management options.\n\n【29】If you are facing similar problems, feel free to get help from iCliniq.com\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   Injection Sclerotherapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036277/\n*   Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1356993/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In earlier days, going out in the sun in tanning beds was an option to get tanned skin. But nowadays, it is not considered the best option for tanning as it has various health hazards like skin cancer, sunburn, skin damage, etc. The best option to get tanned skin is sunless tanning, in which skin is tanned without exposure to the sun. It is done by using cosmetic products which are applied to the skin to make the skin look darker in complexion.\n\n【2】What Is Sunless Tanning?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Sunless tanning is a procedure in which the complexion of the skin is darkened by the use of skin creams, lotions, sprays, etc. In this procedure, the skin is tanned without going out in the sun, so it is called sunless tanning. Limited exposure to the sun is healthy for the skin as it stimulates the synthesis of Vitamin D, but prolonged exposure may damage the skin and cause skin diseases like skin cancer and sunburn. So, for those people who want a darker skin tone but want to protect themselves from the harmful (ultraviolet) UV lights, it is considered a safe procedure as it eliminates the need for prolonged exposure to the sun which is unhealthy for the skin.\n\n【4】What Is the Active Ingredient in Sunless Tanning Products?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) is considered a safe active ingredient to use in cosmetic products used for sunless tanning. DHA is a color additive that reacts with the amino acid present on the surface of the skin (dead cells of the skin) to make it appear darker. The results produced by DHA usually last for five to seven days as it works on the dead cells of the skin, which are shed continuously.\n\n【6】DHA is considered safe as it does not cause any toxicity. Moreover, It is not absorbed into the body through the skin. It was discovered in Germany when it gave brown color to the skin upon spilling. It has been approved by FDA and used as a sunless tanning agent since 1973.\n\n【7】According to FDA, sunless tanning products which contain DHA as the active ingredient should be used on external surfaces and should not be used on internal surfaces like:\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Sunless Tannning - An Overview</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Early-Stage Scalp Cancer - Causes, Types, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>I have a small bubbly rash on my back, which is itchy. Could it be shingles?</u>\n\n【13】*   Lips.\n\n【14】*   Eyes.\n\n【15】*   Body parts that are covered with mucous membranes.\n\n【16】In addition, these sunless cosmetic products should be prevented from inhalation and ingestion. It can be done by two methods,\n\n【17】*   Airbrush tanning.\n\n【18】*   Sunless spray tanning.\n\n【19】What Is the Difference Between Sunless Spray Tanning and Airbrush Tanning?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The major difference between sunless spray tanning and airbrush tanning is the method of application of the tanning solution and the procedure. Both the methods are described as follows:\n\n【21】What Is Sunless Tanning Spray?\n------------------------------\n\n【22】It is also called self-tanning, and in this procedure, a fine mist is sprayed on the surface of the body to make it look “tanned.” It is available in beauty salons and spas, where it is applied in a booth that has nozzles from which tanning solution (containing DHA) is sprayed all over the body. These fine nozzles are situated at the corners of the booth. Before starting the procedure, a shower cap, protective eyewear, lip balm, and nose filters are provided to protect the eyes and prevent the inhalation of tanning solution spray.\n\n【23】In the booth, when the person enters, instructions are given, and accordingly, the person has to move to different angles to get the solution applied all over the body through nozzles. After the session, the person is instructed not to take a bath for four to six hours.\n\n【24】What Is Airbrush Tanning?\n-------------------------\n\n【25】In this procedure, the tanning solution is applied to the body with the help of an airbrush and compressor. The technician evaluates the suitable skin tone and accordingly applies the tanning solution containing DHA as an active ingredient using an airbrush all over the body. After this procedure, the skin gets tanned. The results of this procedure stay for up to five to ten days.\n\n【26】Both types of sunless tanning do not protect the skin from harmful UV lights as it does not contain sunscreen. So, it is necessary to apply sunscreen before going into the sun to protect the skin from the hazards of UV lights and keep the skin healthy.\n\n【27】What Are Bronzers for Sunless Tanning?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【28】Bronzers are used in the form of gels, lotions, moisturizers, sprays, etc. for sunless tanning. But these are less effective than airbrush and spray tanning and are temporary. Their effect can be easily washed away with soap and water. The advantage of bronzers over spray tanning and airbrushing tanning is the reduced cost. They are cheaper than both procedures. In addition, this can be done easily at home without going out to a salon or hiring a professional. However, The results are better with spray tanning and airbrush tanning. So, for special occasions, professional sunless tanning procedures like spray tanning and airbrush tanning are better.\n\n【29】All these products usually do not protect the skin from harmful UV light, as most of these products do not contain sunscreen. So, it is necessary to apply sunscreen before going out in the sun for healthy skin after sunless tanning procedures.\n\n【30】What Are the Other Products for Sunless Tanning?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   **Tyrosine**: These act as tanning accelerators and are available in the form of pills and lotion. It has an amino acid called tyrosine which can increase melanogenesis and can tan the body. However, there is no such data supporting this method of tanning. So, it is not reliable.\n\n【32】*   **Canthaxanthin:** These come in the form of pills called tanning pills. It is not FDA approved to use as a tanning agent as it is used as a food color agent. It works by depositing all over the body and giving an orange-brown color to the skin. These kinds of pills have several side effects, like hepatitis, retinopathy, and damage to the skin and digestive system. So, this is also not recommended for sunless tanning.\n\n【33】*   **Beta-carotene**: These also come in the form of pills. These pills contain beta carotene, which is a food coloring agent and has not gotten approval as a sunless tanning agent. So, it is also harmful to use and poses a risk to health.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Sunless tanning is the best way to get the skin tanned without taking a sunbath. Harmful UV lights tan the skin, but it damages the skin too. So, to get healthy tanned skin, sunless tanning procedures are preferred. The best sunless tanning products, including lotions, creams, and sprays, are those which contain DHA as the active ingredient as it is FDA approved and completely safe for the skin. Pills should be avoided for sunless tanning as these have harmful effects and are not safe to use.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   U.S. Food & Drug Administration- Sunless Tanners & Bronzers  \n    https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/sunless-tanners-bronzers\n*   AAD- How to apply self-tanner.  \n    https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/apply-self-tanner\n*   Skin Cancer Foundation- Fake it to Make it: Sunless Tanning Explained  \n    https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sunless-tanning-explained/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

But, not all fractures fall under a floating knee. The fractures involving both the bones (the femur and tibia) fall under the term floating knee, also known as the flail knee. These fractures are usually complex and have multiple causes which make it appear to be a partial joint or the knee joint appears to be floating. The overall occurrence of the floating knee is uncommon or rare. Although this type of fracture is seen in people performing high-intensity workouts, arduous exercises, or a very active lifestyle, in the case of gender, it has a higher male predilection.\n\n【2】What Are the Classifications of Floating Knee?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Several classifications have been given to describe this condition, which are given below:\n\n【4】**Blake and McBryde Classification:**\n\n【5】This classification was given based on the site of injury. By this classification, a floating knee can be broadly classified as a type 1 or type 2 fracture.\n\n【6】*   **Type 1 Fracture:** This type of fracture is coined as an original fracture that involves both the bone, namely the tibia, and the femur. Type 1 fracture is the fracture of both shafts.\n\n【7】*   **Type 2 Fracture:** This type of fracture is also called a false fracture as it directly does not involve the bony cortex. This is further classified as Type A and B.\n\n【8】Type A affects the knee joint.\n\n【9】Type B affects the hip or ankle joint.\n\n【10】**Classification by Letts and Vincent:**\n\n【11】This is a classification given in the system of child medication where it is divided into five categories alphabetically. This includes the following:\n\n【12】*   **Type A -** It is the fracture of two closed primary ossification sites or shaft regions.\n\n【13】*   **Type B -** It is a closed fracture of the neck of the bone (diaphyseal end) and shaft of the bone.\n\n【14】*   **Type C -** It is two closed fractures between the round end portion of the bone (epiphyseal end) and the neck of the bone (diaphysis end).\n\n【15】*   **Type D -** It involves one closed fracture and one open fracture.\n\n【16】*   **Type E -** Here, both fractures are open fractures.\n\n【17】**Classification by Bohn- Durbin:**\n\n【18】*   **Type 1 -** Type 1 fractures are fractures involving the shafts of both the long bones, femur, and tibia.\n\n【19】*   **Type 2 -** The fractures involve only the juxta-articular region of the femur and tibia.\n\n【20】*   **Type 3 -** The fracture involves the epiphyseal component.\n\n【21】**Classification by Fraser et al**\n\n【22】This classification was given based on knee involvement, where it is broadly classified into types 1 and 2 and then it is further sub-classified into three subtypes.\n\n【23】*   **Type 1 -** Fractures of both bones without involving the knee.\n\n【24】*   **Type 2 -** Fractures involving the knee. Subtype A involves the tibial plateau, subtype B involves the distal femur, and subtype C involves both the tibial plateau and distal femur within the knee joint.\n\n【25】What Are the Causes of a Floating Knee?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【26】Floating knee or the ipsilateral fracture of the tibia and femur is a complex type of fracture that is often involved with higher energy activities, including,\n\n【27】*   Road traffic accidents.\n\n【28】*   Falling from extreme heights.\n\n【29】*   Accidents during walking.\n\n【30】*   Accident with cyclists.\n\n【31】*   Local trauma to the knee.\n\n【32】*   High-impact injuries with a firm dull surface.\n\n【33】*   Automobile accidents.\n\n【34】*   Athletes.\n\n【35】What Are the Symptoms of a Floating Knee?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【36】*   Patients with the floating knee have multifold injuries involving both the hard and soft tissue and should not be ignored.\n\n【37】*   Patients are usually noticed with increased sensitivity to touch at the site of injury in both the tibial and femoral regions showing a complete changeover in the affected area and also appearing to be shorter than usual.\n\n【38】*   Severe soft tissue and vascular injuries and lacerations are seen in this fracture involving a meniscal tear where patients become hemodynamically compromised.\n\n【39】*   Patients are presented with severe unbearable pain, swelling, sensitivity, inability to stand or bear weight, and knee instability.\n\n【40】*   Delayed complications include infection, increased blood loss, fat embolism, and delayed healing.\n\n【41】How Is a Floating Knee Managed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【42】The management of this fracture takes various treatment modalities, which can be broadly classified into three main steps:\n\n【43】*   **Emergency Bone Fixation:** This is reducing the fracture and repositioning it, preventing it from further damage.\n\n【44】*   **Management of Compartment Syndrome:** This is a medical condition that occurs due to increased pressure due to excess pooling of blood in a particular region, limiting the blood flow to other places and causing self-strangulation. Hence this is an emergency condition and has to be prevented to maintain proper blood flow to the legs and other regions.\n\n【45】*   **Management of Life-Threatening Injuries:** Other management includes fixing lacerations of the vascular and soft tissue injury.\n\n【46】*   The other essential medical management of this fracture is restoring the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) and surgical management includes a combination of treatment modalities with plating, nailing, placement of a combination of implants, wiring, and casting.\n\n【47】*   Over 50 percent of the patients show good to excellent prognoses with proper care and management.\n\n【48】*   Patients with surgical management also show shorter hospitalization times than those with conservative management.\n\n【49】How Is the Floating Knee Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【50】The methods of diagnosis aiding in the management of floating knee fractures include:\n\n【51】*   Doppler.\n\n【52】*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\n【53】*   X-rays.\n\n【54】*   Computed Tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【55】Doppler and MRI are used to assess soft tissue injuries and to help establish proper blood flow preventing compartment syndrome, fat embolisms, and neurological sensations. CT scans and X-rays aid in determining fractures, the current condition of the patient, and in predicting prognosis.\n\n【56】What Are the Complications of a Floating Knee?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【57】Most of the time, the post-operative complications are lesser. In some cases, the post-operative complications can be life-altering, and they can be:\n\n【58】*   Leg length discrepancy.\n\n【59】*   Infections leading to knee stiffness.\n\n【60】*   Leg amputation.\n\n【61】But complications also seem to be decreased and less complicated when seen involving fractures to the diaphyseal end of the femur or tibia.\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】Although a floating knee or ipsilateral fracture of the tibia and femur is said to be uncommon and complicated, it is still treatable. It has a prognosis rate of more than 50 percent globally. With timely diagnosis and well-executed treatment modalities with medical and surgical management, the complications are limited, and excellent outcomes are seen, restoring the patient to a comfortable lifestyle.\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   Floating Knee  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537096/\n*   The floating knee: a review on ipsilateral femoral and tibial fractures  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367526/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The endocrine system secrets hormones and releases them into the blood. These hormones help in many important functions like growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Growth and development among children are based on the proper functioning of the endocrine system. An imbalance in hormones may affect growth and development and may cause disorders that are life-threatening or may need surgery.\n\n【2】What Are Endocrine Disorders in Children?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The endocrine system controls the hormones that regulate many bodily functions such as temperature, mood, growth, etc. Problems related to growth, puberty, and sexual development have their roots in endocrine systems. Common endocrine disorders among children are related to the pancreas, pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal glands. These problems may be due to an imbalance of hormones or the presence of tumors.\n\n【4】Endocrine Disorders Include:\n\n【5】*   Diabetes (type 1 or type 2).\n\n【6】*   Thyroid disorders (Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism).\n\n【7】*   Short stature due to growth hormone deficiency.\n\n【8】*   Turner syndrome.\n\n【9】*   Tumors.\n\n【10】*   Adrenal glands disorder.\n\n【11】*   Adrenoleukodystrophy.\n\n【12】*   Bone and mineral disorder.\n\n【13】*   Childhood obesity.\n\n【14】*   Lipid disorders.\n\n【15】*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and type 2 ( MEN 2).\n\n【16】*   Pituitary disorders.\n\n【17】*   Puberty disorders.\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Endocrine Disorders in Children?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Children show the following symptoms and they vary:\n\n【20】*   Fatigue.\n\n【21】*   Weakness.\n\n【22】*   Headache.\n\n【23】*   Irritability.\n\n【24】*   Weight loss/gain without knowing.\n\n【25】*   Failure to attain growth milestones.\n\n【26】What Are the Causes of Endocrines Disorders in Children?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Sometimes causes of endocrine disorders are unknown. Risk factors like genetics and obesity may increase a child’s chance of getting affected by endocrine disorders. The causes of endocrine disorders in children depend on the different conditions.\n\n【28】*   **Tumors**: Tumors (noncancerous) of the adrenal and pituitary glands are the cause of acromegaly and Cushing’s syndrome (a syndrome caused due to excess cortisol hormone).\n\n【29】*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Some conditions like hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are due to an increase or decrease in thyroid hormones. High androgen levels in females lead to polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\n【30】*   **Autoimmune Condition**: Some autoimmune conditions like diabetes type 1, and Grave’s disease are seen in hyperthyroidism.\n\n【31】Which Are the Endocrine Disorders in Children?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The following disorders are related to children:\n\n【33】*   **Growth Disorders**: Children may show abnormal growth in height or size for their age and sex. Other reasons include; imbalances in growth hormone, thyroid, and Cushing’s disease. Genetics play a role in height of a child but endocrine disorders may affect a child’s growth. If a child is having a growth hormone deficiency, the child's growth is affected and they show short stature.\n\n【34】*   **Pubertal Disorders:** Puberty occurs due to changes in hormone levels. An imbalance of hormones may lead to early or delayed puberty. If puberty starts before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys, it is called precocious puberty. In delayed puberty, due to a deficiency of hormones, signs of puberty may not be seen even at the age of 13 in girls and 14 in boys.\n\n【35】*   **Turner Syndrome:** A rare genetic disease occurring only in girls. Girls showing this syndrome present short height and cardiac problems. As the symptoms are mild, girls will be in their teens when get diagnosed. They may also present with learning disabilities, lack of menstrual cycles, delayed puberty, and show infertility on growing up.\n\n【36】*   **Calcium Disorders:** Calcium is an important mineral required by the human body. Hypercalcemia (increased levels of calcium) affects digestion, and the functioning of the heart, brain, kidneys (causing stones in the kidney), and bone (weaken bones). Hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels) causes jitteriness, muscle twitches, and seizures. The child may not eat properly.\n\n【37】*   **Lipid Disorders:** Hormones control pathways for fats and proteins and help in metabolism.\n\n【38】*   **Pituitary Disorders:** These include acromegaly and Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, etc.\n\n【39】*   **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) and Type 2 ( MEN 2):** In this type of disorder, tumors develop in hormone-secreting cells.\n\n【40】*   **Childhood Obesity:** A serious medical condition resulting because of extra weight.\n\n【41】*   **Thyroid Disorders:** Most common endocrine disorder in children. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are the two types. In hyperthyroidism, the child is presented with weight loss and feels nervous and sweaty. In the case of hypothyroidism, the child presents with fatigue, constipation, dry skin, and depression.\n\n【42】How Are Endocrinal Disorders Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【43】Some of the endocrine diagnostic tests include;\n\n【44】*   **Annual Wellness Check-Ups:** It is recommended if a child’s growth lags behind and not matching with a growth chart, which can be a symptom of a problem.\n*   **Bone Age Assessment:** It is done to know the maturity of a child’s skeletal system using an X-ray.\n\n【45】*   **Stimulation and Suppression Test:** It is used to know the relationship between the adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary to know the primary cause of abnormal adrenocortical secretion.\n\n【46】*   **Blood Test:** It helps to know the levels of hormones.\n\n【47】*   **Nutritional Assessment:** It includes a history of diet intake, physical examination, anthropometrics (weight, height, stature, head circumference, triceps skinfold thickness), pubertal staging, skeletal maturity staging\n\n【48】*   **Imaging Tests:** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound is done in case of endocrine-related tumors to know where is it situated and to what extent it has spread.\n\n【49】*   **Biopsy:** Once the tumor is identified then small tissue is taken out to check under a microscope.\n\n【50】*   **Diabetic Tests:** Blood tests are done to know random blood sugar, fasting, and average A1C blood levels. Autoantibodies are checked which are found in type 1.\n\n【51】*   **Dysmetabolic Endocrine Tests:** Cluster of disorders which include blood pressure, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hypertension, fatty blood, and impaired fibrinolysis leading to blood clots. Tests for these are outside the endocrine. Blood tests are used to know lipid levels in children.\n\n【52】*   **Lipid Tests:** Blood tests are used for checking lipid levels.\n\n【53】*   **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Tests:** A blood test to check for hormone levels especially androgen ( a male sex hormone) which is a hallmark of the disease. Ultrasound and other scans to check if any cysts are present in the ovaries.\n\n【54】How Do You Treat Endocrine Disorders in Children?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Treatments of endocrine disorders in children depend on the specific endocrine disorder.\n\n【56】*   Hormonal therapy is the first line of defense for treating children with endocrine disorders.\n\n【57】*   Depending on the cause and based on the child’s overall health, medicine, and lifestyle changes (exercise and diet) may be recommended.\n\n【58】*   In PCOS, based on the condition of the child, a course of treatment that includes medications and surgery is recommended to remove cysts.\n\n【59】*   In the case of tumors, treatment options can be planned for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**:\n\n【61】Endocrine disorders are a complex web of diseases. They are challenging to identify because of the range of symptoms they show and the similarities present with other conditions. Especially in children identifying and treating is a big challenge to parents as well as doctors. Knowing about the conditions in detail helps one to seek help from a doctor at the earliest.

They act as a means of intracellular communication between all of the body's cells. They control everything, including digestion, growth, appetite, immune system, mood, and libido. Therefore, even a small hormone imbalance can have a significant impact on health and well-being.\n\n【2】People frequently use hormone replacement therapies to treat symptoms when their hormone levels drop or become out of balance. Certain forms of gender-affirming care also employ hormone replacement therapy. In recent years, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) has attracted a lot of interest. It promises a \"natural\" hormone therapy method.\n\n【3】What Are Bioidentical Hormones?\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】Bioidentical hormones are processed hormones that are intended to resemble the hormones produced by the glands in the body. People who experience low or unbalanced hormone symptoms may find relief by taking bioidentical hormones. People who are going through the menopausal or perimenopausal stages frequently experience this.\n\n【5】The endocrine glands produce chemicals called hormones. They act as messengers, informing other body parts when and how to function. Numerous bodily systems and processes are impacted by hormones. The slightest imbalance can result in symptoms that disrupt the day. As a remedy for these symptoms, doctors may advise hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【6】Hormones from plants that have been processed are used in bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT). The three bioidentical hormones that are most frequently used are testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen. Pharmaceutical companies premake some bioidentical hormone prescription dosage forms. Some kinds of bioidentical hormones have received FDA approval in the United States. A pharmacist will create other kinds of bioidentical hormones according to a doctor's prescription. These hormones are bioidentical compounds (or mixtures).\n\n【7】The FDA has not evaluated and approved the compounded forms. Although it is frequently stated that products made from plants are natural options, once they have undergone processing, they have undergone laboratory alteration and are no longer natural.\n\n【8】Here are some examples of bioidentical hormones:\n\n【9】*   17 beta-estradiols, including medications like Estrace, Estradil, and Estring.\n\n【10】*   Estradiol acetate, including Femring.\n\n【11】*   Estradiol hemihydrate, including Vagifem.\n\n【12】*   Prometrium and Prochieve are two examples of micronized progesterone USP (unique selling proposition).\n\n【13】What Are the Uses of Bioidentical Hormones?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The body produces fewer hormones as one ages. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are some of these hormones. Low hormones frequently have the following effects:\n\n【15】*   Hot flashes.\n\n【16】*   Night sweats.\n\n【17】*   Vaginal dryness.\n\n【18】*   Loss of interest in sex or pain during intercourse.\n\n【19】*   Sleep difficulties.\n\n【20】*   Energy loss or fatigue.\n\n【21】*   Weight gain.\n\n【22】*   Mood swings.\n\n【23】*   Confusion or a loss of memory.\n\n【24】Bioidentical or traditional hormone therapy aims to replace these lost or low hormone levels. Most people experience an improvement in their symptoms once hormone levels are raised. Depending on the specific symptoms they are intended to treat, bioidentical hormones come in various forms. A person who is being treated for hormone replacement will frequently have their saliva or blood sample checked for their hormone levels.\n\n【25】Hormone replacement therapy may also lessen the risk of diabetes, tooth loss, and cataracts, in addition to helping with symptoms. According to anecdotal evidence, some people think it can help with wrinkle reduction and even skin thickness, hydration, and elasticity. However, there is little proof that bioidentical hormones are as effective as traditional hormone therapy. Based on the symptoms and medical history, the healthcare provider can help decide the hormone replacement options.\n\n【26】Who Requires Bioidentical Hormones?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【27】Most perimenopausal women may search for treatment options over the safety of bioidentical hormones. However, not all women respond favorably to conventional therapies. Women may think about bioidentical hormones as potential alternatives in these situations. Before beginning bioidentical hormone therapy, women who have tried other medications might want to consider changing their lifestyles. Some additional steps to take could be:\n\n【28】*   Taking vitamin supplements.\n\n【29】*   Eating a healthier diet.\n\n【30】*   Increasing exercise.\n\n【31】*   Trying to reduce anxiety and stress.\n\n【32】How Safe Are Bioidentical Hormones?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】The FDA-approved bioidentical hormones have undergone safety testing. They have met the exacting requirements of the FDA and are secure for use by people. There are risks with this hormone therapy, just like with any other. Even the FDA-approved bioidentical hormones should be discussed with the healthcare provider to determine their benefits and drawbacks.\n\n【34】The drug company is required to disclose any side effects they learn about when the FDA approves a drug. The paperwork when picking up the prescription at the pharmacy includes a list of these side effects. Hormone compounding pharmacies are exempt from filing paperwork with the FDA or reporting adverse drug reactions. The fact that healthcare professionals are unaware of all the potential side effects of these hormones contributes to the misconception that compounded hormones are safer.\n\n【35】There may be side effects, particularly after the first dose. The body is not accustomed to the new hormone level. As the body gets adjusted to the new hormone level, many side effects improve. The dose may need to be adjusted in some circumstances. The following are some common side effects of bioidentical hormones:\n\n【36】*   Weight gain.\n\n【37】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【38】*   Headaches.\n\n【39】*   Breast tenderness.\n\n【40】*   Tiredness.\n\n【41】*   Acne.\n\n【42】*   Increased facial hair.\n\n【43】*   Spotting.\n\n【44】*   Cramping.\n\n【45】*   Bloating.\n\n【46】*   Mood swings.\n\n【47】Research studies have demonstrated that taking hormones carries risks. It can increase the chance of gallbladder disease, stroke, and blood clots. If one uses hormonal therapy for an extended period of time or is older, the risk of heart disease and breast cancer may also rise. Bioidentical hormones are allegedly safer than conventional hormone therapy, according to many medical professionals who use them. However, there are no sizable research studies on bioidentical hormones to support this.\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】Some people with symptoms linked to low or otherwise unbalanced hormone levels may benefit from bioidentical hormones. However, not all bioidentical hormones have FDA approval. Hormone replacement therapies, in general, including BHRT, have risks and side effects in addition to potential benefits. It is crucial to talk about these with the doctor. Additionally, certain medical conditions can make one more susceptible to severe side effects from hormone replacement therapy. A doctor must be consulted about the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement. Most importantly, we must understand that one does not have to put up with the uncomfortable side effects of low hormones, as it can be safely managed.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bioidentical Hormone Therapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3127562/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

China reported that this was a new virus affecting mammals mainly. It was then identified to be the family of coronavirus that affects the respiratory system of the human body. It was later named the SARS-CoV-2. There are four different coronavirus categories: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Among them, only alpha and beta are found to infect humans. The previous coronavirus outbreak was known as a severe acute respiratory syndrome, the SARS, and the other one was MERS, the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which originated from Saudi Arabia.\n\n【2】Animals And Origin Of COVID 19:\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】The coronavirus outbreak was initially thought to be transmitted from an animal market at Wuhan from the meat of bats. It was linked with the previous outbreak of SARS and MERS, but still, the researchers are not able to find out a perfect solution.\n\n【4】Current State Of The CoronaVirus:\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】Since last December, the virus has crossed Wuhan almost all over the world. The WHO has declared it a pandemic. Due to a lack of initial awareness of the disease, and an easy transmission route, the virus tends to travel the world mainly due to the people who traveled around the world. The travelers act as the carrier of the virus. After that, it was found to affect the countries due to the incoming passengers from other countries. Almost all the leading countries went into lockdown, and many countries are still in lockdown as a completely enhanced community quarantine. Despite all the effective measures taken by the government and health practitioners, the curve of coronavirus infection is again peaking. Day by day, all the countries are experiencing more loss of lives. Currently, COVID-19 has infected about 80 lakhs people. The mortality rate is crossing more than four and a half lakhs people.\n\n【6】Incubation Period:\n------------------\n\n【7】The incubation period is the time taken for the disease to express its symptoms. The incubation period of COVID-19 is approximately 14 days since the day of infection. The first 14 days are said to be the pre-symptomatic contagious period. In the second 14 days, patients are seen to express more severe symptoms. Once the virus has entered the body through the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal route, it starts to express its symptoms only by the fifth or sixth day. But, it has the capacity to spread the disease by day one itself. This is one of the notable points. This is the reason why isolating and treating coronavirus patients is difficult.\n\n【8】What Is the Incubation Period for Each COVID Variant?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】According to a study published in 2022, the COVID-19 incubation period progressively decreased from the Alpha variant to the Omicron variant with the evolution of mutant strains. According to the findings of the research, the incubation period of COVID-19 caused by the Alpha variant was 5.00 days (95 % confidence interval \\[CI\\], 4.94 to 5.06 days), and the incubation period of COVID-19 caused by the Beta variant was 4.50 days (95 % CI, 1.83 to 7.17 days), both of which were comparable to the incubation period of the wild-type strain in Wuhan, China. (5.2 days).\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Early Detection and Prevention of Black Fungus (Mucormycosis)</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Furthermore, the study found that the incubation period of COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant was 4.41 days (95 % CI, 3.7 to 5.05), which was shorter than the average incubation period of COVID-19 (6.26 days) and also shorter than the incubation periods caused by the Alpha variant and the Beta variant.</u>\n\n【15】The result of that study showed that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 had an incubation period of 3.42 days (95% CI 2.88 to 3.96 days), which was shorter than the incubation periods of the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants.\n\n【16】In addition, Infected children had a shorter mean incubation period (8.82 days; 95 % CI, 8.19 to 9.45) than the general population (6.65 days).\n\n【17】How Does the Transmission of Disease Occur?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【18】There is still research going on to explain the exact spread from human to human transmission. It is found to affect the elderly and immunocompromised people very easily. The spread from animals to humans is still being traced. Since the virus mainly affects the respiratory system, the transmission was established to be from the nasopharyngeal secretions of the body. It could mainly include mucus and saliva. This type of infection is known as the droplet type of infection. The droplets are easily spread by spitting saliva or mucus, sneezing, and usage of things owned by infected people. It can also be transmitted due to poor social distancing. Later, after an increase in the number of cases, it was also proven that many affected individuals were asymptomatic. When they were incidentally checked, some people turned out to be positive. Thus, those individuals were termed as asymptomatic carriers of the disease.\n\n【19】What Are The Symptoms Of The Disease After Transmission?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The symptoms of the disease might range from being asymptomatic to a highly severe version of the disease. During the initial period of the disease, patients are known to stay asymptomatic, and later they might develop mild flu-like symptoms that include common cold, fever, headache, fatigue, and sore throat. Later, they may develop difficulty in breathing to a feeling of complete breathlessness. The degree of breathlessness can be mild to severe. Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting do not frequently occur in these patients. The nervous system might be affected in some patients. They might have symptoms of a stroke. It is one of the rare cases of COVID-19.\n\n【21】Droplet Infection:\n------------------\n\n【22】There is a greater risk of transmission to the people who live close to the affected individuals. The droplets can be easily spread through the air to nearby places. The virus is also viable for at least 72 hours on contact surfaces of affected individuals. The respiratory mucus particles are highly virus-laden and competent enough to spread the disease. Larger droplets of infected particles stay in the air only for a less amount of time. The smaller particles are known to float in the air for a longer period of time. Significantly, coronavirus is known to live in aerosols and droplets for approximately 3 hours.\n\n【23】What Are The Transmission Stages?\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】The virus is prone to spread at a distance of at least six feet through the droplets dismissed in the air. When the person’s hand is contaminated by virus particles and if they touch their mouth or nose with the infected hand, the virus gets into the oropharynx or nasopharynx. It then starts to move slowly towards the respiratory system through the trachea and bronchus. COVID-19 is found to be a lower respiratory tract infection. So, from the bronchus, the virus moves to the lower respiratory tract towards the alveolus. Some studies have been established that coronavirus affects the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors present there. It then enters the cells through the receptor and disintegrates its viral particles inside the cell.\n\n【25】What Are the Precautionary Measures?\n------------------------------------\n\n【26】Precautionary measures include practicing proper hygiene measures such as:\n\n【27】1.  Keep your things clean all the time.\n\n【28】2.  It is necessary to keep the working space also clean.\n\n【29】3.  Do not share your personal belongings.\n\n【30】4.  Soaps, towels, and other toiletries should not be shared with others.\n\n【31】5.  It is advised to have a separate food plate and drinking glasses.\n\n【32】6.  Maintain social distancing.\n\n【33】7.  Avoid going to public places.\n\n【34】8.  Consume foods that boost your immunity.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】To conclude, one of the most important steps in choosing an isolation period is identifying the incubation period of various COVID variants. The spread of COVID-19 infection can be stopped only when people know how long they will be contagious and when healthcare providers know what the accurate isolation time is to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Instructions to all major and minor ports for dealing with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  \n    https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/DGSOrder04of2020.pdf\n*   Clinical Questions about COVID-19: Questions and Answers  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html\n*   NIH- Incubation Period of COVID-19 Caused by Unique SARS-CoV-2 Strains  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9396366/#:~:text=Findings,%2C%20and%203.42%20days%2C%20respectively</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In addition, it teaches a non-judging, accepting behavior in society. Body positivity challenges how society views physical appearance as the parameter of beauty and recognizes the judgments on race, gender, sexuality, and disability.\n\n【3】What Is Body Positivity?\n------------------------\n\n【4】Body positivity means showing respect, acceptance, and appreciation for the bodies as they are and for the functions it does.\n\n【5】It includes:\n\n【6】*   Accepting that every body type is different and accepting its uniqueness.\n\n【7】*   Always carry a feeling of gratitude towards the functions it performs.\n\n【8】*   Not judging the body by the parameters created by society.\n\n【9】*   Feeling comfortable in your skin.\n\n【10】*   Shifting focus from flaws to strength.\n\n【11】*   Rejecting the negative image and thoughts toward one's own body.\n\n【12】*   Accepting the realities and working on them rather than building dream castles.\n\n【13】What Is the Aim of Creating Body Positivity Awareness?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Body positivity aims to help people understand the fact that everybody is beautiful. One should make a healthy relationship with their bodies and include healthy food, exercise, clothing, health, and self-care as a routine.\n\n【15】*   The positive influence of social media can develop a healthier and more realistic body image.\n\n【16】*   There should be fun lifestyle choices (varies from person to person) and nothing to be forced on.\n\n【17】*   The main goal is to challenge how society and all media demonstrate the physical ideal of the human body.\n\n【18】*   To neutralize the effect and impact of skinny culture and not judge people by their size and weight (body shaming).\n\n【19】**History:**\n\n【20】*   It dates back to 1850, when women first protested against the body shape and use of corsets.\n\n【21】*   In late 1960, a fat acceptance movement came into play that focussed on fat-shaming and discrimination based on size and weight.\n\n【22】*   In 1969, National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) was established. It mainly dealt with changing public opinions about weight.\n\n【23】*   In 2000, the internet was the source where body-shaming and love were spread.\n\n【24】*   In 2012, this movement began to emerge again, focussing on the acceptance of weight and that all bodies are beautiful.\n\n【25】Various social media handles and influencers participate in this movement, creating awareness.\n\n【26】**Body Positive Movement:**\n\n【27】A psychotherapist coined the term body positive from a website in late 1969. Before this time, the ideal loved body type was skinny.\n\n【28】People were shamed and bullied for being overweight. But it was after 1969 that people started appreciating various body types. The body-positive movement acts on how negative messages about bodies and appearance damages people emotionally, physically, and psychologically. Thus it offers a solution to all these harmful beliefs.\n\n【29】What Are the Chief Goals of the Body Positivity Movement?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   Challenging the social model of what is ideal.\n\n【31】*   Accepting all body types.\n\n【32】*   Addressing the unrealistic body standards.\n\n【33】What Are the Reasons for Addressing Body Positivity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The main aim of addressing body positivity is for good mental health. By having good mental health, one feels confident and does not underestimate self-worth. On the other hand, having a negative body image is correlated with depression and eating disorders. There are many problems associated with poor body image, that include:\n\n【35】1.  **Low Self-Esteem-** Dissatisfaction with one's body, color, and shape is associated with poor self-esteem. One develops a feeling of inferiority.\n\n【36】2.  **Depression and Other Mental Illnesses-** Body dissatisfaction (particularly in women) contributes to elevated rates of depression. People do not feel good about themselves, which results in demoralization, decreased confidence, and productivity. It evolves negative thoughts and feelings, which, when not suppressed, may lead to depression.\n\n【37】3.  **Eating Disorders-** A feeling of letdown is linked-to eating disorders. The false belief that beauty, success, and esteem are by thinness. When people consider this idea of thinness, they experience body dissatisfaction and may indulge in unhealthy and unnecessary dieting.\n\n【38】4.  **Other Contributing Factors-** Plastic surgeries and injections for enhanced and young looks have severely impacted the idea of body positivity. The idealization of skinny culture has directed people towards excessive workout regimens and extreme dieting.\n\n【39】**Criticism Faced:**\n\n【40】The body positivity movement has faced various problems and critics.\n\n【41】For some, the message of body positivity has made people less aware of their health, and they do whatever they feel like doing.\n\n【42】Others said some consider body positivity as the idea that skinny people are fitter, healthier and happier.\n\n【43】What Are Some Common Misconceptions Regarding Body Positivity?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The concept of society regarding an ideal body type is strong and persistent. Each of us has also thought of having such a body type. Thus, this creates more difficulty in accepting that an overweight or underweight body type is normal.\n\n【45】Some common misconceptions regarding the body's positive beliefs are:\n\n【46】*   This idea makes one lazy and unaware of their overall health.\n\n【47】*   It intends to neglect diet and exercise, which are beneficial for healthy living.\n\n【48】*   These people ignore social messages on body and appearance.\n\n【49】What Are the Steps Taken to Maintain a Healthy Body Image?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】The body-positive message states that you should change how you feel about your body (self-love).\n\n【51】But what can be done for such a healthy body image?\n\n【52】*   **Acknowledgment-** Acknowledge that you are not valued based on your shape and size but your skills and work.\n\n【53】*   **Adopting Body Neutrality-** One should admit that not everything in their body is beautiful, but love and care for it endlessly. Body image plays a part in self-image, and it is not everything to be focused on.\n\n【54】*   **Shift Focus-** People should not aim to focus only on the body. They should focus on other aspects also.\n\n【55】*   **Self-Care Is a Part of Health-** One should not aim to look beautiful and do things to change the body type. Exercise should be done to keep your body fit, strong, and energized. Healthy meals fuel the body and brain. It would not feel like forced work, and you will enjoy such a lifestyle.\n\n【56】*   **Do Not Plan Your Future Versions and Act-** Live in the present. Do tasks that fit your present criteria even include buying clothes. Many of us keep and buy things considering our future versions (for example - clothes that are a size smaller) as we have planned to lose weight. This type of habit makes us look bad in our thoughts. And when you can make up for it in the future, it demoralizes you even more. Always choose things that build your confidence and make you comfortable.\n\n【57】*   **Do Not Compare Yourself With Others-** Everyone is different in terms of looks, body types, skills, nature, etc. We should never compare ourselves to others as one might be good at something that you are not at and lacks things - that you master. It simply means - everybody is unique. Just appreciate what you have and move along.\n\n【58】What Is Body Neutrality?\n------------------------\n\n【59】It is the act of accepting your body the way it is, recognizing its abilities and functions it performs, and not simply focussing on how it looks. The word neutrality means being neutral towards your body. You do not have to force a feeling of love on your body every day. Accept it the way it is. The idea of body neutrality says - you may not necessarily love your body every day and can still live happily and appreciate everything it does for you. Your body digests the food you eat and allows you to think, run, love, give birth, etc. It does almost everything necessary for survival. What else better we can ask for. When you accept the idea of body neutrality, you ultimately give it respect, love, care, nutrition, rest, nutritious meals, and exercise. And you begin to feel good about yourself and your body.\n\n【60】This belief is far better as it does not involve false hopes and forced acceptance.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Body positivity means accepting and appreciating the body you have and not worrying about the effect of natural processes of aging, pregnancy, etc. It works on the principle that everybody is beautiful, and we should not create a genre of what is considered beautiful, be it a skinny body, zero figure, or glossy skin. Body neutrality, as another belief, explains how to accept your body the way it is, not by forcing and feeling the love on oneself every day.\n\n【63】Remember: Everybody is unique.\n\n【64】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【65】* * *\n\n【66】#### **1.**删除换行**Which Habits Can Help for a Positive Self-Image?**\n\n【67】Here are ways one can help themselves to have a positive self-image –  \n\\- Accepting different body types and its uniqueness.  \n\\- Feel gratitude towards the functions the body performs.  \n\\- Not judging the body by societal parameters.  \n\\- Feeling comfortable in own body and skin.  \n\\- Shifting focus from body flaws to strengths.  \n\\- Eliminating negative thoughts toward one's own body.  \n\\- Accepting reality.\n\n【68】#### **2.**删除换行**What Should One Do to Maintain a Positive Body Image?**\n\n【69】Here are some ways one can maintain a positive body image –  \n\\- Make a list of the positive qualities.  \n\\- Ask partners to highlight positive qualities.  \n\\- Define realistic personal goals and objectives.  \n\\- Convert negative thinking into positive thinking.  \n\\- Get to the root of childhood labels.  \n\\- Refrain from comparison to others.  \n\\- Develop strengths.  \n\\- Practice self-love.  \n\\- Practice positive affirmations.\n\n【70】#### **3.**删除换行**Why Is It Important to Have a Positive Body Image?**\n\n【71】Positive body image is the concept of how one perceives their body and having a positive attitude towards their body image.

All this may lead to emotional abuse, and the person may tend to suffer from mental health issues.\n\n【84】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is the Significance of Body Awareness?**\n\n【85】Body awareness helps people understand that everybody is beautiful in their own way. One should have a healthy relationship with their body and make lifestyle changes that include healthy food, exercise, health, and self-care as a routine. It is important to –  \n\\- Develop a more realistic body image.  \n\\- Make lifestyle choices accordingly.  \n\\- Challenge societal perceptions.  \n\\- Change the perception that being skinny is being healthy.  \n\\- To not judge people and prevent body shaming.\n\n【86】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is a Body Positivity Movement?**\n\n【87】A psychotherapist coined the term body positive earlier, as skinny was ideal and loved body type before this. People were made to feel guilty, shamed, and bullied for being overweight. But due to the increasing awareness, people started appreciating different body types. The body-positive movement acts to change the negative messages about bodies and appearance which damages people emotionally, physically, and psychologically. Hence this movement is a solution to all these harmful beliefs and their impacts.\n\n【88】#### **12.**删除换行**What Are the Main Influences of Body Image?**\n\n【89】Body image is influenced by several factors. Among the several factors that influence body image, social and cultural factors have the biggest impact on physical and mental well-being. It is also called “sociocultural influence,” which means that the environment impacts what people find desirable. Hence, one should have a positive body image to lead a healthy life and have a sound mental health.\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>*   What’s the Difference Between Body Positivity and Body Neutrality?  \n    https://health.clevelandclinic.org/body-positivity-vs-body-neutrality/\n*   Body Positivity: An Important Message for Girls, AND Boys  \n    https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/700childrens/2018/10/body-positivity\n*   Body positivity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8708647/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b2da47c3-2f5a-42e8-b5a0-d0256c8a67a2", "title": "Methotrexate - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions", "text": "【0】Methotrexate - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant agent. It prevents the growth of certain cells in the body that reproduce quickly. These cells include cancer cells, skin cells, and cells in the bone marrow. Because of this property, this drug is used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, for example, cancer of the breast, lung, skin, head, or neck. It also prevents the immune cells in the body from attacking healthy cells in the body (autoimmune reaction). This autoimmune reaction can result in inflammation seen in conditions like psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【2】Methotrexate is a prescription drug and is commonly prescribed only after all other treatment options have failed. It is available as an oral tablet, oral solution, self-injectable solution, and IV solution. You will be trained by your healthcare provider for the self-injectable solution. This drug is often used in combination with other drugs.\n\n【3】**Drug Group:**\n\n【4】Methotrexate belongs to the class of drugs called antimetabolites. Antimetabolites interfere with the enzymes necessary for DNA synthesis. These drugs act as a substitute for the metabolites that are used during metabolism for DNA synthesis. Antimetabolites are used in chemotherapy. As cancer cells multiply and grow more rapidly than normal cells, antimetabolites affect the replication of cancer cells more than they affect normal cells.\n\n【5】The other antimetabolites drugs are 5-Fluorouracil, 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP), Floxuridine, Fludarabine, Hydroxycarbamide, and Phototrexate.\n\n【6】What Is Methotrexate Used For?\n------------------------------\n\n【7】Methotrexate is used in the treatment of:\n\n【8】1.  Some types of cancer - This drug was originally developed and is still being used as a chemotherapeutic agent. It is used in the treatment of breast cancer, cancer of the head and neck, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia, cancer of the bladder, and trophoblastic neoplasms.\n\n【9】2.  Autoimmune conditions - Methotrexate is also used as a disease-modifying agent in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, lupus, Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and eczema. It is also used in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which is the most common type of arthritis in children.\n\n【10】3.  Medical abortion - Methotrexate is also used to induce an abortion. It is used along with Misoprostol to terminate early pregnancies. It can also be used to terminate an ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy.\n\n【11】4.  Other autoimmune conditions - Sometimes, Methotrexate is also used to treat Crohn's disease, which is a condition caused by the immune system attacking the lining of the digestive tract. And also multiple sclerosis, which is a condition where the immune system attacks the nerves.\n\n【12】Never take Methotrexate or any other medicine without consulting your doctor first.\n\n【13】How Does Methotrexate Work?\n---------------------------\n\n【14】Methotrexate works by inhibiting enzymes that are responsible for nucleotide synthesis, which includes thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, and aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART). This action prevents cell division and reduces inflammation. The duration of action is quite long for this drug, which is why it is generally given only once weekly.\n\n【15】Methotrexate gets converted to methotrexate polyglutamate when it enters tissues. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Methotrexate polyglutamate inhibits AICART more efficiently than Methotrexate. As a result of this inhibition, AICART ribonucleotide accumulates, which ultimately results in the anti-inflammatory action.\n\n【16】**Onset Of Action:**\n\n【17】The drug starts working in about 1 to 2 hours after an oral dose, and an intramuscular injection takes about 30 to 60 minutes to start working. If given a low dose, the effect lasts anywhere between 9 and 30 hours, and between 24 and 45 hours if given a high dose. It might take around 3 to 6 weeks for you to see any improvement in your symptoms.\n\n【18】**Habit-Forming:**\n\n【19】There have been no reports of habit-forming tendency in people taking Methotrexate.\n\n【20】**Expiry Date:**\n\n【21】Avoid taking this medicine after it expires. The expiry date will be printed on the back of the pack.\n\n【22】What Is the Dosage of Methotrexate?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】The dosage of Methotrexate will be decided by your doctor based on your age, weight, and other medical conditions. You will be first started on a low dosage, and depending on how your body reacts, the dosage will be modified. Methotrexate is available in 2.5 mg, 1 g, 20 mg, 50 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg/mL, 10 mg/0.4 mL, 15 mg/0.4 mL, and many more strengths.\n\n【24】**Methotrexate dosage for adults:**\n\n【25】Methotrexate is not approved to be used for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis in children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. For patients above 65 years, the doctor will check your kidney and liver function before prescribing this drug.\n\n【26】**Methotrexate dosage for children:**\n\n【27】This drug should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age.\n\n【28】Consult a doctor to know the exact dosage for other conditions.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>I am suffering from swollen feet and unbearble pain due to RA.

You might have to take this drug on a rotating schedule, meaning you will have to take it for several days, followed by several days or weeks where you do not have to take it. It is important to follow your doctor’s direction carefully.\n\n【36】For psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, this drug is usually prescribed once a week. Do not take it daily if only prescribed once a week, as it can lead to severe side effects and can also be fatal.\n\n【37】Make sure you understand when and how long to take Methotrexate before you leave the doctor’s office. Never take it more or less than prescribed. For anti-inflammatory action, it might take 3 to 12 weeks for the drug to show any effect. So, even if you feel well or do not feel any difference, continue to take Methotrexate, and never stop taking this drug without consulting your doctor first.\n\n【38】The self-injectable or intramuscular solution can be given by a doctor, or the doctor will train you or your caregiver to administer the drug carefully at home. Make sure you follow the doctor’s instructions carefully.\n\n【39】**Missed Dose:**\n\n【40】Set the alarm or a reminder to take this drug on time. Do not miss a dose of Methotrexate. If in case you miss a dose, you can take it as soon as you remember about missing the tablet. But if it is already time for the next dose, then do not take two tablets together, as it might result in severe adverse reactions. Just skip the missed dose and take the next dosage.\n\n【41】What Are the Drug Warnings and Precautions?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【42】There are a few things that need to be considered before taking this tablet, and tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions:\n\n【43】1.  Pregnancy - Methotrexate is known to end early pregnancy or can seriously harm the fetus. If you get pregnant while taking this medicine, stop the medicine and consult your doctor immediately. Methotrexate can also affect sperm. So both men and women who are getting treated with this drug should use birth control.\n\n【44】2.  Breastfeeding - Methotrexate is not recommended in breastfeeding women.\n\n【45】3.  Liver Damage - If you have a pre-existing liver condition, this medicine is not recommended for you. In patients with liver disease or injury, the concentration of this drug increases, which increases the risk of side effects. The doctor will check your liver function before prescribing this drug.\n\n【46】4.  Kidney Damage - If you have a pre-existing kidney condition, this medicine is not recommended for you. Methotrexate can damage the kidneys at higher doses. The doctor will constantly monitor your creatine levels while on this drug, and your dose will be adjusted accordingly.\n\n【47】5.  Lung Disease - This drug can result in serious lung conditions, such as pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates. In case you develop breathing difficulty and other breathing or respiratory symptoms while on this drug, consult your doctor immediately.\n\n【48】6.  Lowers White Blood Cell and Platelets Count - As this medicine can lower the neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) and platelet count, the doctor will closely monitor your blood cell count.\n\n【49】7.  Skin Reactions - Methotrexate can result in fatal skin reactions. It can cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin ulcerations, and skin necrosis. If you notice any skin lesion or rash while taking this drug, consult your doctor immediately.\n\n【50】8.  Gastrointestinal Tract Injury - This medicine can cause severe diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis (infection of the mouth). The symptoms of ulcerative stomatitis are swollen and bleeding gums, oral ulcers, and loose teeth.\n\n【51】9.  Infections - As this drug suppresses the immune system, the chances of infections are more. In case you develop an infection, the doctor will stop chemotherapy and give you broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【52】10.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome - If Methotrexate is used for a rapidly growing tumor, it can lead to a condition called tumor lysis syndrome. The common symptoms of this syndrome are problems passing urine, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and upset stomach. Inform your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\n【53】11.  Malignant Lymphoma - This medicine might increase the risk of malignant lymphoma (a type of blood cancer).\n\n【54】Apart from these precautions and drug warnings, some medications can increase the risk of side effects. This includes the use of NSAIDs along with Methotrexate. Radiation therapy, along with this drug, may increase the risk of muscle or bone damage.\n\n【55】What Are the Side Effects of Methotrexate?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【56】The common side effects seen with Methotrexate include:\n\n【57】*   Stomach upset.\n\n【58】*   Nausea.\n\n【59】*   Vomiting.\n\n【60】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【61】*   Tiredness.\n\n【62】*   Dizziness.\n\n【63】*   Hair fall.\n\n【64】*   Fever.\n\n【65】*   Headache.\n\n【66】*   Chills.\n\n【67】*   Oral sores.\n\n【68】*   Easy bruising.\n\n【69】*   Blisters in the lungs.\n\n【70】*   Skin ulcers.\n\n【71】*   Sun sensitivity.\n\n【72】*   Bronchitis.\n\n【73】*   Increased susceptibility to infections.\n\n【74】*   Skin rash.\n\n【75】*   Runny nose.\n\n【76】These symptoms are usually mild and most usually go away in a few days.

{"seq_id": "831b6db6-b644-4fab-92cf-599447792d90", "title": "Spinal Cord Injuries and Respiratory Failure - An Overview", "text": "【0】Spinal Cord Injuries and Respiratory Failure - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The human body needs oxygen for survival. The respiratory system helps to breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide to prevent the build-up of acids in the body. Injury to the spinal cord disrupts the signals to the muscles responsible for inhaling and exhaling air. The level of respiratory impairment depends on the level of spinal injury. Severe respiratory dysfunction requires mechanical ventilation.\n\n【2】How Does the Respiratory System Function?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Respiration requires the activity of three muscles; the diaphragm (at the bottom of the chest), the intercostal muscles (between the ribs), the accessory muscles, and the muscles of the abdomen (over the belly). Inhalation of air involves contraction of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles, which allows expansion of the chest cavity to breathe in oxygen. Exhalation is a passive movement by the forceful contraction of the abdominal muscles to breathe out carbon dioxide.\n\n【4】What Is the Role of the Spinal Cord in Respiration?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The brain coordinates the activity of respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord to the phrenic nerves at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical spinal levels for contraction of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the dome-shaped primary muscle for inspiration (inhalation). It moves down during the contraction. The lungs, rib cage, and abdomen expand during inspiration. Air travels through the windpipe to reach the air sacs in the lungs. This transfers oxygen to the blood. The diaphragm relaxes and moves up during expiration. The lungs, rib cage, and abdomen relax to breathe out carbon dioxide. During a cough, the brain sends signals to the nerves from the thoracic portion of the spinal cord for the contraction of the abdominal muscles and the intercostal muscles.\n\n【6】What Is the Impact of Spinal Cord Injury on the Respiratory System?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Signals sent from the brain cannot pass beyond the damaged spinal cord, and the brain cannot control the muscles of respiration. The extent of respiratory control loss depends on the level of the spinal cord injury.\n\n【8】*   A complete high cervical injury injures the spinal cord at or above the cervical 3rd, 4th, and 5th spinal nerves. This results in complete paralysis of both the muscles of inhalation and exhalation. This needs a tracheostomy (an opening created through the neck to reach the trachea -the main airway, for breathing) or a ventilator (a machine that helps to breathe by pushing air into the lungs).\n\n【9】*   In a complete lower cervical injury that does not involve the cervical 3rd, 4th, and 5th nerves, the diaphragm function is not disturbed, and a ventilator is not required.\n\n【10】*   In incomplete cervical injuries, the extent of diaphragm weakness and loss of control over other muscles depends on the extent of the injury.\n\n【11】*   In thoracic level injury, some or complete control over abdominal and intercostal muscles is lost depending on the location and extent of the damage.\n\n【12】*   In lumbar or sacral level injury, abdominal and intercostal muscles are not affected.\n\n【13】After the muscle control loss, the muscles functioning work hard to breathe oxygen into the blood and send out carbon dioxide. This results in respiratory problems.\n\n【14】What Are the Common Respiratory Problems?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   **Bronchitis** - Inflammation of the tubes that carry air to the air sacs in the lungs.\n\n【16】*   **Pneumonia** -Infection of the air sacs in one or both lungs.\n\n【17】*   **Atelectasis** - The collapse of all or a portion of the lung due to mucus build-up.\n\n【18】*   **Obstructive Sleep Apnea** - Obstructive sleep apnea occurs due to loss of muscle tone in the tongue, soft palate, or other soft tissues of the throat during sleep. This collapses the airway and obstructs the flow of air while breathing. This causes a drop in blood oxygen and a rise in carbon dioxide. The brain responds with arousal to start breathing. This disrupts sleep throughout the night.\n\n【19】What Are the Interventions in Respiratory Dysfunction?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】*   **Mechanical Ventilation -** High-level spinal cord injury patients need mechanical ventilation. The tracheostomy tube is an invasive ventilation method. Non-invasive ventilators offer comfort, speech, swallowing, and reduced secretions.\n\n【21】*   **Respiratory Muscle Training -** The respiratory muscle function is lost, and cough production and speech are impaired in ventilated individuals. It is possible to train the ventilated muscles for strength and endurance. The muscles are trained by breathing against resistance to cause fatigue. This improves the strength and endurance of the muscle.\n\n【22】*   **Abdominal Binder -** Abdominal binders are commonly used in tetraplegia. This uses inductance pneumography during spontaneous breathing. Abdominal binding influences rib-cage motion over the entire range of inspiratory capacity and increases total lung capacity and rib-cage dimensions in tetraplegic individuals.\n\n【23】*   **Ventilator-Assisted Speech -** Speech is affected in high cervical injuries. Low loudness and short phrases are observed if diaphragm function is not disturbed in cervical injury. Abdominal binders may improve speech in these conditions. If cervical injury impairs diaphragm function, the ventilator is needed, and speech is altered. The nature of the speech depends on the type of ventilator. Speech delivered with tracheostomy tubes differs because ventilator-delivered air enters below the larynx. If the tube is inflated, the person cannot speak. Deflating the tube allows the person to speak. Speech with a phrenic nerve pacer is also abnormal. It is improved by using abdominal binders.\n\n【24】*   **Respiratory Muscle Pacing -** In ventilated tetraplegic patients, conventional bilateral phrenic nerve pacing provides freedom from mechanical ventilation. It eliminates the noise associated with mechanical ventilators. The electrical stimulation of phrenic nerves does this in the neck or by magnetic stimulation.\n\n【25】*   **Assisted Cough -** An impaired cough leads to mucus build-up. Several methods are available to induce coughing and clear the secretions. These procedures are performed with chest physical therapy.\n\n【26】*   **Spinal Cord Stimulation -** Spinal cord stimulation at T9 (thoracic vertebrae 9) and L1 (lumbar vertebrae 1) levels.\n\n【27】*   **Spontaneous Cough -** Spontaneous cough is enhanced if the person is seated and lurches forward.\n\n【28】*   **Quad Cough** - The person is placed in an upright posture and straddled by placing hands under the right and left costal margins. The vigorous pressure applied to the abdomen enhances cough and clears secretions.\n\n【29】*   **Suction Catheter** - This device enhances cough by utilizing negative pressure applied at the opening of the tracheostomy tube.\n\n【30】*   **Mechanical In-Exsufflation** - This device is attached to the tracheostomy tube to remove the secretions.\n\n【31】*   **Bronchoscopy** - Bronchoscopy visualizes and enhances secretion clearance.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Spinal cord injury leads to respiratory dysfunction.

Gene alterations that are essential for the immune system's capacity to attract white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, to the site of infection are the root cause of many illnesses. LAD may result in persistent bacterial and fungal infections, sluggish wound healing, and inadequate antibiotic response. In extreme situations, LAD can result in infections that are difficult to cure and might be life-threatening. For the management of LAD symptoms and the prevention of infections that might be life-threatening, early identification and treatment are crucial.\n\n【9】What Are the Types of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Leukocytes are mostly unable to escape circulation and reach tissues that have been infected by microorganisms. Leukocyte trafficking's ongoing monitoring of foreign antigens is also disrupted.

More precisely, a mutation in the kindlin-3 gene results in this kind of LAD.\n\n【19】LAD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\n\n【20】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndromes (LAD) can cause a variety of symptoms, but they frequently involve:\n\n【22】1.  Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, including ear infections, skin infections, and pneumonia.\n\n【23】2.  Delayed healing of a wound.\n\n【24】3.  The antibiotic response is poor.\n\n【25】4.  Gum disease and mouth sores.\n\n【26】5.  Persistent diarrhea.\n\n【27】6.  Delayed growth.\n\n【28】7.  Delayed umbilical cord separation in infants.\n\n【29】In extreme situations, LAD can result in infections that are difficult to cure and might be life-threatening. These infections can affect several organs and lead to sepsis, a potentially lethal disease in which the body's immune system reacts to an infection by causing tissue damage and extensive inflammation. LAD symptoms can develop over time; in some cases, a diagnosis may not occur until later in childhood or adolescence.\n\n【30】How Is Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome (LAD) is diagnosed using a process that combines clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, and genetic testing. In order to identify LAD, the following tests may be used:\n\n【32】1.  **Blood Testing:** Blood tests may monitor white blood cell counts and activity, as well as spot any anomalies that might be linked to LAD.\n\n【33】2.  **Genetic Testing:** Genetic testing can discover mutations in the ITGB2 or SLC35C1 genes that cause LAD.\n\n【34】3.  **Flow Cytometry:** A laboratory method called flow cytometry may be used to examine the expression and role of certain proteins on the surface of white blood cells. By differentiating between LAD-I and LAD-II, this test can aid in the diagnosis of LAD.\n\n【35】4.  **Biopsy:** In order to determine whether white blood cells are present at the infection location, a skin biopsy may be taken.\n\n【36】The diagnosis of LAD may require a team of experts, including immunologists, geneticists, and infectious disease specialists. The management of LAD symptoms and the avoidance of infections that might be life-threatening depend on early detection.\n\n【37】What Is the Treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndromes?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndromes (LAD) are incurable; this therapy focuses on symptom management and infection avoidance. LAD may be treated using any of the following methods:\n\n【39】1.  **Antibiotics:** Utilizing antibiotics, bacterial illnesses can be treated and prevented. Antibiotic therapy may need to be prolonged and may require greater dosages than normal due to the immune system's diminished capacity to fight infections.\n\n【40】2.  **Antifungal Drugs:** LAD patients frequently get fungal infections, which can be treated and prevented using antifungal medications.\n\n【41】3.  **Growth Factors:** In order to increase the production of white blood cells and strengthen the immune system, growth factors like granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be employed.\n\n【42】4.  **Stem Cell Transplantation:** If LAD is severe, stem cell transplantation can be an option. To achieve this, healthy bone marrow from a donor is used to replace the bone marrow in the body that makes white blood cells. Stem cell transplantation carries some risk and is often only used in the most severe LAD instances.\n\n【43】5.  **Gene Therapy:** Gene therapy is an experimental kind of medicine that involves correcting or replacing the dysfunctional gene that causes LAD. The experimental stage of this treatment is still ongoing, and it is not readily accessible.\n\n【44】Individuals with LAD may benefit from adopting precautions to lower their risk of infection in addition to medical therapy, such as maintaining excellent hygiene, avoiding contact with ill individuals, and remaining current on vaccines. In order to create a thorough treatment strategy for LAD, it is crucial to collaborate with a group of medical experts, including immunologists, geneticists, and experts in infectious diseases.\n\n【45】What Is the Prognosis of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndromes?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The prognosis for leukocyte adhesion deficiency varies depending on how severe the condition is; it frequently results in death before the age of one. With the right antibiotic medication, moderate LAD sufferers can live through their third decade. Successful recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may experience an improved quality of life.\n\n【47】**Conclusion**\n\n【48】Rare hereditary diseases known as leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndromes (LAD) impair the immune system's capacity to combat infections. White blood cell activation and recruitment, which are crucial for battling infections, are regulated by genes that are mutated in LAD.\n\n【49】Since LAD cannot be cured, therapy focuses on symptom management and infection avoidance. Working with a group of healthcare experts is crucial. For the management of LAD symptoms and the prevention of infections that might be life-threatening, early identification and treatment are crucial. People with LAD can have healthy lives with the right management, while they may need continuing medical care to avoid and cure infections.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n无关删除-1:<u>*   Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Syndromes - Symptoms, Causes, Treatment | NORD  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency-syndromes/\n*   Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539770/\n*   Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD)  \n    https://primaryimmune.org/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It allows light to the cornea and adjusts its size according to the amount of light. Ideally, no two pupils can be of the same length or diameter. However, if the difference in the diameter exceeds 1 mm, it may be termed anisocoria (unequal pupil size). This condition is quite common, and it is said that 15 % of the population would have experienced it at some point in their lives. Anisocoria can be congenital. It can be present since birth, or it may have occurred suddenly due to some underlying disease. However, if it appears suddenly, it may be a cause of concern.\n\n【1】What Are the Symptoms of Unequal Pupil Size?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【2】Symptoms may accompany varying pupil sizes or be pointed out by someone else. A medical practitioner may also diagnose it during a regular visit. Anisocoria may be associated with ocular as well as non-ocular symptoms.\n\n【3】**Ocular Symptoms May Include:**\n\n【4】1.  One pupil that is bigger or smaller in size.\n\n【5】2.  Pain in the eyes.\n\n【6】3.  Vision loss.\n\n【7】4.  The blurring of the vision.\n\n【8】5.  Double vision or diplopia.\n\n【9】6.  Photophobia or sensitivity to light.\n\n【10】7.  Redness of the eye.\n\n【11】**Non-ocular Symptoms May Include :**\n\n【12】1.  Fever.\n\n【13】2.  Headache.\n\n【14】3.  Nausea.\n\n【15】4.  Vomiting.\n\n【16】5.  Neck pain.\n\n【17】6.  Stiffness in the neck.\n\n【18】7.  Dizziness.\n\n【19】What Are the Causes of Unequal Pupil Size?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】**Causes That May Not Be Associated With Underlying Pathology:**\n\n【21】1.  **Drugs:** Consumption of certain drugs may cause the pupil to become bigger or smaller. Drugs that may have an effect on the pupil include Anticholinergics, Pilocarpine, and Sympathomimetics.\n\n【22】2.  **Consumption of Cocaine:** Cocaine can cause the pupils to become bigger.\n\n【23】3.  **Injury:** Injury or trauma to the head, eye, or neck can lead to conditions that may cause the alteration of pupil size. During an injury to the eye, a total or partial separation of the iris may be seen.\n\n【24】**Causes That May Be Associated With Underlying Pathology:**\n\n【25】1.  **Migraine**: Migraine is a neurological condition that is associated with unilateral headaches. Under such conditions, a person may have unequal pupil size.\n\n【26】2.  **Seizures**: A person experiencing a seizure attack may present with one pupil bigger or smaller than the other.\n\n【27】3.  **Glaucoma**: It is a condition of the eye in which damage to the optic nerve can occur. This condition, at times, can cause one pupil to be bigger than the other.\n\n【28】4.  **Third Nerve Palsy:** The oculomotor nerve, or the third nerve, serves as the nerve supply to the eye, its muscles, and the pupil. Any damage, tumor, or any other pathology of this nerve can cause the nerve to malfunction, leading to unequal pupil size. Third, nerve palsy can also cause drooping eyelids and the inability of the pupil to contract and relax.\n\n【29】5.  **Horner's Syndrome**: The exact cause of this condition is unknown, but can be caused by a tumor or injury. In this condition, one pupil may be constricted or smaller, leading to unequal pupil size. The constricted pupil may not be responsive to light.\n\n【30】6.  **Tonic Pupil / Adie Syndrome:** Under this condition, one pupil is not responsive to light and remains big. This condition occurs more commonly in women than men in the age group of 20 to 40 years.\n\n【31】**Causes That Are Localized to the Brain and Neck:**\n\n【32】1.  **Brain Aneurysms**: Brain aneurysms are small bulges in the brain's arteries.\n\n【33】2.  **Strokes**: This damage the brain due to disrupting its blood supply.\n\n【34】3.  **Brain Tumors:** These are tumors of the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【35】4.  **Meningitis:** It is an infection of the brain and the spinal cord.\n\n【36】5.  Tumors of the lymph nodes may exert pressure on the nerves.\n\n【37】6.  Any injury or block to the vessels of the neck may have an impact on the nerves supplying the eye.\n\n【38】How Are Unequal Pupils Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【39】1.  **Physical Examination:** When one pupil is bigger or smaller than the other, a physical examination is a preliminary investigation that is to be done. A medical practitioner will determine whether the pupil is bigger or smaller. The reaction of the pupil to light will be used as a tool to find this.\n\n【40】2.  **Other Investigation:** The reaction of the pupil coupled with other symptoms will lead to further diagnostic tests such as :\n\n【41】*   Blood investigations.\n*   Computed tomography.\n*   Magnetic resonance imaging.\n*   Any other investigation as the doctor may deem necessary.\n\n【42】When to Consult a Doctor for Unequal Pupil Size?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Except for congenital cases, wherein one pupil is bigger or smaller than the other, all other cases require immediate medical attention. Unequal pupils can signify some serious underlying medical condition. Hence seeking medical care as a priority is advisable.\n\n【44】How to Treat Unequal Pupil Size?\n--------------------------------\n\n【45】Treatment of unequal pupil size will be decided based on its causative factor. To treat the condition of the eye, it will be important to address the underlying factors that are causing it. Hence correct diagnosis is the key to the resolution of this condition. Anisocoria that is present since birth requires no treatment as there are no underlying causative factors. In case of anisocoria due to mechanical factors, such as trauma, the injury should be resolved at the earliest. In the case of anisocoria due to any other etiology, it is necessary to address the underlying causes, such as Horner's syndrome and Adie's pupil.\n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】Anisocoria is a condition that can be resolved by treating the causative factor. Treating unequal pupils is more than just treating irregularities. It is more important to treat the underlying disease, which can be more life-threatening.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   https://www.icliniq.com/articles/migraines-and-headaches/worst-headache-ever-it-could-be-brain-aneurysm  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003314.htm\n*   Pupillary Disorders Including Anisocoria  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pupillary-disorders-including-anisocoria\n*   Unequal Pupil Sizes (Anisocoria)  \n    https://www.optometrists.org/general-practice-optometry/guide-to-eye-conditions/guide-to-blurry-vision-and-headaches/when-is-blurred-vision-a-medical-emergency/unequal-pupil-sizes-anisocoria/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These parts are known as the lower extremities of the body. Amputations can be a result of surgical removal or as a result of physical trauma. Lower extremity amputation is resorted to saving life due to ischemic (poor blood supply area), infected, necrotic (dead area), or unresectable tumors (tumors that cannot be removed) sometimes. More than half of all amputations are caused by peripheral vascular disease (disrupted blood supply to extremities), either by itself or in conjunction with diabetes mellitus. Trauma is the second most common cause of lower limb amputation.\n\n【2】What Are the Terms Used in Lower Limb Amputation?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Major Amputation -** Any amputation carried out above the ankle is major.\n\n【4】*   **Foot Amputation -** Amputations below the ankle are considered foot amputations.\n\n【5】*   **Primary Amputations -** These are carried out without effort to save the limb. Efforts to save limp include revascularization (increase in the blood supply of the affected area), bone repair, or soft tissue coverage.\n\n【6】*   **Secondary Amputations -** These are carried out after a failed revascularization attempt.\n\n【7】*   **Traumatic Amputation -** It is described as limb loss due to an incident.\n\n【8】What Are the Indications for Lower Limb Amputation?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   **Trauma -** It is a common reason for limb amputation.\n\n【10】*   **Malignant Tumors -** Malignant tumors tend to spread from the original site to other body parts and necessitate removal if it occurs in the extremities.\n\n【11】*   **Infection and Nerve Injury -** Limb removal becomes necessary when the underlying cause cannot be corrected.\n\n【12】*   **Peripheral Vascular Insufficiency -** When the blood supply to the extremities cannot be regained, the area becomes necrosed (dead). Infection from one area can spread to another region, so amputation becomes necessary.\n\n【13】*   **Congenital Disabilities -** Some defects present from birth cannot be cured and require limb amputation.\n\n【14】*   **Osteomyelitis -** A severe illness caused due to bacterial infection of the bone.\n\n【15】*   **Gas Gangrene -** Accumulating gas in the extremities necessitates surgical removal of the leg.\n\n【16】**What Are the Levels of Lower Limb Amputation?**\n\n【17】Depending upon the site of amputation, it is divided into the following:\n\n【18】*   **Transfemoral -** Above knee amputation.\n\n【19】*   **Disarticulated Knee -** Amputation occurs at the level of the knee.\n\n【20】*   **Transtibial -** Below knee amputation.\n\n【21】*   **Disarticulated Ankle -** Amputation at the level of the ankle.\n\n【22】*   **Syme Amputation -** Amputation occurs at the ankle joint, but the heel pad is saved.\n\n【23】*   **Foot Amputation -** Amputation of part of a foot.\n\n【24】*   An amputated toe or transmetatarsal amputation\n\n【25】What Is Above-Knee Amputation?\n------------------------------\n\n【26】An above-knee amputation (AKA) occurs when the thigh bone is amputated above the knee joint. Transfemoral amputation is another name for this kind of amputation. The amputation most frequently occurs in the middle of the thigh bone. The femur (bone of the thigh) makes up the residual leg; there is no knee joint. An AKA may cause the hamstrings (tendon in the back of the knee) and quadriceps (the large muscle in the front thigh) to lose a substantial amount of muscular control. Using a prosthesis (an artificial limb) becomes difficult in this type.\n\n【27】What Is Below-Knee Amputation?\n------------------------------\n\n【28】Amputation through the shin bone (tibia bone, most giant two bones of the leg) is referred to as a below-knee amputation (BKA), otherwise known as transtibial amputation. BKA is the most frequent amputation, which carries a lower risk of major post-operative complications than a transfemoral amputation. The knee joint is spared in a BKA, and fitting a prosthetic limb is more successful.\n\n【29】What Is Amputation of the Hemipelvis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【30】The hip joint and a portion of the pelvis are amputated in a hemipelvis amputation. Transpelvic amputation is another name for this kind of amputation. It is typically carried out due to trauma or malignant (spreading cancer) growth. Walking is challenging following a hemipelvis amputation since attaching the prosthesis becomes impossible without a residual limb. However, the doctor and physical therapist can work to determine the best device for a patient to enhance walking abilities.\n\n【31】What is An Amputated Toe?\n-------------------------\n\n【32】The leading cause of toe amputations is typically a low blood supply to the toe, which occasionally progresses to gangrene (dead area). Physical therapy helps in rehabilitation but is rarely required after this kind of amputation. But physical therapy may be used occasionally if functional mobility is restricted.\n\n【33】What Is Partial Foot Amputation?\n--------------------------------\n\n【34】When a portion of the foot is severed, it is called partial foot amputation. Transmetatarsal amputation is another name for this procedure. A person can have a high level of functional mobility after a partial foot amputation since muscle attachments are preserved throughout the procedure. In addition, this kind of amputation preserves the balance and foot contour, which can aid in preserving the natural gait.\n\n【35】What Is Disarticulation?\n------------------------\n\n【36】A joint amputation is referred to as disarticulation. With the removal of the shin bone, the knee joint is preserved. Walking may be more accessible as disarticulation amputation in youngsters aids in maintaining the growth of bone plate.\n\n【37】**What Are the Preoperative Training Programs Before Lower Limb Amputation?**\n\n【38】1\\. Limb movement improves circulation and prevents thrombosis (blood clotting) after surgery.\n\n【39】2\\. Deep breathing, coughing, and postural drainage (improve secretion release) prevent chest complications and maintain joint flexibility. It also boosts the flexibility of the shoulder girdle, pelvis, and other parts of the body.\n\n【40】3\\. Instructing the patient on how to place the limb in bed.\n\n【41】4\\. Teach the patients to stand on one leg, balance, and monitor wheelchairs.\n\n【42】5\\. Psychological comfort is crucial.\n\n【43】What Is Postoperative Care After Lower Limb Amputation?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】1\\. Close monitoring of patients is required to avoid thrombosis and chest complications.\n\n【45】2\\. Contracture (muscle becomes stiff and short) and deformity avoidance:\n\n【46】*   The most frequent form of contracture is knee flexion contracture can be avoided by situating an amputated limb correctly and using passive limb movement.\n\n【47】*   Preservation of flexibility and strength.\n\n【48】3\\. The patient can be moved around in the bed by raising the body on the arms.\n\n【49】4\\. The benefit of push-up exercise is that it helps to build the upper-limb muscles, which are essential for using ambulation aids in the future.\n\n【50】**What Are the Complications of Lower limb Amputation?**\n\n【51】*   Blood clots.\n\n【52】*   Edema (fluid accumulation in the operated area).\n\n【53】*   A poor recovery.\n\n【54】*   Wound infection.\n\n【55】*   Pneumonia (lung infection).\n\n【56】*   Phantom limb (pain in the limb even after removal).\n\n【57】*   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or the formation of a blood clot in lower leg veins that can travel to the lungs and cause blockage.\n\n【58】*   Ulceration on a stump.\n\n【59】*   Necrosis of the operated area.\n\n【60】*   Joint rigidity.\n\n【61】*   Osteomyelitis (bone infection).\n\n【62】*   Osteoporosis (weakening of bone).\n\n【63】**Conclusion**\n\n【64】The restoration of mobility and limb function depends on the type of amputation. Therefore, assessing the patient's nutritional state during surgery is essential for better wound healing. After amputation, the patient should try to reduce edema (fluid accumulation), improve vascular inflow, and eradicate bacteremia (bacteria in the blood). Antibiotics should be used when needed.\n\n【65】Surgical operations and rehabilitation must be synchronized. A multidisciplinary approach is used in modern amputee management to handle these extensive challenges. Each situation involves unique medical, surgical, social, rehabilitative, prosthetic, and economic considerations. Amputation surgery includes preoperative, surgical, and short-term and long-term post-operative objectives.\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n无关删除-1:<u>*   Lower Extremity Amputation | Michigan Medicine  \n    https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/rehabilitation/lower-extremity-amputation\n*   Lower Extremity Amputation Prevention (LEAP) | HRSA  \n    https://www.hrsa.gov/hansens-disease/leap\n*   General Principles of Amputation Surgery | UW Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine, Seattle  \n    https://orthop.washington.edu/patient-care/limb-loss/general-principles-of-amputation-surgery.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is the presence of small red dots or pinpricks on the human skin. These are present mainly on the lower extremities. Depending on the size of the red dots, these are known as purpura or petechiae. These occur due to the lack of blood in the human body. The red blood cells (RBCs) take blood from all over the body. The anemia rash can be due to any anemia. If a patient is anemic, then they should consult a doctor for regular blood tests. The article discusses anemia rash, its causes, types of anemia, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n【2】What Is Anemia?\n---------------\n\n【3】Anemia is decreased or reduced in red blood cell numbers. The red blood cells take oxygen. With an oxygen deficiency, an individual may experience cold or tiredness. There may be a presence of skin rashes. The condition can be tested by checking hemoglobin levels. The iron part present in the red blood cells is the hemoglobin. The usual range of hemoglobin in males is between 13 to 16 g/dL, and in females is between 11 to 13 g/dL. Insufficient oxygen intake by the human body can result in low hemoglobin levels. The symptoms include tiredness, dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath, and elevated heart rates.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Anemia?\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】Various types of anemia are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** A lack or decrease in iron levels in the human blood leads to iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【7】*   **Aplastic Anemia:** Aplastic anemia is called aplastic anemia when the bone marrow does not construct the red blood cells.\n\n【8】*   **Pernicious Anemia**: When the immune system cannot attack cells in the stomach leading to a stoppage of vitamin B12 absorption.\n\n【9】*   **Hemolytic Anemia**: In certain infections, the red blood cells are destroyed. In this, the body is unable to meet the demand and supply.\n\n【10】*   **Macrocytic Anemia:** People with a decrease in vitamin B12 and folate may have a large type of red blood cells called macrocytic anemia.\n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Anemia Rash?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【12】Anemia rash occurs due to anemia.\n\n【13】*   **Aplastic Anemia**: Aplastic anemia occurs due to default in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is a spongy tissue that generates stem cells. The stem cells consist of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Platelets help in the stoppage of the bleeding. The reduced number of platelets can cause a decrease in blood clotting. There may be bleeding under the top layer of the skin. The usual range of platelets is between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter. The platelets diminish after every ten days. If the body cannot generate new platelets and change them with old ones, blood clotting will be affected. Consequently, this can cause subcutaneous bleeding, resulting in a red rash. This is called an anemia rash.\n\n【14】*   **Acquired Aplastic Anemia**: The condition affects young children and elderly people. The bone marrow can sustain either temporary or permanent damage. This may be due to pregnancy, viral infection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Idiopathic aplastic anemia is a condition where the underlying cause is unknown to the individual affected.\n\n【15】*   **Inherited Aplastic Anemia**: It is also known as Fanconi anemia. Ninety percent of people experience this type of anemia. Due to bone marrow failure, some individual feels a tiny rash. The condition can be transferred from the parents to the son or daughter.\n\n【16】*   **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: The symptoms include bruising and itchiness due to the lack of iron. There may be an appearance of a rash on the skin.\n\n【17】*   **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura**: The condition in which blood clots are formed all over the body. This can lead to tiny red or purple spots called petechiae. There may be a purplish bruising similar to the purpura rash.\n\n【18】*   **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria**: The genetic mutation cause the formation of abnormal red blood cells. The easy breakdown of the red blood cells causes blood clots and bruising.\n\n【19】*   **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome**: Infections, pregnancy, and medications can destroy the red blood cells. The symptoms include bruising and swelling on the hands and feet.\n\n【20】What Are the Symptoms of Anemia Rash?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】The signs and symptoms of anemia rash are as follows:\n\n【22】*   Stool in the blood.\n\n【23】*   Retinal bleeding leads to vision issues.\n\n【24】*   Heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\n【25】*   Bruises on the skin.\n\n【26】*   The other symptoms include nausea, fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, pale skin, headache, dizziness, and rapid heart rate.\n\n【27】*   The symptoms of anemia include weakness, tiredness, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightness, and cold feet and hands.\n\n【28】How Is Anemia Rash Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【29】The doctor may diagnose anemia rash by physical examination and diagnostic tests. The diagnostic tests are as follows:\n\n【30】*   **Complete Blood Count:** To assess levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin, a healthcare provider may recommend a complete blood count test.\n\n【31】*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy**: The biopsy may be recommended in case of aplastic anemia. The healthcare provider may examine a bone marrow sample with a needle under a microscope.\n\n【32】How Is Aplastic Anemia Treated?\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】The approaches to treat anemia rash are as follows:\n\n【34】*   **Iron Supplementation**: The doctor may prescribe iron supplements if an individual suffers from iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【35】*   **Vitamin Supplementation:** The doctor may prescribe vitamin supplements if an individual suffers from vitamin B12 deficiency. These supplements can help in producing new red blood cells.\n\n【36】*   **Blood Transfusion**: The doctor may prescribe blood transfusions in case of very low hemoglobin levels.\n\n【37】*   **Medications:** The doctor may recommend topical corticosteroids or oral antihistamines to treat itchiness.\n\n【38】*   **Bone Marrow Transplantation:** Bone marrow transplantation is prescribed in case of aplastic anemia. This will help in the replacement of the damaged bone marrow.\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】The anemia rash is the presence of small tiny dots on the skin's surface. This can be due to anemia. The symptoms include pallor, red dots, and bruises on the skin. The healthcare provider diagnoses the condition by physical examination, complete blood count, and bone marrow biopsy. The condition can be treated by prescribing iron, vitamin supplementation, blood transfusion, and medications. A healthy diet and lifestyle changes help in managing anemia rash.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   An Unusual Cause of Anemia and a Rash  \n    https://shmabstracts.org/abstract/an-unusual-cause-of-anemia-and-a-rash/\n*   Skin Rash, Hepatitis, and Hemolytic Anemia Caused By Para-Aminosalicylic Acid  \n    https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/arrd.1964.89.3.440?journalCode=arrd\n*   A Toddler With Rash, Encephalopathy, and Hemolytic Anemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4681381/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Familial cold urticaria (FCAS) is the mild type of CAPS, Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous and Articular syndrome (CINCA) is the intermediate form, and MWS is the severe form with a mental and physical handicap. The primary clinical symptoms of CAPS are an urticarial rash, fever, arthralgia, and exhaustion. The pro-inflammatory interleukin 1 (IL-1) overproduction that causes CAPS symptoms is caused by the NLRP3 gene mutation. Since IL-1 inhibitors have been approved for treating MWS, patients' quality of life has significantly increased.\n\n【2】What Is the Epidemiology of Muckle-Wells Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】According to estimates, there are 1–10 cases of CAPS for every million people. There is no gender predominance. However, Caucasians appear more affected than other races.\n\n【4】What Is the Pathogenesis of Muckle-Wells Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The NLRP3 gene, situated on chromosome 1q44, has three CAPS phenotypes, each brought on by either dominantly inherited or de novo gain-of-function mutations, with varying degrees of penetrance. The NALP3 protein (also known as cryopyrin), which belongs to the family of intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain NOD-like receptors NLRs, is produced by the NLRP3 gene. NLRs are members of the PRR (pattern-recognition receptor) family. The various danger- and pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs and PAMPs) are recognized by PRRs. The NACHT domain, which allows NLRs to cluster and oligomerize, is present in all NLRs. Increased inflammation may result from NALP3 NACHT domain mutations.\n\n【6】Although a particular mutation may be linked to various phenotypes of varying severity, these mutations show a strong genotype-phenotype association. Only a small number of people with plausible CAPS profiles have no mutation. Somatic mosaicism in some of them may indicate a function for somatic mutations.\n\n【7】What Are the Clinical Manifestations of Muckle-Wells Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Without a known cause, MWS is characterized by recurrent or intermittent fever, headache, urticarial rash, arthralgia, or arthritis. The median age of beginning for febrile attacks is 0.8 years, and they typically begin in infancy. The intense weariness that causes social isolation affects 40 % to 80 % of patients. Attacks may intensify at night, accompanied by a general feeling of malaise, chills, sweating, severe myalgia, and heaviness in the lower limbs, occasionally with edema. Most attacks end within 24 hours, although a percentage linger over three days. 40 % of patients have more than 24 attacks per year, compared to 50% who have fewer than 12 per year.\n\n【9】90% of migraine, intracranial hypertension, or chronic meningitis are accompanied by headaches and irritation, severely affecting everyday life. Patients may have a livedoid appearance to their skin, and urticarial rashes that are not pruritic may develop during bouts. The lesions are consistent with neutrophilic urticaria histologically. Rarer symptoms include mouth ulcers, folliculitis, or erythema nodosum.\n\n【10】Arthralgia and clubbing of the nails are the two primary osteoarticular symptoms. Only CINCA patients exhibit arthritis and cartilaginous proliferation at growth plates and epiphyses. After age 10, patients with MWS may experience progressive sensorineural hearing loss, which is most likely the result of chronic internal ear inflammation.\n\n【11】Conjunctivitis is common, and severe cases of episcleritis and uveitis can also be detected. Up to 25% of instances of amyloidosis result in proteinuria and renal failure. Blood levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and absolute neutrophil count may all rise during an incident.\n\n【12】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Muckle-Wells Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Other periodic inflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), juvenile systemic granulomatosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and Behçet disease are differentially diagnosed. Still, illness was frequently accompanied by fever, rash, arthralgia, and chronic inflammatory signs. Hypocomplementemia vasculitis or systemic lupus could also be symptoms of other autoimmune disorders. The symptoms of CAPS, in general, and MWS, in particular, are similar to those of other auto-inflammatory illnesses such as HIDS, TRAPS, or FMF. The illness linked with NALP 12 mutations, which also includes adenomegaly, stomach pain, mouth ulcers, headache, and deafness in some individuals, is the hereditary recurrent fever disease that most closely resembles MWS.\n\n【14】What Is the Treatment Given for Muckle-Wells Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Painkillers and antihistamines had been demonstrated to be unsuccessful in lowering CAPS symptoms prior to the discovery of biological therapies. However, high-dose corticosteroids were partially effective. In addition to exhaustion, chronic discomfort, hearing and vision impairments, and learning challenges, patients experienced a lower quality of life. They encountered a lack of understanding in their academic or professional environments, which resulted in social and emotional exclusion. They might gradually acquire various psychiatric issues, such as drug addictions or severe depression, that result in suicide. The etiology of CAPS has been clarified, enabling effective IL-1 treatment.\n\n【16】Three IL-1 inhibitors have proven effective in CAPS: canakinumab, a fully human monoclonal IgG1 targeted at IL-1; Rilonacept, a chimerical protein made up of the IL-1-binding domains of human IgG1 and IL-1RI fused to the Fc portion of the protein. Anakinra is a recombinant non-glycosylated form of the human IL-1RA. In Europe, all CAPS phenotypes are approved for using Anakinra and Canakinumab. For all CAPS traits, only Canakinumab is authorized in Japan. In the USA, Rilonacept is approved for use in adults and children over 12 who have FCAS and MWS, while Canakinumab is approved for use in adults and children over two who have FCAS and MWS. Anakinra is approved for use in CINCA.\n\n【17】Anakinra injections daily caused symptoms to quickly subside and CRP and SAA levels to return to normal. By clinical severity, Anakinra may be administered in babies as young as eight months old at doses between 1 and 8 mg/kg/day and in adults as old as 300 mg. Because Anakinra has a very short half-life (6 hours), if the medication is stopped, symptoms quickly return. As it can enter the cerebral fluid, Anakinra has substantial advantages for treating systemic symptoms and may impact chronic conditions such as aseptic meningitis, uveitis, and cochlear inflammation.\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】With a better understanding of CAPS pathophysiology and therapy utilizing anti-IL-1, clinical profiles and outcomes of MWS patients have significantly improved. Patients can now resume their everyday lives. Advanced research is still required to accurately predict phenotype from genetics for early therapy. For a more accurate diagnosis and application of anti-IL-1, further research is still required on the pharmacokinetics and diffusion of the medicines into CSF in young children. It's essential to evaluate how long-term usage of IL-1-antagonists affects children who receive treatment early in life regarding how they grow, develop, and mature sexually.\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>*   Muckle–Wells syndrome: clinical perspectives  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513904/\n*   Muckle-Wells syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/8472/muckle-wells-syndrome\n*   Muckle-Wells Syndrome Across Four Generations in One Czech Family: Natural Course of the Disease  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00802/full</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It prevents and relieves the illness of patients going through life-threatening issues. The main motive for palliative care is to reduce disease and restore the patient's health. Palliative anesthesia does reduce the illness stress but at the cost of the patient's life. Due to sedatives, the patient is completely asleep, which inhibits the severity of the patient's condition, and the nourishment is limited.\n\n【2】What Is Palliative Care or End-of-Life Care?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The World Health Organization says that \"palliative care is the approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families who are facing problems associated with the life-threatening illness.\" It prevents and relieves problems through early detection and treatment, including physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Pain and difficulty breathing are the two most frequently faced severe symptoms requiring palliative care.\n\n【4】Who Requires Palliative Care?\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】Palliative care is required for many diseases. The patient requirement is irrespective of age and sex and only deals with the severity of the illness. The majority of patients who need it have chronic diseases and conditions such as,\n\n【6】1.  Chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n【7】2.  Cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【8】3.  Cancer.\n\n【9】4.  Human immunodeficiency virus.\n\n【10】5.  Diabetes.\n\n【11】6.  Kidney failure.\n\n【12】7.  Chronic liver diseases.\n\n【13】8.  Multiple sclerosis.\n\n【14】9.  Parkinson's disease.\n\n【15】10.  Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【16】11.  Neurological disease.\n\n【17】12.  Dementia.\n\n【18】13.  Congenital abnormalities.\n\n【19】14.  Drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【20】What Does Palliative Care Do?\n-----------------------------\n\n【21】It aims to improve the quality of life by relieving suffering. Its primary focus is on managing the symptoms like pain, difficulty in breathing, difficulty in eating, and mental problems. The initial care starts with the earlier information gathered. Then, symptoms with laboratory tests are noted. The management of the patient's condition depends upon symptoms, so the treatment accordingly is made to follow.\n\n【22】When to Use Anesthesia in Palliative Care?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Anesthesia usage in palliative care is as follows:\n\n【24】*   Anesthesia is the last step if the patient fails to respond to other treatments. If treatment fails to relieve the symptoms like pain, difficulty in breathing, and delirium, anesthetics command palliative care.\n\n【25】*   The doctor should acknowledge the patient for using anesthesia during palliative care or before starting the treatment if cases like delirium are present.\n\n【26】*   The doctor should also inform the caregiver of the patient about anesthesia usage. It can be used for a short time to see if the patient has eliminated the symptoms. Awakening from the anesthesia shows the result.\n\n【27】*   Continuous usage or intermittent anesthesia on the patient is entirely doctor-dependent according to symptom severity.\n\n【28】*   Intermittent anesthesia makes the patient communicate with the family, but continuous anesthesia only allows the family to meet but cannot communicate because the patient is asleep.\n\n【29】What Considerations to Be Noted Before the Usage of Anesthesia in Palliative Care?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】In many cases, palliative care with anesthesia is required when other treatment fails to inhibit the symptoms. But before giving anesthesia, a few considerations regarding the patient's health are noted. It includes:\n\n【31】*   All medical team members should collectively decide, before going for the anesthetic, whether or not they can manage the complications.\n*   If the patient is suffering from intolerable symptoms of pain, vomiting, difficulty in breathing, delirium, etc. make the physician go for an anesthetic.\n\n【32】*   Written consent is essential before the administration of anesthesia. It is a kind of legal agreement doctors have if they are dealing with critical cases of patients, which says conditions can even lead to mortality during treatment—legal action for the doctor's safety from a patient casualty case. Even a consent agreement must state the situation of the patient. Using the anesthetic in such an illness can even lead to risks to the patient's life. The patient should be fully conscious while going through the agreement and should not be pressured to sign the consent. In an emergency, the patient's caregivers should sign the consent by fully acknowledging the severity of the patient's condition.\n\n【33】What Are the Anesthetics Used in Palliative Care?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】There are many anesthetic agents used in palliative care. The most commonly used are:\n\n【35】*   **Opioids** - These agents relieve pain by acting on the central nervous system and inducing drowsiness.\n\n【36】*   **Benzodiazepines** \\- They also act on the brain's central nervous system to overcome anxiety and seizure symptoms. Midazolam is most often used in palliative care treatment because of its rapid onset and short duration of action. It is mainly used in delirium cases and difficulty breathing patients.\n\n【37】What Intraoperative Care Is Taken During Anesthesia Administration?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Anesthesia is primarily given in the hospital by the doctor. However, it can also be delivered in a home care environment. The doctor should prepare the initial dose very appropriately to manage the symptoms. It can be given intravenously or by any other means depending on the requirement, continuous or intermittent. The patient being treated is monitored every time. However, the patient's condition decides whether to monitor vital signs, if the patient is at end-of-life, only respiratory rate is seen, and near-to-end-of-life patient blood pressure and oxygen are measured. Fluids during this time are not usually advised as this can cause congestion, so little drinking is advised or given by feeding tubes to the patient.\n\n【39】Is Palliative Anesthesia Beneficial or Not?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Palliative anesthesia is used when the patient is near-to-end-of-life or at the end of life when nothing goes on to treat the patient's symptoms, making the condition severe to handle. Anesthesia during that period relieves the symptoms, and drowsiness makes the patient sleep a lot. The patient's case becomes painful due to decreased appetite. Few studies have shown that patients live for a week or more but hardly cross the month due to severity. So, palliative anesthesia has been shown to shorten the life of patients. However, it does benefit the patient by relieving him of the ongoing symptoms and lands him at risk of mortality.\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】Palliative care anesthesia is required when nothing goes on for withdrawal of the symptoms like difficulty in breathing and pain. In severely ill patients, the doctor uses palliative anesthesia to reduce the symptoms and relax the patient. The patient is given palliative anesthesia after informing and taking consent. However, it relieves the patient's signs but leads the patient to dangerous complications of mortality.\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   General anaesthesia in end-of-life care: extending the indications for anaesthesia beyond surgery  \n    https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/anae.15459\n*   Palliative Care Principles and Anesthesiology Clinical Practice: Current Perspectives  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8486274/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "469b9a68-5992-4ba4-8a89-448104872ea8", "title": "Dermatitis Herpetiformis", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Dermatitis herpetiformis is also called Duhring-Brocq disease. It is characterized by an intensely itchy, chronic papulovesicular eruption usually distributed symmetrically on the extensor surfaces. After its presentation, the condition persists indefinitely in varying severity. The prevalence varies from 10 to 39 per 100,000 persons.\n\n【2】Who Can Get Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Dermatitis herpetiformis occurs more commonly in males than females in the ratio of 2:1 and second, third, or fourth decades. There may be a family history of autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, Addison disease, and alopecia. Genetic predisposition with human leucocyte antigen is also found.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. IgA (Immunoglobulin A) antibodies formed against this protein in the predisposed individuals are thought to cross-react with certain antigens of the dermal-epidermal junction leading to the clinical expression of the disease. Most patients with this condition probably have some gastrointestinal abnormality such as diarrhea, weight loss, tiredness, and abdominal discomfort similar to celiac disease. The patients with coeliac disease have concurrent dermatitis herpetiformis and tend to have more intestinal pathology.\n\n【6】What Are the Clinical Features of Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Dermatitis herpetiformis is either an erythematous papule such as an urticaria\\-like plaque or, most commonly, a vesicle. It initially appears as petechiae which progresses further to form papular lesions.\n\n【8】*   The patchy lesion can sometimes resemble lesions of other inflammatory skin conditions such as dermatitis, scabies, etc.\n\n【9】*   The lesions are usually itchy and located symmetrically on the elbows, knees, shoulders, lower back, and buttocks.\n\n【10】*   The face and facial hairline may also be involved.\n\n【11】*   They often appear in clusters, and large bulla is infrequent.\n\n【12】*   The lesion resolves and leaves post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.\n\n【13】What Are the Complications of Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】**In Gastrointestinal Tract:-**\n\n【15】*   Steatorrhea (excess stool fat) and D-xylose malabsorption are observed in 20% to 33% of patients.\n\n【16】*   Iron and folate malabsorption leading to anemia is rare.\n\n【17】*   DH patients also have an increased incidence of achlorhydria (absence of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions) and atrophic gastritis (inflammation of gastric mucosa).\n\n【18】**Malignancy:** There is an increased frequency of gastrointestinal lymphomas and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in dermatitis herpetiformis patients.\n\n【19】**Neurological Problems:** They can have ataxia (loss of balance), epilepsy (seizures), and polyneuropathy (damage to the peripheral nerves).\n\n【20】**Heart Problems:** Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) and pericarditis(inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart) can occur.\n\n【21】**Autoimmune Diseases:-**\n\n【22】These patients also have a high incidence of autoimmune diseases such as,\n\n【23】*   Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n【24】*   Autoimmune thyroid disease.\n\n【25】*   Pernicious anemia.\n\n【26】*   Addison's disease.\n\n【27】*   Lupus erythematosus.\n\n【28】*   Vitiligo.\n\n【29】*   Myasthenia gravis (weakness of voluntary muscles).\n\n【30】*   Scleroderma (chronic hardening and tightening of the connective tissues and skin).\n\n【31】*   Sarcoidosis.\n\n【32】How to Diagnose Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   **Skin Biopsy:** A skin biopsy is a confirmatory test for diagnosing dermatitis herpetiformis. The histologic features include:\n\n【34】*   Subepidermal blisters.\n\n【35】*   Neutrophils and eosinophils are present in the dermal layer.\n\n【36】*   Ig A deposits are visible in the dermal layer through direct immunofluorescence.\n\n【37】*   **Tests for Nutritional Deficiencies:** Patients with coeliac disease are screened for nutritional deficiencies with the tests such as complete blood count, iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, folate levels, serum calcium levels, thyroid function tests, and liver function tests. Iron and folic acid levels are evaluated as mild anemia are possible due to malabsorption associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. And thyroid function tests are recommended as thyroid diseases and dermatitis herpetiformis are associated with each other.\n\n【38】*   **Autoantibody Tests:** The specific tests include IgA anti-endosomal antibodies, IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody, IgA and IgG (Immunoglobulin G) gliadin assay, and total IgA level.\n\n【39】*   **Small Intestinal Biopsy:** The patients showing abnormal results in blood tests are subjected to intestinal biopsy to confirm gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The histology shows atrophy of the bowel, which indicates the flattening of the intestinal lining.\n\n【40】How to Treat Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】*   **Dapsone:** It is the drug of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis in the usual 100 to 150 mg daily. Occasionally, patients will require double this dose. There is prompt relief of symptoms, and no new lesions erupt after one to two days of therapy. However, the patients must be on a minimal dose of Dapsone (sometimes as little as 25 mg on alternate days) because the disease activity increases sharply on cessation of treatment. If the patient is allergic or intolerant to Dapsone, ultra-potent topical steroids, systemic steroids, Sulfapyridine, and Rituximab can be taken.\n\n【42】*   **Gluten-free Diet:** The intestinal lesions respond well to a gluten-free diet. Strict adherence to this diet will reduce the requirement for medication in most patients. It further improves gluten-sensitive enteropathy, nutrition, and bone density. In addition, the diet reduces the risk of developing autoimmune diseases. However, highly motivated individuals can adhere to this diet. Thus, do not take itchiness lightly, as it is common in most skin diseases.\n\n【43】How Long Will a Person Have Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Dermatitis herpetiformis can persist lifelong unless diet modification is established.\n\n【45】Is Dermatitis Herpetiformis Contagious?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【46】Dermatitis herpetiformis is non-contagious like any other type of dermatitis. It cannot spread from one person to another.\n\n【47】When to Consult a Healthcare Provider for Dermatitis Herpetiformis?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】If you feel any symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, it is good to report to the healthcare provider immediately. The itchy feeling of the condition can affect the quality of life. Try consulting a dermatologist initially who would recommend you some diagnostic tests. And if you have a nutritional deficiency, the nutritionist will follow you up. Getting identified and treated earlier is the best choice.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Living with visible bumps and blisters is more complex than adapting to a new diet. Therefore, whenever you get tempted by your favorite food, remember it is worth avoiding them than suffering from those itchy blisters. And do not modify your diet and take medicines on your own. Consult the specialist and take necessary precautions with their consent. Stay gluten-free, stay dermatitis herpetiformis-free.\n\n【51】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【52】* * *\n\n【53】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Appearance of Herpetiformis Dermatitis?**\n\n【54】Herpetiformis dermatitis appears like clusters of itchy bumps that may appear similar to eczema or acne. It is characterized by clustered vesicles and papules that erupt symmetrically on the knees, elbows, back, buttocks, scalp, or back. It may be associated with a burning sensation.\n\n【55】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Dermatitis Herpetiformis Curable?**\n\n【56】There is no cure for dermatitis herpetiformis. Medications can help in healing the rash associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. The bumps and itching may subside within one to three days.\n\n【57】#### **3.**删除换行**Does Dermatitis Herpetiformis Spread From One Person to Another?**\n\n【58】It spreads from one person to another by direct skin contact. The disease is usually rare and is associated with long-term skin problems. A person may get dermatitis herpetiformis when the body is sensitive to gluten.\n\n【59】#### **4.**删除换行**Can a Person Have Dermatitis Herpetiformis Without Celiac Disease?**\n\n【60】Most people with dermatitis herpetiformis are sensitive to gluten and develop celiac disease. In some people without celiac disease, gluten can cause allergy-like reactions that include itchy rashes called dermatitis herpetiformis.\n\n【61】#### **5.**删除换行**Is Dermatitis Considered an Autoimmune Disease?**\n\n【62】Dermatitis herpetiformis is considered one of the autoimmune diseases that is triggered by eating gluten. It most commonly causes blistering, itching, and burning rash. Males are commonly affected by this disease, and it commonly occurs in the age group of 30 years.\n\n【63】#### **6.**删除换行**Where Does Initiation of Dermatitis Herpetiformis Happen?**\n\n【64】Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by clustered vesicles and papules that can start from any of the areas like the scalp, back, knees, elbow, and buttocks.

This disease has claimed the life of more than 45 children so far. These deaths have been caused due to low blood sugar levels in the body. To know how low blood sugar level, AES, and deaths are related, let us understand more about this condition.\n\n【1】What Is Acute Encephalitis Syndrome?\n------------------------------------\n\n【2】Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a group of neurological disorders, that affects the brain and limbs, and caused by viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, or chemical toxins. Inflammation of the brain tissue is called encephalitis. It is commonly seen in children younger than 15 years. The outbreak of this disease is common during monsoon. The causative organism varies depending on the season and geographical variation.\n\n【3】What Is the Most Common Cause of AES?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】The cause of AES is not clearly understood as it is a very complex condition. It is known to be caused by many factors and microorganisms like viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, environmental chemicals, or it can be autoimmune.\n\n【5】Viruses are known to cause most cases of AES. The common viruses include:\n\n【6】*   Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus.\n\n【7】*   West Nile encephalitis virus.\n\n【8】*   Tick-borne encephalitis.\n\n【9】*   Measles.\n\n【10】*   Nipah virus.\n\n【11】*   Zika virus.\n\n【12】*   Herpes simplex virus (HSV).\n\n【13】*   EBV (Ebstein-Barr virus).\n\n【14】*   Mumps.\n\n【15】How Does AES Spread?\n--------------------\n\n【16】The virus is spread through drinking or eating contaminated water and food. The JE virus spreads through the bite of an infected mosquito. AES commonly spreads during monsoon. It can also spread from person-to-person contact if it is caused by just viruses that can spread through personal contact.\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of AES?\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】The disease spreads rapidly and affects the cells in the brain. The symptoms include:\n\n【19】*   High fever (above 103 ℉).\n\n【20】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【21】*   Mental confusion.\n\n【22】*   Hallucinations.\n\n【23】*   Light sensitivity.\n\n【24】*   Unconsciousness.\n\n【25】*   Irritability.\n\n【26】*   Coma.\n\n【27】*   Seizures.\n\n【28】What Are the Signs of AES to Look for in Infants?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Signs in infants are:\n\n【30】*   Vomiting.\n\n【31】*   Bulging of the soft spot on the head (fontanel).\n\n【32】*   Body stiffness.\n\n【33】*   Crying continuously.\n\n【34】*   Not taking feeds properly.\n\n【35】Who Is at Risk?\n---------------\n\n【36】AES generally affects children in rural areas. It is mainly due to malnourishment and low blood sugar levels. This results in poor immunity and the condition progresses rapidly, leading to death.\n\n【37】How Is AES Treated?\n-------------------\n\n【38】As it is caused by a viral or bacterial infection, antivirals or antibiotics are used. Fever and seizures are managed with medicines. Steroids and anti-inflammatory medications are used to reduce pain and other symptoms.\n\n【39】Prognosis is good if the disease is caught in the early stage.\n\n【40】How Can AES Be Prevented?\n-------------------------\n\n【41】It can be prevented by:\n\n【42】*   Get your child vaccinated for all childhood viral infections.\n\n【43】*   Keep your vicinity clean to stop the breeding of mosquitoes.\n\n【44】*   Drink a lot of water to flush out toxins from the body.\n\n【45】*   Eat healthily.\n\n【46】*   Practice good hygiene.\n\n【47】*   Consume fruits and vegetables after washing them thoroughly.\n\n【48】What Are the Complications of AES?\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】The complications include:\n\n【50】*   Memory loss.\n\n【51】*   Changes in personality.\n\n【52】*   Fatigue.\n\n【53】*   Vision problems.\n\n【54】*   Epilepsy.\n\n【55】*   Difficulty hearing.\n\n【56】*   Difficulty speaking.\n\n【57】*   Coma.\n\n【58】*   Breathing becomes difficult.\n\n【59】*   Death.\n\n【60】Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in India:\n-------------------------------------\n\n【61】The recent outbreak in India is believed to be due to children consuming unripe or rotten lychee fruit. Consuming lychee is not directly linked to death and AES. Animal experiments have shown that methylene cyclopropyl glycine (MCPG), a toxin present in lychee causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The kids who died are believed to be suffering from AES and hypoglycemia (as they are malnourished and skip meals), which on consuming lychee made the blood sugar levels drop to fatal levels, resulting in coma and death.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Cyclosporine is categorized under immunosuppressants.\n\n【2】Cyclosporine has been used to treat certain eye conditions like keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dryness of conjunctiva and cornea) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (an allergic eye condition). It increases tear production in the eye during these keratoconjunctivitis conditions, which causes dry eyes.\n\n【3】What Are Dry Eyes?\n------------------\n\n【4】A dry eye is a multifactorial condition that occurs when tears cannot lubricate the eyes and are not adequate and stable. Many reasons can cause dry eyes. Dry eyes can cause damage to the eye surface. In the United States, dry eyes have affected five to thirty percent of the population. Dry eyes affect the quality of life, and their symptoms impair daily activities such as driving, reading, or watching television.\n\n【5】**Symptoms of Dry Eyes:**\n\n【6】*   A burning or scratching sensation in the eye.\n\n【7】*   Stringy mucus around the eyes.\n\n【8】*   Redness of the eye.\n\n【9】*   Sensitivity to light.\n\n【10】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【11】*   Watery eyes.\n\n【12】**Causes of Dry Eyes:**\n\n【13】*   Tear film dysfunctioning can be due to hormone changes, autoimmune diseases, inflamed eyelids, and allergic eye disease.\n\n【14】*   Decreased tear production related to aging, Sjogren's syndrome, or other conditions like lupus and scleroderma or any medications leading to decreased tears.\n\n【15】*   Increased tear evaporation can occur related to vitamin A deficiency and less blinking.\n\n【16】How Does Cyclosporine Emulsion Work for Dry Eyes?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The ophthalmic Cyclosporine increases tear production by decreasing eye infection and swelling to allow the tear to produce.\n\n【18】**Mechanism of Action of Cyclosporine:**\n\n【19】Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant medication. It affects the immune system by interfering with the production of T-cells. Cyclosporine enters the cytoplasm of the T-cells and binds to Cyclophilin. The binding complex of Cyclosporine affects T-cells by blocking the action of Calcineurin and preventing de-phosphorylation. It also affects the mitochondria and epithelial cell death by blocking mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Cyclosporine also activates the Fas/FasL and caspase.\n\n【20】**Dosage:**\n\n【21】**Dosage Form** - Solution and emulsion.\n\n【22】**Dose Strength** - 0.05 milligram per milliliter.\n\n【23】*   Single-use vials - Each vial contains 0.4 milliliters of Cyclosporine.\n\n【24】*   Multidose vials - Each bottle contains 5.5 milliliters of Cyclosporine.\n\n【25】**Dose Restriction** \\- Cyclosporine should be instilled in each eye twice daily (after every 12 hours).\n\n【26】**Special Considerations:**\n\n【27】*   **Allergies** \\- The patient should always inform the doctor about allergies, if any. Allergies to food items, dyes, preservatives, or animals are involved in it.\n\n【28】*   **Pediatrics** \\- The safety and efficacy of Cyclosporine are not established in children below the age of four.\n\n【29】*   **Geriatric** \\- Safety and efficacy have not been established in older people. The medical conditions have varied the results.\n\n【30】*   **Breastfeeding Mothers** \\- No relevant results determine infants' risks while using Cyclosporine in breastfeeding mothers.\n\n【31】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【32】**What Are Cyclosporines?**\n---------------------------\n\n【33】Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant medicine that comes in the form of eye drops used to increase tear production by decreasing the inflammation of the eye.\n\n【34】What Is the Use of Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion is primarily used to treat dry eyes. Dry eyes can be due to lower tear production or some other conditions like Sjogren syndrome or medications. This medicine increases the production of tears and hence lowers the inflammation and swelling of the eye.\n\n【36】**How Is This Medicine Used?**\n------------------------------\n\n【37】The ophthalmic eye drops of Cyclosporine come in solution or emulsion forms. A solution is a liquid, and an emulsion combines two unmixed liquids. The medicine is to be instilled in each eye twice a day. The timings of instilling the eye drops in the eyes should be the same every day. The instructions given by the doctor should be followed, and do not use more or less medicine; use as much as recommended by the doctor.\n\n【38】How to Instill Medicine to the Eye?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【39】There are a few steps to delivering the medicine into the eye. They are as follows:\n\n【40】*   Wash the hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n\n【41】*   Follow the instructions given above the package.\n\n【42】*   When using an emulsion form, turn over the bottle until the liquid inside looks white.\n\n【43】*   Remove the cap of the bottle.\n\n【44】*   Do not touch the dropper tip against the eye.\n\n【45】*   Tilt the head back and pull the lower eyelid with the index finger to form the pocket of the eyelid.\n\n【46】*   Hold the dropper with the other hand and keep it near the eye without touching it.\n\n【47】*   Look up and subsequently squeeze the dropper over the stretched lower eyelid.\n\n【48】*   The patient should close their eyes for two to three minutes.\n\n【49】*   Do not blink the eye or squeeze the eyelids.\n\n【50】*   Place pressure over the inner eyelid junction near the nose.\n\n【51】*   Wipe out the extra liquid from the face and then wash the hands.\n\n【52】**What Are the Important Points While Using Cyclosporine?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Use the exact amount of dose as recommended by the doctor.\n\n【54】*   It is exclusively for eye use only.\n\n【55】*   Do not swallow or apply it to the skin.\n\n【56】*   Do not touch the dropper to the eye.\n\n【57】*   If eye lubricant or artificial tear is used, then use it 15 minutes before or after Cyclosporine.\n\n【58】*   It should not be delivered while the lens is still inserted in the eyes.\n\n【59】*   Please keep it away from the children and pets.\n\n【60】**What Should a Doctor Know Before Prescribing Cyclosporine?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】Inform the doctor before the doctor recommends Cyclosporine:\n\n【62】*   If the patient is allergic to Cyclosporine.\n\n【63】*   If the patient is planning for pregnancy or pregnant.\n\n【64】*   If the patient is breastfeeding the child.\n\n【65】*   If the patient is suffering from any medical conditions.\n\n【66】*   If the patient is taking any medications or vitamins.\n\n【67】*   If the patient is an alcoholic or tobacco chewer or inhaler.\n\n【68】What Diet Should Patients Follow While Taking Medicine?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【69】There is no special diet required. The patient can continue with a regular diet. However, if the doctor recommends a supplement diet, the patient should have it.\n\n【70】**When to Take Missed Dose?**\n-----------------------------\n\n【71】Instill the missed dose as soon as remembered. However, if the time is near the following amount, skip the missed dose and have the next dose. Do not double the dose.\n\n【72】**What Should Patients Do in case of an Overdose of Cyclosporine?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【73】Although it is not so dangerous to overdose on Cyclosporine, do not take it unnecessarily or intentionally; instead, use the recommended dosage as suggested by the doctor.\n\n【74】What Are the Side Effects of Cyclosporine?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【75】Side effects of Cyclosporine are:\n\n【76】*   Burning.\n\n【77】*   Itchiness.\n\n【78】*   Redness.\n\n【79】*   Pain in the eye.\n\n【80】*   Eyelid swelling.\n\n【81】*   Eye discharge.\n\n【82】*   Headache.\n\n【83】*   Feeling that something is present in the eye.\n\n【84】Severe side effects that require immediate doctor attention are:\n\n【85】*   Itching.\n\n【86】*   Face, throat, eye, and tongue swelling.\n\n【87】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【88】**How to Store and Dispose of the Medicine?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【89】The storage of medication should be in a closely tight container. It is stored at room temperature, away from excess heat and moisture. Place the container away from the children. It is very important to keep it away from children and pets.\n\n【90】The unrequited medicine is disposed of in special ways so that others cannot consume it unknowingly. The take-back programs are the best way to dispose of the medicine, instead of disposing of it in the garbage or flushing it in the toilet.\n\n【91】For Doctors:\n------------\n\n【92】**Formulation of Cyclosporine:**\n\n【93】*   Cyclosporine is poorly soluble in water.\n\n【94】*   Its ophthalmic Cyclosporine is formed by a homogenous emulsion of glycerin (2.2 percent), castor oil (1.25 percent), polysorbate 80 (1.00 percent), carbomer copolymer type A (0.05), purified water, and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment.\n\n【95】*   Cyclosporine is not found in the blood after it has been treated in the patients. A few patients who have delivered one percent are detected with a lesser blood concentration in the body.\n\n【96】**Mechanism of Cyclosporine:**\n\n【97】Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant medication. It affects the immune system by interfering with the production of T-cells. Cyclosporine enters the cytoplasm of the T-cells and binds to cyclophilin. The binding complex of Cyclosporine affects T-cells by blocking the action of calcineurin and preventing de-phosphorylation. It also affects the mitochondria and epithelial cell death by blocking mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Cyclosporine also activates the Fas/FasL and caspase.\n\n【98】**Indication of Cyclosporine:**\n\n【99】The indication of Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion is to increase tear production in patients with dry eye conditions. It is an immunosuppressant.\n\n【100】**How to Use Cyclosporine?**\n\n【101】Steps to use Cyclosporine\n\n【102】*   First, wash your hands properly.\n\n【103】*   Rotate the bottle of vials gently, do not shake it.\n\n【104】*   Open the eye by stretching the lower eyelid gently with index fingers to make a space.\n\n【105】*   Drop the medicine into the space without touching the dropper tip.\n\n【106】*   Do not blink; instead, close your eyes gently.\n\n【107】*   Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands.\n\n【108】*   If the patient is using the artificial tear (lubricant eye drops), after putting the artificial tears, make the patient wait for 15 minutes before putting the Cyclosporine eye drops into the eyes.\n\n【109】**Dosing:**\n\n【110】The dose of the medicine will be different for different patients. The single vial dose is given once a day. In contrast, the multi-vial is offered twice a day.\n\n【111】The amount of the medicine depends upon the strength of the treatment.\n\n【112】The number of doses taken in a day, the time allowed between the doses, and the length of the time taken for a medicine depend upon the patient's medical condition for which Cyclosporine is recommended.\n\n【113】**To Increase Tear Production:**\n\n【114】*   **For Ophthalmic Emulsion Dosage:**\n\n【115】Adults and children under 16 and older are recommended one drop in the affected eye twice a day every 12 hours.\n\n【116】*   **For Ophthalmic Solution Dosage Form:**\n\n【117】Adults are recommended one drop in the affected eye twice a day, and the doctor decides the children's dose.\n\n【118】**To Treat Keratoconjunctivitis:**\n\n【119】*   **For Ophthalmic Emulsion Dosage:**\n\n【120】Adults and children four years of age and older are recommended one drop in the affected eye four times a day means morning, noon, afternoon, and evening.\n\n【121】The doctor decides on children's doses under age four.\n\n【122】**Precautions While Using Cyclosporine:**\n\n【123】*   Avoid wearing contact lenses while using the medicine.

They are:\n\n【128】*   Betaxolol ophthalmic.\n\n【129】*   Carteolol ophthalmic.\n\n【130】*   Dexamethasone ophthalmic.\n\n【131】*   Difluprednate ophthalmic.\n\n【132】*   Fluocinolone ophthalmic.\n\n【133】*   Levobetaxolol ophthalmic.\n\n【134】*   Levobunolol ophthalmic.\n\n【135】*   Prednisolone ophthalmic.\n\n【136】*   Medrydone ophthalmic.\n\n【137】*   Timolol ophthalmic.\n\n【138】*   Triamcinolone ophthalmic.\n\n【139】*   Rimexolone ophthalmic.\n\n【140】**Contraindication of Cyclosporine:**\n\n【141】*   **Hypersensitivity** \\- If the patient suffers from any hypersensitivity reaction, the doctor should not recommend Cyclosporine.\n\n【142】**Special Considerations -**\n\n【143】*   **Allergies**\\- If the patient has any allergies, they can be related to food, dye, or medicine. The doctor should know it before he recommends Cyclosporine.\n\n【144】*   **Pediatric Patients** \\- Children below the age of 16 are not recommended for Cyclosporine, as no data or results have been determined in children below 16.\n\n【145】*   **Geriatric Patients** - In the older population, Cyclosporine can not show useful results as in others because of the medical conditions of the older people.\n\n【146】*   **Pregnancy** - No data and results were established in pregnant women related to Cyclosporine.\n\n【147】*   **Breastfeeding Mothers**\\- The results on breastfeeding mothers related to Cyclosporine are not evaluated. The risks associated with infants are unknown.\n\n【148】**Clinical Studies of Cyclosporine for Dry Eyes:**\n\n【149】1.  **Cyclosporine for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dry Eyes:** Survey study with 5884 patients with a controlled group with one-third reported decreased symptom severity by one week and two-thirds by three weeks. There were improvements in the objectives and subjective metrics. The use of emulsion has shown uniform superiority to vehicles in improving two signs of corneal staining and dry eyes—Schirmer scores in randomized vehicle-controlled trials, with three out of four studies using emulsion placebo. In vehicle studies, Cyclosporine was better than vehicle control, improving ocular dryness. Taking an average of the particular symptom or sign that improved was not consistent between the studies. Chen et al. found Cyclosporine emulsion was superior with improved ocular dryness, total dry eye score, foreign body sensation, Schirmer scoring, and corneal staining. Baiza-Duran et al. presented aqueous Cyclosporine was superior with improvement to ocular dryness, photophobia, and ocular fatigue. Sall et al. found Cyclosporine emulsion to improve blurry vision only. Stevenson et al. compared various Cyclosporine emulsion concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 percent) to the vehicle and found the highest concentration, 0.4 percent, superior to the Schirmer scores. All Cyclosporine concentrations, when compared to vehicles, were fine with respect to gritty sensation, and most (0.05, 0.02, 0.4 percent) improved ocular dryness. On seeing the Cyclosporine efficacy over the dry eye treatments, Cyclosporine emulsion worked the same as vitamin A in the dry eye population. Cyclosporine has improved the symptoms in other populations with aqueous-based Cyclosporine suspensions to aqueous vehicles.\n\n【150】2.  **Cyclosporine for the Treatment of Severe Dry Eye:** Cyclosporine efficacy was evaluated in severely dry eye conditions like Sjogren syndrome radiation-associated, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma, and graft versus host disease. Dastjerdi et al. presented 22 patients with severe dry eye who failed to improve after twice dosing. Among them, 15 patients showed improvements with frequent dosing (three to four times daily). One hundred eighty-three patients improved 0.1 percent aqueous Cyclosporine by more than 0.05 percent aqueous Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine emulsion showed decreased dry eye symptoms.\n\n【151】3.  **Cyclosporine for the Treatment of Post-refractive Surgery and Contact Lens-Associated Dry Eyes:** Two studies have been performed on the effects of Cyclosporine emulsion after refractive surgery. A retrospective study of 40 patients showed faster baseline symptoms in Cyclosporine emulsion-treated eyes. Prospective study of 21 patients with better results in the Cyclosporine emulsion-treated group. The contact lens study showed positive results of Cyclosporine emulsion with improved symptoms.\n\n【152】4.  **Long-Term Effects of Cyclosporine Emulsion 0.05 for Dry Eye Treatment:** Study conducted in patients treated with Cyclosporine emulsion for one year. It demonstrated the maintenance of effects with the once-daily dosing after stable treatment with twice-daily dosing for one year. In eight patients, it was reported that long-term resolution of chronic dry eye symptoms after long-term Cyclosporine use.\n\n【153】5.  **Cyclosporine Has Higher Doses for Treating Dry Eye:** Although 0.1 percent of Cyclosporine is found safe for long-term use. The effectiveness is 0.05 and 0.1 percent doses. The studies favor the 0.05 dose by a randomized controlled study using Cyclosporine emulsion, which says 0.05 is significantly better than 0.1 percent for even the control of blurry visions. However, some studies find no differences between randomized controlled studies using various Cyclosporine emulsions concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 percent). They report that 0.1 percent of Cyclosporine performs most consistently overall, while 0.05 percent of Cyclosporine showed the most consistent symptom improvement.\n\n【154】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【155】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cyclosporine Ophthalmic  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a604009.html\n*   Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsions for the treatment of dry eye: a review of the clinical evidence  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420022/\n*   Safety and efficacy of cyclosporine 0.05% drops versus unpreserved artificial tears in dry-eye patients having laser in situ keratomileusis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16765793/\n*   Restasis (cyclosporine) ophthalmic label  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2012/050790s020lbl.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is considered the best option in severe grade III and grade IV stenosis that is clear of the vocal cords. Over the last 30 years, pediatric airway construction has been fast-growing, and there has been an increase in cases of subglottic stenosis. CTR is an alternative subglottic stenosis technique used for adults.\n\n【2】CTR is a technique that involves resection of the anterior cricoid arch and thinning of the posterior cricoid plate, along with preserving the posterior mucosal flap. The resected normal trachea is telescoped into the posterior cricoid plate. Then joined with a mucosal flap and thyroid cartilage. CTR is more challenging than the expansion laryngotracheal reconstruction ( LTR). This procedure is done to remove the stenotic portion. Care should be taken to avoid any injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during the procedure. Conley first reported CTR for the treatment of SGS in an adult in 1953.\n\n【3】What Are the Indications for Cricotracheal Resection?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Many clinical situations need to be treated with CTR. Indications include the following:\n\n【5】*   Individuals with severe and high-grade SGS.\n\n【6】*   Individuals with less grade SGS where the cartilage of the affected area has less structural integrity.\n\n【7】*   When there is an airway obstruction due to the collapse of the subglottic and proximal walls of the trachea.\n\n【8】*   When lateral subglottic and tracheal walls are not sturdy enough to support the graft placed during the procedure called LTR.\n\n【9】*   When an area of SGS is attached to the area of the supra-stomal collapse of the anterior tracheal wall, this weakens the cartilage strength and affects the anteroposterior lumen dimension.\n\n【10】*   When there is a failure of LTR, CTR is indicated.\n\n【11】What Are the Contraindications for Cricotracheal Resection?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The position and length of stenosis are important to be considered in conducting the procedure called CTR. The selection of an individual for CTR depends on the proximity of the stenosis to the vocal folds and the risk of resecting the stenosis without causing injury to the vocal cords.\n\n【13】A distance of two to three mm from stenosis to vocal cords must be present for CTR.\n\n【14】Contraindications include the presence of:\n\n【15】*   When SGS extends into the anterior two-thirds of the vocal cords.\n\n【16】*   When lengthy stenosis of almost 40 % to 50 % is present in the trachea.\n\n【17】*   When uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux is present.\n\n【18】*   When uncontrolled eosinophilic esophagitis is present.\n\n【19】*   When Down syndrome is present.\n\n【20】*   When untreated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization is present.\n\n【21】*   Individuals with a history of previous distal tracheal surgery.\n\n【22】When the scar is present in the posterior glottis and CTR, posterior cricoid split and cartilage graft may be used. LTR is used as a preferred procedure when CTR is contraindicated.\n\n【23】How Is Cricotracheal Resection Performed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【24】Stenosis is a challenging problem even today. CTR is a newer option with minimal complications after the procedure and provides long-term results. This procedure is performed under the following steps.\n\n【25】**1\\. Preoperative Planning or Surgical Planning:** To decide whether CTR will be conducted at a single or two-stage procedure. Single-stage procedure: In this procedure, the individual is decannulated intraoperatively without tracheostomy. Two-stage procedure: Reconstruction is done over a supra-stomal stent or around a T tube. The single-stage procedure is preferred over the two-stage procedure. In case of multiple airway obstructions, individuals with poor cardiopulmonary status, and those undergoing another airway procedure along with CTR, a two-stage procedure is done and also called extended CTR.\n\n【26】**2\\. Technique:** CTR is a surgery to remove a narrow part of the trachea (windpipe) just below the voice box ( larynx). CTR is done to remove a stenotic portion of the trachea.\n\n【27】*   Directly cutting into the stenosis is done to open the airway, thereby minimizing the amount of trachea resected.\n\n【28】*   At the distal end of the divided trachea, stenosis is removed. Stay sutures are placed on both sides at the membranous and cartilaginous portions.\n\n【29】*   The anterior third cricoid cartilage is resected at the other end (proximal). Then the stenotic portion of the trachea is removed. The posterior wall of the cricoid cartilage is thinned up to 40 % of its thickness.\n\n【30】*   The stay suture is given from the distal to the proximal aspect of the trachea through the mucosa and cricoid cartilage.\n\n【31】*   The posterior wall is anastomosed using a running suture.\n\n【32】*   The stay sutures should be given before the posterior wall anastomosis ( joining).\n\n【33】*   Edges of the trachea are brought together, and tightening is done with posterior wall anastomosis.\n\n【34】*   Interrupted sutures are placed at the anterior wall anastomosis. The T-tube is placed for airway support.\n\n【35】*   The upper limb of the T-tube is placed above the vocal cords.\n\n【36】*   For the sidearm of the T-tube, tracheostomy is done in the distal trachea.\n\n【37】Two weeks are required to recover after surgery. This is a very successful treatment and has excellent long-term results.\n\n【38】What Are the Complications of Cricotracheal Resection?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Complications of Cricotracheal resection are:\n\n【40】*   **Post-operative Laryngeal Edema:** It is generally seen after one to two weeks of the procedure.\n\n【41】*   **Occurrence of Restenosis:** Generally seen among 10 % of individuals who underwent the procedure. Early restenosis is treated with an endoscopically placed balloon dilation.\n\n【42】*   **The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve May Get Injured With Vocal Cord Paralysis:** This occurs in two percent of individuals who underwent the procedure. It occurs during the posterolateral dissection of the airway.\n\n【43】*   **Bursting Open of Anastomosis:** It is rare but a serious complication that needs immediate diagnosis. Intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube is used to treat this condition.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】In a nutshell, an alternative method for treating SGS is Cricotracheal resection, which involves removing a stenotic section of the trachea near the larynx and understanding its indications, contraindications, and complications can facilitate seeking prompt medical attention. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment, and while CTR is a more complex technique compared to Expansion LTR, it can also yield outstanding long-term outcomes when used for severe cases of SGS.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cricotracheal resection  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18775346/\n*   Tracheal Resection  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563234/\n*   Prevention and Management of Complications Following Tracheal Resection  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515949/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These variations affect everything from hair color to body shape and size. When we take a look at almost any type of creature, one will notice that there are some pretty big differences between male and female specimens of that species. These anatomical distinctions are referred to as sexual dimorphism in humans. This article will explain exactly what this term means, why it occurs, what happens in human cultures around the world, and whether it has any advantages for individuals or the entire population. Keep reading to learn more about sexual dimorphism in humans and how it affects our species.\n\n【2】What Is Sexual Dimorphism in Humans?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Sexual dimorphism is defined as the differences between male and female organisms biologically within the same species. When scientists refer to sexual dimorphism in humans, they are talking about traits like overall body size, shape and fat distribution, skeletal differences, muscle development, height, and the presence or absence of body hair. While many species exhibit sexual dimorphism, humans are a particularly extreme example, with males being much larger than females across almost all of these traits.\n\n【4】Sexual dimorphism can be thought of as the extreme end of a spectrum that also includes sex differences. In humans, sex differences are the biological variations that occur between males and females. On average male bodies are larger than female bodies and female bodies have more body fat than male bodies. When scientists talk about sexual dimorphism in humans, they are referring to the extreme end of the sex difference spectrum, where males and females look almost completely different from each other.\n\n【5】What Are the Differences in Appearance Between Men and Women?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The main difference in sexual dimorphism between men and women is body size. On average men are taller and heavier when compared to women. The average man is taller than the average woman by 16 percent, and he is also heavier by about 20 percent. Although men are taller and heavier on average, these differences do not apply to every individual man or woman. In fact, studies have shown that adult men are taller than adult women in 99 percent of the world’s cultures. The same is not true for body weight. The majority of cultures show no significant difference in average body weight between adult men and women. In only a few cultures, adult women are, on average, heavier than adult men. Anthropologists who have studied human sexual dimorphism have found that it varies a lot between cultures. There are some cultures in which adult men are, on average, taller than women, while in other cultures, adult women are taller than men. The same variation exists for average body weight. Differences in skin thickness and hair distribution serve to protect males from UV (ultraviolet) solar radiation and females from UV (ultraviolet) solar radiation and cold. Variations in voice pitch and timbre also serve to communicate one’s gender. The differences in sexually dimorphic features are not random or arbitrary; rather, they seem to serve a function. For example, the typical male skeletal structure results in a narrower shoulder-to-hip ratio than the typical female skeletal structure, allowing for greater ease in childbirth.\n\n【7】What Are the Sexual Dimorphism in Facial Features?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Female faces are generally longer and wider than male faces. Female faces also tend to possess a smaller chin and larger eyes relative to male faces. The female trait of having a shorter distance between the eyes and a longer distance between the mouth and chin is likely an indicator of high estrogen and low androgen levels, both of which are associated with high fertility. The male trait of having a long distance between the eyes and a shorter distance between the mouth and chin is likely an indicator of high androgen levels, which are associated with low fertility. Population-wide morphological variation may have an impact on the degree of sexual dimorphism. Because people in small-scale traditional societies encounter fewer different faces and interact socially with potential partners less frequently over the course of their lifetimes.\n\n【9】What Are the Hormonal Reasons for Sexual Dimorphism in Humans?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】There are a number of hormones that could be responsible for sexual dimorphism, including androgens, estrogen, and progesterone. Androgens are the group of male sex hormones which is responsible for male secondary sexual characteristics, are present in both males and females, but in males, they are present in higher concentrations. These higher androgen concentrations in males could be responsible for sexual dimorphism in humans, as androgens cause males to develop thicker skin and more hair. Estrogens are responsible for female secondary sexual characteristics and are also present in males but in lower concentrations. Higher estrogen concentrations in males could be responsible for sexual dimorphism in humans, as estrogens cause males to develop thinner skin and less hair. Progesterone is responsible for sexual dimorphism in humans in two ways. First, progesterone affects the anterior pituitary gland and its hormone production, resulting in higher levels of prolactin (a hormone responsible for milk production) in females and higher levels of testosterone in males. Progesterone also increases the likelihood of sex-related diseases, such as breast cancer in females and prostate cancer in males.\n\n【11】What Are the Cultural Reasons for Sexual Dimorphism in Humans?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Sexual dimorphism may be due to cultural factors, such as how males and females are expected to look within a particular society. Other cultural factors that may be responsible for sexual dimorphism include fashion, socialization practices, and the symbolic meaning associated with specific physical characteristics.\n\n【13】**Conclusion**\n\n【14】Sexual dimorphism generally refers to the differences between the male and female appearance of the same species. It is a common occurrence in nature, with many animals exhibiting strong sexual dimorphism. Humans are no exception, with men and women generally looking different as a result of sexual selection pressure due to mate choice. Sexual dimorphism is not unique to humans, but it is more pronounced in our species than in any other animal. Different human populations exhibit facial dimorphism to varying degrees and in different directions. Studies typically concentrate on adults because sexual dimorphism is still not particularly pronounced before puberty. Overall, the variation in the pattern of facial dimorphism across populations does not appear to be explained by the morphological variability of the face, and the partial explanation offered by sex differences in stature.\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>*   National library of medicines - Substantial but Misunderstood Human Sexual Dimorphism Results Mainly From Sexual Selection on Males and Natural Selection on Females  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9156798/\n*   National library of medicine - How and why patterns of sexual dimorphism in human faces vary across the world  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727579/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3c7d6851-cd1d-49ea-b3f8-6d7f5a814acd", "title": "Ovarian Cysts - Symptoms, Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment", "text": "【0】Ovarian Cysts - Symptoms, Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment\nWhat Is an Ovarian Cyst?\n------------------------\n\n【1】An ovarian cyst, a sac that is filled with fluid, is usually present in or on the surface of the ovary, which is an organ in the female reproductive system. Females have a pair of ovaries that are the size of an almond. One ovary is present on either side of the uterus in the lower abdomen. It is the reservoir of egg cells, and it also produces the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. These egg cells mature into eggs (ova) in the ovaries and are released during each menstrual cycle.\n\n【2】Most women have one or more ovarian cysts at some time. They rarely produce any pain or discomfort. Most of the cysts do not need treatment and disappear in a few months. But, cysts that rupture can result in severe symptoms. It is important to understand the symptoms that might occur due to ovarian cysts, as it will help in getting prompt medical help. Also, regular pelvic exams are a must for all women.\n\n【3】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of an Ovarian Cyst?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Most of the time, an ovarian cyst does not result in symptoms. But if the cyst grows too big, the following symptoms might be experienced:\n\n【5】*   Abdominal swelling or bloating.\n\n【6】*   Severe pelvic pain during periods.\n\n【7】*   Nausea.\n\n【8】*   Vomiting.\n\n【9】*   Pain during bowel movements.\n\n【10】*   Pelvic pain before periods.\n\n【11】*   Pain during sex.\n\n【12】*   Lower back pain.\n\n【13】*   Pain in the thighs.\n\n【14】*   Painful or tender breasts.\n\n【15】When to Consult a Doctor?\n-------------------------\n\n【16】In case you experience sharp and unbearable pelvic pain, fever, feel dizzy, and are short of breath, immediate medical attention is required. A ruptured cyst or a condition called ovarian torsion can result in such symptoms. Failure to get help immediately can result in serious consequences.\n\n【17】What Are the Types of Ovarian Cysts?\n------------------------------------\n\n【18】**The main types of ovarian cysts are:**\n\n【19】1.  Functional Ovarian Cysts - It is the most common type of ovarian cysts seen. They are usually formed during the woman’s normal menstrual cycle, are painless, and usually resolve on their own in weeks. The types of functional ovarian cysts are -\n\n【20】    1.  Follicle Cysts - In the ovaries, the mature egg is released from the ovaries into the fallopian tube for fertilization with sperm. Inside the ovary, the egg is protected by a fluid-filled follicle, which bursts, and the egg is released into the fallopian tube. Sometimes, the follicle does not shrink after it releases the egg, or the egg itself is not released, resulting in a follicular ovarian cyst. They are the most common type of functional ovarian cyst and are usually harmless. It normally disappears within a few weeks.\n\n【21】    2.  Corpus Luteum Cysts - When the egg is released from the ovary, the leftover tissue in the ovary is called corpus luteum. This corpus luteum can fill with blood and result in a luteal cyst or corpus luteum cyst. This cyst takes a few months to disappear and is less common. If this cyst ruptures, it can result in sudden pain and internal bleeding.\n\n【22】2.  Pathological Cysts - Cysts that grow in the ovaries can be harmless or malignant (cancerous).\n\n【23】    1.  Dermoid Cysts - Otherwise called cystic teratomas. It is normally a benign cyst that is formed from the cells that mature into the ovum or eggs. They have to be surgically removed. They are commonly seen in women under 30 years of age.\n\n【24】    2.  Cystadenomas - Ovarian cysts that form from the cells that cover the ovary is called cystadenomas. They do not grow inside the ovary but are attached to the outer layer of the ovary. They are either filled with a mucus-like thick substance or a watery liquid. They can grow big, can be cancerous, and have to be removed surgically. This ovarian cyst is commonly seen in women over the age of 40 years.\n\n【25】    3.  Endometrioma - The membrane that makes the inner layer of the uterus (endometrial tissue) can sometimes grow outside the uterus and get attached to the ovaries (endometriosis). An ovarian cyst that develops from this tissue is called an endometrioma. It results in severe pelvic pain during menstruation and is seen in women in their reproductive years.\n\n【26】**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome:**\n\n【27】Polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS is a common hormonal disorder affecting women in the child-bearing years. Women with this condition have large numbers of small cysts, resulting in enlargement of the ovaries. This condition has to be treated promptly, or it can lead to infertility.\n\n【28】What Are the Risk Factors for an Ovarian Cyst?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】These factors increase your risk of developing an ovarian cyst:\n\n【30】1.  Hormonal imbalance.\n\n【31】2.  Pregnancy.\n\n【32】3.  Pelvic infection.\n\n【33】4.  Previous ovarian cysts\n\n【34】5.  Endometriosis.\n\n【35】What Are the Complications of Ovarian Cysts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The other possible complications include:\n\n【37】1.  Ovarian Torsion - When the ovarian cyst grows big, they push on the ovaries, which increases the risk of the ovaries twisting, called ovarian torsion. It is a painful condition and needs immediate medical help, as it can stop the blood flow to the affected ovary. The symptoms include severe pelvic pain, vomiting, and nausea.\n\n【38】2.  Cyst Rupture - If the ovarian cyst ruptures, it can cause severe pain and internal bleeding. The chances of the cyst rupturing increase as it grows in size. The other risk factors include vigorous exercise and vaginal sex.\n\n【39】3.  Ovarian Cancer - In some very rare cases, ovarian cysts might be an early form of ovarian cancer. It is commonly seen after menopause.\n\n【40】How Is an Ovarian Cyst Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【41】Most of the time, ovarian cysts are found during a routine pelvic examination or accidentally during an abdominal ultrasound. If the doctor notices swelling on your ovaries, you might have to get some of the following tests done:\n\n【42】*   Ultrasound - to confirm the presence of the cyst. Here, high-frequency sound waves are used to get images of the ovaries, uterus, etc. This test helps determine the location, size, and if the cyst is filled with fluid or is solid. There are two types of ultrasound tests available, abdominal (transabdominal) and vaginal (transvaginal). The abdominal ultrasound is taken across the abdomen, and the transvaginal ultrasound is taken through the vagina.\n\n【43】*   CT scan - here, X-rays are used to produce cross-sectional images of the ovaries and cyst.\n\n【44】*   MRI - a test that uses magnetic fields to produce in-depth images of the ovaries.\n\n【45】As most cysts disappear within a few weeks or months, the doctor might not treat them immediately. Instead, you will be asked to get another ultrasound test after a few weeks or months. If the cyst is still present or has increased in size, then the doctor will suggest you perform the following tests to determine the cause:\n\n【46】1.  Pregnancy test - As luteal cysts are commonly seen during pregnancy, and the doctor will check if you are pregnant.\n\n【47】2.  Hormone levels.\n\n【48】3.  CA-125 blood test - The protein, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), is elevated in women who have ovarian cancer.\n\n【49】What Are the Treatment Modalities for Ovarian Cysts?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】In most women, the doctor will ask the patient to wait and get re-examined in a few weeks or a month to see if the cyst goes away on its own, in case you do not have symptoms. If you have symptoms, then depending on your age, the size of the cyst, and its location, the treatment options include:\n\n【51】1) Hormonal Contraceptives - Birth control pills are prescribed if you have recurrent ovarian cysts. These pills will not shrink the cysts that you already have, but they will prevent cysts from recurring.\n\n【52】2) Surgery - Cysts that are growing in size, causing symptoms, and do not look like functional cysts are removed surgically.\n\n【53】*   Ovarian Cystectomy - If it is possible, the surgeon will remove the cyst alone without removing the ovary.\n\n【54】*   Oophorectomy - It is when the ovary is removed along with the cyst.\n\n【55】*   Total Hysterectomy - For ovarian cancers, the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are surgically removed.\n\n【56】There is no possible way to prevent ovarian cysts. This is why routine gynecological examinations are important to detect cysts early. Please consult a doctor immediately in case you notice changes in your menstrual cycle, experience pelvic pain, unintentional weight loss, and abdominal fullness.

Cyclothymia is a rare mood disorder with relatively fewer mood swings and mild, less frequent episodes. The mood swings in patients with cyclothymia never reach the extremity or are severe enough to cause significant depression or complete maniac episodes.\n\n【2】Thus, it is considered a chronic and milder form of bipolar disorder. During the attacks of the condition, a person experiences noticeable mood shifts from baseline to euphoria. However, an individual is completely fine and stable between the episodes. Although the highs and lows are not extreme in cases with cyclothymic disorders, they can prove to be a risk factor for the onset of bipolar disorder.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Cyclothymic Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The exact cause of the disorder remains unknown.\n\n【5】Still, some of the probable causes are:\n\n【6】*   The genetic link is considered the most probable etiology of the condition, as cyclothymia, depression, and bipolar disorders are deemed to have a hereditary tendency. In addition, reports have proved that mental illnesses run in families.\n\n【7】*   Twin studies have suggested the probability of developing cyclothymic disorders is higher in identical twins if one of the twins has a condition.\n\n【8】*   Environmental factors also play a role in aggravating the chances of developing the disorder.\n\n【9】*   Life events like sexual abuse and a prolonged period of stress.\n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cyclothymic Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Hypomanic symptoms or major depressive episodes characterize cyclothymia; these do not meet the criteria for major depressive disorders. The most significant symptom of cyclothymia includes mood swings ranging from highs to lows; a high is a period when an individual experiences abnormally elevated mood and is persistently irritated. During the episodes, the person has an abnormally increased energy level and increased activity.\n\n【12】Other symptoms include:\n\n【13】*   High self-esteem.\n\n【14】*   Talking a lot (chatterbox behaviors).\n\n【15】*   Racing thoughts.\n\n【16】*   Highly focused.\n\n【17】*   Goal oriented.\n\n【18】*   Feeling that they have rested enough even if they sleep for a few hours.\n\n【19】*   Being highly agitated.\n\n【20】*   Frequent involvement in risky, unjudgemental activities like random business decisions and sexual encounters.\n\n【21】An individual's low is a distinct period during which he feels depressed, helpless, and hopeless. During these episodes, a person loses interest in the activities they previously enjoyed.\n\n【22】Other symptoms presented during the episodes of low include:\n\n【23】*   Feeling socially isolated.\n\n【24】*   Low self-esteem, underconfidence.\n\n【25】*   Self-doubt, guilt.\n\n【26】*   Loss of appetite, weight loss.\n\n【27】*   Frequent insomnia or hypersomnia.\n\n【28】*   Feeling drained and tired.\n\n【29】*   Difficulty concentrating.\n\n【30】*   Emotional instability.\n\n【31】*   Impulsive behaviors.\n\n【32】*   Being irresponsible.\n\n【33】*   Recurrent thoughts of self-infliction or suicide.\n\n【34】What Aggravates the Condition?\n------------------------------\n\n【35】The periods of stress or being physically or emotionally exhausted have been reported to elevate the frequency and duration of the symptoms. If a person is not supported or does not receive mental help at the right time, it can aggravate self dought, and the tendency to have suicidal thoughts is more as an individual feels lonely.\n\n【36】What Are the Diagnostic Criteria for Cyclothymic Disorders?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Cyclothymic disorders can affect males and females; they do not have a preference for any gender. The onset of the disorder is usually during adolescence or early adulthood. As the symptoms are mild, diagnosis becomes a challenge.\n\n【38】*   An individual with a cyclothymic disorder is thoroughly examined for the signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n【39】*   Blood tests are done to rule out the symptoms due to substance abuse.\n\n【40】*   Ruling out other disorders with similar symptoms like bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.\n\n【41】*   The diagnosis is concluded when a person meets the following criteria:\n\n【42】*   Symptoms of alternating highs and lows have been present for at least two years, the frequency such that the symptoms are present for around 50 % of the total duration.\n\n【43】*   An individual has not been free of symptoms for more than two months.\n\n【44】*   Symptoms are not due to other underlying causes like substance abuse or Bipolar Disorder.\n\n【45】How Is the Prognosis in Patients With Cyclothymic Disorders?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Diagnosis, treatment, and management of cyclothymia present complications as the symptoms of the disorder being mild are often unnoticed or ignored. As a result, frequent symptoms can be misdiagnosed as other psychological disorders like bipolar disorder. But whenever the condition is appropriately diagnosed, and timely attention is received to have results in the longer run, as the symptoms are mild, controlling or overcoming them becomes more manageable.\n\n【47】How Is Cyclothymic Disorder Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【48】As the symptoms of cyclothymia are not very severe, most cases go undiagnosed or do not feel the need to seek help or treatment. For those who present with cyclothymia, treatment mainly aims at stabilizing the mood and learning to cope with the highs and lows. No medicinal treatment is available for the disorder, but physicians might prescribe mood stabilizers to control the symptoms. Psychotherapy is another treatment option where a psychotherapist guides and teaches a person to recognize, analyze, and deal with the symptoms. As a result, an individual's thought process is altered to change the response and improve social interactions and relations.\n\n【49】What Are the Complications of Cyclothymic Disorders?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Though cyclothymia presents with fewer complications when compared to bipolar disorder. Still, the disorder interferes with the normal functioning of the individual.\n\n【51】Some common complications include:\n\n【52】*   Difficulty in building and maintaining good social relations.\n\n【53】*   Unstable personal relationships.\n\n【54】*   Days away from work.\n\n【55】*   Hospitalization.\n\n【56】*   Insomnia.\n\n【57】**Conclusion:**\n\n【58】Cyclothymic disorders are rare psychological disorders where a person experiences mild mood swings, which consist of highs and lows. Still, these are never extreme, as seen in patients with mood or bipolar disorders. The person can be extremely happy for a while or feel hopeless or unworthy at another moment. These individuals can also have suicidal thoughts. These individuals have a difficult time socializing or maintaining personal or professional relationships. The diagnosis is confirmed when the episodes have been consistent for the past two years. Cyclothymia can sometimes be misdiagnosed due to substance abuse or bipolar disorder. Treatments become more manageable with a good prognosis if diagnosed in time. Treatment aims at overcoming the symptoms or learning to cope with them.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cyclothymic Disorder  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557877/\n*   Cyclothymia  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cyclothymia/\n*   What Are Bipolar Disorders?  \n    https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/bipolar-disorders/what-are-bipolar-disorders\n*   Mood Disorders  \n    https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/mood-disorders\n*   Cyclothymia  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cyclothymia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This term was first coined by Caravelli in the year 1842. The open bite in the anterior segment of the upper or lower jaw may have dental, skeletal, or often combined etiologic factors. Whatever the etiology of malocclusion, it primarily causes a deviation in the vertical relationship that should be otherwise maintained between the maxillary and the mandibular arches of the orofacial cavity.\n\n【2】Though the prevalence of a simple (not severe) anterior open bite decreases over a phase until young adolescence, it is maximum at the age of 6 years with a 4.2 % approximation in children. When diastema or spacing between the anterior teeth is present along with this anterior occlusal relationship, then it may further negatively impact the smile line of the individual.\n\n【3】What Are the Clinical Characteristics of an Anterior Open Bite?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The clinical features in patients suffering from the anterior open bite may be mainly due to the obstruction of the nose (blocked nose) before and during the phase of puberty in young adults. Also, these patients have hyperactivity of the tongue during the act of swallowing or even at a resting position. Both these factors can affect or rather alter the axial inclination angle of the incisors leading to anterior or posterior open bites as attributed by hypotheses in the dental literature.\n\n【5】How Is Anterior Open Bite Classified?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【6】An anterior open bite, from an etiological point of view, can be mainly classified into two categories:\n\n【7】A. Dental anterior open bite often results from an impediment in the sequence or a consequence of delayed dental eruption or altered tooth-bound inclinations.\n\n【8】B. Skeletal open bite in the anterior segment is mainly due to the increased facial growth in the posterior region of the jaw or face.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>I have crooked teeth and broken decayed tooth.

What could be the reason?</u>\n\n【14】What Causes an Anterior Open Bite?\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】Anterior open bites, thus, as elaborated, can exist for several reasons though it is crucial to identify the exact and most common etiology responsible that varies from patient to patient. Medical and dental history should be elicited by the dental surgeon or the orthodontist before beginning the treatment plan and any restorative, prophylactic or other surgical corrective procedures for the dentition need to be resolved ideally before beginning orthodontic treatment for long-term success and good prognosis. The causes include:\n\n【16】1.  **Intra Arch Disturbances -**\n\n【17】Open bites, be it anterior or posterior as per research, occur due to alterations of tooth position, especially within an arch (intra-arch malocclusion). Common risk factors or examples for causing open bite include:\n\n【18】*   Thumb sucking.\n\n【19】*   Problems in the tongue posture or potential issues in patients (young adults who suffer from airway disorders).\n\n【20】*   Excessive wear out in a segment due to appliances (anterior bite plane).\n\n【21】*   Abnormal dental eruption due to ankylosis (tooth fusion).\n\n【22】1.  **Inter Arch Disturbances:**\n\n【23】When open bites occur due to alterations because of the relationship between the mandible to the maxilla, or inter-arch malocclusion, then the risk factors include:\n\n【24】*   Degenerative joint diseases\n\n【25】*   Class II or III skeletal malocclusion\n\n【26】*   A mandibular plane angle that is moderate to extremely steep( this can be observed in patients with long facial contours).\n\n【27】*   Suppose there is tooth wear without the secondary or compensatory eruption of the dentition. A good example is patients who have erosive tooth wear due to citrus fruit sucking or deposits (causing enamel tooth wear) but the compensatory eruption in fact may not keep up with this wear rate causing inter-arch disturbances.\n\n【28】How Is Dental or Skeletal Malocclusion Diagnosed and Treated?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The orthodontist or the dental surgeon can recommend laboratory tests like DC/TMD (diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders) for detecting and examining open bite malocclusion in detail. Cone beam computed tomography is the widely used radiographic modality to analyze and also to differentiate between the anterior and posterior open bite cases.\n\n【30】1.  **Occlusal Equilibrium:** The dentist will also examine the tooth exposure to determine the smile line and the desired anterior position of the maxillary to mandibular teeth without affecting any occlusal changes. But if the occlusal changes are necessary then occlusion equilibration is established by alteration of the posterior bite and by reshaping the anterior teeth to efficaciously produce a contact between the anterior teeth of both arches. However, the disadvantage in some cases with occlusal equilibrium is dentinal hypersensitivity because of tooth reduction, especially when it is excessive to establish anterior contact.\n\n【31】2.  **Restorations and Equilibration:** To close a simple case of anterior open bite, the dentist may also use restorative modalities coupled with occlusal equilibration if the above method is alone, not sufficient to achieve the desired anterior bite or there is an exceeding risk of dentinal hypersensitivity in the patient.\n\n【32】3.  **Orthodontic Therapies:** The treatment of dental open bite is managed by the orthodontist or the dental surgeon using fixed orthodontic therapy. However, when patients with severity of skeletal malocclusion may require a more comprehensive approach (as in the management of skeletal open bite), then orthognathic surgical intervention procedures are planned, without which only fixed orthodontic therapies would fail, hence surgery and therapy are used in combination for skeletal malocclusion in anterior open bite cases.\n\n【33】4.  Dental malocclusion of open bite in a growing patient such as a young adult can be treated by using certain myofunctional appliances. These appliances need to be worn for a specified time period followed then by a short- or long-term retention period with removable orthodontic appliances.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Anterior open bite as a dental or skeletal malformation thus may require simple to complex integrated treatment strategies such as orthodontic, periodontal, and restorative intervention for correcting the bite in specific cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

When the blood pressure is high for a prolonged time, changes occur in the left ventricle, left atrium, and coronary arteries, leading to heart disease. This can lead to diastolic failure or systolic failure, or both over time. The workload of the heart gets increased due to elevated blood pressure. Hypertensive heart disease is considered the most common cause of death due to hypertension. One-fourth of heart failure is caused by hypertension.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Hypertensive Heart Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Narrowing of the Arteries:** Elevated blood pressure can cause the narrowing of blood vessels. Following this, blood flow to the heart may slow down or even stop. This ends up in coronary artery disease.\n\n【4】*   **Thickening and Enlargement of the Heart:** Increased blood pressure makes the pumping of the heart difficult. This difficulty causes the thickening and growth of heart muscles, which affects the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart.\n\n【5】What Are Cardiovascular Complications Associated With Hypertension?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Prolonged unmanaged hypertension can lead to the following heart complications:\n\n【7】1.  **Heart Failure:** Heart failure results when the heart does not pump adequate blood.\n\n【8】2.  **Coronary Heart Disease:** It occurs when the blood flow to the heat’s muscles gets reduced due to the deposition of plaques in the arteries of heart.\n\n【9】3.  **Peripheral Artery Disease:** A type of atherosclerosis that develops due to the deposition of fatty plaque in the arteries of legs or arms.\n\n【10】4.  **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy:** It is the thickening of muscles in the left ventricle or lower left chamber of heart.\n\n【11】5.  **Cardiomegaly:** Cardiomegaly is a condition which causes the increase in the size of the heart.\n\n【12】6.  **Myocardial Ischemia:** When the flow of blood to the heart gets reduced, heart muscles won’t receive enough oxygen, which leads to myocardial ischemia.\n\n【13】7.  **Atherosclerosis:** Atherosclerosis occurs when fats, cholesterol, and other substances gets accumulated in the walls of the arteries.\n\n【14】8.  **Sudden Cardiac Arrest:** It refers to sudden loss of entire heart activities.\n\n【15】9.  **Stroke and Sudden Death:** It results from the blockage of blood supply to the brain.\n\n【16】What Are the Risk Factors for Hypertensive Heart Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】People with high blood pressure are at the highest risk for hypertensive heart disease. However, other factors that can increase the chance of developing hypertensive heart disease are:\n\n【18】*   Being overweight.\n\n【19】*   Low or no physical activity.\n\n【20】*   Smoking.\n\n【21】*   Family history of hypertensive heart disease.\n\n【22】*   Men and postmenopausal women.\n\n【23】*   Consuming food rich in fat and cholesterol.\n\n【24】*   Older age.\n\n【25】What Are the Clinical Manifestations of Hypertensive Heart Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The clinical manifestations of hypertensive heart disease can differ according to the person’s condition and the severity of the disease:\n\n【27】*   Chest pain.\n\n【28】*   A feeling of pressure or tightness in the chest.\n\n【29】*   Extreme tiredness.\n\n【30】*   Pain in the shoulder, neck, and arms.\n\n【31】*   Persistent cough.\n\n【32】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【33】*   Swelling in the ankles or legs.\n\n【34】How Is Hypertensive Heart Disease Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The doctor will inquire about signs and symptoms after taking a medical history. The blood pressure of the patient will be checked and the history of hypertension will be evaluated. Physical examination and lab tests will be conducted to check blood and kidney function.\n\n【36】The following tests are used for diagnosing hypertensive heart disease:\n\n【37】1.  **Lipid Profile:** It is a test that measures the triglycerides and cholesterol levels in the blood. Lipid profile tests will help doctors to know the risk of heart disease and other medical conditions.\n\n【38】2.  **Basic Metabolic Panel:** This test measures the level of different substances in the blood, which include glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Any abnormality in the level of these substances may indicate a serious medical condition.\n\n【39】3.  **Complete Blood Count:** Biomarkers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein, can predict the risk of coronary artery disease. Other components like erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematocrit, and white blood cell count can also predict the risk of the development of heart conditions.\n\n【40】4.  **Urine Test:** Urine test checks for biomarkers or protein expressions that can predict heart diseases or other chronic medical conditions.\n\n【41】5.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** The electrical signals of the heart can be monitored with the help of an ECG. It can detect arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and other heart conditions. It is an important diagnostic tool for hypertensive heart disease.\n\n【42】6.  **Echocardiogram:** In an echocardiogram, sound waves are used to develop pictures of the heart. It is also known as a heart ultrasound or heart sonogram. It can depict the flow of blood through the heart and heart valves.\n\n【43】7.  **Coronary Angiography:** It is a test to check for any blockage in the coronary arteries. In this test, a contrast dye is administered into the arteries through a catheter, and the blood flow through the heart is analyzed by a doctor by looking at an X-ray screen.\n\n【44】8.  **Exercise Stress Test:** It is advised for people with symptoms such as chest pain. In this test, patients are hooked up to ECG and are asked to exercise on a treadmill. It determines the efficiency of the heart when the body works hard.\n\n【45】9.  **Nuclear Stress Test:** It is also called the thallium stress test and is similar to the exercise stress test. In a nuclear stress test, a dye is inserted into the arm through an intravenous line, and the image of the heart is viewed using a special camera.\n\n【46】What Is the Treatment for Hypertensive Heart Disease in Older People?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The treatment of hypertensive heart disease depends on the age and severity of the disease.\n\n【48】**Medications:** A combination of the following medications is used for the treatment of hypertensive heart disease.\n\n【49】*   Water pills to reduce blood pressure.\n\n【50】*   Diuretics remove excess body fluids.\n\n【51】*   Vasodilators relax smooth muscles in the arteries.\n\n【52】*   Calcium channel blockers improve the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.\n\n【53】*   Beta-blockers decrease the pressure on blood vessels and the heart.\n\n【54】*   Thiazide diuretics remove excess salt and water from the body.\n\n【55】*   Nitrates to relieve chest pain.\n\n【56】**Surgery:** In severe cases, doctors advise surgery or implantation of certain devices to increase the blood flow to the heart.\n\n【57】*   **Pacemaker:** It is a device that can produce electrical stimulation to contract the muscles of the heart, which helps in maintaining normal heart rhythm.\n\n【58】*   **Cardioverter Defibrillators:** These are implantable devices that can assess and provide electrical shock whenever required to correct the heart's rhythm.\n\n【59】*   **Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery:** It is a surgical method to treat blockages in coronary arteries and is advised only in cases of severe coronary heart disease.\n\n【60】How Can Older People Prevent Hypertensive Heart Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】The most important method to prevent hypertensive heart disease is to maintain normal blood pressure. Making certain lifestyle adjustments can prevent hypertensive heart disease during old age:\n\n【62】*   Overweight or obesity are the factors that can increase the risk of both heart disease and hypertension. So it is important to maintain a healthy body weight.\n\n【63】*   Give preference to a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, fibers, proteins, etc. and try to avoid foods rich in salt, sugar, and fat.\n\n【64】*   Stop smoking and reduce the intake of alcohol.\n\n【65】*   Workout regularly for at least 20 to 30 minutes a day.\n\n【66】*   Manage stress by practicing stress management techniques like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, breathing exercises, etc.\n\n【67】**Conclusion:**\n\n【68】Hypertensive heart disease is a chronic condition that affects older people more as age is a risk factor. Unmanaged hypertension for a long time is the cause of this condition. Coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, atherosclerosis, etc. can occur as a result of hypertensive heart disease. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can help the patient recover from this condition.\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hypertensive Heart Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109725/\n*   Hypertension, heart failure, and frailty in older people: A common but unclear situation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8029958/\n*   Hypertensive Heart Disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30969622/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can be addictive due to frequent usage; in fact, it remains one of the most widely used masticators in rural parts of India. The berry contains alkaloids that have great potential for oro-systemic carcinogenicity and multisystemic ill effects.\n\n【2】How Is Areca Nut Consumed?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】The knowledge about areca nut and its effects has now been elucidated with oncologic research, and the awareness is now increasing rapidly with publications and case evidence that are being presented globally by oral surgeons, oncologists, and clinical researchers.\n\n【4】Areca nut grows from Areca catechu seeds, typically found in the tropical Pacific regions, parts of Asia, and also some parts of East Africa. It is commonly called betel nut as, mostly, it is chewed after being wrapped with betel leaves (called paan) or if mixed with tobacco (called betel quid).\n\n【5】The composition and the mode of usage vary across populations and countries. Areca nut remains the fourth most widely consumed addictive substance globally after nicotine, ethanol, and caffeine, consumed by nearly 10 percent of the world's population. Chewing areca nuts is a detrimental habit that begins from a younger age, and children can be seen freely consuming the same, especially in the rural belts.\n\n【6】What Is the Role of Areca Alkaloids?\n------------------------------------\n\n【7】Though other substances are also part of areca nuts, like tannins, polyphenols, catechins, etc. the highest concentration of compounds in this nut is that of alkaloids. The polyphenols present, such as safrole, can also contribute to metabolite toxicity in addition to the alkaloid effects.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Oral Submucous Fibrosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Buccal Mucosa Cancer</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Small Bowel Resection - Indications, Contraindications, and Procedure</u>\n\n【13】Areca nut is perceived as a harmless substance by many individuals, given its easy and wide availability, and is advertised as such by most manufacturers. Ayurveda specialists often recommend areca nut chewing to many people owing to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, antiulcer, and neuroprotective properties as a means to balance the Pitta and Kapha doshas (components of ayurvedic treatment). The central and peripheral pathways usually mediate the analgesic effect of areca nut. However, its detrimental impact worsens or aggravates systemic side effects making its use completely counterproductive and avoidable due to its potential carcinogenicity.\n\n【14】There are four forms of alkaloids present in areca nuts that are:\n\n【15】*   Arecoline.\n\n【16】*   Arecaidine.\n\n【17】*   Guvacoline.\n\n【18】*   Guvacine.\n\n【19】The role of these alkaloids has been implicated by research as an important causative of oral cancer in predisposed individuals and regular areca nut users. Nitrosamines, formed as byproducts of the areca alkaloids, such as methylnitrosamino propionitrile, are the most carcinogenic compounds. Research has yielded substantial evidence for potential carcinogenicity linked directly to oral and esophageal cancers.\n\n【20】What Are the Systemic Effects of Areca Nut?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【21】**Carcinogenicity:** The IARC review concludes that the areca nut is carcinogenic, especially on regular or repeated use. It is primarily linked to cancers of the oral cavity, the pharynx, and the esophagus. Recent research sheds light on the potential link between habitual areca nut consumption and hepato-biliary and uterine cancers.\n\n【22】**Endocrine System:** Areca nut has the ability to impact the endocrine system negatively and is linked to risks of individuals developing hypothyroidism, prostate hyperplasia, infertility, etc.\n\n【23】**Immune system:** The immune system is also impacted because of the ability of the areca nut to suppress normal T-cell activity. This subsequently leads to decreased cytokine release, ultimately altering healthy immunity.\n\n【24】**In Pregnancy:** Intrauterine exposure to areca nut induces potential issues in pregnancy and delivery, such as the possibility of low birth weight in infants, preterm birth, and even neonatal withdrawal syndrome.\n\n【25】**Dependency and Withdrawal Syndromes**: Areca nut use is also associated with these syndromes, as areca nut is associated with addiction, mild euphoria, a state of relaxation, mental satisfaction, etc. The key characteristics of withdrawal syndrome are related to the further effects of insomnia, mood swings, etc. The affected individuals may also feel irritable and anxious. The effects may be comparable to Amphetamine use (which produces similar effects in the CNS).\n\n【26】**Cardiovascular System:** Heart palpitations, increased blood pressure and body temperature, frequency of flushing, and sweating within minutes of areca nut consumption have also been reported in clinical studies.\n\n【27】Studies demonstrate that an increase in facial temperature by 0.5 to 2 degree Celcius is directly related to the consumption of areca nut, with pronounced effects within a few minutes after consumption.\n\n【28】**On Stress and Adrenal Gland Hormones:** Areca nut can induce adrenal chromaffin cells to release catecholamines that can contribute to systemic stress.\n\n【29】**Pre-existing Systemic Disease Aggravation:** Clinical research implicates that areca nut consumption may aggravate pre-existing conditions like myocardial infarction, neuronal injury, obesity, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatic toxicity, asthma, type-II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic disorders, etc.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Globally, India has one of the highest incidences of oral cancers, approximately up to 30 percent of the total cases of cancer. Dentists and maxillofacial surgeons should hence spread awareness about the potentially detrimental effects and oro-systemic negative impact of areca nut. With its carcinogenic capacity, it is one of the predisposing risk factors for oral cancer load. To conclude, areca nut is indeed an addictive substance consumed globally with widespread indulgence through different age groups and populations. Oral physicians and health care providers should educate the general public about the detrimental health impact of regular areca nut consumption to combat the global disease load of oral cancer and its multiorgan effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

For conception to occur, several steps are involved, which includes the following:\n\n【2】What Factors Determine the Conception Process?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The process of conception is dependent on several factors, which is shown below:\n\n【4】What Is Male Infertility?\n-------------------------\n\n【5】Male infertility is a disorder of the reproductive system which produces impregnation failure in the affected individual. Couples who have been having unprotected intercourse frequently for over a year and are not able to conceive are supposed to have fertility issues. These can be present either in one of them or may involve both.\n\n【6】How Prevalent Is Male Infertility?\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】In about 35 to 52 percent of childless couples, the male partner is the cause of infertility. This percentage is increasing in number nowadays because of the changes in the lifestyle of most males.\n\n【8】Alcohol consumption, the increased smoking rate among young people, physical inactivity, excessive workplace stress, irregular and unhealthy diet, change of sleep pattern (poor sleep), etc. are the main cause of life-threatening diseases like diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, heart attacks, cerebrovascular attack (brain stroke), and most importantly 'infertility.'\n\n【9】What Factors Are Responsible for Male Fertility?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The fertility of a male depends on several factors, which include:\n\n【11】1.  Healthy sperm production by at least one of the testicles of a man. This is aided by testosterone and other hormones produced by the body.\n\n【12】2.  Sperm should be able to enter the semen. This transportation is done with the help of delicate tubes. The sperm which enters the semen should be ejaculated.\n\n【13】3.  The number of sperms in the semen should be adequate. If the sperm count is less than 15 million in one millimeter of semen, it is considered low. The probability of fertilizing an egg becomes difficult in these cases.\n\n【14】4.  The sperm must be motile enough to penetrate the egg and fertilize it.\n\n【15】What Causes Male Infertility?\n-----------------------------\n\n【16】Any disruption in the characteristics of sperm can bring about fertility issues in the male.\n\n【17】The causes of male infertility are as follows:\n\n【18】**A. Lifestyle Factors:**\n\n【19】1.  **Smoking -** Tobacco smoke can cause a reduction in sperm count. Not only active smokers but also those exposed to passive smoke have a risk of developing fertility problems.\n\n【20】2.  **Obesity -** Being overweight can also produce infertility as it impairs sperm function and also brings about hormonal imbalances.\n\n【21】3.  **Alcoholism -** Testosterone levels are reduced with alcohol consumption. It also reduces the production of sperms. In addition, the impact of alcohol on the liver can produce liver dysfunction, which also has an effect on fertility.\n\n【22】4.  **Drugs -** Individuals who take anabolic steroids to strengthen and increase muscle growth are more prone to fertility problems. This is because shrinkage of testicles and reduction in sperm production occurs with the intake of anabolic steroids. Although not permanently, drugs like Cocaine and Marijuana can decrease the quality and count of your sperm.\n\n【23】**B. Environmental Factors:**\n\n【24】1.  **Radiation Exposure -** There can be a temporary reduction in sperm production when exposed to radiation. However, high doses can bring about a permanent reduction.\n\n【25】2.  **Chemical Exposure -** A decrease in sperm count is noted in individuals who are constantly exposed to organic solvents, chemicals, herbicides, materials used for painting, and pesticides.\n\n【26】3.  **Testicular Overheating -** Although there is not sufficient evidence to support it, it has been attributed that increased temperature of the testicles can negatively impact the production and function of sperms. Also, it has been said that prolonged sitting, working in systems or laptops for excessively long periods, using hot tubs or saunas often, and wearing tight clothes can contribute to the rise in temperature of the testicles. Studies are still needed to bring about a conclusion.\n\n【27】4.  **Exposure to Heavy Metals -** Infertility can also occur due to exposure to heavy metals like lead, etc.\n\n【28】**C. Medical Conditions:**\n\n【29】1.  **Primary Pathologies -**\n\n【30】**a. Undescended Testicles (Cryptorchidism):**\n\n【31】It is a condition in which the testicles have not descended down into the scrotum, the bag that usually holds the testicles. Instead, these are still held up in the abdomen. Infertility is likely to occur in these patients.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>Dr.Sandip Vitthal Pawar</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>Dr.Ishwar Mahadev Yamgar</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>My right testicle and spermatic cord area are enlarged.Please help.</u>\n\n【37】**b. Varicocele:**\n\n【38】The quality and count of sperms are compromised in varicocele, a reversible cause of infertility characterized by a swelling in the veins draining the testicle.\n\n【39】**c. Oligospermia:**\n\n【40】It is characterized by reduced quality of sperms which can also affect the conception process resulting in infertility.\n\n【41】**d. Tubular Defects:**\n\n【42】Transportation of sperm occurs through a number of tubules, namely the tubes present within and those that drain the testicle, tubes in the epididymis, vas deferens, or urethra, and tubules present adjacent to the ejaculatory ducts. Blockage in any of these tubules due to injury, surgery, infections, or developmental issues can cause fertility problems.\n\n【43】**e. Antisperm Antibodies:**\n\n【44】These are antibodies synthesized by the body's own immune system against the sperms. As a result of this immune action, the sperm are mistakenly eliminated.\n\n【45】**f. Infection:**\n\n【46】Scarring by some infections can also produce problems with fertility. This is because as a result of scarring, there occurs a blockage affecting sperm transportation. The infections responsible are epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis) and orchitis (testicular inflammation). In some cases, sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and HIV can also cause scarring. It is reversible damage in most cases, while some infections may bring about irreversible damage.\n\n【47】**g. Hormonal Imbalance:**\n\n【48】Hormonal imbalance caused by a testicular disorder, or dysfunctions of the endocrine organs like the pituitary, thyroid, hypothalamus, or adrenal glands can also result in infertility.\n\n【49】**h. Chromosomal Abnormalities:**\n\n【50】Infertility is a characteristic of individuals having genetic disorders with chromosomal aberrations like Klinefelter's syndrome, Kallmann's syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In the case of Klinefelter's syndrome, there is an extra X chromosome (usually male has XY chromosomes, whereas in this syndrome there are XXY chromosomes) that produces abnormalities in the male sexual organs.\n\n【51】**i. Coital Factors:**\n\n【52】Hypospadias (a urethral opening is present below the penis), erectile dysfunction, pain during intercourse, relationship problems, premature ejaculation, etc. are contributing factors to infertility as far as sexual intercourse is concerned.\n\n【53】**j. Retrograde Ejaculation:**\n\n【54】In this condition, the semen which has to come out of the penis during ejaculation enters the urinary bladder. It is an important cause of azoospermia. Surgical procedures involving the bladder, urethra, and prostate glands, certain medications, trauma to the spinal cord, and diabetes are important causative conditions.\n\n【55】**k. Previous Surgery:**\n\n【56】Infertility can occur as a result of surgeries of the testis, prostate, scrotum, and urethra, vasectomy, and surgeries done to treat rectal and testicular cancers.\n\n【57】**2\\. Systemic Pathologies -**\n\n【58】**Medications:**\n\n【59】Intake of anabolic steroids, certain medicines taken for arthritis, gastric ulcer, etc. chemotherapy, and testosterone-replacement therapy can impair sperm production resulting in infertility.\n\n【60】**a. Cancer:**\n\n【61】Cancer, in general, or tumors of the male reproductive organs, and cancer treatment can have an impact on fertility.\n\n【62】**b. Other Medical Conditions:**\n\n【63】Patients with diabetes and hypertension are more prone to develop infertility.\n\n【64】**c. Celiac Disease:**\n\n【65】Celiac disease, a digestive dysfunction caused by gluten sensitivity, can also produce fertility issues. Opting for a gluten-free diet can help in reversing the condition.\n\n【66】What Increases the Risk of Developing Infertility?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【67】The following risk factors increase the chances of developing male infertility:\n\n【68】*   Alcohol consumption.\n\n【69】*   Smoking.\n\n【70】*   Obesity.\n\n【71】*   Family history.\n\n【72】*   Exposure to radiation or toxins.\n\n【73】*   Trauma to the testicles.\n\n【74】*   Using illegal drugs.\n\n【75】*   Previous surgeries of the pelvic organs.\n\n【76】*   Vasectomy.\n\n【77】*   Undescended testicles.\n\n【78】*   Testicles frequently exposed to overheating.\n\n【79】*   Radiation therapy.\n\n【80】*   Chemotherapy.\n\n【81】*   Chronic medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancers, etc.\n\n【82】Is Male Infertility Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【83】Diagnosis of male infertility is made with the help of the below tests:\n\n【84】**1\\. Medical History:**\n\n【85】A detailed medical history of the patient about the presence of any hereditary or genetic disorders, chronic medical conditions, trauma, or surgeries is collected. These help in identifying the causes of infertility.\n\n【86】**2\\. Physical Examination:**\n\n【87】The physician examines the male genital organs to look for abnormalities.\n\n【88】**3\\. Semen Analysis:**\n\n【89】Semen is the ejaculatory fluid that contains the sperm. The semen is analyzed for the sperm count, morphology of the sperm, and the ability of the sperm to swim across the vagina to reach the egg in the uterus. The semen is obtained by asking the patient to masturbate in a special container. Some patients do not masturbate owing to their religious beliefs. In these patients, a specialized condom is used to collect the semen. To establish an accurate sperm count, multiple semen analysis has to be done.\n\n【90】In addition to the above, the following tests are employed to diagnose the cause of infertility:\n\n【91】**1\\. Transrectal Ultrasound:**\n\n【92】In this test, a wand inserted into the rectum diagnoses the prostate abnormalities and duct blockages.\n\n【93】**2\\. Post-Ejaculation Urinalysis:**\n\n【94】This test detects the presence of semen in urine. It is useful in the diagnosis of retrograde ejaculation, in which the semen enters the urinary bladder during ejaculation instead of passing out through the urethra.\n\n【95】**3\\. Scrotal Ultrasound:**\n\n【96】The presence of abnormalities in the testicles or other structures and varicocele are detected with the help of scrotal ultrasound.\n\n【97】**4\\. Testicular Biopsy:**\n\n【98】It helps in analyzing sperm production. If the sperm count in the testicles is normal, then the cause of reduced sperm production may be a blockage in the ducts or decreased motility of the sperm.\n\n【99】**5\\. Hormonal Tests:**\n\n【100】Testosterone and other hormones responsible for sexual function are analyzed to look for any imbalances.\n\n【101】**6\\. Genetic Testing:**\n\n【102】Genetic testing is employed to look out for genetic disorders that are causing very feeble sperm production.\n\n【103】**7\\. Sperm Function Tests:**\n\n【104】These tests determine the survival capacity of the sperms, the ability to penetrate the egg, and problems occurring during its attachment with the egg.\n\n【105】How Is Male Infertility Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【106】Treatment for male infertility is aimed at treating the cause. In many cases, causative treatment is beneficial in sorting fertility issues.\n\n【107】The following are the different treatment modalities involved:\n\n【108】*   **Antibiotics:**\n\n【109】Infertility caused by an infection is treated with the help of antibiotics. However, the chances of reversing infertility by treating the infection are less.\n\n【110】*   **Surgery:**\n\n【111】Surgical correction of a blocked vas deferens by bypassing the obstructed area (vasoepididymostomy) and varicocele is of help. Also, a previous vasectomy can be reversed to regain fertility. Sperm retrieval techniques can be helpful in patients where there is normal sperm production but an absence of sperm in the ejaculate.\n\n【112】*   **Treatment for Coital Factors:**\n\n【113】Erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and other relationship problems can be treated with the help of medications or psychological counseling, depending on the root cause.\n\n【114】*   **Hormonal Treatments:**\n\n【115】In conditions where there are abnormal levels of hormones, based on the level of hormones, hormone replacement medications or medications to reduce the hormone levels are prescribed.\n\n【116】*   **Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART):**\n\n【117】**a. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection -**\n\n【118】In this procedure, sperm is injected directly into the egg. With the help of this procedure, nine out of ten males with infertility problems can be benefitted.\n\n【119】**b. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) -**\n\n【120】The ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs, which are collected, fertilized with the sperm in the culture dish, and two to three developed embryos are placed inside the uterus of the female with the help of a small catheter.\n\n【121】What Lifestyle Modifications Help in Increasing the Chances of Conception?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【122】The following factors can boost your chances of impregnating a woman:\n\n【123】*   Avoid smoking and alcohol.\n\n【124】*   Maintain ideal body weight.\n\n【125】*   Eat a balanced and nutritious diet.\n\n【126】*   Have frequent sexual intercourses around the days of ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary).\n\n【127】*   Avoid using lubricants that hamper sperm motility.\n\n【128】*   Maintain a healthy sexual relationship with your partner.\n\n【129】What Are the Complications of Male Infertility?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【130】Below are the complications that can occur with male infertility:\n\n【131】*   The most important implication of the fertility problem is the inability to have a child.\n\n【132】*   Relationship problems might accompany infertility.\n\n【133】*   The artificial techniques involved in achieving pregnancy are expensive.\n\n【134】*   Inability to release the semen increases the risk of developing testicular cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, etc.\n\n【135】How Can Male Infertility Be Prevented?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【136】Male infertility can be prevented by following the below steps:\n\n【137】1.  Abstain from unhealthy habits like smoking, alcohol, and drugs.\n\n【138】2.  Keep your body weight in control.\n\n【139】3.  Avoid getting involved in activities that cause overheating of the testicles.\n\n【140】4.  Limit exposure to pesticides, toxins, radiations, and chemicals.\n\n【141】5.  Avoid getting a vasectomy procedure.\n\n【142】6.  Patients who are about to get cancer treatment should opt for sperm banking.\n\n【143】Conclusion:\n-----------\n\n【144】Infertility is becoming a rising concern among men. With technological advancements in the medical field, the chances of impregnating are increasing. Around 90 % of individuals with male infertility are capable of having their own child. Always remember both men and women should be examined for fertility issues. Reaching out to a healthcare professional is advised when a year of unprotected sexual intercourse cannot result in pregnancy.\n\n【145】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【146】* * *\n\n【147】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Features of Infertility in Males?**\n\n【148】The clinical features of infertility in males involve difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of ejaculated semen, reduced libido or erectile dysfunction, pain, swelling or a lump in the testicular area, gynecomastia, and decreased body and facial hair.\n\n【149】#### **2.**删除换行**How to Increase Fertility in Men?**\n\n【150】Some of the ways to increase fertility in males are:  \n\\- D-aspartic acid supplements.  \n\\- Regular exercise.  \n\\- Vitamin C.  \n\\- Minimizing stress.  \n\\- Sufficient vitamin D.  \n\\- Tribulus terrestris (medicinal herb).  \n\\- Fenugreek.  \n\\- Zinc supplementation.  \n\\- Withania somnifera (fenugreek).  \n\\- Maca root.\n\n【151】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Infertility Be Reversed?**\n\n【152】Infertility due to varicocele can be reversed by surgery; infectious etiology can be treated with antibiotics, hormone therapy, and assisted reproductive technology can be used to reverse infertility.\n\n【153】#### **4.**删除换行**How Many Men Have Infertility?**\n\n【154】Males contribute 50 % of all infertility cases globally out of 60 to 80 million couples suffering from infertility issues.

{"seq_id": "fe640b2c-0cfc-4f84-aa53-bd3ebc932e91", "title": "Poikiloderma of Civatte - Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Poikiloderma of Civatte - Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment\nWhat Is Poikiloderma of Civatte?\n--------------------------------\n\n【1】Poikiloderma of Civatte is a chronic, non-cancerous skin condition commonly acquired on the cheeks and neck. It results in hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation of the affected skin, raising only cosmetic concerns. The condition usually runs a benign course and is asymptomatic.\n\n【2】The term 'poikiloderma' refers to a cutaneous change in the affected skin exhibiting vasodilatation of the capillaries, epidermal atrophy, and reticulated hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation changes. A French dermatologist named Civatte was the first to describe this benign condition in 1923.\n\n【3】The condition represents net-like mottled reddish-brown patches on the face and neck with telangiectasia. It most commonly occurs in fair-skinned individuals. It most commonly affects the areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun for a longer period.\n\n【4】It is, therefore, not a disease but a classic combination triad of -\n\n【5】*   Cutaneous atrophy (lax, wrinkled, and shiny skin).\n\n【6】*   Telangiectasia (a condition where there is dilatation of the fine blood vessels).\n\n【7】*   Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Poikiloderma of Civatte?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Poikiloderma of Civatte is usually recognized into three clinical subtypes based on its typical clinical manifestations. These three subtypes are -\n\n【10】1.  Erythematotelangiectatic type.\n\n【11】2.  Pigmented type.\n\n【12】3.  Mixed type.\n\n【13】What Are the Causes of Poikiloderma of Civatte?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The exact etiology of the disease is unknown. The disease can be either due to genetic or acquired causes. Some of the causes are as follows:\n\n【15】1\\. Long and chronic exposure to ultraviolet rays is considered the main causative factor for developing this cutaneous condition.\n\n【16】2\\. Other predisposing factors include:\n\n【17】*   Individuals who have white or fair skin.\n\n【18】*   Light-sensitive compounds in certain body deodorants, perfumes, toiletries, or make-up products can trigger autoimmune reactions leading to contact hypersensitivity.\n\n【19】*   Hormonal changes that occur during menopause in women may trigger this disorder.\n\n【20】*   If lower, estrogen levels can also trigger this disorder's etiopathogenesis.\n\n【21】What Is the Epidemiology of Poikiloderma of Civatte?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Female predilection is seen as compared to males. The disorder is more frequently present in females who are approaching menopause. The prevalence of this disease is not known. Not more than 100 to 150 individuals have been reported in medical history. Poikiloderma of Civatte occurs more commonly in white-skinned individuals.\n\n【23】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Poikiloderma of Civatte?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The disease does not usually show any signs or symptoms in mild cases. However, few affected individuals may show stingy, pruritic, and itchy symptoms of the poikiloderma lesions. The main clinical symptoms of the disease include:\n\n【25】1\\. Mottled alternating spots that are either red or brownish-red in color. The pigmentation is due to the following factors:\n\n【26】*   Hemosiderin pigment released from the disintegrated red blood cells leads to brown staining of the skin lesions.\n\n【27】*   The blood is released from the tiny, broken blood capillaries.\n\n【28】*   Chronic sun exposure can lead to the deposition of melanin in the cutaneous layers.\n\n【29】2\\. Epidermal atrophy results in thinning of the cutaneous cellular layers making the skin look dry.\n\n【30】3\\. The characteristic lesions are typically present on the face and neck exposed areas. Usually, the neck area shaded by the chin is spared from developing any cutaneous lesions.\n\n【31】4\\. The classic lesions develop bilaterally (both sides) on the cheeks and neck and sometimes symmetrically in the upper chest region.\n\n【32】5\\. The changes are gradually exaggerated on the cutaneous surface with time.\n\n【33】How Is the Diagnosis of Poikiloderma of Civatte Made?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The diagnosis of Poikiloderma of Civatte is usually established based on extensive clinical examination.\n\n【35】*   **Physical Examination:** The classical triad of symptoms and the occurrence of symmetrical lesions on the cheeks and neck serve as an important diagnostic clinical feature to differentiate the disease from other skin lesions.\n\n【36】*   **Other Tests:** Clinical history and examination can be followed by blood tests and a lesional skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【37】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Poikiloderma Of Civatte?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】These include:\n\n【39】*   Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (autoimmune inflammatory disease causing widespread organ damage).\n\n【40】*   Bloom’s syndrome (a genetic disorder characterized by retarded growth and a narrow face).\n\n【41】*   Rosacea (blushing on the face due to visible blood vessels).\n\n【42】*   Parapsoriasis (reddish, scaly patches that are treatment-resistant).\n\n【43】*   Pigmented contact dermatitis (allergic skin reaction due to cosmetic ingredients or fragrance).\n\n【44】*   Cutaneous type of T-cell lymphoma (cancer of the T-cells).\n\n【45】*   Eczema (dry, itchy, and rough skin).\n\n【46】What Is the Treatment and Management of Poikiloderma Of Civatte?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The disease cannot be cured, but the symptoms can be minimized by taking preventive measures.\n\n【48】1\\. **Drug Therapy**\\- The first and foremost is avoiding exposure to harmful ultraviolet rays. Preventing sun exposure prevents the appearance of new skin lesions from developing and improves the existing lesions.\n\n【49】*   Use mineral sunscreens with SPF (sun protection factor) 50 to protect the skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays damage.\n\n【50】*   The use of perfumes and cosmetic products that are found to be faulty should be stopped immediately.\n\n【51】*   Retinoids can be used topically at night to improve the effect of laser therapy and mitigate cosmetic disfigurement.\n\n【52】*   Skin-lightening corticosteroid creams can also be recommended to reduce hyperpigmentation. They should be applied twice a day for three to four months.\n\n【53】2\\. **Laser Therapy**\\- It is the mainstay of treatment for managing the patchy lesions of Poikiloderma of Civatte. Laser therapy aims to eliminate the pigmented and vascular areas and stimulate collagen fibers' resynthesis. The commonly used laser techniques include:\n\n【54】*   **Pulsed Dye Lasers (PDL) Therapy** - These are strong and sturdy lasers that are focused on targeting the underlying blood capillaries beneath the skin without causing any harm to the skin cells. They function at a single wavelength of light only. Therefore, this laser therapy aims to eliminate the erythema of the skin lesions that occur due to broken small blood capillaries underneath the skin. Pulsed dye lasers cause temporary edema, worsening the skin's redness before improving it. The patient requires several visits to treat the condition.\n*   **Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) Therapy**\\- This treatment therapy operates at multiple different wavelengths. They target the melanin pigment and the blood capillaries simultaneously. They also induce the synthesis of collagen fibers, making the skin look more supple and plump. Intense pulse therapy is not as strong and sturdy as pulsed dye lasers. Hence, multiple patient visits are advised for the sessions to treat the condition significantly. This laser therapy improves the problem of skin discoloration.\n*   **Fractional Laser Therapy**\\- This therapy targets the epithelium and the connective tissue, stimulating new collagen regrowth and remodeling collagen fibers. The results are achieved gradually. Numerous sessions with the patient are needed. It may take six to seven months to resolve the problem completely.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Poikiloderma of Civatte is a long-lasting skin condition with no proper cure or treatment. The management of the symptoms mainly comprises eliminating both the hyper-pigmented and vascular components with the help of laser technology. Besides laser therapy, it is very important to prevent from sun exposure by using broad-spectrum sunscreens.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Poikiloderma of Civatte: a histopathological and ultrastructural study  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341870/\n*   Poikiloderma of Civatte  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/poikiloderma-of-civatte\n*   Poikiloderma of Civatte  \n    https://www.aocd.org/page/PoikilodermaofCiva</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Specifically, low testosterone levels have been linked to mood swings in men.\n\n【2】The hormone testosterone, which is important in this process, is directly related to the control of mood and emotions in the body. Therefore, the brain's capacity to effectively regulate testosterone levels may be compromised if it is low. This can result in intense and disruptive mood swings, anxiety, and depression.\n\n【3】What Is the Role of Testosterone in Men?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】Testosterone is a hormone that is essential for the development and upkeep of male physical attributes and reproductive functions. The testes are the primary source of testosterone production, although the adrenal glands also produce small quantities. Testosterone levels usually reach their maximum during adolescence and early adulthood in males, and then progressively decrease with age.\n\n【5】Testosterone is responsible for male characteristics such as:\n\n【6】*   Muscle mass.\n\n【7】*   Bone density.\n\n【8】*   Body hair growth.\n\n【9】*   Deepening of the voice.\n\n【10】It also has a big impact on how much energy, sex drive, and mood you have. Low testosterone in men increases the risk of mood swings and other social and psychological issues. Testosterone production is primarily controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the brain and is essential for the maintenance of male reproductive health and overall well-being.\n\n【11】Why Do Low Testosterone Levels in Men Cause Mood Swings?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】There are several reasons why low testosterone levels can cause mood swings in men.\n\n【13】1\\. It can disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, which can lead to mood changes.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>How to treat mood swings and depression after having a child?</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Is TRT suggested for low testosterone levels, low libido, and ED in a 47-year-old?</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Can mood swings delay periods?</u>\n\n【19】2\\. It can cause physical changes in the body, such as decreased muscle mass and increased body fat, which can negatively impact self-image and self-esteem.\n\n【20】3\\. It can cause fatigue and low energy levels, which can contribute to feelings of depression and irritability.\n\n【21】Testosterone has been found to have a significant impact on the brain's emotional centers, such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. These brain regions are responsible for processing emotions, regulating mood, and controlling impulsive behaviors. Testosterone can affect the activity of these regions, leading to changes in mood and behavior.\n\n【22】According to a study, men with low testosterone levels are more prone to show symptoms of despair and anxiety. Additionally, they might feel less well-being and have a lower quality of living. On the other hand, men with higher testosterone levels typically exhibit improved mood and cognitive function, more confidence, and a feeling of overall well-being.\n\n【23】Men's emotional responses are also controlled by testosterone. Cortisol, which can have a negative effect on mood and cognitive function, is released when males experience stress. Testosterone can improve mood and lower stress levels by lowering cortisol levels, which regulate the stress reaction.\n\n【24】What Are the Symptoms Exhibited in Cases of Low Testosterone?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Numerous physical and psychological symptoms may be present in men with low testosterone levels. Some of the most typical indications of low testosterone are listed below:\n\n【26】*   **Low Sex Drive:** Testosterone plays a critical role in male sexual function, and low testosterone levels can cause a decreased interest in sex or difficulty achieving an erection.\n\n【27】*   **Fatigue:** Low testosterone levels can cause fatigue, decreased energy levels, and reduced physical stamina.\n\n【28】*   **Reduced Muscle Mass:** Testosterone is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, and low levels can lead to reduced muscle mass and strength.\n\n【29】*   **Increased Body Fat:** Body fat might grow as a result of low testosterone levels, especially around the waist.\n\n【30】*   **Decreased Bone Density:** Testosterone is critical for maintaining bone density, and low levels can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\n\n【31】*   **Mood Changes:** Low testosterone levels can cause mood changes such as irritability, depression, and anxiety.\n\n【32】*   **Memory And Concentration Problems:** Testosterone plays a role in cognitive function, and low levels can lead to memory and concentration problems.\n\n【33】*   **Hot Flashes:** Hot flashes, which are comparable to those experienced by women during menopause, may happen to some men.\n\n【34】*   **Sleep Disturbances:** Low testosterone levels can affect sleep quality, leading to insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns.\n\n【35】*   **Decreased Motivation:** Low testosterone levels can cause a lack of motivation, decreased ambition, and reduced productivity.\n\n【36】What Can Cause Low Levels of Testosterone in Men?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】The following are some typical reasons for low testosterone in males, which can result in mood swings:\n\n【38】*   Age-related decline in testosterone levels.\n\n【39】*   Hypogonadism (a condition in which the testes do not produce enough testosterone).\n\n【40】*   Sleep apnea.\n\n【41】*   Chronic illness (such as HIV/AIDS, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease).\n\n【42】*   Medications (such as opioids, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy drugs).\n\n【43】*   Stress.\n\n【44】*   Substance abuse (such as alcohol and opioids).\n\n【45】*   Nutrient deficiencies (such as vitamin D and zinc).\n\n【46】*   Obesity.\n\n【47】*   Sedentary lifestyle or lack of physical activity.\n\n【48】How to Maintain Testosterone Levels?\n------------------------------------\n\n【49】While some causes of low testosterone levels cannot be prevented, there are some lifestyle changes that can help maintain healthy testosterone levels:\n\n【50】*   Maintain a healthy weight and avoid obesity.\n\n【51】*   Exercise regularly.\n\n【52】*   Get enough sleep.\n\n【53】*   Manage stress levels.\n\n【54】*   Eat a healthy and balanced diet.\n\n【55】*   Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\n\n【56】*   Avoid smoking and drug abuse.\n\n【57】*   Ensure adequate intake of vitamin D and zinc.\n\n【58】*   Discuss the potential side effects of medications with the doctor before taking them.\n\n【59】*   Keeping away from chemicals and plastics that are harmful to the environment.\n\n【60】What Are the Treatment Options for Low Testosterone in Men?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】Men who have mood swings and low testosterone levels have a variety of therapeutic choices. The doctor may recommend one or a combination of the following:\n\n【62】*   **Testosterone Replacement Therapy:** Using testosterone to replace the hormone that the body is not producing naturally is known as testosterone replacement treatment. Injections, gels, patches, pellets, and other types of administration are all options for this treatment.\n\n【63】*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Lifestyle changes, such as exercise and diet, can help improve testosterone levels and reduce mood swings. Exercise can elevate mood and raise testosterone levels. A healthy diet that includes lean protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can also help improve testosterone levels and overall well-being.\n\n【64】*   **Counseling:** Counseling can help men cope with the emotional challenges that come with low testosterone levels and mood swings. A therapist can help men develop coping strategies and provide support as they navigate this challenging time.\n\n【65】**Conclusion**\n\n【66】The impact of low testosterone levels on a man's mood and general state of health can be significant. Mood swings is a common symptom of low testosterone levels and can make it difficult for men to manage their emotions. If mood swings or other symptoms of low testosterone levels are experienced, it is essential to speak with the physician to determine the underlying cause and explore treatment options. With the right treatment, men with low testosterone levels can improve their mood, energy levels, and overall well-being.\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>*   The effect of testosterone levels on mood in men  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24016385/\n*   Physiology, Testosterone  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526128/#:~:text=Testosterone%20is%20the%20primary%20male,males%20and%20females%20are%20identical.\n*   What Is a Normal Testosterone Level?  \n    https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000002928</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Pinna perichondritis is not a very common condition, but the researchers do not know the exact number of people affected by this condition. The condition was found commonly in adolescents in England between 1990 and 1998 because of high ear piercings.\n\n【2】The infection can occur for various reasons and cause swelling, pain, and redness in the outer ear. The most common cause of pinna perichondritis is high ear piercing, which increases the risk of infection or perichondritis. It may also cause pus accumulation or abscess between the cartilage and ear tissue. Pinna perichondritis can even cause severe complications if not diagnosed and treated timely, as it can cease the blood supply to the ear cartilage. This can lead to necrosis or death of the tissue. Necrosis of the cartilage can further cause permanent ear deformities such as the “cauliflower ear.”\n\n【3】Therefore, a person experiencing any symptoms of pinna chondritis or other ear infections should consult the healthcare provider immediately. The article talks in detail about the pinna perichondritis condition and the treatment and preventive measures to minimize the risk of occurrence.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Pinna Perichondritis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Pinna perichondritis is a bacterial infection caused by the most common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause the infection. These bacteria can cause infection in the cartilage of the external ear called the pinna. The infection mainly occurs due to any trauma or injury. The shape of our external ear is created by a thick tissue called cartilage. It is further surrounded by a thin layer of tissues called perichondrium, which supplies nutrients to the cartilage. The following reasons, therefore, cause pinna perichondritis:\n\n【6】*   Ear piercings cause damage to ear cartilage and are a significant cause of perichondritis.\n\n【7】*   Trauma to the side of the head.\n\n【8】*   Insect bites.\n\n【9】*   Contact sports.\n\n【10】*   Acupuncture.\n\n【11】*   Burns.\n\n【12】Less common causes of pinna perichondritis:\n\n【13】*   Herpes zoster infections.\n\n【14】*   Untreated ear infections that involve ear cartilage.\n\n【15】*   Ear surgery.\n\n【16】*   Minor trauma to the ear.\n\n【17】Pinna perichondritis can also occur in people having the following medical conditions:\n\n【18】*   Weakened immune system.\n\n【19】*   Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and other inflammatory conditions.\n\n【20】*   Diabetes.\n\n【21】What Are the Symptoms of Pinna Perichondritis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The symptoms of pinna perichondritis are as follows:\n\n【23】*   Red, painful, and swollen outer ear.\n\n【24】*   Tenderness.\n\n【25】*   Fever.\n\n【26】*   Warmth is felt on the outer ear.\n\n【27】Perichondritis of the pinna mainly affects the upper part of the external ear and does not cause any damage to the ear lobes. Fluid discharge may also occur if any abscess is present.\n\n【28】How Is Pinna Perichondritis Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】The doctor diagnoses the pinna perichondritis through a physical examination of the infected ear. They ask the person about their symptoms and any injury or trauma that may have caused this condition. Trauma can be of various times, such as burns, ear piercing, acupuncture, and cuts. The doctor also asks about the person's medical history that may have caused an infection in the ear. Blood tests and imaging for diagnosis are usually not indicated in pinna perichondritis. However, if secondary infections cause necrosis, abscess, and swelling in the extended area. Then a blood count test, c-reactive protein, urea and electrolytes, coagulation screen, and blood cultures should be performed. In addition, microbiological swabs of the infected area and pus discharge are also taken to evaluate the case.\n\n【30】How Is Pinna Perichondritis Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【31】The first line of treatment for perichondritis is antibiotic therapy, depending on the severity of the condition and the type of bacteria involved. Fluoroquinolone is the most common antibiotic to treat pinna perichondritis or perichondritis infection. The antibiotic is available in oral and topical forms. It can be directly taken through the mouth or applied to the infected area of the skin.\n\n【32】What Are the Preventive Measures for Pinna Perichondritis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The preventive measures for pinna perichondritis are\n\n【34】*   Avoid piercing high ear cartilage; instead, pierce the lower earlobe as the risk of infection is also low in this area.\n\n【35】*   Do not scratch the ear too much.\n\n【36】*   The treatment of ear infections should be done promptly.\n\n【37】*   Avoid acupuncture on the ears.\n\n【38】*   Contact sports should also be avoided.\n\n【39】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Pinna Perichondritis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】The doctor should know other pathologies that can cause inflamed or painful ears. They should perform an otoscopy in the case of children to rule out otitis media as they cannot communicate their symptoms properly.\n\n【41】*   Otitis externa.\n\n【42】*   Pinna cellulitis.\n\n【43】*   Malignant otitis media.\n\n【44】*   Relapsing polychondritis.\n\n【45】*   Psoriasis or eczema or other dermatological conditions are affecting the ear.\n\n【46】*   Otitis media.\n\n【47】What Are the Complications Associated With Pinna Perichondritis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Pinna perichondritis can lead to cartilage necrosis, cauliflower ear, or minor cosmetic deformity of the ear if left untreated. Perichondritis infection may also spread to the other areas surrounding the pinna and can cause a secondary infection called chondritis. The person may require hospital admission and intravenous antibiotics.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】Pinna perichondritis, if promptly diagnosed and treated with antibiotic therapy, can settle the symptoms in two or three days, but pain may persist for a month. However, people should be aware of the increased risk of ear infections from high ear piercings. Therefore, a person suffering from any symptoms of perichondritis, such as swelling, redness, and pain in the outer ear, should consult the healthcare provider immediately to avoid any permanent deformity of the ear.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Perichondritis: Not All Ear Pain Is Otitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686808/\n*   Pinna Perichondritis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572081/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is used to restore a normal heart rhythm and maintain a steady and regular heartbeat. Propafenone hydrochloride is known as an antiarrhythmic drug that works by blocking the activity of certain electrical signals in the heart, which can cause an irregular heartbeat. Propafenone hydrochloride was approved in March 2003 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n【2】**Dosage**\n\n【3】Propafenone hydrochloride comes in tablet form with 150, 225, and 300 milligrams strengths.\n\n【4】What Is the Clinical Use of Propafenone Hydrochloride?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Propafenone hydrochloride is used for the following reasons-\n\n【6】*   It is used to prolong the time for recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (PAF) associated with any disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.\n\n【7】*   It is used to prolong the time for recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with any disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.\n\n【8】*   It is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【9】**Warnings and Precautions-**\n\n【10】*   **Proarrhythmic Effects-** Propafenone has proarrhythmic effects such as sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It can also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias and can prolong the QT interval. It is, therefore, important that each patient prescribed Propafenone hydrochloride must be evaluated electrocardiographically before and during the therapy to determine whether the response to the drug supports continued treatment. Because Propafenone can prolong the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, and changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret.\n\n【11】*   **Brugada Syndrome-** Brugada Syndrome can be unmasked after exposure to Propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG (electrocardiogram) after the initiation of Propafenone hydrochloride; ECG must be performed, and if any changes appear that are suggestive of Brugada syndrome, then the drug should be discontinued.\n\n【12】*   **Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents-** The use of Propafenone hydrochloride combined with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval has not been studied extensively. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, like phenothiazines, oral macrolides, and tricyclic antidepressants. Withhold class 1A and 3 antiarrhythmic agents for at least five half-lives before initiating Propafenone hydrochloride. Avoid using Propafenone with class 1A and 3 antiarrhythmic agents. There is limited experience with the concomitant use of class 1B and 1C antiarrhythmics.\n\n【13】*   **Heart Failure-** Propafenone can provoke heart failure in patients who have a history of heart failure.\n\n【14】*   **Conduction Disturbances-** Propafenone hydrochloride slows atrioventricular conduction and can also cause dose-related first-degree AV block. The average PR interval prolongation and increase in QRS duration are also dose-related. Propafenone should not be given to patients with intraventricular and atrioventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker.\n\n【15】*   **Effects of Pacemaker-** Propafenone hydrochloride can alter both the pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers as well as defibrillators. During and after the therapy, the devices should be monitored and re-programmed accordingly.\n\n【16】*   **Agranulocytosis-** Agranulocytosis was reported in some patients receiving Propafenone. Generally, agranulocytosis occurred within the first two months of Propafenone therapy, and after discontinuing the therapy, the white count normalized by fourteen days. Unexplained fever or decrease in the white cell count, especially in the first three months of therapy, needs consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Patients are instructed to report immediately for any signs of infection like fever, chills, or sore throat.\n\n【17】*   **Hepatic Dysfunction-** Propafenone hydrochloride is highly metabolized by the liver. Hence it should be closely monitored in patients who have moderate to severe liver disease.\n\n【18】*   **Renal Dysfunction-** Propafenone hydrochloride should be closely monitored in patients with impaired renal function, as 50 % of the drug is excreted through urine.\n\n【19】*   **Myasthenia Gravis-** Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported while treated with Propafenone hydrochloride.\n\n【20】*   **Elevated ANA Titers-** Positive ANA titers were reported in some patients receiving Propafenone. They have been reversible after the cessation of the treatment and may also disappear in some cases even after continued Propafenone therapy. Patients should be carefully evaluated who develop an abnormal ANA test, and the therapy should be discontinued if the persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected.\n\n【21】**Drug Interactions**\n\n【22】Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, such as Paroxetine, Desipramine, Sertraline, or Ritonavir, and CYP3A4, such as Ketoconazole, Saquinavir, Ritonavir, or Erythromycin, are expected to cause increased plasma levels of Propafenone hydrochloride. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with the administration of Propafenone can increase the risk of adverse reactions, including pro-arrhythmia. Hence, the continuous use of Propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 and a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be avoided.\n\n【23】**Use in Specific Populations**\n\n【24】*   **Pregnancy-** There are no studies of Propafenone hydrochloride available in pregnant women. Any drug-associated risks of birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes have not been reported yet. Untreated arrhythmias during pregnancy can pose a risk to the pregnant woman and fetus. Propafenone hydrochloride and its metabolite, 5-OH-propafenone, can cross the placenta in humans. In animal studies, Propafenone hydrochloride was not teratogenic. At maternally toxic doses ranging from two to six times the maximum recommended human dose, adverse developmental outcomes were reported while administering to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis or while administering to pregnant rats in the mid-gestation period through weaning of their offspring.\n\n【25】*   **Lactation-** Propafenone hydrochloride and its active metabolite, 5-OH-propafenone, are found in human milk, but the levels are likely to be low. No data is available on the effects of Propafenone hydrochloride on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of the infant must be considered, along with the mother’s clinical need for Propafenone.\n\n【26】*   **Pediatric Use-** The safety and effectiveness of Propafenone hydrochloride in children have not been established yet.\n\n【27】*   **Geriatric Use-** The dosage selection for an older patient should be cautious. It should be started at the low end of the dose range after considering the frequency of renal, hepatic, and cardiac function, other associated diseases, or any other drug therapy.\n\n【28】**For Patients**\n\n【29】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>What are the chances of my GERD and hiatus hernia triggering my PVCs?</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>Cardiac Damage Due to Electric Shock</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>Plasma Cortisol and Atrial Fibrillation - Risk Factors</u>\n\n【34】What Is Arrhythmia?\n-------------------\n\n【35】Arrhythmia is the term used for an irregular or abnormal heartbeat. A person with arrhythmia may experience symptoms like a feeling of skipped heartbeat, pounding in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, weakness, chest discomfort, etc. There are many causes of arrhythmia, such as coronary artery disease, irritable tissue in the heart due to acquired or genetic causes, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy (changes in the heart muscle), valve disorders, any electrolyte imbalance in the blood, including sodium or potassium imbalances, injury from a heart attack, healing process after heart surgery or any other medical conditions. Arrhythmias can be treated with medications and devices like pacemakers or defibrillators.\n\n【36】Why Is Propafenone Hydrochloride Prescribed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Propafenone hydrochloride is used to treat arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) and maintain a normal heart rate. Propafenone comes under a class of medications known as antiarrhythmics, and they work by acting on the heart muscle in order to improve the heart's rhythm.\n\n【38】How Propafenone Hydrochloride Should Be Used?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   Propafenone hydrochloride comes in a tablet form and an extended-release capsule which is taken by mouth.\n\n【40】*   The tablet is usually prescribed to be taken thrice a day, once every eight hours, and the extended-release capsule is taken twice a day, once every twelve hours, with or without food.\n\n【41】*   Patients are advised to follow the directions on the prescription label carefully and ask their doctor or pharmacist to explain any part they do not understand.\n\n【42】*   Propafenone should be taken exactly as directed. It should not be taken more or less or more often than prescribed by the doctor. The whole capsule should be swallowed, and it should not be crushed or divided into small contents.\n\n【43】*   The patients are advised to take Propafenone in a hospital so that the doctor can monitor them carefully as their body gets used to the medication. The doctor may start on a low dose of Propafenone and gradually increase it, not more often than once every five days.\n\n【44】*   Propafenone may control irregular heartbeat, but it will not cure it.\n\n【45】*   The patients are advised to continue Propafenone even if they feel well. It should not be stopped without consulting the doctor; otherwise, the heartbeat may become irregular if Propafenone is stopped suddenly.\n\n【46】What Special Precautions Should Be Followed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【47】*   The doctor should be informed if the patient is allergic to Propafenone or any ingredients present in Propafenone or any other medications.\n\n【48】*   The doctor should be informed about any prescription or nonprescription drugs that the patient is taking.\n\n【49】*   Any herbal, dietary, or vitamin supplements taken by the patient should be informed to the doctor.\n\n【50】*   Medications like anticoagulants, antibiotics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, antidepressants, medications for irregular heartbeat, medications for mental illness and nausea, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should be mentioned to the doctor.\n\n【51】*   Inform the doctor if the patient experiences sweating, excessive diarrhea, loss of appetite, vomiting, or decreased thirst or has ever had a slow heartbeat, low blood pressure, high or low levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, or bicarbonate in the blood, asthma, heart failure, or any other condition that causes the patient’s airways to become narrow after taking Propafenone.\n\n【52】*   If a patient has or has ever had a pacemaker, myasthenia gravis, or liver or kidney disease, then they should be informed to the doctor.\n\n【53】*   If a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding or is planning to get pregnant, then they should inform the doctor.\n\n【54】*   If a patient is about to undergo any surgery, including dental surgery, then the doctor should be informed about Propafenone.\n\n【55】*   This medication can make a person feel dizzy or drowsy, so it is advisable not do any activity that requires attention, like driving a vehicle.\n\n【56】*   The use of tobacco can decrease the effectiveness of this medication.\n\n【57】What to Do if a Dose Is Missed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【58】The missed dose must be taken as soon as the patient remembers it. However, the missed dose can be skipped if it is almost time for the next dose. The patient should never take an extra dose to compensate for the missed dose.\n\n【59】What Are the Side Effects of Propafenone?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【60】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【61】*   Headache.\n\n【62】*   Nausea.\n\n【63】*   Vomiting.\n\n【64】*   Dry mouth.\n\n【65】*   Constipation.\n\n【66】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【67】*   Acidity.\n\n【68】*   Unusual taste in the mouth.\n\n【69】*   Anxiety.\n\n【70】*   Tiredness.\n\n【71】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【72】*   Uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body.\n\n【73】*   Difficulty with coordination.\n\n【74】*   Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\n【75】*   Wheezing.\n\n【76】*   Difficulty breathing.\n\n【77】*   Chest pain.\n\n【78】*   Slow, fast, or pounding heartbeat.\n\n【79】*   New or worsening irregular heartbeat.\n\n【80】*   Sudden, unexplained weight gain.\n\n【81】*   Swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs.\n\n【82】*   Skin rash.\n\n【83】*   Fainting.\n\n【84】*   Unexplained fever, chills, weakness, or sore throat.\n\n【85】**Storage and Disposal-**\n\n【86】*   The medication should be kept in a tightly sealed container and stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight.\n\n【87】*   Unneeded medication should be disposed of in such a way that children or pets cannot consume them.\n\n【88】*   It is advisable to contact the local garbage collecting/recycling department to dispose of the medication.\n\n【89】What Should Be Done in Case of an Overdose?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【90】In case of an overdose, immediately contact the poison control helpline number. If the patient has collapsed or cannot be awakened or experiences seizures, then they should be rushed to the hospital.\n\n【91】**Other Information**\n\n【92】*   Any other person apart from the patient for whom the medication is not prescribed should not take it.\n\n【93】*   It is important to keep a written list of the prescription and nonprescription drugs that the patient is taking.\n\n【94】*   The written list should be carried out while visiting a doctor or in case of emergencies.\n\n【95】**For Doctors**\n\n【96】**Indications-**\n\n【97】Propafenone is used to prolong the time for the recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (PAF) associated with any disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. It is also used for treating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【98】**Mechanism of Action-**\n\n【99】The electrophysiological effect of Propafenone hydrochloride manifests itself in a reduction of the upstroke velocity of the monophasic action potential. In the Purkinje fibers, and to some lesser extent, myocardial fibers, Propafenone hydrochloride can reduce the fast inward current carried by the sodium ions, which is responsible for the antiarrhythmic action of the drug. The diastolic excitability threshold is increased, and the effective refractory period is prolonged. Propafenone hydrochloride can reduce spontaneous automaticity and depresses the triggered activity. In vitro, under very high concentrations, Propafenone hydrochloride inhibits a slow inward current carried by the calcium, although this calcium antagonist effect does not contribute to the antiarrhythmic efficacy.\n\n【100】**Pharmacodynamics-**\n\n【101】Propafenone hydrochloride comes under class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anesthetic effects, and it has a direct stabilizing action on the myocardial membranes. It is used for treating atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Propafenone acts by inhibiting the sodium channels and restricts the sodium from entering cardiac cells, which results in reduced excitation. The drug has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine.\n\n【102】**Pharmacokinetics-**\n\n【103】*   **Absorption-** Propafenone is nearly completely absorbed through oral administration (90 %). The systemic bioavailability ranges from five to fifty percent.\n\n【104】*   **Volume of Distribution-** 252 liters.\n\n【105】*   **Protein Binding-** 97 %.\n\n【106】*   **Metabolism-** Propafenone is metabolized primarily in the liver, where it is rapidly and extensively metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-hydroxy propafenone and N-dipropyl propafenone. These metabolites have antiarrhythmic activity comparable to Propafenone but are present in less than twenty-five percent concentrations than Propafenone concentrations.\n\n【107】*   **Route of Elimination-** Approximately fifty percent of Propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine after administration of immediate-release tablets.\n\n【108】*   **Half-Life-** Two to ten years.\n\n【109】**Usage Considerations-**\n\n【110】*   The use of Propafenone hydrochloride in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or in patients with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Propafenone hydrochloride tablets should not be used to control ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation.\n\n【111】*   Some patients with atrial flutter who underwent treatment with Propafenone hydrochloride have developed 1:1 conduction, producing an increased ventricular rate. Concomitant treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular nodal refractory period is recommended.\n\n【112】*   The use of Propafenone hydrochloride in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation has not yet been evaluated.\n\n【113】*   Due to the proarrhythmic effects of Propafenone hydrochloride, it is not recommended to be used with lesser ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are symptomatic. Any drug use should be reserved for patients for whom the physician feels the potential benefits can outweigh the risks.\n\n【114】**Dosage Administration-**\n\n【115】*   The dosage of Propafenone hydrochloride tablets should be individually titrated based on the response and tolerance of the patient.\n\n【116】*   Initiate the therapy with Propafenone hydrochloride tablets 150 milligrams, given every 8 hours (450 milligrams per day). Dosage can be increased at a minimum of three to four-day intervals to 225 milligrams every 8 hours (675 milligrams per day). If an additional therapeutic effect is needed, the dosage of Propafenone hydrochloride tablets can be increased to 300 milligrams every 8 hours (900 milligrams per day). The usefulness and safety of doses exceeding 900 milligrams per day have not yet been established.\n\n【117】*   In hepatic impairment patients or those with a significant widening of the QRS complex or second- or third-degree AV block, a reduction in the dosage should be considered.\n\n【118】*   With other antiarrhythmic agents, in elderly patients or in ventricular arrhythmia patients with previously marked myocardial damage, the dose of Propafenone hydrochloride should be increased gradually during the initial phase of treatment.\n\n【119】*   The combination of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition and either cytochrome P450 2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with the simultaneous administration of Propafenone can increase the concentration of Propafenone hydrochloride and hence increase the risk of pro-arrhythmia and other adverse events. Therefore, the continuous use of Propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 and a CYP3A4 inhibitor must be avoided.\n\n【120】**Adverse Reactions-**\n\n【121】*   Unusual taste.\n\n【122】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【123】*   Headache.\n\n【124】*   Dizziness.\n\n【125】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【126】*   Constipation.\n\n【127】*   Weakness.\n\n【128】*   Fatigue.\n\n【129】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【130】*   Dyspnoea.\n\n【131】*   CHF.\n\n【132】*   Wide complex tachycardia.\n\n【133】*   Palpitations.\n\n【134】*   Bradycardia.\n\n【135】*   Tremor.\n\n【136】*   Anorexia.\n\n【137】*   Ataxia.\n\n【138】**Contraindications**\n\n【139】Propafenone hydrochloride is contraindicated under the following conditions-\n\n【140】*   Heart failure.\n\n【141】*   Cardiogenic shock.\n\n【142】*   Sinoatrial, intraventricular, and atrioventricular disorders of impulse generation or conduction.\n\n【143】*   Brugada Syndrome.\n\n【144】*   Marked hypotension.\n\n【145】*   Bradycardia.\n\n【146】*   Bronchospastic disorders or severe obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【147】*   Marked electrolyte imbalance.\n\n【148】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【149】无关删除-1:<u>*   Propafenone hydrochloride  \n    https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Propafenone-hydrochloride\n*   Propafenone  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698002.html\n*   PROPAFENONE HYDROCHLORIDE tablet, film coated  \n    https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=d4a552ce-f215-4ec7-b5dd-aee266ba9b08\n*   Rythmol SR (Propafenone Hydrochloride) Capsules  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/nda/2003/21-416\\_Rythmol.cfm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

People squat when they want to pick things up from the floor, while working out, and while playing sports like basketball, volleyball, etc. During these exercises, one may experience pain or discomfort in the knee region. It can be due to various reasons. This article will explain the causes, remedies, and prevention of knee pain while squatting.\n\n【2】What Are the Possible Causes of Knee Pain While Squatting?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The common causes of knee pain while squatting are,\n\n【4】1.  Squatting all wrong.\n\n【5】2.  Twisting or spraining the knee.\n\n【6】3.  Tendonitis.\n\n【7】4.  Knee arthritis\n\n【8】5.  Iliotibial band syndrome.\n\n【9】6.  Cartilage tears.\n\n【10】7.  Patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n\n【11】*   **Squatting All Wrong -** The right way to squat is to sit with legs a little wider than the hip-width, bending the knees, bringing the hip back with chest upwards and shoulder backward. Squatting works the gluteus, thigh muscles like hamstrings and quadriceps, hip flexors, and calves muscles. Doing squats improperly can result in knee pain, and instead of working thigh muscles and gluteus muscles, pressure will be exerted on the knee area.\n\n【12】The most common mistakes made while squatting include placing the knees forward more than necessary, bending forward while squatting, and lifting the heels.\n\n【13】*   **Twisting or Spraining the Knee -** Knees are made of ligaments. Any injury to the ligaments will result in a sprain. Placing more weights on the knee, twisting the knee while squatting incorrectly, and a fall or a hit during sports activities are mainly major causes of knee sprain. A sprained knee will cause pain and swelling. Limping is also another sign of a sprained knee. With a sprained knee, squatting or doing any kind of exercise involving the knee becomes difficult.\n\n【14】*   **Tendonitis -** It is a condition of inflammation of the tendons (a connective tissue that connects muscle to the bone). Tendonitis of the knee is caused by the overuse of the knee during sports or exercises. Athletes are most commonly affected by tendonitis. Obesity, not enough shoe padding, uneven leg muscles, and not properly aligned legs, ankles, and knees are the contributing factors to tendonitis.\n\n【15】*   **Knee Arthritis -** Arthritis of the knee is characterized by the presence of pain, swelling, and stiffness. Arthritis gets worse with age, and there is no permanent cure. Only the symptoms can be controlled.\n\n【16】Cartilage tissue seen around the joints is responsible for producing cushioning effects to the bone. Due to inflammation and age, the cartilage wears out, and the joint (knee) becomes stiff and painful due to decreasing cushion effect.\n\n【17】*   **Iliotibial Band Syndrome -** Iliotibial band is a tendon that runs from the hip to the knee on the lateral side of the leg. The iliotibial band gets inflamed due to constant rubbing against the knee bone. The rubbing happens when the tendon becomes tight. This occurs especially while playing sports and squatting. People who work out without proper stretching are more likely to sustain this injury.\n\n【18】*   **Cartilage Tears -** A rigorous activity resulting in a knee injury can cause the cartilage to tear. Activities found to cause cartilage tears are climbing mountains and stairs, playing sports like football, squatting, bending the knee too much, etc. People affected by cartilage tears will experience symptoms like pain, popping noises in the knee, stiff knees, swelling, and pain while working out. This will usually require surgery and physiotherapy to heal.\n\n【19】*   **Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome -** Also known as runner’s knee, is a pain experienced in and around the knee. It is most common among people who do running and jumping a lot. People suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome often experience pain while taking the stairs, squatting, and bending the knees. Women are more likely to be affected by patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n\n【20】How to Manage Knee Pain While Squatting?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【21】1.  Commonly called RICE which means rest, ice, compress and elevate, it is used to relieve knee pain and swelling. Resting the leg by not doing the activities that elevate pain is essential. Icing the area of pain for 15 to 20 minutes will ease the pain rapidly. Compression using the elastic bandages can be done for the swelling to subside. Tight compression should be avoided, and a small area over the kneecap should be left open. Resting the legs over the pillow such that the legs are above the level of the heart offers good relief. Heat compression can also be done in the case of arthritis.\n\n【22】2.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are available to be bought over-the-counter. These medications can help ease the pain and inflammation.\n\n【23】3.  Physiotherapy to improve the muscle strength around the knees with mild exercises will be advised by the doctors.\n\n【24】4.  In case of severe pain and serious injury, arthroscopy and realignment surgeries are recommended. Arthroscopy involves a thin device inserted into the knee to find and rectify the damage.\n\n【25】How to Prevent Knee Pain While Squatting?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【26】1.  Warm-up is mandatory before starting a workout, especially for older people.\n\n【27】2.  Squatting has to be done in an appropriate way. To squat, one should stand in a position and gradually sit with the buttocks. During this, the thighs should be parallel to the floor, the back should be straight and should not bend, the buttocks should not be lower than the knee, and the foot should rest on the floor. One should not strain too much in order to prevent injuries.\n\n【28】3.  It is always advised to squat in front of a mirror to maintain eye contact.\n\n【29】To prevent the knee from being exposed to injuries causing pain and swelling, the following facts can be considered.\n\n【30】*   Discontinue the activity if it causes any discomfort.\n\n【31】*   Warm-up and cool-down during exercises should not be avoided.\n\n【32】*   Lose the extra pounds to eliminate pressure on the knee.\n\n【33】*   Stretching should be done on a daily basis to avoid the stiffness of muscles.\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】Knee pain is a common condition that can be commonly found with rigorous activities and aging. It is advisable to restrain from the activities causing knee pain. Diagnosing the causative factor and treating the condition in the early stages can prevent the worsening of the pain.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   Prevention and how to squat  \n    https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325246#prevention-and-how-to-squat\n*   8 Causes of Knee Pain When Squatting  \n    https://www.thehealthy.com/pain/knee-pain-when-squatting/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e5d576e6-18d0-4792-b0ed-034ccd6a9390", "title": "Myoclonic Seizure - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Myoclonic Seizure - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is a Myoclonic Seizure?\n----------------------------\n\n【1】It is a type of seizure where the muscles suddenly contract to cause quick twitching movements. An individual stays conscious during a myoclonic seizure attack. In most people, it involves the neck, shoulders, and upper arms of one side of the body, though rarely, it may affect the whole body. The underlying cause of myoclonic seizures is genetic factors. And it may be accompanied by cognitive and developmental problems as well.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Myoclonic Seizures?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The possible causes of myoclonic seizures are:\n\n【4】*   Genetic mutations- Those with a family history of epilepsy are at a higher risk.\n\n【5】*   Structural abnormalities in the brain at the time of development.\n\n【6】*   Tumors in the brain.\n\n【7】*   Infections involving the brain.\n\n【8】*   In traumatic head injury.\n\n【9】*   Stroke.\n\n【10】*   Inadequate oxygen supply to the brain.\n\n【11】*   In many individuals, the cause remains unknown.\n\n【12】How Can One Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of a Myoclonic Seizure?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The seizure attack is so short that often one may mistake it for a nervous reaction, simple muscle tics, or just going clumsy. Several myoclonic seizures may occur one after the other in clusters too. Myoclonic seizures may occur along with atonic seizures, which can cause sudden limpness in the body. One may fall suddenly (drop attack). The myoclonic jerks happen first, followed by a sudden loss of muscle tone. This is called a myoclonic atonic seizure. In the majority of individuals, a myoclonic seizure presents as:\n\n【14】1.  A quick jerking of muscles.\n\n【15】2.  Multiple rhythmic movements of the affected part.\n\n【16】3.  An electric shock-like sensation.\n\n【17】4.  Clumsy behavior.\n\n【18】What Are the Different Types of Myoclonic Seizures?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Myoclonic seizures appear as a part of the following epilepsy disorders:\n\n【20】**1) Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (Janz’s Syndrome)**\n\n【21】It normally starts in adolescence between the ages of twelve to eighteen. People with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have a higher-than-average chance of having a family member who has epilepsy. In the long run, they may have tonic-clonic seizures as well. This means the person may need treatment for life. In individuals with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy:\n\n【22】*   Seizures usually involve the neck, shoulders, and arms.\n\n【23】*   Occurs mostly while waking up from sleep.\n\n【24】*   Often begin in early puberty or adulthood.\n\n【25】*   It can be controlled with medication, but most often, seizures continue throughout the person’s life.\n\n【26】**2) Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS)**\n\n【27】It is a rare neurological disorder characterized by many seizures, including the myoclonic type. It usually starts between the ages of two to six and affects children with neurological disorders, traumatic brain damage, and developmental anomalies in the brain. The child may get atonic seizures, tonic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and absence seizures, along with myoclonic seizures. One may also have severe learning disabilities and physical limitations. Myoclonic seizures associated with LGS involve:\n\n【28】*   Jerking movements of the neck, shoulders, upper arms, and face.\n\n【29】*   They are strong and difficult to control.\n\n【30】*   One may require many types of treatments, such as surgery and a keto diet along with anticonvulsant medication.\n\n【31】**3) Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy**\n\n【32】In progressive myoclonic epilepsy, the symptoms usually start in late childhood or adolescence. It is a rare form of seizure consisting of different epilepsy syndromes. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes are caused by gene mutations. It is called progressive as it may get worsened over time. They include:\n\n【33】*   Conditions such as Lundborg disease, Lafora disease, sialidosis, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.\n\n【34】*   Developmental and physical impairments, as well as learning disabilities, depend on the severity of the syndrome.\n\n【35】*   An individual with progressive myoclonic epilepsy usually has a short life expectancy.\n\n【36】How Is a Myoclonic Seizure Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】A myoclonic seizure is often associated with other symptoms in individuals. It is essential to consult with a doctor and obtain a proper diagnosis. The doctor will evaluate the medical history and ask about the nature of symptoms at the time of the seizure attack. Since most types of myoclonic seizures are genetically passed on to the next generation, discussing family history with the doctor is very important. The additional diagnostic tests include:\n\n【38】1.  An electroencephalogram (EEG) is where one attaches electrodes to the patient’s scalp to understand the pattern of the brain’s electrical activity. This helps identify the part of the brain where seizures originate.\n\n【39】2.  Imaging studies like computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help identify structural abnormalities and tumor-like lesions inside the brain, which may start a seizure.\n\n【40】3.  A lumbar puncture (spinal tapping) procedure is where the doctor inserts a needle into the spine to extract a sample of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The fluid is examined for signs of infections or tumors.\n\n【41】4.  The doctor may order blood tests, too, to analyze signs of infections, electrolyte imbalance, etc.\n\n【42】How Is a Myoclonic Seizure Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【43】Most myoclonic seizures are difficult to treat and require multiple treatment modalities. The doctor may suggest a combination of the following treatments:\n\n【44】*   Common anticonvulsant medications such as Valproic acid, Levetiracetam, Zonisamide, and Benzodiazepines. For juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, one may prescribe Topiramate or Lamotrigine as well.\n\n【45】*   Special diet plans like the keto diet or Atkins diet which has low carbohydrates but are rich in fats.\n\n【46】*   A vagus nerve stimulator is often used to control seizures as well. Here an electrical stimulator is attached behind the neck to pass on electrical signals into the brain.\n\n【47】*   Lifestyle modifications like taking timely meals, getting adequate sleep, adopting stress management practices, avoiding lights that flicker inside the room, and limiting alcohol usage.\n\n【48】*   Rarely may one recommend surgery to remove the malfunctioning area of the brain from which the seizures originate.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Childhood myoclonic epilepsy often progresses into full-blown seizures (tonic-clonic) as they reach adulthood, adding to further complications to the individual's health. Myoclonic seizures are often brief and can easily be mistaken for tics or tremors. Hence, doctors often recommend that the caregivers of the affected individual keep a journal and write down the date and time when a seizure takes place and document how long the seizure lasted and what it looked like. Sharing this information with the physician can help them find the right treatment for the person having a seizure.\n\n【51】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【52】* * *\n\n【53】#### **1.**删除换行**Can You Classify Myoclonic as a Type of Seizure?**\n\n【54】Myoclonic can be characterized as a generalized form of seizure that causes sharp, uncontrollable muscle movements. The episodes are short and cause sudden limpness of the muscles.\n\n【55】#### **2.**删除换行**What Drugs Can Trigger Myoclonic Movements?**\n\n【56】Certain drugs such as Levodopa, antidepressants, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, antidiarrheal, bismuth subsalicylate, and anti-infectious medicines like antibiotics Cephalosporins, Clozapine can trigger unintentional muscle movements.\n\n【57】#### **3.**删除换行**What Most Commonly Triggers Myoclonic?**\n\n【58】Myoclonic is usually caused by abnormal activity in the brain or the spinal cord. This may happen due to alcohol, fatigue, injury, infection, fever, or stress. It often affects the nerves that are connecting the sensory organs and the muscles to the central nervous system.\n\n【59】#### **4.**删除换行**Is EEG Helpful to Diagnose Myoclonic Seizures?**\n\n【60】Yes, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common test used to detect a case of myoclonic seizure. The test is marked with generalized, irregular, and multi-spikes. These represent the increased electrical activity in the brain.\n\n【61】#### **5.**删除换行**Does Myoclonic Require Immediate Treatment**\n\n【62】Myoclonic seizures are not severe or painful, and therefore, do not require any kind of immediate treatment. The seizure rarely gets worse but can initiate other kinds of seizures. However, it may be required to treat the conditions that are causing them.\n\n【63】#### **6.**删除换行**Can We Treat Myoclonic Naturally?**\n\n【64】Exercising regularly can be helpful in reducing painful muscle twitching to a certain extent. Exercise can lead to further muscle twitching, but this helps to trick the brain to avoid assuming it is disease-related. Getting a regular massage can also help to reduce stress.\n\n【65】#### **7.**删除换行**How to Reduce Myoclonic Jerks?**\n\n【66】Myoclonic jerks cannot be controlled or stopped. Use of anticonvulsants such as Levetiracetam, Valproic acid, and Zonisamide may be used to reduce the intensity of the symptoms. The jerks usually do not last for more than a few seconds.\n\n【67】#### **8.**删除换行**How Can You Define Negative Myoclonus?**\n\n【68】Negative myoclonus is a motor disorder that involves sudden, involuntary interruption of muscle contraction. This sudden movement can cause postural lapses by interrupting muscle activity and cause a person to fall.\n\n【69】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Low Magnesium cause Myoclonus?**\n\n【70】Low magnesium, less than 0.8 mEq/L, can cause hypomagnesemia that may include vertigo (a sudden spinning sensation triggered by moving the head too quickly), myoclonus, nystagmus ( involuntary eye movement), and hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes).\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   Myoclonic Seizures  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/myoclonic-seizures\n*   Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/progressive-myoclonus-epilepsy/\n*   Myoclonic seizures  \n    https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/epileptic-seizures/myoclonic-seizures\n*   Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy.html\n*   Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/\n*   Myoclonic seizures  \n    https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/seizures/myoclonic-seizures\n*   Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a common epilepsy syndrome  \n    https://n.neurology.org/content/73/13/e64</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1d15a5ee-300c-4116-a34a-05ef553cf095", "title": "Augmented Reality in Orthopedics - A Comprehensive Review", "text": "【0】Augmented Reality in Orthopedics - A Comprehensive Review\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Digital technology and computer-assisted applications are being progressively used by the orthopedic fraternity in their day-to-day clinical practice. Imaging technologies like computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have revolutionized and greatly contributed to the precise diagnosis, close monitoring, and accurate treatment of several musculoskeletal disorders and related ailments. Augmented reality (AR) is an integrative technique that, combined with orthopedic applications like diagnosis and treatment interventions, would become a promising tool for orthopedic surgeons. This article reviews the diverse aspects of augmented reality (AR) in present-day orthopedic applications.\n\n【2】What Does Augmented Reality Mean?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Augmented reality (AR) refers to a three-dimensional display of digital technology that superimposes digital information and details onto the real-world environment. It involves overlaying digital images in the real world to enhance and visualize digital details. It is an emerging medicine technique with diverse applications, such as data visualization, preoperative planning, intraoperative management, intraoperative guidance for surgical tools, medical education, and advanced training. In the healthcare domain, augmented reality increases the technical skill and ability of the clinician, surgeon, or healthcare provider by perceiving intuitive medical information through virtual augmentation. AR refers to the augmentation of a real-world environment with detailed virtual information.\n\n【4】How Does Augmented Reality Work?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】A wide range of AR systems are being developed with advanced technology and are being implemented at both clinical and preclinical levels. Any AR system primarily consists of three main components. They are:\n\n【6】*   **Position Tracking System** - It monitors the location and the exact orientation of the study object or operative field.\n\n【7】*   **Display System** - It contains a semi-transparent head-mounted or standard display screen to project the real image superimposed on a virtual image. It augments the user’s view through a monitor-based, optical, or video see-through display system.\n\n【8】*   **Control Software System** - This system combines the visual image details and the digital data present in the tracking system for visualization on the display screen. This control software processes and updates the available data faster, providing the clinician with a detailed and accurate real-time image display.\n\n【9】In current clinical practice, some AR systems are supplemented with conventional imaging modalities like CT scans and fluoroscopic images obtained during preoperative procedures. The control software system uses these image inputs and positioning markers to determine the relative object position in the operative field. Augmented reality systems comprise sophisticated hardware and advanced software for offering accurate computer-processed images and virtual data to surgeons in real-time environments so that real-life operational sites or objects can be combined with computer-generated virtual images.\n\n【10】How Is Augmented Reality Used in Orthopedics?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The AR system is greatly used in preoperative diagnosis and surgical interventional procedures in orthopedics. Augmented reality finds its usage in orthopedic surgeries in the following ways:\n\n【12】*   Visualizing clinical data like medical images of surgical importance obtained during preoperative and intra-operative procedures.\n\n【13】*   It aids in mechanical procedures like insertions of implants or screws, surgical bone-cutting (osteotomies), and correcting musculoskeletal deformities.\n\n【14】*   It helps visualize the anatomical structures and rigid relations in augmented real environments.\n\n【15】*   In tumor surgeries, augmented reality helps visualize the three-dimensional expansion of the bone tumor, which is a crucial step in proper surgical resection of the malignancies.\n\n【16】*   In trauma care, AR systems enable surgeons to visualize preoperative osteointegration plate models and virtually created models simultaneously, which favors the selection of optimal implant models appropriate for the clinical conditions.\n\n【17】*   Augmented reality enhances orthopedic surgical training like arthroscopy and advanced education when combined with telemedicine facilities.\n\n【18】What Are the Clinical Implications of AR Systems in Orthopedics?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】In recent years, various studies have documented the use of augmented reality (AR) systems in both preclinical orthopedic research and clinical practice. Substantial scientific evidence suggests that AR systems could be a useful and integrative tool in orthopedic applications like preoperative decision-making and intra-operative guidance. Some of the current implications of AR systems in orthopedics are as follows -\n\n【20】*   **Camera-Augmented C-Arm AR Systems -** These are used in various procedures like implant removal and nail, screw, and plate removal aided by fluoroscopy. Augmented reality techniques markedly reduced (nearly half) the number of X-ray shots in these procedures.\n\n【21】*   **Virtual Interactive Presence (VIP) -** It is an interactive AR system where two real-time streaming videos, recorded separately in remote fields, are merged for a single common operational field facilitating interaction in real-time with surgeons in remote healthcare settings. VIP technology is commonly used in performing shoulder arthroscopy procedures. VIP-AR technology is an effective teaching tool for medical students and orthopedic residents. Total shoulder arthroplasty procedures are also performed by combining VIP-AR systems and wearable computing equipment, which provides significant postoperative motion range and considerable pain reduction.\n\n【22】*   **AR-Hip -** Through this AR system, the orthopedic surgeon could view the image of the acetabular cup (of the hip joint) being overlaid on the real operational field through a smartphone display. It enables better visualization of the inclination and anteversion angles of the acetabulum (interior of the hip joint). Successful total hip arthroplasty procedures are performed using AR-HIP systems. In fractures involving the pelvis and acetabulum (hip joint), virtual fracture reduction systems comprising AR-aided templates, personal computers, and video cameras are used. These AR-based reconstruction plates relatively reduce the operative time duration and surgical complexity leading to minimal invasiveness. In spine surgeries, surgical navigation AR systems employs video inputs from multiple cameras, favoring acceptable duration for navigation and offering high accuracy in pedicle screw placement.\n\n【23】*   **Augmented Reality Computer Assisted Spine Surgery (ARCASS) -** Here, a projector and a camera are used to project the three-dimensional (3D) preoperative model of the individual undergoing spinal surgery onto the intraoperative field. This AR-based system reduces operative time and radiation doses to the patients.\n\n【24】*   **Virtual Protractor With Augmented Reality (VIPAR) -** It comprises a tracking camera with a head-mounted display and a marker sheet for three-dimensional visualization of the needle trajectory in percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures. It facilitates surgeons in finding the accurate needle trajectory. AR systems create virtual planes for resection and spinal osteotomy volumes preoperatively during spinal surgeries. These systems, controlled by intraoperative visualization, transfer 3D operational plans to navigation systems through head-up displays in surgical microscopes.

It is the most common form of chronic hepatitis globally. Most chronic cases are transmitted to the child from the mother (mother-to-child transmission). About 15 to 40% of individuals affected by chronic HBV develop complications like liver cirrhosis and cancer, often leading to death. Mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection can either occur during the pregnancy period or during delivery. Taking proper preventive measures, including vaccinations, helps reduce the mother-to-child transmission of HBV. The preventive measures include maternal screening, the use of antiviral drugs for high-risk pregnant mothers infected with HBV, and postexposure preventive measures, which include HBV vaccination.\n\n【2】What Are the Risk Factors for Perinatal HBV Transmission?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】HBV transmission in infants and young children takes place through the following routes:\n\n【4】*   Perinatal transmission.\n*   Transmission from infected mother to child- Vertical transmission.\n*   Transmission from infected household to child- Horizontal transmission.\n\n【5】Hepatitis B virus is a double-stranded virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family. It consists of a viral envelope (that contains HBsAg) and a nucleocapsid core (HBcAg). Regional prevalence and disease severity vary. It is transmitted through body fluids and remains viable on surfaces for a week. A positive HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) indicates an acute or chronic infection. HBsAg is the marker for maternal HBV screening. HBeAg in serum indicates viral replication; it can cross the placenta and cause infection in the infant.\n\n【6】One of the most important risk factors for perinatal HBV transmission is the high level of HBV DNA (Hepatitis B virus DNA) in pregnant women. HBV DNA test helps in determining the viral load in the blood. The HBV replication in embryos from mothers with high-level HBV DNA is higher than in mothers with undetectable HBV DNA levels.\n\n【7】What Are the Different Routes of Mother-To-Child Transmission?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The different routes of mother-to-child transmission are:\n\n【9】*   **Intrauterine Transmission:**\n\n【10】Intrauterine transmission can occur during the early embryonic stage, and transmission can occur through maternal oocytes or sperms. Transmission during the intrauterine period can also occur through maternal blood or placental leakage during the time of early labor (preterm labor).\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Abdominal ultrasound showed enlarged liver and diffuse coarse structure.

Transmission through breast milk is controversial. The risk of transmission is greater if there is abrasion on the nipples.\n\n【18】What Are the Clinical Features of HBV Infection?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Acute HBV infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of hepatitis and include:\n\n【20】*   Fatigue.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Vomiting.\n*   Low-grade fever.\n*   Anorexia.\n*   Myalgia.\n\n【21】Acute HBV symptoms are similar for both non-pregnant and pregnant women. In less than 1% of acute infections, fulminant hepatitis occurs, leading to irreversible liver damage and death.\n\n【22】Chronic infection has three immunologic phases:\n\n【23】*   Immune tolerant.\n*   Immune active.\n*   Inactive carrier.\n\n【24】The immune tolerant phase is commonly seen in perinatal transmission cases.\n\n【25】What Are the Preventive Measures?\n---------------------------------\n\n【26】Per the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendation, pregnant women should be screened for HBsAg at their first prenatal visit. HBsAg-negative pregnant women who are not vaccinated and are at risk of developing infection should be vaccinated during pregnancy.\n\n【27】Women who are at risk of developing infections are:\n\n【28】*   Diabetes.\n*   HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) infection.\n*   Chronic liver disorder.\n*   Renal disease.\n*   Drug users.\n*   Having HBsAg positive sexual partner.\n\n【29】The preventive strategies include:\n\n【30】**1\\. Care For HBsAg-Positive Pregnant Women:**\n\n【31】As per the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendation, all pregnant HBsAg-positive women receive management for chronic HBV infection.\n\n【32】**2\\. Decontaminating Newborn:**\n\n【33】Bathing the newborn with mild soap and water helps remove body fluids and HBV-contaminated blood and thus aids in minimizing the risk of infection.\n\n【34】**3\\. Post-exposure Prophylaxis:**\n\n【35】Post-exposure prophylaxis involves the administration of hepatitis B vaccination within twelve hours of birth and completing the vaccination series. High maternal HBV DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) levels and maternal HBeAg positivity, not completing the vaccine series, and delay in timely administration of the Hepatitis B birth dose increase the failure of post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\n【36】**4\\. Antiviral Prophylaxis:**\n\n【37】Lamivudine is commonly used for antiretroviral prophylaxis against HBV infection. It acts against HBV replication. Telbivudine is another antiviral used for prophylaxis and is a thymidine nucleoside analog.\n\n【38】**5\\. HBV Screening During Pregnancy:**\n\n【39】Along with other routine screening tests done during the first prenatal visit, HBV screening should also be done. It is recommended to be carried out in all pregnant women, whether they have received a vaccination or have done previous tests. Screening is the most important factor that helps control HBV transmission. The screening test is extremely important because the perinatal transmission rate is very high. It helps identify pregnant women who require antiviral therapy and newborns who need prophylaxis.\n\n【40】**6\\. Mode of Delivery:**\n\n【41】There is no clear evidence of a relationship between the mode of delivery and the risk of HBV transmission from mother to baby. Some studies have shown that ECS (elective caesarian section) is more favorable than vaginal birth as the risk of transmission is comparatively lower in ECS.\n\n【42】**7\\. Low-Birth Weight Babies:**\n\n【43】In preterm infants and low birth weight infants whose weight is less than 4.4 pounds, the first dose of the HBV vaccine is deferred until two months of age. In cases where maternal screening was not done, or the mother was HBsAg positive, the first HBV dose should be administered at birth, and four HBV vaccine doses should be given. Only in the case of low-risk infants should the dose be deferred.\n\n【44】**8\\. Breastfeeding:**\n\n【45】Most studies suggest no significant increase in the risk of HBV transmission in breastfed infants, and the risk is further reduced with immunoprophylaxis.\n\n【46】**9\\. Neonatal Management:**\n\n【47】Immunoprophylaxis administration in newborns reduces the risk of HBV transmission. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and HBV vaccination should be administered within a day after birth, followed by timely vaccine doses. Though the usual route of HBV vaccine administration is intramuscular, studies have shown that the intradermal route may increase immunogenicity.\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】Having an HBV infection while pregnant can pose a serious risk to the baby. The chronicity rate is higher for perinatal infections when compared to adult transmission. Proper maternal screening and preventive measures play a significant role in reducing the perinatal transmission of HBV.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   HBV Perinatal Transmission  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659463/\n*   Prevention of Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Transmission  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4164184/\n*   PERINATAL HEPATITIS B  \n    https://oeps.wv.gov/hbv/Pages/hbv\\_perinatal.aspx</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This protein-energy metabolism, in other words, is the cellular balance for nutrient enrichment in our system that in turn ensures or promotes growth maintenance and development. PEM or protein-energy malnutrition occurs when a dietary insufficiency of proteins would be either acute or chronic in origin. Affected children are at increased risk of multisystemic diseases apart from gross oral impact exhibited due to nutritional deficiencies.\n\n【2】Protein-energy malnutrition nearly affects 5-6 million children globally, as per the 2006 UNICEF report given the lack of a proteinaceous diet to compensate for children of low socioeconomic status in developing countries. This breach of immune defenses seen mainly due to imbalanced protein-energy metabolism in this global condition may result in numerous immunodeficiencies, mainly in children below five years of age and young adults. The most common systemic comorbidities resulting from poverty are especially diarrhea and malaria. Though initial symptoms of these conditions can be addressed effectively by the physician, these children are still prone to health risks like the transmission of infectious diseases via community spread or prenatal and genetic components of malnutrition hampering their immunity.\n\n【3】The risk of hospitalization is observed more with the occurrence of the following diseases that may increase the fatality or mortality rate:\n\n【4】*   HIV infection.\n\n【5】*   Otitis media.\n\n【6】*   Rickets.\n\n【7】*   Anemia.\n\n【8】*   Keratomalacia.\n\n【9】*   Pneumonia.\n\n【10】*   Tuberculosis.\n\n【11】*   Cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n【12】*   Hypophosphatemia.\n\n【13】These conditions lead to eventual loss of gastrointestinal immunity, and increased metabolic demand of the body causes fat and visceral volume loss (due to electrolyte imbalance and abnormalities). Severe cases of PEM do result in multi-organ failure if not treated in time.\n\n【14】How Does Protein-Energy Malnutrition Impact Oral Health?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】**Vitamin B Deficiency -**\n\n【16】*   In children suffering from PEM, iron and folic acid deficiency often accompanies vitamin B complex deficiency (iron absorption orally may also be severely impaired in most children). Vitamin B supplementation, mainly in the form of vitamin B12 along with folic acid and iron, are fundamental constituents to the functioning of erythrocytes (red blood cells) of the bone marrow.\n\n【17】*   Burning sensation in the mouth, angular cheilitis (cracking at the mouth corners), sore throat, oral aphthous ulcerations, oral mucosal inflammation or inflammation of the tongue, and its borders usually signify vitamin B deficiency. It is usually due to vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) deficiency or vitamin B complex (B12) deficiency, or, in other words, pernicious anemia.\n\n【18】*   Vitamin B2 or riboflavin deficiency can also lead to a condition that is a combination or triad of cracked lips, burning mouth, tongue inflammation, or oral mucosal inflammation, also known as ariboflavinosis or a deficiency of riboflavin.\n\n【19】**Vitamin C and Calcium Deficiency -**\n\n【20】*   Vitamin C deficiency or ascorbic acid deficiency, also known as scurvy, is a detrimental impediment to healthy connective tissue and gingiva. That is why gingival bleeding, defective collagen synthesis, and impaired wound healing in the oral cavity due to lowered antioxidant bound immunity are all a part of vitamin C deficient features clinically in PEM children. Vitamin C is also linked to periodontal health.\n\n【21】*   Calcium deficiency is also linked to periodontal health as calcium plays a crucial role in maintaining and protecting alveolar bone. Bone density is mainly affected due to disturbance in the calcium metabolism and lowered calcium levels.\n\n【22】**Bacterial Colonization and Hypomineralization of Enamel -**\n\n【23】*   Similarly, a strong relationship or a linear linkage of enamel hypoplasia has been evidently documented in undernourished or malnutrition children.\n\n【24】*   Hypomineralization of enamel causes the bacterium to invade the tooth's enamel at a quickened pace, with the primary maxillary incisors being affected the most, as per research. Cariogenic bacteria causing dental caries is a sequela often following hypomineralized enamel (host factors and a diet of fermentable carbohydrates are other factors linked to dental caries in children). It leads to rapid progression of dental carious lesions causing dental decay and pain in children.\n\n【25】*   According to research conducted in the Indian continent, children and young infants suffering from PEM (early childhood PEM/EC-PEM) had a reduction in salivary secretion, low serum concentrations of vitamin A, lowered protein secretion, and also a reduction in the defense factors (agglutinating factors) in saliva.\n\n【26】*   These reduced oral cavity immune defense mechanisms also result in poor nutritional status, stunted growth, and delayed eruption patterns throughout childhood.\n\n【27】*   Dental caries can thus be defined mainly as carious lesions in the teeth due to the demineralization of the enamel and the dentine by organic acids (which are formed by the bacteria in the dental plaque) through the anaerobic metabolism of dietary derived sugars.\n\n【28】What Is the Treatment for Protein-Energy Malnutrition?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】1.  The dental surgeon should primarily address dietary issues and advise suitable vitamin supplementation and prophylactic and restorative treatment for the affected (or impacted) teeth. Timely diagnosis and intervention by the dentist in these children for observing the impact of PEM on permanent erupting dentition would be incredibly beneficial for addressing prosthetic and restorative concerns if needed.\n\n【30】2.  PEM usually requires multidisciplinary management via all aspects of medicine, mainly addressing the patients' environmental needs, dietary changes, and feeding assistance.\n\n【31】3.  Daily nutrient supply in these patients may be increased upto 2 gram of protein per kilogram bodyweight. In those hospitalized due to PEM, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities need to be attended by the physician along with management of hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and diarrhea by the diabetologist, cardiologist, and gastroenterologist.\n\n【32】4.  Parenteral supplementation of vitamins and magnesium supplementation (0.4 mEq/kg/day) is necessary for at least a week. Due to low oral absorption of iron, these children need oral or intramuscular iron supplementation.\n\n【33】**Conclusion:**\n\n【34】PEM is not just a multisystemic condition in affected children, but it also impairs oral health and well-being to the maximal extent. Hence treatment should include diverse approaches from physicians and dental surgeons and a nutrient-rich diet, supplementation, and vitamin therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

People living in milder climates are vulnerable to seasonality. The seasonal changes show evidence of changes in cardiovascular functioning. There are attenuated peaks of cardiovascular events during the summer and winter seasons. It can be described as winter peaks and summer troughs. Populations in the North and Southern hemisphere showed higher winter rates of cardiac events.\n\n【2】What Are the Factors Influencing Seasonal Variations of CVD?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Seasonal variations cause sudden rise and fall in temperatures and can affect the circulatory system and certain health parameters. The incidence of disease and mortality increases during winter seasons. In England and Wales, the winter peak results in an average of 20,000 deaths every year. The seasonal variations also change lifestyle, dietary habits, and physical activity. All these together can influence the functioning of the heart and leads to cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【4】Various factors can lead to changes in coronary heart disease. The incidence, survival, and mortality rate also changes in different seasons. Coronary heart disease can be more fatal in low temperatures. The various risk factors are\n\n【5】*   Environmental factors like temperature and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\n【6】*   Lifestyle factors - obesity, exercise, diet, and smoking.\n\n【7】*   Blood pressure.\n\n【8】*   Serum cholesterol level.\n\n【9】*   Coagulation factors.\n\n【10】*   Acute and chronic infections.\n\n【11】**Temperature:**\n\n【12】There is residual variation in cardiovascular diseases due to differences in Environmental temperature. A lower temperature may exert a direct effect on the heart.\n\n【13】Indirect effects can occur due to changes in blood pressure.\n\n【14】In very low temperatures, conditions like angina can worsen.\n\n【15】In low temperatures, the body surface is cooled and causes peripheral vasoconstriction resulting in increased cardiac output, circulating noradrenaline, and blood pressure.\n\n【16】The cardiovascular changes to temperature in a healthy adult are less, or the body can cope with the situation.\n\n【17】Low temperature or cold is associated with high systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The oxygen consumption of the heart is increased. The increased demand cannot be met in a compromised circulation of the heart, and this leads to myocardial ischemia and later results in angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Long-term variations and blood pressure can lead to coronary heart disease.\n\n【18】Coronary heart disease mortality is strongly associated with temperature deviation from the average temperature. Extreme variations in hot and cold temperatures can increase coronary heart disease mortality. In cold Climatic temperatures, insulation has a protective effect.\n\n【19】People living in higher altitudes with lower temperature conditions have a reduced incidence of developing coronary heart disease.\n\n【20】**Ultraviolet Radiation:**\n\n【21】Exposure of the skin surface to sunlight leads to vitamin D synthesis. And lower levels of vitamin D can be linked to coronary heart disease.\n\n【22】This relation should be independent of other factors like smoking, medications for hypertension, body mass, and previous history of angina.\n\n【23】**Serum Cholesterol Level:**\n\n【24】The level of vitamin D affects the serum cholesterol level, which is a risk factor for heart disease. The level of vitamin D decreases during cold climate conditions and leads to higher levels of cholesterol.\n\n【25】**Coagulation Factors:**\n\n【26】Hematologic parameters like hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), hematocrit, fibrinolytic activity, and platelet levels show changes in a change in environmental temperature. Lower temperatures can increase platelets and red blood cells. The plasma volume is also reduced. Lower temperature and increased incidence of respiratory infections result in winter rise of fibrinogen concentrations. The changes in coagulation factors are linked to seasonal variations in cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolic disorders.\n\n【27】**Acute Respiratory Infections:**\n\n【28】Cardiovascular disease and respiratory infections show a peak during the winter season. Reduced temperature can suppress the immune system and leads to a high risk of respiratory infections. Respiratory infections like influenza increase the plasma fibrinogen and inhibition of fibrinolysis. These vascular changes increase the risk of arterial thrombosis and developing coronary heart disease. The changes associated with the respiratory system are primarily seen in elderly people.\n\n【29】**Age and Sex:**\n\n【30】Age and sex are not important factors in the seasonal variation of heart diseases.\n\n【31】Coronary heart disease mortality increases with age in winter peaks. It is also linked to other factors like less physical activity, spending more time outside, less use of protective clothing, and poor household heating. Previous history of coronary heart disease can aggregate in such conditions.\n\n【32】**Time Trend:**\n\n【33】In the USA, there is a time trend for the seasonality of diseases. Similarly, the prevalence of various heart diseases has a time trend concerning climatic changes and other risk factors.\n\n【34】What Are the Lifestyle Factors Affecting the Cardiovascular Diseases?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】**Diet and Obesity:**\n\n【36】Body weight also shows variations in seasons. Obesity is common during the winter season due to less physical activity and high intake of fat. Diet does not have much effect over seasons. Intake of vitamin C is also reduced in winter. These can be a factor for changes in cardiovascular activity.\n\n【37】**Exercise:**\n\n【38】It is important to stay physically active and fit for good functioning of the heart and to stay away from heart problems. An inactive or sedentary lifestyle can be a risk factor for heart disease.\n\n【39】Certain physical activities are done only during certain periods. Generally, physical activity is very less during winter seasons. Simple activities like cycling, walking, and exercise help to improve cardiac function. And the effects of temperature will not be affected seriously. At the same time, high levels of physical activity in low temperatures can increase the mortality rate. It has deleterious effects on heart functioning and can cause death.\n\n【40】**Smoking:**\n\n【41】In cold climate conditions, smoking also increases. Since smoking is an important risk factor for heart disease, it should be controlled.\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】Seasonal variations are reported in various regions with extreme climatic conditions. Proper study related to seasonal variations can help reduce the prevalence and mortality of diseases. Underlying heart diseases, age, physical inactivity, less use of protective clothing, and inadequate indoor heating can make the condition severe and lead to death. Understanding the seasonal variations and preparing the body to keep a healthy heart functioning is of prime consideration. The mortality and morbidity rate increases during the winter, than the summer season.\n\n【44】Seek help from a doctor or health care provider to have customized changes to the lifestyle and to follow.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Seasonal variations in cardiovascular disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28518176/\n*   Environmental Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306458\n*   Seasonal Variation of Overall and Cardiovascular Mortality:  \n    https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113500</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "49b48f3a-4f2a-460d-9c17-606ff9a17421", "title": "Frey's Syndrome (Auriculotemporal Syndrome)", "text": "【0】Frey's Syndrome (Auriculotemporal Syndrome)\nWhat Do You Mean by Frey’s Syndrome?\n------------------------------------\n\n【1】This condition was first described by Lucie Frey in 1923 and is also commonly known as an auriculotemporal syndrome in the medical literature. Frey’s syndrome, hitherto thought to be rare, is a nerve injury-related traumatic postoperative phenomenon that may occur after a parotid gland surgery. The main characteristics that distinguish Frey’s syndrome are gustatory sweating or flushing. To put it in simpler terms, the patient starts to sweat whenever salivation tends to occur. Sweating or often both sweating and flushing happens over the preauricular areas. Whenever it starts to happen, it is accompanied by flushing or reddening of the cheeks, temple region of the forehead, or over the neck whenever the person is in a natural situation to salivate. For example, if a person eats or thinks about food, salivating is a natural impulse, but in this case, when the nerve is injured, the patient starts to flush and sweat.\n\n【2】What Causes Frey’s Syndrome?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Frey’s syndrome occurs due to nerve aberration, which can be related to the direct or indirect injury to the auriculotemporal nerve and most often follows a surgical injury to the parotid salivary gland most commonly after parotidectomy (the surgical excision of this large salivary gland usually precedent due to infections or neoplasms that would be benign or malignant).\n\n【4】The causes though not exactly correlatable in all the cases, mainly remains to be one of the following,\n\n【5】*   Trauma to the auriculotemporal nerve branch.\n\n【6】*   Pathologic entities or lesions of the parotid gland as in neoplasms (benign or malignant tumors).\n\n【7】*   Parotid gland infections.\n\n【8】*   Sympathetic nerve dysfunctionalities.\n\n【9】*   Accidental injuries to the preauricular area or the face.\n\n【10】*   Local or systemic infections that affect salivary glands.\n\n【11】How Common Is Frey’s Syndrome?\n------------------------------\n\n【12】Initially, in the earlier decades, this syndrome was thought of as a rare postoperative syndrome or an adverse effect of the auriculotemporal nerve, but it is not a very uncommon diagnosis by the physicians now given that the incidence of 4 to 62% of post parotidectomy patients presents with Frey’s syndrome in a period of the half to one and a half year post-surgery. This is the reason why most parotid gland surgeries are also treated with facial reconstructive surgeries post the procedure because the incidence of parotid gland surgery without facial reconstruction is thought of as another major cause of this syndrome.\n\n【13】What Are the Characteristic Features of Frey’s Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The syndrome is not limited to only salivary stimulus but also reflects in the patient during a masticatory stimulus that aggravates the clinical symptoms (in response to masticatory or bite stimuli). The sweat glands and cutaneous areas are innervated by the parasympathetic postganglionic nerve fibers that may extend into the cutaneous tissues. This results in the clinical features of flushing, sweating, or even itching, burning sensations that may be a source of great discomfiture and personal anxiety to the suffering patient.\n\n【15】Apart from the clinical features of erythema or facial redness and sweating instead of salivating in response to a salivary stimulus, the patient can also reportedly have nasal discharges that can be embarrassing while smelling food. Between the painful bouts or attacks, the patient can experience a temporary form of numbness or altered sensations like burning in the affected area (paresthesia sensation often as a result of “gustatory neuralgia”).\n\n【16】What Is the Pathogenesis of Frey’s Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Frey’s syndrome prevalence is almost equal in males and females. In the early part of the course, the auriculotemporal branch of the Mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve within the parotid gland is impacted by trauma. The trigeminal nerve not only functions to supply the sweat glands of our scalp but also supplies parasympathetic nerve fibers to the parotid gland.\n\n【18】How Is the Diagnosis of Frey’s Syndrome Made?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The diagnosis of Frey’s syndrome is usually most commonly by the test called the “starch-iodine” test that is primarily used for the evaluation of sudomotor functions in patients suffering from Horner’s syndrome and Frey’s syndrome. Underactive as well as an overactive sweat gland (hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis) can be tested through this method. The affected area of the face is firstly painted with a tincture of iodine and then allowed to dry. An increase in room temperature or salivary stimulating or pressure-inducing medications like Pilocarpine is given to the patient after dusting the dried part with cornstarch. The aim of this diagnostic method is to visualize sweat when it reaches the cutaneous or skin surface. In the presence of iodine solution, the starch turns blue if sweat is present. The color change is a useful indicator in detecting Frey’s syndrome.\n\n【20】How Can Frey’s Syndrome Be Prevented?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】**Minimally Invasive Surgeries and Facial Reconstruction:** Though facial reconstructive surgery post a parotidectomy procedure or surgery of the parotid gland may be useful in preventing Frey’s syndrome, current modalities of surgical treatment to minimize the traumatic impact onto the preauricular area remains the most effective strategy to prevent this condition from occurring. Most surgeries of the parotid gland are more traditional in approach and do not use any barrier methods or techniques while operating. However, evidence suggests that Frey’s syndrome can be prevented by using barrier reconstruction between the salivary gland nerves and the sweat glands post a parotidectomy procedure and is another highly preventive strategy.\n\n【22】The incorporation of a barrier between the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers and cutaneous tissues is the key to effective prevention. Similarly, research studies show that a decrease in the skin surface area reduces the overall severity of this condition as it occurs as a post-surgical effect. To prevent the reinnervation of the postganglionic fibers to the sweat glands, fascia flaps, or transposition muscle flap, the temporoparietal fascia flap (TPPF) are two common surgical flap methods for increasing the accessibility, decreasing the surface area of the skin, and also for their increased predictability in vasculature. Hence increased flap thickness, autologous and biosynthetic material grafting can be useful surgical methods during surgery. Endoscopic surgeries, transoral parotidectomy, and parotidectomy performed by mini incisions are some of the minimally invasive alternate surgical techniques to prevent this syndrome.\n\n【23】What Treatment Methods Are Available for Frey’s Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Topical antiperspirant medications like Scopolamine, Glycopyrrolate, or currently the most commonly used BTA injection (Botulinum Toxin A) into the affected area intradermally, has proven effective in these patients. Studies have demonstrated that BTA injection significantly improves the patient’s life quality by reducing stress and anxiety and improving gustatory symptoms. But BTA injection is also associated with a symptomatic recurrence rate in the patient between 1 to 3 years after the injection.\n\n【25】Surgical management for Frey’s syndrome is not typically advocated by surgeons owing to the risk of facial nerve injuries though a few documented cases of surgical transection of auriculotemporal, tympanic, or greater auricular nerve are present.\n\n【26】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】#### **1.**删除换行**What Causes Frey's Syndrome?**\n\n【29】A syndrome that includes gustatory sweating (sweating while eating) and facial flushing is known as Frey's syndrome. An injury to the auriculotemporal nerve causes it, usually after a surgical trauma to the parotid gland.  \n\n【30】#### **2.**删除换行**What Happens in Frey's Syndrome?**\n\n【31】The mechanism for Frey syndrome is aberrant reinnervation of postganglionic parasympathetic neurons to cutaneous blood vessels and nearby denervated sweat glands. Consequently, it results in sweating and flushing in the sympathetically void skin in response to salivation and mastication.  \n\n【32】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Frey Syndrome Permanent?**\n\n【33】The Frey's syndrome barrier has to either permanently remain in place or can be replaced by dense body fibrosis. It has to be replaced to prevent parasympathetic parotid fibers' growth toward the facial skin sweat glands.\n\n【34】#### **4.**删除换行**How Common Is Frey's Syndrome?**\n\n【35】Frey's syndrome is rare, but the exact incidence is unknown. This condition most often occurs as a complication of parotidectomy (the surgical removal of a parotid gland). The percentage of people who develop Frey's syndrome after a parotidectomy is estimated to be 30 to 50 percent.  \n\n【36】#### **5.**删除换行**Does Hyperhidrosis Get Better with Age?**\n\n【37】Hyperhidrosis does not decrease or go away with age, and it also depends on how you get hyperhidrosis. In fact, 88% of patients say that their excessive sweating has gotten worse over time.  \n\n【38】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Auriculotemporal Nerve?**\n\n【39】The auriculotemporal nerve (ATN), a branch of the mandibular nerve, provides sensation to several regions on either side of the head, such as the ear, jaw, and scalp. It runs through the structures of the head and face along the superficial temporal artery and vein.  \n\n【40】#### **7.**删除换行**Is the Auriculotemporal Nerve a Branch of the Mandibular Nerve?**\n\n【41】The trigeminal nerve has three main branches, and one of them is the mandibular nerve (V3). The mandibular nerve has four main branches, and one of them is the auriculotemporal nerve that runs with the superficial temporal vein and artery and provides sensory innervation to other regions on the side of the head.  \n\n【42】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Frey's Syndrome?**\n\n【43】The symptoms of Frey's syndrome include:  \n• Flushing.  \n• Sweating.  \n• Burning.  \n• Neuralgia.  \n• Itching.  \nUsually, the symptoms are mild but can result in discomfort as well as social avoidance and anxiety.  \n\n【44】#### **9.**删除换行**What Nerve Is Involved in Frey's Syndrome?**\n\n【45】When the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves near the parotid glands are cut, especially the tiny branches originating from the auriculotemporal nerve, it results in Frey's syndrome, also known as an auriculotemporal syndrome. The auriculotemporal nerve supplies nerves to certain structures in the sides of the face, including the parotid glands.  \n\n【46】#### **10.**删除换行**Why Do I Feel Really Hot after Eating?**\n\n【47】It is common to sweat during or after eating. In some people, sweating occurs on the scalp, face, or neck when they are eating hot or spicy foods and drinks. In such cases, the person's body responds naturally to the rise in body temperature through sweat.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is primarily found in the form of Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN), which is colorless at room temperature. People usually get exposed to cyanide through exhaust from vehicles or mills and industrial treatment work, contaminating water due to the discharge of wastes from chemicals or iron steel industries. In addition, any substance that has nitrogen and carbon content present can release cyanide under a particular condition when burnt.\n\n【2】What Is Cyanide?\n----------------\n\n【3】Cyanide is a harmful, deadly substance in various forms, such as Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in colorless gaseous form and Potassium cyanide (KCN) in crystal form.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Cyanide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Cyanide poisoning is usually caused by medical exposures, industrial fireworks, and domestic fires. Electroplating injury, fumigation, metallurgy pesticides, rubber manufacturing, etc. are some examples of cyanide used for manufacturing. Also, some hypertensive medical emergency cases are treated with the help of cyanide exposure, thus, causing poisoning in the body over time. Cyanide poisoning can be caused by infusion, inhalation, or ingestion exposure leading to death in patients by cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, or metabolic acidosis.\n\n【6】What Are the Types of Cyanide Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   **Acute Cyanide Poisoning -** This usually occurs due to unintentional exposure to cyanide and requires immediate treatment before it becomes life-threatening. Symptoms associated with acute poisoning include seizures, cardiac arrest, difficulty breathing, and loss of consciousness.\n\n【8】*   **Chronic Cyanide Poisoning -** Prolonged exposure to hydrogen cyanide gas over 20 to 40 ppm can lead to severe poisoning. It causes dilated pupils, vertigo, drowsiness, convulsions, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【9】What Are the Different Sources of Cyanide Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   **Plants -** Some plants contain cyanogenic properties and can cause cyanide poisoning. These include apricot, plum, pear, peach, apple, etc. In addition, some varieties of potatoes called cassava can also cause toxicity. However, only high levels of ingestion of these plants can cause cyanide toxicity.\n\n【11】*   **Fire -** Burning of rubber or plastic substances releases smoke, causing toxicity.\n\n【12】*   Photography, fumigation, chemical processing, and industrial electroplating use hydrogen cyanide, and insecticide manufacturing use potassium cyanides, which causes severe environmental toxicity.\n\n【13】*   **Smoking -** Tobacco is also one of the significant sources of cyanide, found naturally; therefore, cigarette smoking can cause severe cyanide poisoning in people.\n\n【14】*   Some varieties of chemicals like nail paint removers and other thinners are no longer available in the market as they can automatically develop cyanide poisoning in the body.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cyanide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   Breathing difficulties.\n\n【17】*   Nausea.\n\n【18】*   Vomiting.\n\n【19】*   Body weakness.\n\n【20】*   Headache.\n\n【21】*   Mental confusion.\n\n【22】*   Unconsciousness.\n\n【23】*   Cardiac arrest.\n\n【24】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【25】*   Seizures.\n\n【26】*   Prolonged sleep.\n\n【27】What Are the Chronic Effects of Cyanide Toxicity?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   **Central Nervous System -** Studies show the consumption of cassava ( a potato variant) can cause chronic degenerative neuropathy and other neurological effects.\n\n【29】*   **Cardiovascular and Respiratory Effects -** Cyanide usually affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, secondary to the central nervous system. It can cause hypoventilation, myocardial infarction, and reduced cardiac output.\n\n【30】*   **Endocrine Effects -** Some studies have shown thyroid gland enlargement due to cyanide poisoning. In contrast, in some studies, goiter and cretinism are prevalent due to cassava consumption which has a cyanogenic effect on the body.\n\n【31】*   **Developmental Effects -** Low birth rate cases have been found in women with high levels of cyanide exposure.\n\n【32】**What Is the Pathophysiology of Cyanide Toxicity?**\n\n【33】Cyanide symptoms are usually produced more rapidly during intravenous and inhalation than an oral route into the body because cyanide diffuses faster into the bloodstream through these routes only. This blood toxicity due to cyanide poisoning is mainly caused by aerobic cell metabolism stoppage. Inside the mitochondria, cyanide binds with a ferric ion compound, which blocks oxygen reduction to water and inhibits cellular respiration. Cyanide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and produces ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate) as cellular energy by utilizing oxygen. This leads to metabolic acidosis by cellular hypoxia and ATP depletion. This causes harmful effects to the vital organs as the tissues in the body use oxygen, and this causes cyanide toxicity in the body.\n\n【34】How to Diagnose Cyanide Toxicity?\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】*   **Caboxyhaemoglobin Level -** This helps diagnose the amount of smoke inhaled due to cyanide exposure.\n\n【36】*   **Methemoglobin Level -** It is used to diagnose injury due to smoke inhalation.\n\n【37】*   **Blood or Plasma Lactate Level -** This usually does not help diagnose cyanide poisoning initially but can later confirm the poisoning due to prolonged exposure.\n\n【38】What Are the Treatment Options for Cyanide Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   **Cyanokit (Cyanide Antidote Kit)-** It is used in cases of cyanide exposure suspected in the patient. Although this treatment does not provide a proper cure to the condition, it can only prevent any further spread of poison in the patient's body.\n\n【40】*   **Dicobalt Edetate -** It is another treatment method used to eliminate cyanide from the body after exposure by intravenous route. It has side effects like low blood pressure, anaphylaxis, and seizures. Case assistance from a local toxicologist or specialist can help deal with the case.\n\n【41】*   In case of low exposure, a patient can be sent home after a few hours, but if the exposure level and poisoning effect are too high, the patient must be admitted to the hospital for proper treatment.\n\n【42】How to Prevent Cyanide Toxicity?\n--------------------------------\n\n【43】*   Proper care against domestic or residential fire must be ensured. If possible, smoke detectors should be installed, and halogen lamps and cigarette smoke must be avoided inside the house.\n\n【44】*   Chemicals containing toxic substances must be kept in air-tight containers under lock and key to avoid exposure to children.\n\n【45】*   Occupational hazards can be avoided by using absorbent papers or protecting work surfaces. Ensure to keep chemicals in labs or factories; workplace uniforms or dresses must not be bought at home as they can also cause exposure to other people.\n\n【46】*   Dispose of your clothes, hand gloves, and mask completely in zipped plastic bags after using them to prevent the spread of toxins.\n\n【47】**Conclusion**\n\n【48】Cyanide can be rapidly absorbed by the body through various routes and therefore requires immediate treatment and medical assistance as its effects can be fatal, leading to death. Though the prognosis of the person affected with cyanide toxicity is challenging, continuous observation and monitoring of symptoms and progress in condition before and after admission to the hospital can be reliable predictors in cyanide poisoning incidents.\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cyanide Toxicity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507796/\n*   Cyanide and Central Nervous System  \n    https://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:798876/FULLTEXT01.pdf\n*   Facts About Cyanide  \n    https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp\n*   Cyanide  \n    https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/publications/cyanide-fact-sheet</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Infection control measures are put in place to minimize the risk of patients developing surgical site infections (SSIs) or other healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).\n\n【1】Infection control and prevention in operation theaters are of utmost importance because surgical procedures carry a risk of infections. Any surgical procedure, no matter how minor or major, can result in the introduction of microorganisms into the patient's body, potentially leading to surgical site infections (SSIs) or other healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). These infections have the potential to result in extended hospital admissions, higher healthcare expenses, and even fatalities.\n\n【2】To lower the risk of infections among patients and medical personnel, infection control and prevention in operating rooms are important. Healthcare professionals can reduce the risk of infections in the operating room by adopting the necessary measures for infection control in surgical settings.\n\n【3】What Are the Measures of Infection Control and Prevention in Operation Theaters (OT)?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】In order to ensure that patients receive safe and effective surgical care and that healthcare personnel are safeguarded from potential risks of infections, infection control and prevention in operating rooms are essential. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising concern in hospital settings, and infection control and prevention strategies can help stop their spread and associated complications. The measures for infection control and prevention are broadly categorized into two:\n\n【5】1\\. **Standard Precautions:**\n\n【6】The standard precaution includes undertaking the following measures:\n\n【7】*   Hand Hygiene: All healthcare professionals should wash their hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers to maintain proper hand hygiene.\n\n【8】*   Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): To stop the transmission of illnesses, healthcare personnel should wear PPE such as gloves, masks, gowns, and eye protection.\n\n【9】*   Aseptic Procedure: Aseptic technique involves using sterile equipment and maintaining a sterile field during medical procedures, such as surgery or insertion of a catheter, to prevent contamination and infection.\n\n【10】*   Environment Hygiene: Prior to and following each surgical procedure, the operating room should be properly cleaned, paying particular attention to high-touch areas.\n\n【11】*   Reprocessing of Instruments: To reduce the risk of infection, surgical instruments and equipment should be sterilized before and after each use.\n\n【12】*   Waste Management: Sharps and medical trash should be disposed of properly, as should all other waste produced during surgical procedures.\n\n【13】2\\. **Universal Precautions:**\n\n【14】*   **Management of Blood Spillage**: In order to prevent a blood spill from spreading and potentially contaminating adjacent locations, it is crucial to contain the spill when it happens in a medical setting. Immediately cover the spill with paper towels or other absorbent material and dispose of it in accordance with the facility's protocol. Additionally, in order to avoid exposure to blood-borne pathogens, healthcare workers should put on proper personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n【15】*   **Post-Exposure Management**: A healthcare professional should start post-exposure management as soon as possible if they are exposed to a patient's blood or other bodily fluids. Cleaning and sanitizing the afflicted region, taking the proper prophylactic medication (such as an antiviral drug), and undergoing further testing to check for any potential infections may all be necessary.\n\n【16】What Is the Procedure and Guideline for Infection Control and Prevention in OT?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The CDC recommendations for the prevention of surgical site infections are as follows:\n\n【18】1\\. **Pre-Operative:** Pre-operative infection control and prevention measures aim to minimize the risk of infection before a surgical procedure. These measures may include:\n\n【19】*   Examining individuals for infection risk factors like diabetes or obesity, or other medical conditions.\n\n【20】*   Improving the patient's underlying health issues before surgery.\n\n【21】*   Rational administration of right antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery.\n\n【22】*   Educating patients on how to properly care for their skin and their hygiene before surgery.\n\n【23】*   Ensuring suitable environmental controls in the operating area, such as appropriate ventilation and cleaning procedures.\n\n【24】2\\. **Intra-Operative:** Intraoperative infection control and prevention measures aim to minimize the risk of infection during a surgical procedure. These measures may include:\n\n【25】*   Using sterile methods to avoid contaminating the surgical site during the process.\n\n【26】*   Using and discarding sharps, such as needles and blades, correctly.\n\n【27】*   Monitoring the operating room's environmental parameters, such as temperature and humidity, to prevent infection.\n\n【28】*   The operation room's movement and traffic should be kept to a minimum to lower the danger of infection.\n\n【29】*   Employing personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly to stop the transmission of illness, such as gloves, gowns, and masks\n\n【30】3\\. **Post-Operative:**\n\n【31】Post-operative infection control and prevention measures aim to minimize the risk of infection after a surgical procedure. These measures may include:\n\n【32】*   Monitoring and treating surgical wounds properly can promote healing and prevent infection.\n\n【33】*   Administering the proper antimicrobial prophylaxis after surgery, if necessary.\n\n【34】*   Putting in place the necessary environmental controls, like suitable cleaning and disinfection procedures, to stop the transmission of diseases.\n\n【35】4\\. **Surveillance**: Surveillance for infection control and prevention involves ongoing monitoring of infection rates and identifying trends or outbreaks.\n\n【36】What Are the Barriers to Infection Control and Prevention in OT?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】The barriers that may hinder effective infection control in operation rooms are listed below:\n\n【38】*   **Patient Factors:** Patients may be more susceptible to infections, making infection control procedures more difficult if they have underlying medical disorders, weakened immune systems, or poor personal hygiene.\n\n【39】*   **Time Restrictions:** In OT, it can be challenging to adhere to proper infection control precautions, such as complete washing and disinfecting of equipment and surfaces between procedures, due to time restrictions and the requirement for swift patient turnover.\n\n【40】*   **Limitations in Structure and Design:** OTs' structural and design flaws may reduce the efficacy of infection control measures. For instance, insufficient ventilation systems, hand hygiene stations, and storage capacity can all compromise infection control.\n\n【41】*   **Limited Resources:** Practices for infection control may be limited by a lack of resources, including inadequate space, a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), insufficient cleaning supplies, and inappropriate equipment.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Infection control and prevention in the operation theatre are essential to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers. The risk of infection transmission in the operating theatre is high due to the invasive procedures and patients' vulnerability to infections during surgery. Proper sterilization techniques, hand hygiene, and personal protective equipment can significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site infections and other hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, regular monitoring of infection rates and adherence to infection control protocols can further enhance patient safety in the operation theater.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Operating Room Protocols and Infection Control  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882240/\n*   Standard Precautions  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/summary-infection-prevention-practices/standard-precautions.html\n*   Surgical Site Infection  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/ssi/index.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is an inherited disease (passed from parent to child) in which the body is not able to make enough protein called hemoglobin.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Thalassemia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】The symptoms of thalassemia are as follows:\n\n【6】*   Weakness.\n\n【7】*   Fatigue.\n\n【8】*   Pale or yellowish skin.\n\n【9】*   Slow growth.\n\n【10】*   Dark urine.\n\n【11】*   Abnormal swelling.\n\n【12】*   Facial bone deformities.\n\n【13】*   Splenomegaly (refers to enlargement of the spleen).\n\n【14】*   Delayed puberty.\n\n【15】What Is the Cause of Thalassemia?\n---------------------------------\n\n【16】Thalassemia is caused by the mutation of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) cells that make hemoglobin and are passed from parents to children. Hemoglobin molecules exist as chains called beta and alpha chains. Production of alpha or beta chains is reduced in the case of thalassemia. The severity of thalassemia depends on the number of mutated genes received from parents.\n\n【17】What Are the Types of Thalassemia?\n----------------------------------\n\n【18】There are basically two types of thalassemia.\n\n【19】**1\\. Alpha Thalassemia:** It is inherited by the involvement of four genes altogether.\n\n【20】*   **One Mutated Gene:** It will show no signs and symptoms of thalassemia but will be the carrier of the disease.\n\n【21】*   **Two Mutated Gene:** This involves mild signs and symptoms, and the condition will be called alpha thalassemia.\n\n【22】*   **Three Mutated Gene:** Involves moderate signs and symptoms.\n\n【23】**2\\. Beta Thalassemia:** Occurs when two genes are involved in a beta hemoglobin chain formation.\n\n【24】*   **One Mutated Gene:** This will show mild signs and symptoms and is called thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia.\n\n【25】*   **Two Mutated Gene:** This shows moderate to severe signs and symptoms, and the condition is called Cooley anemia or thalassemia major.\n\n【26】What Are the Risk Factors and Complications of Thalassemia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】**The risk factors of thalassemia are:**\n\n【28】*   **Family History:** Thalassemia is usually inherited from parents to children through mutated genes.\n\n【29】*   **Ancestry:** Thalassemia is mostly seen in African Americans and Southeast Asian Descent.\n\n【30】**The complications of thalassemia are as follows:**\n\n【31】*   **Iron Overload:** People suffering from thalassemia can produce an excess of iron in the body. Excessive iron can result in damage to the liver, endocrine system, or heart.\n\n【32】*   **Infection:** People with thalassemia are more prone to developing an infection.\n\n【33】*   **Bone Deformities:** Thalassemia can lead to the expansion of bone marrow that causes bones to widen, resulting in abnormal bone structure.\n\n【34】*   **Enlarged Spleen:** Spleen helps the body fight against infections and infiltration of damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is associated with red blood cell destruction and causes the spleen to enlarge.\n\n【35】*   **Slow Growth Rates:** Thalassemia can slow the child's growth and delay puberty.\n\n【36】*   **Heart Problem:** Thalassemia is often associated with congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms.\n\n【37】What Is Thalassemia Screening?\n------------------------------\n\n【38】Thalassemia is a genetic test that is conducted on normal blood samples for the evaluation of thalassemia carrier genes carried by the parents. Thalassemia is usually detected after childbirth or pregnancy.\n\n【39】*   **Screening During Pregnancy:** It is done to detect the risk of a child born with thalassemia. Screening is usually done before ten weeks of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is the test done during pregnancy in which a placental tissue sample is taken between nine to twelve weeks. The gene composition of the placenta is analyzed to detect the presence of thalassemia. The placental tissue is retrieved with a long thin needle inserted into the abdomen or vagina. Amniocentesis is another screening method in which the amniotic fluid is collected, and an ultrasound is performed.\n\n【40】*   **Testing After Birth or Later in Life:** Newborns are usually checked for beta-thalassemia major. The child can be tested at any time whenever reported with symptoms of thalassemia.\n\n【41】*   **Testing for the** **Thalassemia** **Traits:** A blood test can be carried out if the person has traits of thalassemia and are at risk of having a baby with thalassemia. It is useful in case of any family history of thalassemia.\n\n【42】How to Diagnose Thalassemia?\n----------------------------\n\n【43】Thalassemia can be diagnosed in the following ways:\n\n【44】*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures the hemoglobin count and size of red blood cells.\n\n【45】*   **Reticulocyte Count:** Measures the number of young red blood cells in the human body.\n\n【46】*   **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:** It is used in the diagnosis of alpha thalassemia.\n\n【47】*   **Genetic Screening:** It is used in the diagnosis of alpha thalassemia.\n\n【48】How to Treat Thalassemia?\n-------------------------\n\n【49】Thalassemia can be treated in the following ways:\n\n【50】*   **Blood Transfusion:** Involves the injections of red blood cells through a vein to restore normal red blood cells and hemoglobin.\n\n【51】*   **Iron Chelation:** Involves removing excess iron from the body.\n\n【52】*   **Folic Acid Supplement:** Helps the body to make red cells healthy.\n\n【53】*   **Bone Marrow And Stem Cell Transplant:** This treatment involves bone marrow and stem cell transplant from a compatible donor to treat thalassemia. Compatibility of the donor means that the same types of proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are present. A syringe is injected into bone marrow stem cells from the donor in the bloodstream during the procedure.\n\n【54】*   **Luspatercept:** It is an injection given every week and helps to develop red blood cells.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】A bone marrow transplant is taken from a compatible sibling that offers the best chance of curing thalassemia. Most people suffering from thalassemia lack suitable sibling donors. Also, bone marrow is said to be a high-risk procedure that leads to severe complications. The life expectancy in people with mild thalassemia is normal, while in the case of heart disease, iron overload is one of the causes of death in people with thalassemia. Genetic testing is done to reveal whether the partner carries the gene or not. Excess iron can occur due to frequent blood transfusions and cause damage to the liver, heart, and endocrine system. In severe cases, it can be fatal. Pregnancy-associated with thalassemia is called high-risk pregnancy.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Thalassemia  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/thalassemia/facts.html#:~:text=Thalassemia%20is%20an%20inherited%20\n*   About Thalassemia  \n    https://www.thalassemia.org/learn-about-thalassemia/about-thalassemia/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Non-scarring.\n\n【16】2\\. Scarring.\n\n【17】The scarring type can be divided into three types and is also referred to as cicatricial alopecia. It is characterized by a permanent form of hair loss resulting from damage to hair follicles.\n\n【18】*   **Tinea Capitis:**\n\n【19】This type of hair loss is associated with inflammatory changes caused by fungal (ringworm) infection and is contagious in nature. They are associated with bald patches, swelling, severe itching, and red rashes in a ring shape.\n\n【20】*   **Alopecia Mucinosa:**\n\n【21】This condition occurs with the collection of mucinous substances in the hair follicles and the sebaceous glands. The inflammatory response to this accumulation prevents the growth of hair. Initially, the condition can be reversed with early diagnosis and treatment, but when the disease advances the hair follicles are permanently destroyed with scarring.\n\n【22】*   **Alopecia Neoplastica:**\n\n【23】This condition is the result of the metastatic (spread of cancer cells) invasion into hair cells. The infiltration occurs from the breast, lungs, and renal carcinoma (cancer).\n\n【24】Non-scarring alopecia has six major types:\n\n【25】*   **Telogen Effluvium:**\n\n【26】Telogen effluvium is a condition in which excessive loss of hair occurs after some initial event like fever, infection, certain drugs, surgery, or due to stress, which is commonly seen in students during exams. Usually, it recovers after the initial trigger is removed and the patient gets better in 3 months. Sometimes, it can be chronic if constant shedding occurs for more than 6 months and that can be due to iron deficiency, zinc deficiency, and other systemic conditions. For its treatment, the underlying cause should be identified and treated.\n\n【27】*   **Alopecia Areata:**\n\n【28】Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where hair loss occurs in patches. It most commonly involves the scalp but can also involve the bearded areas in males. When it affects the entire body, it is called alopecia universalis. It is usually a reversible condition and 80 % of people have regrowth of hair during the first year after hair loss. Topical and oral steroids are the mainstay of treatment, and intralesional steroids can be used in them. Other options for the treatment of alopecia areata are topical irritants like Dimethyl Sulfoxide application or Cantharidine application.\n\n【29】*   **Androgenetic Alopecia:**\n\n【30】Another common hair loss, especially in males, is androgenetic alopecia or male pattern hair loss. It can also occur in females, especially those with hormonal imbalances. For its treatment, camouflage can be used in the form of wigs, synthetic hair, and Minoxidil hair spray is used in this type of alopecia. Oral Finasteride is also used for its treatment.\n\n【31】*   **Traumatic Alopecia:**\n\n【32】Traumatic alopecia involves the voluntary and forceful pulling of the hair from the scalp that is commonly seen in children. Some people suffer from trichotillomania (urge to pull the hair out of the scalp), which comes under traumatic alopecia.\n\n【33】*   **Tinea Capitis:**\n\n【34】The type of Tinea capitis fungal infection can be two types, one is inflammatory and the other one is non-inflammatory. The non-inflammatory type is not associated with scarring.\n\n【35】*   **Anagen Effluvium:**\n\n【36】Anagen effluvium is a type of non-scarring alopecia seen in patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer management. The anti-cancer drugs are toxic to the growth of hair.\n\n【37】What Are The Other Common Causes Of Hair Loss?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Other causes of hair loss are those in which inflammatory causes permanently destroy the hair follicles like lichen planus, frontal fibrosing alopecia, etc. Other causes of hair loss can be chronic infections, chemotherapy, medications, or hair shaft defects.\n\n【39】One common problem in females is excessive use of hot straighteners and curlers on hair which also weakens the hair shaft and causes excessive loss and shedding of hair.\n\n【40】How To Diagnose Different Types Of Hair Loss?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【41】The cause and the type of hair loss have to be thoroughly evaluated for better treatment planning and to prevent further hair loss.\n\n【42】*   The physician may order a blood test to check for thyroid function, blood cell count, auto-antibodies, and certain hormone levels to determine the basic underlying cause of hair loss.\n\n【43】*   KOH prep (potassium hydroxide preparation) and culture test are necessary for fungal infection.\n\n【44】*   Radiographic investigations in the case of alopecia mucinosa to identify the disease stage.\n\n【45】*   Hair biopsy and laboratory analysis will give detailed information on hair loss.\n\n【46】*   A hair pull test will be useful to evaluate the strength of the hair strands and the follicular bulb. The test is performed by holding a few hairs from various parts of the scalp and pulling gently. Shedding six or more hairs during the test is a positive sign, indicating active hair loss. The test is generally positive for telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and scarring alopecia.\n\n【47】*   The images of the hair and scalp lesion can be visualized and recorded through a dermatoscope and this procedure is called dermatoscopy.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】Different types of alopecia have different causes and therefore complete history and physical examination of the patient is necessary for better treatment planning. Checking hair under Wood’s light (long wave ultraviolet light) is preferred to detect any fungal infection in the scalp.\n\n【50】Dermatologists can give optimal and coordinated care to patients with hair loss, especially when the condition is also associated with itching, rashes, and discharges.\n\n【51】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【52】* * *\n\n【53】#### **1.**删除换行**How Do You Find the Type of Hair Loss?**\n\n【54】Hair loss may occur due to various reasons. However, a dermatologist may use a pull test, card test, trichometric analysis, etc. to find the type of hair loss. But, when sudden and severe hair loss (80 to 100 strands) occurs, it may be due to stress. On the other hand, when hair loss occurs in patches, resulting in baldness in particular areas, then it can be alopecia areata.\n\n【55】#### **2.**删除换行**How Is Hair Loss Classified?**\n\n【56】Hair loss types are listed below:  \n\\- Scarring (cicatrial alopecia)  - Alopecia mucinosa, tinea capitis, alopecia neoplastica.   \n\\- Non-scarring - Alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, traumatic alopecia, androgenetic alopecia, and anagen effluvium.\n\n【57】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Features of Alopecia at Its Initial Stages?**\n\n【58】The following features indicate the initial stages of alopecia:  \n\\- Sudden hair loss (more than 50 to 100 strands of hair).  \n\\- Hair loss may occur in patches.  \n\\- Hair loss also happens in the beard, pubic area, eyebrows, etc.  \n\\- Changes in the nails, especially the appearance of white lines over them\n\n【59】#### **4.**删除换行**Does Vitamin Deficiency Cause Hair Loss?**\n\n【60】   \nA deficiency of essential vitamins and minerals may disturb the functioning of the body's systems. In addition, hair loss may also occur in case of vitamin deficiency. Especially lack or low levels of vitamin D and B12 may result in sudden hair loss. Vitamin D is required for hair growth and can be gained through 15 minutes of sun exposure daily.\n\n【61】#### **5.**删除换行**Which Are the Most Common Types of Abnormal Hair Loss?**\n\n【62】The common forms of hair loss are as follows:  \n\\- Alopecia areata - Hair loss occurs due to an autoimmune disorder.  \n\\- Androgenic alopecia - Males are more affected by this genetic type of hair loss.  \n\\- Anagen effluvium - Chemotherapy or other related medical procedures may cause sudden hair loss.  \n\\- Telogen effluvium - Exposure to sudden stress or hormonal disturbances may lead to severe hair loss.\n\n【63】#### **6.**删除换行**Do Vitamins Help With Hair Fall?**\n\n【64】Yes, vitamins do help in faster and healthier hair growth. It includes:  \n\\- Vitamin D.  \n\\- Biotin.  \n\\- Vitamin B12.  \n\\- Vitamin C.  \n\\- Vitamin B2.\n\n【65】#### **7.**删除换行**Can Alopecia Be Triggered?**\n\n【66】There are no specific trigger factors for hair loss. However, the following components may increase its risk:  \n\\- Genetics.  \n\\- Nutritional deficiencies.  \n\\- Stress.  \n\\- Hormonal changes.  \n\\- Chemotherapy.  \n\\- Autoimmune disorder.\n\n【67】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Alopecia Curable?**\n\n【68】The treatment of alopecia depends on its type and cause. In case of nutritional deficiency and stress, lifestyle modifications and medications might help with hair regrowth. With genetic or autoimmune disorders, it is important to provide emotional support to one who is affected by hair loss and can wear hair wigs in case of severe hair loss.\n\n【69】#### **9.**删除换行**How to Differentiate if Hair Loss Is Due to Genetics or Stress?**\n\n【70】Hair loss due to stress is sudden and severe and can be reversed by controlling stress and other lifestyle changes. In the case of genetic hair loss, the hair that grows back is less compared to the hair that falls down. By the age of 30 to 60, complete or partial baldness may occur with a genetic type of hair loss.\n\n【71】#### **10.**删除换行**Does Alopecia Spread Fast?**\n\n【72】Alopecia may occur in small patches over a week, and it may regrow within a few months. But some small patches may join with other patches over the scalp and result in large baldness, which may happen within a few weeks of time. Sometimes, they may grow back or result in complete baldness.\n\n【73】#### **11.**删除换行**Can Stress Lead To Alopecia?**\n\n【74】Out of many factors causing hair loss, stress remains the most common. An increase in stress disturbs the body’s immune system, which leads to hair loss along the scalp and sometimes all over the body. When the body and mind are stressed over a period of three months, then hair loss may occur severely.\n\n【75】#### **12.**删除换行**What Causes Sudden Hair Loss?**\n\n【76】Sudden hair loss may be due to the following:  \n\\- Genetics.  \n\\- Aging.  \n\\- Hormonal changes.  \n\\- Stress.  \n\\- Post-surgery.\n\n【77】#### **13.**删除换行**How to Reverse Alopecia?**\n\n【78】In some cases, alopecia can be reversed with medications and lifestyle modifications. But this may occur gradually over a period of several months or years. It is important to follow the instructions given by a trichologist to prevent further damage to hair. In addition, it is crucial to get medical advice properly at the initial stage of hair loss to reverse alopecia.\n\n【79】#### **14.**删除换行**Does Alopecia Heal on Its Own?**\n\n【80】No, alopecia does not recover on its own. In case of minimal or mild hair loss, regrowth may occur within a few months with proper nutrition and medication. If alopecia is severe and in large patches, it is difficult for the hair to grow back, and hair wigs or other accessories may be worn to compensate for such hair loss.\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>*   Alopecia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538178/\n*   TYPES OF HAIR LOSS  \n    https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-loss/types</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Three pairs of turbinates in the nose resemble shell-shaped bony structures that help control airflow. They also help moisturize and warm the inhaled air before reaching the lungs for respiration. Whenever one of the conchae gets filled with air, the condition is known as concha bullosa or pneumatization of turbinate (pneumatization means the presence of air-filled cavities).\n\n【2】What Are the Conchae?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Three pairs of conchae (singular-concha) are on both sides of the nasal septum. The nasal septum is the bone that separates the nostrils in half. The conchae are three nasal passages for airflow and are named based on their location in the nasal cavity, which is inferior (lowest), middle and superior (upper).\n\n【4】*   **Superior Concha** - This is the highest conchae in the nose and is located near the brain and protects the part of the brain which helps with the smell.\n\n【5】*   **Middle Concha** - The middle concha is between the superior and inferior conchae. It is as long as a little finger. It projects downwards towards the opening of various sinuses and protects them from the pressurized nasal airflow.\n\n【6】*   **Inferior Concha** - The inferior concha is the largest among the three conchae and can be long as an index finger in humans. The inferior concha is responsible for various essential functions such as airflow direction, heating, humidification, and filtering the air inhaled through the nose.\n\n【7】Each of these nasal passages, separated by the conchae, opens into the sinus cavity, which are the air-filled spaces in the skull. There are four hollow air-filled cavities present in the facial bones named after the bones in which they are located, which include -\n\n【8】*   Maxillary sinuses (located on each side of the nose near the cheekbones).\n\n【9】*   Frontal sinuses (located above eyes near forehead).\n\n【10】*   Ethmoid sinuses (located near the eyes on either side of the nose bridge).\n\n【11】*   Sphenoid sinuses (present behind the eyes deep in the skull).\n\n【12】The primary function of the sinuses is to produce mucus, a type of fluid that is sticky and slippery and helps warm, moisten, and filter the air in the nasal cavity.\n\n【13】What Is Concha Bullosa?\n-----------------------\n\n【14】Concha bullosa means the presence of air or pneumatization in the middle concha. It is a common disorder that generally does not cause serious complications except when it gets enlarged. The enlarged concha bullosa may cause blockage in the nasal cavity, preventing the sinuses from draining mucus properly. This can lead to the accumulation of mucus and cause a sinus infection.\n\n【15】The pneumatization of the middle and superior conchae is common. It is rare for the inferior concha and is known as the inferior concha bullosa. Concha bullosa may also be found along with deviated nasal septum, which is a condition in which the nasal septum is not entirely straight, making breathing harder.\n\n【16】What Are the Causes of Concha Bullosa?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】The exact cause of concha bullosa is not known. According to various studies, it has been found that it is more likely to occur if a person has deviated nasal septum. This can cause issues in breathing, making it difficult to breathe from one nostril, and symptoms like loud snoring and sleep apnea may also be seen.\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Concha Bullosa?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【19】A small-size concha bullosa does not cause any symptoms and can even go unnoticed throughout the life of a person. However, large-size concha does cause some pain and discomfort. Some of the common symptoms of concha bullosa may include the following -\n\n【20】*   Pain or feeling of pressure around the sinuses or the area around the eyes.\n\n【21】*   Feeling like something is blocking the airway while breathing.\n\n【22】*   Feeling like a person cannot get enough air in or out through the nose.\n\n【23】In case a person has deviated nasal septum, some of the following symptoms may also be seen such as -\n\n【24】*   Noisy breathing.\n\n【25】*   Loud snoring.\n\n【26】*   Frequent nose bleeds.\n\n【27】However, the symptoms of concha bullosa may resemble the symptoms of a sinus infection. Still, it does not cause symptoms like mucus drainage or pain in the ear or jaw, which are commonly seen in sinus infections.\n\n【28】What Is the Diagnosis of Concha Bullosa?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【29】Patients do not need to consult a doctor if they are not facing any difficulty in breathing. However, if the symptoms caused by concha bullosa are affecting the life of a person, they should seek medical help, and the doctor may advise the following tests to help diagnose this condition -\n\n【30】*   **CT (Computed Tomography) Scan** - This is the most common test to diagnose concha bullosa. By this test, the doctor can see a cross-section of the nose and conchae structures and spot the air pockets. These pockets appear as black spots irrespective of the normal gray color of the concha. Usually, the concha bullosa appears as large circles or pockets extending to other parts of the nose.\n\n【31】*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scan** - With this three-dimensional test view of the concha and other structures of the nose can be seen. Same as the CT scan, the MRI scan can also help in identifying the concha bullosa as a dark circle within the nasal cavity.\n\n【32】What Is the Treatment for Concha Bullosa?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Patients usually do not need any treatment if it is not causing any pain or discomfort. No medication or surgery is required if there are no related symptoms found. However, if the symptoms such as headache and breathing difficulty are there, some of the following procedures can be done to treat this condition -\n\n【34】*   **Crushing** \\- In this procedure, the doctor will squeeze the concha bullosa by surgery until the trapped air is not released from them. This surgery can be performed under local or general anesthesia.\n\n【35】*   **Turbinoplasty** \\- In this method, the surgeon will surgically reshape the bones and tissues around the concha bullosa to improve the airflow. This surgery is usually done under general anesthesia.\n\n【36】*   **Turbinate Reduction or Resection** - In this surgery, the concha bullosa is removed using some special tools under general anesthesia.\n\n【37】*   **Septoplasty** \\- This procedure is done in cases where concha bullosa develops due to deviated nasal septum. The deviated septum is straightened in this surgical procedure to make breathing easy.\n\n【38】**Conclusion**:\n\n【39】Concha bullosa is a common condition that usually does not cause serious complications and rarely requires any treatment. But if there is any pain or discomfort which is affecting the daily lifestyle of a patient, then they should go for the different surgical procedures available.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Concha bullosa of the inferior turbinate: an unusual cause of nasal obstruction  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3146328/\n*   Concha bullosa  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/concha-bullosa\n*   Concha Bullosa of the Inferior Turbinate  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868747/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The fibula is one of the two long bones in the lower leg, running parallel to the tibia.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Fibular Deficiency?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact causes of fibular deficiency are not fully understood. However, several factors may contribute to its development. Here are some potential causes:\n\n【4】*   **Genetic Factors:** Fibular deficiency can be caused by genetic abnormalities or mutations that affect the development of the lower limb during fetal growth. In some cases, it may be inherited in a familial pattern, suggesting a genetic component. However, the specific genes involved and the inheritance patterns are not well-defined.\n\n【5】*   **Environmental Factors:** Certain environmental factors during pregnancy may increase the risk of fibular deficiency. These factors include maternal smoking, exposure to certain medications or toxins, and maternal conditions such as diabetes. However, the exact mechanisms by which these factors contribute to fibular deficiency are not fully understood.\n\n【6】*   **Disruptions in Embryonic Development:** Fibular deficiency is thought to occur due to disruptions in the normal development of the lower limb during embryogenesis. The exact mechanisms leading to these disruptions are not clear. It is believed that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may influence the formation and growth of the fibula bone.\n\n【7】*   **Syndromes and Associated Conditions:** Fibular deficiency can be seen as a component of various syndromes or conditions. These syndromes may have underlying genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities that affect multiple aspects of development, including the formation of the fibula bone.\n\n【8】It is important to note that while these factors may contribute to the development of fibular deficiency, the condition is still considered relatively rare, and in many cases, the exact cause remains unknown.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Fibular Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The symptoms of fibular deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Here are some common signs and symptoms associated with fibular deficiency:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Management of Bone Defects in Orthopedic Trauma - General Outlook</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Closed Fracture - Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>**1\\. Leg Length Discrepancy:** The affected leg is shorter than the unaffected leg. The difference in length can range from mild to significant.</u>\n\n【16】**2\\. Foot and Ankle Deformities:** The foot and ankle on the affected side may be malformed or have structural abnormalities. These can include:\n\n【17】*   **Clubfoot:** The foot may be turned inward or downward.\n\n【18】*   **Ankle Instability:** The ankle joint may be unstable or loose.\n\n【19】*   **Tarsal Coalition:** Abnormal connections between two or more bones in the foot, which can restrict movement.\n\n【20】*   **Gait Abnormalities:** Due to leg length discrepancy and foot deformities, individuals with a fibular deficiency may have an altered gait pattern. They may limp or walk with a noticeable limp.\n\n【21】*   **Muscle Imbalance:** The absence or underdevelopment of the fibula can lead to muscle imbalances in the leg. This can result in differences in muscle strength and function between the affected and unaffected leg.\n\n【22】*   **Lower Limb Instability:** The absence of the fibula can affect the stability of the lower leg, potentially leading to issues with weight-bearing and balance.\n\n【23】The specific symptoms can vary from person to person, and not all individuals with fibular deficiency will experience the same combination or severity of symptoms.\n\n【24】Who Is Affected by Fibular Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【25】Fibular deficiency can affect individuals of any gender or ethnic background. It is considered a relatively rare condition, with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 40,000 live births.\n\n【26】The condition can occur unilaterally, affecting only one leg, or bilaterally, affecting both legs. In unilateral cases, the left leg is more commonly affected than the right leg. It can also vary in severity, ranging from mild cases where the leg length discrepancy is minimal and foot deformities are mild to more severe cases with significant limb length discrepancy and complex foot and ankle deformities.\n\n【27】Fibular deficiency can occur as an isolated condition, where it is the only abnormality present, or it may be associated with other congenital anomalies or syndromes.\n\n【28】How Is Fibular Deficiency Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【29】Diagnosing fibular deficiency typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and sometimes genetic testing. Here is an overview of the diagnostic process:\n\n【30】*   **Clinical Examination:** A healthcare professional, such as an orthopedic surgeon or pediatrician, will evaluate the affected leg and foot, looking for signs of limb length discrepancy, foot and ankle deformities, and any associated abnormalities. They will also review the medical history of the patient and inquire about any family history of similar conditions.\n\n【31】*   **Imaging Studies:** X-rays are commonly used to assess the bones and joints of the lower limb. X-rays can reveal the absence or underdevelopment of the fibula bone, as well as any associated bone deformities or joint abnormalities. Additional imaging techniques, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be utilized to obtain more detailed information about the structures and soft tissues of the leg and foot.\n\n【32】*   **Genetic Testing:** In cases where fibular deficiency is suspected to be part of a genetic syndrome or when there is a family history of the condition, genetic testing may be recommended. Genetic testing can help identify specific genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with fibular deficiency.\n\n【33】*   **Differential Diagnosis:** It is important to differentiate fibular deficiency from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as tibial hemimelia (absence or underdevelopment of the tibia bone). A thorough evaluation and comparison of the affected leg with the unaffected leg are crucial in distinguishing between different conditions.\n\n【34】Once the diagnosis of fibular deficiency is confirmed, further assessments may be done to determine the severity of the condition, assess the functional impact, and plan appropriate treatment options. This may involve additional imaging, gait analysis, and consultations with specialists, such as orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment of Fibular Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The treatment for a fibular deficiency depends on various factors like the severity of the condition, age of the individual, presence of associated abnormalities, and functional goals. The treatment approach may involve a combination of non-surgical interventions, surgical procedures, and ongoing monitoring. Here are some treatment options that may be considered:\n\n【37】*   **Observation and Non-surgical Interventions:** In mild cases of fibular deficiency, where the leg length discrepancy is minimal, and foot deformities are not severe, observation and non-surgical interventions may be sufficient. This may involve regular monitoring of the condition, physical therapy to improve strength and range of motion, and the use of orthotic devices, such as braces or shoe inserts, to support the foot and ankle.\n\n【38】*   **Limb-Lengthening Procedures:** In cases where the leg length discrepancy is significant, limb-lengthening procedures may be recommended. This involves gradually lengthening the shorter leg using external fixation devices or internal implants. The goal is to equalize the leg lengths, improve function, and achieve a more symmetrical appearance.\n\n【39】*   **Foot and Ankle Surgeries:** Surgical interventions may be required to correct foot and ankle deformities associated with fibular deficiency. These procedures aim to improve the alignment, stability, and function of the foot and ankle. Surgical options may include tendon transfers, osteotomies (bone cuts), joint fusions, or joint reconstruction.\n\n【40】*   **Prosthetic Management:** In cases where the affected leg has severe deformities or functional limitations that cannot be adequately addressed through surgical interventions, prosthetic management may be considered. This involves the use of custom-made prosthetic devices to support mobility and enhance function.\n\n【41】*   **Rehabilitation and Ongoing Care:** Rehabilitation plays a vital role in the management of fibular deficiency. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can help improve strength, balance, mobility, and overall functional abilities. Ongoing monitoring and follow-up care are essential to address any changes or complications that may arise over time.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Fibular deficiency can result in leg length discrepancy, foot and ankle deformities, and functional limitations. The specific treatment plan will be individualized based on the unique needs and circumstances of each patient. It is important to consult with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including orthopedic surgeons, pediatricians, physical therapists, and geneticists, to develop a comprehensive treatment approach for fibular deficiency.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Congenital fibular deficiency  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24668354/\n*   Fibular Hemimelia  \n    https://posna.org/physician-education/study-guide/fibular-hemimelia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Extensive burns are not only linked to severe illness but also the development of psychological issues.\n\n【2】What Are the Pathophysiology of Burn Wounds?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Burns occur from dry or wet sources. It causes not only local injury at the site of the burn but also thermal injury to a large area of skin, resulting in an acute systemic response collectively called burn shock. Burn shock is explained as capillary permeability, increased hydrostatic pressure, and movement of fluid from intravascular space to interstitial space. Results in hypovolemia and reduced cardiac output require fluid resuscitation. Edema formed in the interstitial space immediately in the first eight hours after the burn injury. Then it continuously slowly forms for the next 18 hours. The volume required for resuscitation depends on the type, site of the burn, patient weight, presence of inhalational injury, time of injury, and extent of a full-thickness burn. Fluid resuscitation was done hourly based on the response of the patient, like urine output. Following resuscitation in a large burn wound patient may fall into hypermetabolism and muscle wasting, which leads to poor wound healing. Chemical burns can be alkali or acid type. Alkali type of burn is penetrating, and it penetrates deep into the skin by liquefying the skin(liquefaction necrosis). The acid type is less penetrating as it causes coagulation necrosis. Electrical burns can cause more effects with an entry and an exit point. There may be internal organ injury. Thermal burns are common, and they can be superficial or deep. Patients have systemic responses toward burns.\n\n【4】How Are Burns Evaluated for Treatment?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】Major factors used in the evaluation of burns are the extent and depth of burns. The extent of the burn is calculated by the percentage of total body surface area, and the depth of burns is the superficial, partial, or full thickness.\n\n【6】How Is the Extent of Burns Calculated?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】In calculating the extent of burns, several methods are there to calculate the percentage of total body surface area burned. They are-\n\n【8】*   **Rule of Nines**\\- In this head represents nine percent, each arm nine percent, anterior chest and abdomen eighteen percent, posterior chest and abdomen eighteen percent, each leg eighteen percent, and perineum one percent. For children, heads are eighteen percent, and legs are thirteen point five percent each.\n\n【9】*   **Lund and Browder Chart**\\- More accurate in children, each arm is ten percent, the anterior and posterior trunk is thirteen percent, and the percentage for head and leg varies depending on patient age.\n\n【10】*   **Palmar Surface**\\- For small burns patient palm, excluding the finger, is five percent of the body surface area, and the hand, including the palm and finger, represents one percent of the body surface area.\n\n【11】How Is the Depth of Burns Calculated?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】The depth of burns is calculated based on their extension into the epidermis and dermis. Superficial burns are first-degree burns involving only the epidermis. They are painful, soft, red, and blanch when touched and not blistering. Partial thickness burns are second-degree burns that extend through the epidermis into the dermis. Its depth can be superficial or deep. These burns are painful, red, blistered, and blanched on touching. Full-thickness burns are third-degree burns that extend deep into the epidermis and dermis into the subcutaneous tissue or even deeper. These types are white, brown leathery, with no pain or blanching due to high-temperature gas, hot flame, or liquid. In calculating the extent of burns, only partial or full thickness is considered. Superficial is excluded.\n\n【13】What Are the Medical Treatment of Burn wounds?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】After giving first aid to the patient, medical treatment is done to promote healing.\n\n【15】*   **Water-Based Treatment**\\- Uses methods like ultrasound mist therapy to clean the wound tissue.\n\n【16】*   **Fluid to Prevent Dehydration**\\- IV fluids prevent dehydration and organ failure.\n\n【17】*   **Pain and Anxiety Medication**\\- Healing of burns is painful; thus, certain medications are used to reduce pain and anxiety, usually while dressing or changing.\n\n【18】*   **Burn Creams and Ointments**\\- Bacitracin and Silver Sulfadiazine-like topical agents are used to preventing infection and closure of wounds.\n\n【19】*   **Dressings -** To cover the area from infection.\n\n【20】*   **Drugs That Fight Infection**\\- IV (intravenous) antibiotics are given to prevent infection.\n\n【21】*   **Tetanus Shot - T**o avoid spread of infection.\n\n【22】What Are the Surgical Treatments for Burn Wounds?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Various surgical methods are used in the treatment of burns. One of the major concerns for the patient is deciding the treatment plan, conservative or operative treatment. In operative treatment, surgeons should decide when and how to remove the burned tissue and determine the extent of tissue involvement. In seriously burned patients, surgery should be done.\n\n【24】*   **Escharotomy and Limb Decompression**\\- Used to treat compartment syndrome. In this procedure, eschar division uses a scalpel incision down into the long axis of the limb through the dermis deep into the fascia extending to the unburned tissue. This procedure should be done in an operating room under sterile conditions with an aseptic technique and the ability for hemostasis.\n\n【25】*   **Early Excision and Grafting**\\- Before this procedure, remove loose burned tissue and treat it with sterile medications to prevent the risk of infection. Once achieved, superficial burns will heal within two weeks, and deep will take some more time. Early excision is used because removal of all devitalized tissue reduces mortality, morbidity, colonization of bacteria, length of hospital stay, and cost. This procedure is used to reduce the risk of scarring and infection. Excision is done when the patient is hemodynamically stable. Burn wounds are surgically treated with tangential excision, fascial excision, or amputation. In tangential excision, all necrotic tissues are removed, and the viable dermis is preserved. The deep donor site for skin graft is treated with a split-thickness skin graft. Advantages are contoured, better preserved, the length of hospital stay is reduced, and quick healing. Fascial excision is an alternative, quicker method. Blood loss is less, but the damage to the contour and lymphedema is evident. Fascial excision is done in full-thickness burns and life-threatening invasive wounds. Amputation is done in unsalvageable limbs, deep burns, and electrocutions. It eliminates functions and so is considered an invalid procedure, but it is used to treat electric and war wounds.\n\n【26】In all procedures, all the non-viable tissues should be removed. Bleeding tissues should be intact and create a viable wound bed. In a few procedures, blood loss is seen, so precautions like adrenaline on the wound will produce vasoconstriction and reduce blood loss. Excision should be done in the first 24 hours to reduce blood loss. In deep fascial burns using Silver Sulfadiazine, a conservative approach is made; full-thickness burns are treated with unmeshed skin grafts because of aesthetic consideration.\n\n【27】In patients with greater burn, allografts are used due to a lack of donor sites. Viable human allograft from a cadaveric source is found to be effective. The benefits of allografts are wound protection against desiccation and bacterial colonization by acting as a physical barrier.\n\n【28】What Are the Skin Substitutes and Future Strategies Used in the Treatment of Burns?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Skin substitutes help in wound closure, preventing desiccation and fluid loss. They can also be used along with allograft.\n\n【30】*   **Biobrane** \\- It is a biosynthetic dressing material of nylon mesh bonded to silicone mesh coated with porcine polypeptides. It is used as a temporary cover for clean, debrided burns.\n\n【31】*   **Integra**\\- It is a dermal regeneration template composed of two layers. The outer layer is a silicone sheet, and the inner layer is a bovine collagen matrix as a dermal analog. It is used in acute burn resurfacing with cultured keratinocytes.\n\n【32】*   **Alloderm** \\- It is an acellular dermal regeneration matrix from human skin developed on the basis that acellular dermal matrices do not undergo degeneration.\n\n【33】**Conclusion:**\n\n【34】The management of burns is done by an interprofessional team, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, burn specialists, wound care specialists, pulmonologists, nurses, etc. The treatment is done to prevent complications and restore function. The outcome depends on the degree and extent of the burn.\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>*   Surgical options in extensive burns management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6880225/\n*   Burn Evaluation And Management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430741/\n*   BURN SURGERY PROCEDURES  \n    https://healthcare.utah.edu/burncenter/conditions-treatment/surgery.php</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

NEMDs have been identified in fifty percent of adults with non-cardiac chest pain or dysphagia.\n\n【2】What Is Nonspecific Esophageal Disorder?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Nonspecific esophageal disorder (NEMD) describes esophageal conditions that do not fit with any well-established esophageal motility disorders. NEMDs have been identified in fifty percent of adults with non-cardiac chest pain or dysphagia. It is a broad term for patients with poorly defined esophageal contraction abnormalities. Motility disorders are an important cause of esophageal complaints.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Nonspecific Esophageal Disorder?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Patients can be asymptomatic. At times, some patients present with dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). An infrequent presenting symptom is chest pain. Commonly seen symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Pain while swallowing.\n\n【7】*   Difficulty swallowing.\n\n【8】*   Swallowed food gets stuck in the esophagus (food impaction).\n\n【9】*   Chest pain that occurs while eating.\n\n【10】*   Heartburn.\n\n【11】*   Acid regurgitation.\n\n【12】Small children, particularly infants, who cannot communicate their difficulties properly might present with irritability, arching of their back, and refusal to eat food.\n\n【13】How Is Nonspecific Esophageal Disorder Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】**1\\. Case History -** A detailed case history would reveal how long this complaint had been present and the various symptoms the patients experienced.\n\n【15】**2\\. Esophagogram (Barium Swallow, Fluoroscopy) -** This imaging technique is used to view the upper gastrointestinal tract. It uses a special kind of X-ray called fluoroscopy. The person undergoing this procedure is made to drink a chalky fluid containing barium. The presence of barium in the blood enables us to see the internal organs more clearly. The fluoroscopic examination might reveal interrupted primary peristalsis (peristalsis is the coordinated movement of the esophagus that is initiated by the swallowing of food), variation in the number and severity of tertiary contractions (tertiary peristalsis or tertiary contractions are the contractions that co-occur at different levels of the esophagus), and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. The radiographic findings in nonspecific esophageal disorders might overlap with those of other motility disorders.\n\n【16】**3\\. Manometry** - It measures the pressure and constriction of the esophageal muscles as food is swallowed. It is used to detect the pattern of muscle activity and the strength of the muscle contractions throughout the esophagus. A barium swallow or fluoroscopy cannot measure the strength of the muscle contractions. Patients with nonspecific esophageal disorders are classified as having hypo contraction abnormalities on manometric examination. Manometric examination reveals an intermittent absence of peristalsis on 20 % or more of the wet swallows (wet swallow causes a higher amplitude of constriction in the distal part of the esophagus than the dry swallow; this is absent in diseases of the esophagus) and low amplitude peristalsis, prolonged duration of peristalsis, and repetitive or three peaked contractions. Disruption of primary peristalsis and non-peristaltic movements are also seen in the radiographic findings.\n\n【17】**4\\. Esophageal Scintigraphy -** A non-invasive, easy, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for determining esophagus abnormalities. It can identify esophageal abnormalities even in asymptomatic patients. NEMD is characterized by normal liquid emptying and delayed semisolid emptying, in contrast to achalasia, where both liquid and semisolid emptying is markedly delayed.\n\n【18】How Is Nonspecific Esophageal Disorder Treated?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Gastroenterologists who deal with such disorders should be aware of the clinical presentations and the interpretation of the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involved. This is also required of the surgeon, who should be aware of the surgical innovations. Proper planning and awareness of the complications are required for multi-disciplinary follow-up care.\n\n【20】**1\\. Medical Care:** The underlying neuropathology causes cannot be cured completely. Hence, the treatment will be at relieving the symptoms elicited. As the nerves involved do not regenerate, treatment is aimed at relieving the physiologic obstruction by surgical or endoscopic balloon disruption of the muscles. A less effective method is to relax the muscles using medications, thereby relieving dysphagia and chest pain.\n\n【21】**2\\. Pharmacologic Care:** Smooth muscle relaxants like nitrates and calcium channel blockers were the first drugs used in all cases of this condition. Other drugs used less extensively include anticholinergics, Amyl nitrate, Nitroglycerine, Theophylline, beta antagonists, and, recently, phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Non-chest pain responds well to antireflux therapy, even without gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. In addition, chronic pain management with TPAs (tricyclic antidepressants) effectively manages non-cardiac chest pain, which is resistant to other therapies.\n\n【22】**3\\. Botulinum Toxin Injections:** It is a good alternative for poor surgical patients, like the elderly and frail ones. Botulinum toxin is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholine at nerve endings. The main disadvantages associated with this therapy include its cost and the requirement for repeated treatments.\n\n【23】**4\\. Endoscopic Treatment:** Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with pneumatic dilation is the standard endoscopic treatment for this condition. Balloon dilations are designed specifically for treating patients with non-specific esophageal disorders to achieve adequate diameters with lasting effectiveness. The response rate for this treatment varies from 53 percent to 93 percent. The major complication observed with this procedure is perforation. Therefore, a water-soluble esophagram should be performed post-dilation to ensure no perforation.\n\n【24】**5\\. Surgical Therapy:** The VATS approach (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) using myotomy and fundoscopy in nonspecific esophageal disorders is a good option for treating cases resistant to medication and balloon dilation.\n\n【25】What Are the Differential Diagnoses for Nonspecific Esophageal Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The various differential diagnoses for this condition include:\n\n【27】*   Achalasia.\n\n【28】*   Diffuse esophageal spasm.\n\n【29】*   Presbyesophagus.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】There is limited knowledge of its natural history and clinical significance, though NEMD is a relatively common disorder. Some patients have been shown to progress toward developing more specific esophageal motility disorders. In approximately one-third of the NEMD patients, esophageal motility has been found to return to normal. Another area of uncertainty in nonspecific esophageal disorders is their clinical significance. The earlier studies suggest that NEMD may be associated with a mild delay in the liquid emptying in some cases, while it was normal in others. These findings were limited by the non-quantitative description of the esophageal transit, the lack of disease control groups, etc. Recent studies performed after overcoming these limitations show that NEMD is associated with a significant but selective impairment of semisolid esophageal emptying.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Clinical and manometric course of nonspecific esophageal motility disorders  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22006112/\n*   Ineffective esophageal motility (IEM): the primary finding in patients with nonspecific esophageal motility disorder  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9331148/\n*   Nonspecific Motor Disorder of the Esophagus: A Real Disorder or a Manometric Curiosity?  \n    https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/0016-5085(93)90335-A/pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Stroke can precipitate symptoms like paralysis of the face, legs, or arms, numbness in these areas, walking or speaking trouble, or problems with understanding and memory. Endovascular treatment is one of the non-surgical management protocols for loss of brain function suddenly due to clots.\n\n【2】What Is Endovascular Surgery?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】EVT (endovascular therapy) involves inserting microcatheters (thin tubes which are visible under X-rays) into the body where the clot is located to remove the blood clot. The arrival of the EVT era has helped revolutionize the field of vascular surgery. EVT is a minimally invasive procedure. It is also advantageous as it has decreased perioperative mortality and significant morbidity. Many patients benefit from this as there is a shorter hospital and intensive care stays and quicker return to daily activities, especially for the elderly. Like a cherry on the cake, there has been a lower level of surgical stress, and EVT may eliminate the necessity for general anesthesia.\n\n【4】How Is Endovascular Treatment Helpful?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】Endovascular treatment is a life-saving strategy against loss of brain function in stroke-affected patients. Timely restoration of the brain's blood supply will help prevent further damage. The removal of blood clots from the blood vessel is known as thrombectomy. Thrombectomy has been proven effective between 16 to 24 hours, a lapse after the patient was last known to be well. Another procedure, thrombolysis, is carried out, which involves liquefying the clot using drugs that are delivered through a catheter if the clot is challenging to remove.\n\n【6】What Is the Anesthesia Regimen for an Endovascular Treatment?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The clinical outcome of this treatment depends on various factors, including the anesthetic regimen employed. EVT can be performed under general anesthesia (GA) or with MAC (monitored anesthesia care). Local anesthesia (LA) is administered for vascular access and may or may not be accompanied by sedation. Acute stroke patients in a study demonstrated improved outcomes in selected patients who underwent thrombectomy as long as 24 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms. There has been an ongoing debate in recent years about which is the best anesthetic type, GA versus MAC, for this procedure.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Why dentists do not use Bupivacaine for nerve block?</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Heat Stroke - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Complications and Prevention</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Is stroke along with bleeding inside brain worrisome?</u>\n\n【13】Which Is the Better Anesthesia Between General and Monitored Care?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Many retrospective studies have found some kind of association between GA and worse neurologic outcomes in patients who underwent acute thrombectomy procedures. MAC has been known to hasten vascular access time, which is the difference between imaging and puncture time. But these studies failed to demonstrate an advantage in the time to revascularization (procedure to restore blood flow). However, it should be noted that both MAC and GA have remarkably reduced blood pressure, which has subsequently led to an increased risk of infarction. Aggressive treatment by the anesthesiologist to minimize the potential risk of GA-induced hypotension.\n\n【15】In selected patients who are cooperative, MAC will help assist in a neurologic examination throughout the procedure. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one anesthetic technique over another routinely. Instead, the technique employed should be based upon a quick clinical assessment of the patient, the comfort level of the anesthesiologist with various methods, and local practice. If GA is selected, extra attention must be given to avoid undue delay in endovascular treatment and maintenance of cerebral circulation.\n\n【16】What Is a WADA Test?\n--------------------\n\n【17】A WADA test is done to determine which is the dominant side for cognitive functions like speech, thinking, and memory. It is done by injecting a small dose of an anesthetic drug or barbiturates into the internal carotid artery. It can be done before surgery in patients with non-threatening conditions like epilepsy. The super selective anesthesia functional examination (SAFE) is an extension of the WADA test. It is also performed before permanent embolization by injecting anesthetic into the vessels. Angiographically occult vessels that supply normal brain tissue are identified. But these tests can also lead to complications like anaphylaxis (anaphylaxis refers to a life-threatening severe allergic reaction to an allergen exposure), contrast hypersensitivity, and hemorrhage (bleeding).\n\n【18】What Is the Protocol for a COVID Positive Patient?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Many patients receive MAC for endovascular treatment, but an urgent conversion to GA may be required in patients with suspected positive COVID infection. Arterial ischemic stroke refers to a condition in which there is blockage or narrowing of the artery that supplies the brain due to blood clot formation. During an AIS (arterial ischemic stroke) immediately requiring EVT, conversion from MAC to GA is undesirable due to the risk of contamination or infection to the healthcare personnel.\n\n【20】Based on the data from randomized control trials, general anesthesia (GA) is non-inferior to monitored anesthesia care (MAC) as long as hemodynamic stability is maintained. Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke has provided better neurological outcomes. If the anesthesiologist finds any difficulties in the urgent conversion of MAC to GA, it is better to start with GA. The choice of the anesthetic and technique to be used should be planned uniquely for each patient, accounting for the patient's neurological and medical status as well as the risk of infection to healthcare personnels.\n\n【21】The following are the preferred candidates for GA in case of suspected COVID:\n\n【22】*   Patients with acute respiratory distress.\n\n【23】*   Patients require a high flow of oxygen or hypoxemia.\n\n【24】*   Those who have an active cough.\n\n【25】*   Active vomiting.\n\n【26】*   Severe stroke.\n\n【27】*   Uncooperative or agitated patients.\n\n【28】Irrespective of the implicated anesthetic technique, hemodynamic stability, ventilation, or oxygenation should be maintained in the recommended range. Blood pressure should be maintained between 140 and 180 mmHg, and oxygen saturation should be more than 94 percent.\n\n【29】What Is the Downside of Endovascular Treatment?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Despite EVT having shown overall improvements in short-term outcomes, the long-term consequences have not been everlasting. Moreover, endovascular repairs have been shown to be less durable, and there might be a need for reintervention. This is infrequent in traditional open repairs. Endovascular surgery has its own unique set of complications.

Urgent assessment and rapid treatment are crucial for better clinical outcomes. In conjunction with imaging advances, endovascular therapy has led to significant outcome benefits.

The eye is more sensitive to drug-related side effects due to its abundant blood supply and thin size. Numerous systemic medications include Bisphosphonates, Topiramate, Vigabatrin, Isotretinoin, other retinoids, Amiodarone, Ethambutol, Chloroquine hydroxychloroquine, Tamoxifen, Quetiapine, Cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, erectile dysfunction medications, and some herbal remedies may cause eye toxicity. Ocular side effects may be linked to a drug's pharmacodynamic (action of the drug) or pharmacokinetic activity (reaction of the body in relation to the exposure of the drug), perhaps acting as a toxicity signal. It is possible to experience both transient visual abnormalities and permanent eyesight loss. Although there are several ways to lower the risk of vision loss, including monitoring for ocular toxicity, lowering the dosage, or quitting the medication and seeking an alternative.\n\n【2】What Are the Systemic Drugs With Toxic Ophthalmic Reactions?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】All the tissues and functions of the eye can be impacted by systemic drug administration, and they may even act as a toxic indicator. It is possible to experience both transient visual abnormalities and irreversible eyesight loss. The most common drugs which induce adverse or toxic ophthalmic reactions are\n\n【4】*   Amiodarone.\n\n【5】*   Phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\n\n【6】*   Bisphosphonates.\n\n【7】*   Antiepileptic drug.\n\n【8】*   Antimalarial drug.\n\n【9】*   Ethambutol.\n\n【10】*   Herbs.\n\n【11】**1) Amiodarone:** Amiodarone is a class III anti-arrhythmic used to treat different arrhythmias. It has been linked to several ocular side effects, the most prevalent of which are\n\n【12】*   **Corneal Deposits:** After one month of treatment with Amiodarone, corneal deposits or keratopathy develops. It is distinguished into three phases. The first phase is forming a horizontal line in the cornea in people taking 200 to 400 mg. Higher dosages can cause phase two and three effects, characterized by a cat-whisker pattern and a whorl-like (verticillate) pattern in the cornea. It might take 3 to 20 months after the withdrawal of Amiodarone to recover from deposits. Colored halos or bright circles of light that encircle headlights and other light sources are also associated with corneal deposits:\n\n【13】    *   **Optic Neuropathy:** It occurs less commonly (2 percent), although it can be severe, resulting in vision loss.\n\n【14】    *   **Other Toxic Effects:** Irritation of the eyelid, eyelid cysts, and dry eyes linked with Amiodarone therapy. A baseline ophthalmic examination is recommended before starting medication, followed by subsequent examinations every six months for the first year and every 12 months afterward.\n\n【15】**2) Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors:** Sildenafil, Vardenafil, and Tadalafil are phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors that treat erectile dysfunction by inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate. PDE5 inhibitors have been linked to various ocular side effects, including color perception abnormalities (typically blue or green), blurred vision, changes in light perception, photophobia, and eye inflammation. However, these occurrences have not resulted in long-term changes in perceptions of color.\n\n【16】**3) Bisphosphonates:** Bisphosphonates (Alendronate, Ibandronate, and Risedronate) treat osteoporosis during postmenopausal and in paget disease. Inflammatory responses caused by bisphosphonates include conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyeball), uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer in the eye wall or uvea), scleritis (inflammation in the white portion of the eye), episcleritis, and keratitis (corneal inflammation). The majority of conjunctivitis cases resolve on their own. Uveitis is often treated with ocular or systemic medications, and the Bisphosphonate may be discontinued. However, Bisphosphonate can be maintained in episcleritis conditions.\n\n【17】**4) Antiepileptic Drug:** Vigabatrin and Topiramate are antiepileptic drugs used to treat seizures. Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic medicine that can treat refractory seizures in individuals who have not responded to previous antiepileptic drug treatments. From 30% to 40% of individuals have experienced vision loss due to Vigabatrin medication. On the other hand, Topiramate is used to treat seizures and migraine prophylaxis.\n\n【18】*   **Acute Angle-closure Glaucoma:** Acute angle-closure glaucoma is most likely to occur within the first two weeks after beginning or modifying the Topiramate drug. It manifests as bilateral blurry vision. Topical mydriasis-inducing medications and beta blockers may help reduce intraocular pressure by retracting the ciliary processes.\n\n【19】**5) Antimalarial Drug:** Hydroxy-chloroquine treats several illnesses, including malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ophthalmic toxicity is associated with both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These medications impact retinal cell metabolism by adhering to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium. Antimalarial drug toxicity is characterized by bilateral bull's-eye maculopathy. There is currently no cure for hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy. Discontinuation may aid in arresting progression, but the impact is irreversible.\n\n【20】**6) Ethambutol:** Ethambutol is used to treat TB and is also associated with many ocular side effects, the most serious of which is optic neuritis. Color vision alterations and visual-field abnormalities have also been reported as ocular abnormalities. Generally, Ethambutol is eliminated in the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; hence, renal impairment might result in higher drug levels and toxicity. Hence, Individuals with additional ocular risk factors, such as renal insufficiency, should be examined periodically.\n\n【21】**6) Herbs:** Herbal supplements have also been linked to ocular side effects. The common herbs with toxic effects are\n\n【22】*   **Niacin:** 1.5g of niacin reduces cholesterol. However, it causes cystoid macular edema (thickening of the retina). However, the edema usually disappears after two weeks of stopping the medication. Additionally, it is also reported that clouded vision is a result of niacin usage.\n\n【23】*   **Chamomile:** It can produce acute conjunctivitis and angioedema, most likely owing to sensitivity to allergens in chamomile.\n\n【24】*   **Echinacea:** It is taken orally to stimulate the immune system and might induce eye irritation and conjunctivitis. Symptoms resolve within a day of discontinuing usage.\n\n【25】How to Manage Ocular Toxicity?\n------------------------------\n\n【26】Certain ocular side effects or toxicity, such as increased intraocular pressure, are treatable with medication or laser treatment. Some ocular adverse effects like macular atrophy (age-related retinal damage) might result in irreversible vision loss, emphasizing the importance of screening for damage at an early stage. The other management of ocular toxicity involves\n\n【27】*   Screening before therapy\n\n【28】*   Monitoring for ocular toxicity.\n\n【29】*   Lowering medication dosages.\n\n【30】*   Withdrawing the medicine.\n\n【31】*   Investigating an alternative drug.\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】Oral medications that are commonly used can have ocular side effects. In addition to retinal toxicity, oral medications can harm other eye elements, such as the cornea, lens, and optic nerve. Drugs should always be considered a potential cause of unexplained eye problems. Opthomologist is positioned to highlight the possibility of ocular toxicity with systemically administered drugs and to emphasize the significance of frequent monitoring and follow-up for adverse visual effects.\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ocular adverse effects associated with systemic medications : recognition and management  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17209665/\n*   The ocular adverse effects of oral drugs  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377292/\n*   Drug Toxicity to the Retina and Optic Nerve: Are You Missing It?  \n    https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/drug-toxicity-to-the-retina-and-optic-nerve</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The spinal cord, also known as the backbone, is the most important part of the body responsible for the gait and posture of an individual. It is divided into five regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum, and coccyx. There are all 24 bones in this region that are movable, and the bones in the sacral and coccyx are fused. The neck has seven vertebrae, twelve in the thoracic and five in the lumbar region. The spine is the main central body support structure, and It has flexibility due to elastic ligaments and the spinal disks in between the vertebrae. The lower part of the backbone is more prone to damage and strain injury.\n\n【2】What Is Disk Desiccation?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】In between each vertebra, a spongy disk acts as a shock absorber. Due to extreme wear and tear over time, this disk wears down as a process of degenerative disk disease. This degeneration occurs as a result of fluid loss, which makes the disk dehydrated and results in deformation and shape changes. This reduces the flexibility and height of the disk and affects its functionality. In most cases, it leads to immense pain, neurological compression, and many associated symptoms. Most of the population after the age of 40 experience degeneration of the disk and develop symptoms. For five percent of adults, it leads to intense back pain.\n\n【4】What Types of Conditions Are Caused by Disk Desiccation?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The disk, when it degenerates and cushions wear away, causes bones to rub against each other and to result in immense pain and other associated conditions like:\n\n【6】*   **Herniated Disk:** In this condition, bulges, ruptures, and slipped discs occur.\n\n【7】*   **Spinal Stenosis:** It occurs when spaces around the spine become narrow.\n\n【8】*   **Adult Scoliosis:** The condition that leads to curvature of the spine.\n\n【9】*   **Spondylolisthesis:** Condition where the vertebrae of the spine move in and out of place.\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Disk Desiccation?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】The major and most common cause of disk desiccation is aging. It is normal with aging. After 40 years, most individuals have disk desiccation, though everyone does not experience intense pain.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>I have lower back pain.

With age, this disk loses this fluid resulting in a thinner disk failing to provide shock absorption and leading the bones to rub against each other.\n\n【19】*   Crack or tear traumas and injuries can lead to small tears and cracks in the spinal disk. Mostly they occur near nerves. This can be immensely painful. This leads to a crack in the outer wall of the spinal disk resulting in the disk bulging out of its place, this condition is called herniated disk, and this also compresses the spinal nerves near the spine.\n\n【20】What Are the Symptoms of Disk Desiccation?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The most common symptoms of disk desiccation are back and neck pain:\n\n【22】*   Early symptoms include a stiff back, accompanied by tingling, pain, and weakness.\n\n【23】*   If the disk desiccation leads to loss of height of the disk, the shift in position can lead to affecting the adjacent vertebrae bodies and lead to compress nerves nearby, causing radicular pain and numbness. This pain can radiate to the knees and legs.\n\n【24】*   The pain can come and go and lasts for weeks or months.\n\n【25】*   Numbness and tingling legs and arms.\n\n【26】*   Pain worsens with bending, sitting, and lifting heavy objects.\n\n【27】*   Pain radiates down the lower back and buttocks.\n\n【28】How Is Disk Dissection Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【29】Disk desiccation is commonly diagnosed by a common symptom like back pain. Few details regarding the onset of pain, duration, aggravating and relieving factors, and radiating regions are taken into consideration.\n\n【30】Additional testing methods include:\n\n【31】*   X-rays.\n\n【32】*   Computed tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【33】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【34】*   Blood tests.\n\n【35】This test helps to detect the deformation and get detailed imaging of bones and adjacent structures. The diagnosis is confirmed if the disk appears thin or out of position.\n\n【36】What Is the Treatment for Disk Desiccation?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】If the disk dissection has no significant pain and not affecting daily activities, no treatment is required.\n\n【38】Home remedies for managing disk desiccation include:\n\n【39】*   Brace around the back while lifting heavy objects.\n\n【40】*   Avoid uncomfortable and painful positions.\n\n【41】*   Increase back strength through core exercise and weight loss.\n\n【42】*   Take over-the-counter medications to relieve pain and discomfort.\n\n【43】*   In some cases, steroid injections help in relieving pain and inflammation.\n\n【44】*   Hot and cold therapy, placing an ice pack, and heating pads every 10 to 15 minutes can help to relieve pain.\n\n【45】*   Yoga and other stretching exercises can help relieve pain and discomfort.\n\n【46】In extreme cases, different approaches to surgery help to treat desiccated discs. This procedure includes the following:\n\n【47】*   **Radiofrequency Neurotomy -** Electric currents are used to burn the sensory nerves and this in turn prevents pain signals from reaching the brain.\n\n【48】*   **Decompression -** This surgery removes extra bone and disk that is out of place and creates more room for spinal nerves.\n\n【49】*   **Fusion -** Surgery is done to join the vertebrae together. This stabilizes the back and prevents movements reducing pain and discomfort.\n\n【50】*   **Correction -** This procedure is done to correct the abnormal curvatures of the spine and in turn, helps in relieving pain and increasing the range of motion.\n\n【51】*   **Implants -** Artificial spacers (implants) and disks are placed between the vertebrae to avoid the friction and pain caused by bones rubbing against each other.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】Disk dissection is an unavoidable condition. But this condition can be managed by many techniques. Follow a pain management plan if there is extreme back pain due to a desiccated disk. If left untreated and the triggering factors are not removed at the right time, this may lead to serious complications and cause spine misalignment. The best approach to potentially avoid it is practicing a positive lifestyle, staying hydrated, maintaining a healthy weight, being active, and following proper techniques to lift heavy objects.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Degenerative Disk Disease  \n    https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/d/degenerative-disc-disease.html\n*   Degenerative Disc Disease  \n    https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/neurosurgery/conditions-treated/degenerative-disc-disease\n*   What Is Disc Desiccation?  \n    https://clear-institute.org/blog/disc-desiccation/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are brought on by faulty gene production, abnormal gene expression, or external factors like infection or ischemia that interfere with a gene's activity, interrupting the normal developmental sequences.\n\n【2】The abnormalities of cortical development are divided into various categories. These conditions could develop as the cortex proliferates, migrating, or organizing. These illnesses have a wide range of clinical symptoms, influenced mainly by the arrest stage. Epilepsy and developmental delays are both frequently caused by problems with cortical development. A helpful method for diagnosing these illnesses is MR imaging.\n\n【3】What Is Cortical Organization?\n------------------------------\n\n【4】Cortical organization refers to the structure and arrangement of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. The cerebral cortex plays a crucial role in various cognitive functions, including perception, attention, memory, language, and higher-order thinking. The cortical organization is characterized by a complex and intricate arrangement of neural cells, particularly neurons. Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into distinct layers and columns that are specialized for different types of information processing.\n\n【5】**Layers:** The cortical layers are horizontal divisions that run parallel to the brain's surface. Typically, there are six layers in the cerebral cortex, each with its unique composition of neurons, connectivity patterns, and functional properties. These layers have different roles in information processing and communication within the cortex.\n\n【6】**Columns:** Cortical columns are vertical structures that extend across multiple cortical layers. These columns consist of a group of neurons that are functionally related and interconnected. They are organized in a columnar fashion to facilitate the processing and integration of information across different cortical layers.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Different Types of Periodontal Diseases: The Classifications</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>OnabotulinumtoxinA - Limitations and Clinical Studies</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Retinal Vasculitis - Signs, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n\n【12】**Functional Areas:** The cerebral cortex is divided into different functional areas, each responsible for specific cognitive functions. These areas include the primary sensory areas (such as the primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, and primary somatosensory cortex), as well as higher-order association areas involved in more complex cognitive processes.\n\n【13】**Cortical Maps:** The cortical organization also includes the presence of cortical maps, which are representations of sensory or motor information across specific regions of the cortex. For example, the somatosensory cortex has a body map, where different regions of the body are represented in an orderly manner. Similarly, the primary visual cortex contains a retinotopic map, where different parts of the visual field are mapped onto specific areas of the cortex.\n\n【14】What Are the Different Classifications of the Disorders of Cortical Formation?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The following are the different stages:\n\n【16】**Embryology:** Three steps are involved in forming the cerebral cortex, cortical organization, cell migration, and cell proliferation. Both neuronal and glial precursors are produced during cell proliferation. However, during migration, these cells move from the proliferative zone to their intended ultimate location. During the period of cortical formation, the cellular network is formed.\n\n【17】Between the third and fifth months of pregnancy, neurons migrate. In six successive waves, the neurons migrate from the germinal zone to their eventual location near the pial surface. Each wave of migrating neuroblasts travels to the cytoplasmic process' pial extension before detaching from it.\n\n【18】As a result, the cerebral cortex's deepest region is occupied by the first neurons to migrate, while the cortex's more superficial regions are home to the later migrants. Radial glial fibers and mediators control migration.\n\n【19】Migration abnormalities are caused by disturbances in the guiding mechanism or the timely separation of the migrating neurons in the cerebral cortex. Under migration, over-migration, or ectopic neural migration are the causes of neuronal migration disorders.\n\n【20】Starting at 22 weeks of fetal gestation and lasting until age two, the cortical organization depends on proper neural migration. The differentiation of neurons forms the normal cortical cytoarchitectonic pattern into different cell types, which group into horizontal laminar aggregates and vertical columns. Anomalies in gyral development and cortical organization emerge from disorders of cortical organization.\n\n【21】**Genetics:** A dominant or X-linked mutation in a particular gene frequently results in cortical development disorders. Mapped or cloned for abnormalities of cortical development are several new genes and new mutations of existing genes.\n\n【22】Patients with severe germline mutations, such as deletions and truncations, frequently exhibit severe symptoms, but those with somatic mosaic mutations frequently do not. Both the mosaicism and germline mutations have the mutation in some or all of the cells. When evaluating the clinical and imaging characteristics of the affected patients, the type of mutation is frequently just as crucial as figuring out which gene has been altered. In genetic counseling, understanding these pathways is crucial.\n\n【23】Every few years, the classification system for disorders of cortical formations changes in response to new knowledge about the neurogenetic underpinnings of the various syndromes.\n\n【24】The three main stages of cortex development do not occur sequentially. After the migration starts, proliferation resumes, and migration resumes as the organization begins. The cells produced by aberrant proliferation frequently do not move or are improperly organized. Too many or too few neurons or aberrant cells may cause disorders of cortical development brought on by improper cell proliferation. Too few neurons cause microlissencephaly, too many cells cause hemimegalencephaly, and aberrant cells cause focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).\n\n【25】**Microlissencephaly**: A significant microcephaly and an aberrant sulcation are the hallmarks of microlissencephaly. The patient has severe congenital microcephaly without perinatal harm. This disease is caused by either increased apoptosis or decreased cell formation in the cerebral cortex. Microcephaly is divided into two categories, severe microlissencephaly and mild microcephaly, with a streamlined gyral layout.\n\n【26】The congenital anomaly known as microlissencephaly is characterized by a smooth cortical surface and a thicker cortex. A moderate malformation with insufficient sulci and normal cortical thickness is microcephaly with a simplified gyral pattern, typically an isolated anomaly.\n\n【27】**Hemimegalencephaly:** A part or the entire cerebral hemisphere may be enlarged and dysplastically overgrown in hemimegalencephaly. It happens when there are too many neuromas or when apoptosis is low. It could be an isolated anomaly or linked to syndromes like tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type I, unilateral hypomelanosis of Ito, proteus syndrome, epidermal nevus syndrome, and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\n\n【28】Patients with hemimegalencephaly have one or more cerebral hemispheres that are moderate to noticeably enlarged. The cerebral cortex could be dysplastic or normal.\n\n【29】**FCD:** In a specific area of the cerebral cortex, FCD is a diverse set of lesions distinguished by aberrant neurons and glial cells. Usually, patients arrive with uncontrollable seizures. From minor cortical disruption without cellular abnormality to severe cases with obvious cortical dyslamination, strange massive cells, and cerebral cortex astrocytosis, FCD spans a spectrum of anomalies. Taylor FCD is characterized by balloon cells in the subcortical white matter and cortex and cytoarchitectural disorder of the cortex brought on by enormous weird, disoriented neurons. There are more cortical neurons, and they are distributed atypically. Both astrocytes and neurons share features with balloon cells.\n\n【30】FCD manifests as a discrete gray-white matter junction and a localized area of cortical thickening. A subcortical linear, curvilinear, radial, or funnel-shaped center of aberrant signal strength can be seen from the gray-white matter junction to the superolateral edge of the lateral ventricle. There are also abnormally enlarged or deep sulci and macrogyria.\n\n【31】**Lissencephaly:** Patients with the entire form of classic lissencephaly may have a smooth brain surface. More frequently, the partial form has a smooth surface with some gyral development along the inferior frontal and temporal lobe lobes. This anomaly is the result of the migration process being stopped. Patients either appear with seizures or developmental delay in the entire form.\n\n【32】The abnormality is characterized by parieto-occipital agyria with frontotemporal pachygyria in the incomplete form or full agyria in the complete form. Because the radial columns of the arrested cells are contained within the cortex, it is thick. White matter in the subcortex is thin and does not interdigitate with grey matter as it should. The parieto-occipital cortex exhibits the highest signal strength in a circumferential band on T2-weighted images, corresponding to a sparse cell zone with high water content. Due to a lack of operculization or inadequate operculization, the cerebral structure is oval or hourglass-shaped with shallow Sylvian fissures.\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】MR imaging is a crucial diagnostic technique for diagnosing cortical formation abnormalities. These illnesses' morphology, distribution, and severity must be clearly shown. Additionally, it can indicate genetic problems, linked congenital malformations, and related disorders.\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>*   Disorders of Cortical Formation: MR Imaging Features  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7051699/\n*   Cortical Malformations: Lessons in Human Brain Development  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00576/full\n*   What disorders of cortical development tell us about the cortex: one plus one doesn’t always make two  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139684/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This medication helps in treating opioid drug addiction by reducing drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It is available in tablets, implants under the skin, injection solutions, or skin patches.\n\n【44】What Are the Long-Term Effects of Buprenorphine/Naloxone?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Buprenorphine/Naloxone treats opioid dependency with prolonged usage, often leading to Naloxone toxicity.\n\n【46】The long-term effects are as follows:\n\n【47】*   Liver damage.\n\n【48】*   Abuse and dependence.\n\n【49】*   Hormonal problems (such as adrenal insufficiency).\n\n【50】What Is the Route of Administration of Buprenorphine/Naloxone?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】A doctor can administer naloxone through various routes, such as:\n\n【52】*   **Intravenous Route**\\- The effects of Naloxone through the IV route is very rapid, but locating venous access becomes difficult for people using drugs frequently. The onset of Naloxone occurs within one to two minutes, and the effects last for almost 40 minutes.\n\n【53】*   **Intranasal Route**\\- This route of administration of Naloxone is usually preferred for a person who is unresponsive or unconscious. This route delays the medication effects, but portable nasal sprays have made Naloxone more useful.\n\n【54】*   **Intramuscular Route**\\- Naloxone injection is also administered into the muscle, and the effects are produced within two to four minutes and last up to 30 to 120 minutes. Intramuscular injections are available as auto-injectors, pre-filled injections, or vials.\n\n【55】What Precautions Should Be Taken Before Using Naloxone Injection?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Precautions that a person should take before using Naloxone include:\n\n【57】*   Naloxone can cause allergic reactions. Therefore, a person must inform the doctor about being allergic to Naloxone or any other drug.\n\n【58】*   Always inform the doctor about any medical condition a person suffers from, such as head injury, seizures, asthma, tumors, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, liver disease, digestive diseases, or mental disorders.\n\n【59】*   Naloxone can cause drowsiness and dizziness in a person. Avoid taking this medication with other drugs like cannabis and alcohol, as it can lead to severe breathing problems, which can be fatal.\n\n【60】*   Buprenorphine or Naloxone can also alter the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). Therefore, a person must use the medicine after the doctor's advice. In case of any symptoms like fainting, irregular heartbeat, or severe dizziness, consult the doctor immediately.\n\n【61】*   Tooth and gums problems are also caused by Naloxone medication. Consult the dentist immediately.\n\n【62】*   Naloxone injection is given after surgery to minimize the effects of opioids. A person should Inform the doctor before surgery about all the medications they are taking.\n\n【63】*   Pregnant women or those planning for a child should be given this medication when it is urgently needed. This medication can cause minor congenital disabilities in newborns and harm the fetus.\n\n【64】*   Naloxone does not have any significant effects on breast milk. However, consult the doctor immediately if a baby shows troubled breathing or unusual sleepiness.\n\n【65】How Is Opioid Addiction Treated With Buprenorphine and Naloxone?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】Buprenorphine and Naloxone are used to treat opioid addiction in the following ways:\n\n【67】*   **Induction Phase**\\- The combination medicine is prescribed to a person suffering from short-acting opioid addiction, such as morphine or heroin. Oral tablets under the tongue are given during the induction phase of the treatment. Tablets are not kept in the cheeks as they can cause withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【68】*   **Maintenance Phase**\\- This phase is obtained once a person becomes stable with a specific dose of the combination medicine. Medication is given as oral tablets to be kept under the tongue and in the cheek. This prolonged treatment plan lasts up to weeks, months, or years.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Naloxone is primarily used to treat overdose and toxicity caused by opiates. The medication is usually given as an injection through an intravenous route for rapid onset. There are no specific side effects associated with Naloxone, and it is generally considered safe for treatment.\n\n【71】A person with overdoses on opioids experiences breathing difficulty and brain damage. Therefore, Naloxone helps to inhibit the action of these excessive opioids in the body and blocks their functioning. The side effects produced by the medication are not usually long-lasting or fatal. However, a person should consult the nearest health center in an emergency.\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>*   Buprenorphine  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459126/\n*   Naloxone Injection  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a612022.html\n*   Management of Opioid Analgesic Overdose  \n    https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1202561\n*   Naloxone (Nasal Route)  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/naloxone-nasal-route/side-effects/drg-20165181?p=1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Phytanic acid is obtained from diets like dairy products and animal-derived foods (beef, meat, and seafood). Normally phytanic acid is broken by alpha oxidation (the process of breakdown of fats in the body) within cell structures called peroxisomes. The mutation in the gene PHYH (Phytanoyl-CoA 2-Hydroxylase) and PEX7 (Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 7) gene (which helps in peroxisome functions is disrupted, leading to Refsum disease. Early signs of Refsum disease are loss of vision (retinitis pigmentosa), and loss of smell (anosmia) is observed in teenagers between the age of 10 to 20 years.\n\n【2】What Is the Prevalence of Refsum Disease?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The prevalence of Refsum disease is about one in one million people in the general population. Both females and males are affected equally.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Refsum Disease?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   **Genetic Mutation:** Refsum disease is a rare disorder caused by mutation of PHYH (Phytanoyl-CoA 2-Hydroxylase) and PEX7 (Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 7) gene resulting in disruption of peroxisomes that contains enzymes that break phytanic acid resulting in abnormal deposition of fat in tissues and blood plasma.\n\n【6】*   **Hereditary:** If one of the parents has Refsum disease, there are increased chances of having a child with a similar disease.\n\n【7】What Are the Types of Refsum Disease?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【8】**It is of two types:**\n\n【9】1.  **Adult or Classical Refsum Disease:** It occurs due to a deficiency of enzyme phytanoyl-CoA Hydroxylase (PAHX) encoded by gene PHYH (Phytanoyl-CoA 2-Hydroxylase), which disrupts peroxisomes functions to breakdown the fast resulting in an abnormal build-up of lipids.\n\n【10】2.  **Infantile Refsum Disease:** It occurs due to genetic mutation of PEX 1, PEX 2, PEX 7, and PEX27 genes. PEX gene function to transport phytanic acid to the peroxisomal compartment for breakdown is disrupted, leading to abnormal fat build-up in body tissues and blood plasma.\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Refsum Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms related to Refsum disease are:\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Bariatric & Metabolic Surgery Training</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Refsum Disease - Causes, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Oral Dysfunction in Breastfeeding Infants: An Overview</u>\n\n【18】*   Retinitis pigmentosa (damage to the retina -the back wall of the eye causing loss of night vision).\n\n【19】*   Complete loss of vision in severe cases.\n\n【20】*   Anosmia (loss of smell).\n\n【21】*   Ichthyosis (dry, scaly, and thick skin).\n\n【22】*   Weakness of muscles in upper and lower limbs (arms and legs).\n\n【23】*   Loss of balance and coordination (due to Cerebral ataxia-Injury to the cerebellum area of the brain).\n\n【24】*   Abnormal heart rate (in rare cases).\n\n【25】*   Nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movements).\n\n【26】*   Structural defects of hands and feet (bone defects leading to short hands or feet).\n\n【27】*   Skeletal defects (affecting elbow, shoulder, and knee joints).\n\n【28】How Is Refsum Disease Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【29】*   **History and Clinical Examination:** The Diet history of the patient is noted. Clinical examination of eyes, hands, and feet is done to rule out any defects associated with Refsum disease.\n\n【30】*   **X-Ray of Hands and Feet:** It is done to check the bone abnormalities in the hands and feet.\n\n【31】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** It is done to rule out any heart rate and rhythm abnormalities.\n\n【32】*   **Molecular Gene Test:** Genetic testing is done to check for the presence of PHYH (Phytanoyl-CoA 2-Hydroxylase) and PEX7 (Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 7) gene mutation.\n\n【33】*   **Plasma Analysis:** Blood plasma evaluation is done to check for the levels of phytanic acid in the body. Normally the blood plasma level of phytanic acid is less than 30 micromoles per liter, but it is raised to more than 200 micromoles per liter in the case of Refsum disease.\n\n【34】*   **Liver Biopsy:** It is done to rule out abnormal functioning or the deficiency of enzyme phytanoyl-CoA Hydroxylase (PAHX) encoded by gene PHYH resulting in abnormal deposition of fats in the liver.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment of Refsum Disease?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【36】Treatment methods for Refsum disease are:\n\n【37】*   **Diet Restriction:** Avoid food containing phytol like meats, fish, and dairy products (butter and cheese). The goal is to restrict the consumption of phytanic acid to less than ten milligrams to avoid abnormal build-up of fats in blood plasma and body tissues (liver and kidney).\n\n【38】*   **Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE):** It is done by plasmapheresis (method of removing blood plasma from the body) in cases where phytanic acid removal needs to be done rapidly. Therapeutic plasma exchange filters the phytanic acid out and reduces its concentration in the body. This helps to prevent the further progression of the disease. This method can control phytanic acid levels in the body for about sixty to seventy percent, which is around 100 micromoles per liter.\n\n【39】*   **Avoid Medications:** Drugs like Ibuprofen and Amiodarone should be avoided as they can increase thyroxine levels. Both these drugs increase the level of phytic acid in the body and disrupt the metabolism of phytanic acid.\n\n【40】*   **Topical Drug Application:** Dry, rough, and scaly skin can be treated with the application of skin creams and mineral oils.\n\n【41】*   **Genetic Counseling:** Genetic counseling should be done for the patient and affected family members.\n\n【42】What Are the Complications That Can Occur if Refsum Disease Is Left Untreated?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】*   **Heart Abnormalities:** Like cardiomyopathy (inability of heart muscles to supply blood to the body effectively).\n\n【44】*   **Muscular Weakness:** Weakness of the upper and lower limb muscles.\n\n【45】*   **Vision Abnormalities:** Like blindness (complete loss of vision).\n\n【46】*   **Nerve Disorders:** It occurs due to the deposition of phytanic acid on the myelin nerve sheath (outer covering of nerve) that causes a tingling sensation or tremor in the hands and feet.\n\n【47】*   **Brain Abnormalities:** Like cerebellar ataxia (injury to the cerebellum area of the brain) resulting in loss of coordination and balance.\n\n【48】*   **Fatty Liver:** It occurs due to abnormal deposition of fat in the liver because of disruption in fat breakdown.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Refsum disease is a rare disorder affecting the breakdown of lipids (fat metabolism) which results in abnormal deposition of fats in the blood plasma and other body parts like the liver and kidney. It can affect both infants and teenagers, resulting in vision loss, loss of smell, muscle weakness, short limbs, and loss of balance which significantly affects the life of the patient. Early diagnosis of the condition is crucial to arrest the progression of the disease by reducing the amount of phytanic acid in the body by the treatment. Sometimes Refsum disorder is present since birth, but in some cases, signs and symptoms start appearing at ten to twenty years of age. Any signs and symptoms associated with the disease observed should be reported to the doctor immediately for early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Refsum Disease  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/refsum-disease/\n*   Refsum disease  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/download/genetics/condition/refsum-disease.pdf\n*   Refsum Disease  \n    https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/refsum-disease</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "62c273ea-6276-43ae-a86b-0f59e7b0bae2", "title": "Hartmann’s Procedure - A Surgical Approach for GI Issues", "text": "【0】Hartmann’s Procedure - A Surgical Approach for GI Issues\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The closed-off region of the rectum and anus is sometimes referred to as Hartmann's pouch by doctors when discussing Hartmann's procedure. However, this Hartmann’s pouch is different from the Hartmann’s pouch in the gallbladder. It is shaped like a pouch since the anus side is open, the rectum side is sealed, and the remaining length is quite small. It serves no particular purpose, but clinicians may distinguish it from other body parts when checking for diseases or infections, particularly in patients undergoing Hartmann's pouch surgery to treat diverticulitis (development of small, bulged pouches in the digestive tract) or cancer.\n\n【2】What Is Hartmann Procedure?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Hartmann’s procedure, also known as proctosigmoidectomy, is surgery of the large intestine. It is a specialized colectomy in which only a part of the colon is removed. Henri Albert Hartmann introduced the Hartmann method for the first time in the year 1921. Hartmann created this technique in reaction to the abdominoperineal resection's high death rate. In Hartmann's surgery, the sigmoid colon, the last section of the colon that meets the rectum, is removed. The rectosigmoid colon is resected during the Hartmann surgery, and a colostomy (an opening in the colon created by performing surgery) is made in the process. Hartmann's procedure is used to remove the diseased or infected parts of the intestine.\n\n【4】Hartmann's procedure can be done either as a planned surgery or in an emergency. In order to remove an obstruction, a chronic infection, or cancer before it spreads, Hartmann's surgery is frequently performed in emergency situations. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to properly reattach the remaining portions of the bowel after removing a portion of it. It is very challenging or risky to attempt to reunite the portions during the same surgery due to infection, inflammation, and other causes. Moreover, the colon needs some time to heal. In order to accomplish this, Hartmann's procedure closes the residual rectum and directs the remaining colon to a new outlet known as a colostomy.\n\n【5】What Are the Parts of Hartmann’s Procedure?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】There are two parts to Hartmann’s procedure:\n\n【7】1.  In the first part, the last portion, or the lower portion of the bowel, is surgically removed.\n\n【8】2.  The second part of the procedure involves redirecting the remaining part of the bowel into a colostomy.\n\n【9】What Are the Indications of Hartmann Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   The indications for the Hartmann procedure have evolved over time, despite the fact that it was first designed to treat distal colon cancer.\n\n【11】*   Diverticulitis is complicated, particularly in stages III and IV, and involves peritonitis.\n\n【12】*   Colorectal cancer, especially rectosigmoid cancer. If cancer results in obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, it can be necessary to perform emergency surgery.\n\n【13】*   Large bowel obstruction caused by scar tissue.\n\n【14】*   Inflammatory bowel disease complication.\n\n【15】*   A complication of another bowel surgery.\n\n【16】*   Rectal prolapse.\n\n【17】*   Injury or trauma.\n\n【18】How Is Hatmann Procedure Done?\n------------------------------\n\n【19】Hartmann’s procedure can be done via laparoscopic surgery or open surgery, depending on the patient's condition. In traditional open surgery, the abdominal cavity is opened in order to reach the organs. However, a more recent technique termed laparoscopic surgery makes smaller incisions with the help of a tiny camera known as a laparoscope. Although the laparoscopic approach is less invasive and requires a quicker recovery, not all conditions can be treated this way. Hartmann’s procedure is performed in the following ways:\n\n【20】**Before the Procedure:**\n\n【21】*   Before the surgery, the patient is asked to fast for at least six to 12 hours. Fasting is important to maintain an empty stomach during the procedure; otherwise, the patient may vomit.\n\n【22】*   The patient will undergo bowel preparation to clear up the colon if it is a planned surgery.\n\n【23】*   An intravenous catheter is installed to keep the patient hydrated.\n\n【24】*   Pain medication options are discussed with the patient in advance in case of planned surgery.\n\n【25】**During the Procedure:**\n\n【26】*   The patient is generally put under general anesthesia.\n\n【27】*   In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon begins with a tiny incision. Through this incision, the laparoscope is introduced. The camera helps visualize organs on a screen. Then the surgeon makes a few more incisions to reach the colon.\n\n【28】*   If the patient is undergoing open surgery, the surgeon makes a single large incision via the abdomen and opens the abdominal cavity.\n\n【29】*   The surgeon will take out the colon to determine which part has to be removed.\n\n【30】*   The diseased part of the colon is removed, and the rectal ends are sealed off.\n\n【31】*   The surgeon creates a new opening called a stoma in the abdominal wall before attaching the other end of the colon to the abdominal wall.\n\n【32】*   A colostomy bag is attached to the stoma (an opening in the abdomen that forms a connection to the digestive system or the urinary tract).\n\n【33】*   The surgical wounds are closed.\n\n【34】**After the Procedure:**\n\n【35】*   After the procedure, the patient is moved to a recovery room to rest for the next few hours.\n\n【36】*   The patients will spend the following seven to ten days recovering in a hospital room till their condition stabilizes.\n\n【37】*   The patient will be given antibiotics and pain medications to prevent infections and control pain.\n\n【38】*   The medical staff will offer advice on utilizing the colostomy bag and taking care of the stoma.\n\n【39】Can Hartmann Procedure Be Reversed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【40】The patient may require the use of the colostomy bag permanently or only temporarily, depending on their condition. By removing the rectum's seal and releasing the end of the colon attached to the colostomy, the surgeon can reverse Hartmann's surgery. The surgeon will then join the two ends of the colon, allowing the patient to continue having regular bowel movements. The colostomy opening is stitched (sutured). It is advised that Hartmann's procedure reversal be carried out at least six months after the initial Hartmann's procedure.\n\n【41】What Are the Complications Associated With Hartmann Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Possible complications of Hartmann’s procedure are:\n\n【43】*   Post-surgical infection.\n\n【44】*   Pneumonia or chest infections.\n\n【45】*   Hemorrhage or internal bleeding.\n\n【46】*   Leaking colon.\n\n【47】*   Hernia (organ protrusion through an unusual opening).\n\n【48】*   Damage and infection in the surrounding organs.\n\n【49】*   Scarring in the intestine may cause further obstruction.\n\n【50】What Are the Potential Adverse Effects of Hartmann Procedure?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】Potential side-effects of Hartmann’s procedure are as follows:\n\n【52】*   **Temporary Ileus:** After the procedure, the bowels could take a while to get back to normal. This condition is known as ileus or bowel paralysis. While the patient's bowels heal, they could require short-term IV (intravenous) fluids or nourishment.\n\n【53】*   **Anal Discharge:** Patients may experience occasional anal discharge even though they will not be excreting from their anus.\n\n【54】*   **Sexual Dysfunction:** A nerve associated with sexual functioning might occasionally get injured during rectal surgery. Therefore, this could make sex more painful or sensitive for women. In addition, it could make it difficult for males to ejaculate or keep an erection for a longer time.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Hartmann’s procedure is done to treat conditions like colon cancer, colorectal cancer, diverticulitis, etc. The procedure can be done as a planned surgery or in emergency conditions. However, the procedure is generally quick and safe and has a good prognosis. The procedure is reversible, and reversal is usually performed after six to twelve months.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hartmann’s procedure, reversal and rate of stoma-free survival  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5958852/\n*   Hartmann’s Procedure  \n    https://www.mkuh.nhs.uk/patient-information-leaflet/hartmanns-procedure\n*   Hartmann procedure  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hartmann-procedure</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It affects men and women at any age. There are several causes of burning sensation, the most common being a urinary tract infection. It can also result from conditions affecting the urinary bladder or other organs of the urinary system. If the patient feels pain or a burning sensation while urinating, it is important to consult the doctor immediately because it could be a warning of an infection.\n\n【2】What Is a Burning Sensation?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】It is a feeling that causes pain and discomfort while urinating, something that is not felt normally. The burning sensation can occur due to disease in any organ of the urinary system, including kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Some patients feel pain in the urethra and the surrounding area. Diabetic patients and pregnant females are at a higher risk of developing a urinary tract infection. As a result, they experience a burning sensation frequently. The patient must not ignore the symptoms and talk to the doctor to understand the condition better.\n\n【4】Why Does Burning Sensation Occur While Urinating?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The causes of the burning sensation are listed below:\n\n【6】1.  **Urinary Tract Infection** - It is the most common cause of pain and burning sensation while passing urine. Urinary tract infection is a term used to describe the infection that can occur in any organ of the urinary system. The immune cells in the urinary system work to fight infections and prevent bacterial entry. However, these bacteria enter when the immune system fails to function. The burning sensation while urinating is one of the symptoms of urinary tract infection. It will only subside after the infection is treated. The other symptoms of urinary tract infection include the following:\n\n【7】    *   Fever.\n\n【8】    *   The urine flow is restricted, so the patient passes a few drops of urine each time.\n\n【9】    *   Urinary incontinence or leakage of urine.\n\n【10】    *   The urine appears cloudy and smells bad.\n\n【11】    *   The patient feels pain in the lower back and the abdominal region.\n\n【12】2.  **Vaginal Infection** - The vagina is a muscular organ in females that connects the uterus to the outside world. The vagina consists of healthy bacteria (lactobacillus) and yeasts. The healthy lactobacillus maintains balance in the vagina by inhibiting the overgrowth of yeasts. When the yeasts multiply and outnumber the healthy bacteria, vaginal infection occurs. The yeasts do not remain confined to the vagina alone. They spread to the nearby organs, most commonly the urethra. As a result, the inflammation of the urethra occurs, resulting in pain and a burning sensation while passing urine.\n\n【13】3.  **Sexually Transmitted Infections** - Sexually transmitted infections are among the most common causes of pain and burning sensation while passing urine. The common sexually transmitted infections include the following:\n\n【14】    *   **Chlamydia** - It is a bacterial infection that spreads rapidly in the genital tract. The patient does not experience any symptoms in the initial stage, so the condition goes unnoticed. However, the signs and symptoms become visible in one to two weeks.\n\n【15】    *   **Gonorrhea** - Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that does not remain confined to the genital tract. It affects the other organs, like the eyes, mouth, and throat. The patient usually experiences symptoms in ten days.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>        Related Topics\n\n【17】        * * *\n\n【18】        My meatus is red and there is a burning sensation during urination. Why?\n\n【19】        From the reports, kindly explain about my wife's burning sensation during urination.\n\n【20】        I have white vaginal discharge with burning sensation during urination. Please help.\n\n【21】    *   **Herpes** - It is a viral infection of the genital area caused by the herpes simplex (HSV) virus. It is the most dangerous one because people are unaware of the infection in the initial stage. In the later stages, the person experiences pain, irritation, and dryness around the genital areas. Small ulcers or blisters formaround the genital areas causing pain and a burning sensation while passing urine. The other symptoms that the patient commonly experiences in sexually transmitted infections are listed below:\n\n【22】        *   A white, greenish, or yellowish discharge from the vagina and penis.\n\n【23】        *   Bowel movements become difficult due to pain.\n\n【24】        *   Pain and burning sensation (dysuria) while passing urine.\n\n【25】        *   There is continuous itching and irritation in the vagina and anus.\n\n【26】        *   Some patients experience fever if the infection is severe.\n\n【27】    *   **Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis** - It is a condition in which small pouches develop in the intestinal region that causes inflammation. Urinary tract infection can develop if the condition is left untreated for a long time. In addition, since the urinary bladder and the other urinary system organs are located close to the intestine, the patients can experience a burning sensation during urination.\n\n【28】    *   **Kidney Stones** \\- Kidney stones or nephrolithiasis are formed when the minerals and salts in the urine crystallize and clump together. If the stones are small, they pass through the urinary tract. However, the urine flow becomes obstructed if the stones are large. As a result, the patient experiences pain while passing urine.\n\n【29】    *   **Prostatitis** - It is a condition in which the inflammation of the prostate gland occurs due to bacterial entry. The prostate gland is present near the urinary bladder in men. The inflammation of the prostate gland can trigger pain in the urethra and the bladder when the patient passes urine.\n        </u>\n\n【30】What Are the Methods Used to Diagnose Dysuria or Burning Sensation While Passing Urine?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Dysuria is a symptom that the patient experiences due to a condition. So, the doctor first looks at the medical history of the patient to diagnose the condition. The medical history gives an idea about the diseases the patient is suffering from. For example, if the patient is suffering from a urinary tract infection, urine tests need to be done. On the other hand, screening tests need to be done if he is suffering from sexually transmitted infections. The following tests need to be done to diagnose the conditions:\n\n【32】*   **Urinalysis -** The patient needs to collect the urine in a container. It is then sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. If the urine contains bacteria, an increased number of white blood cells, and blood, then urinary tract infection can be suspected.\n\n【33】*   **Urine Culture** - In this test, the urine sample obtained from the patient is examined in the laboratory. It is left for several days to check the bacterial growth. It is used to identify the causative organism in patients suffering from sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【34】*   **Blood Tests** - The doctor usually recommends blood tests for any disease to check the general health of the patient and if he is suffering from any infection or not.\n\n【35】*   **Screening Tests** - Screening tests are done to check the disease even if the person does not experience any symptoms. Papanicolaou Test (pap test) is commonly done in women to screen them for cervical cancer. The cells present in the vaginal lining or urethra are collected and examined.\n\n【36】*   **Digital Rectal Examination** - A digital rectal examination is done if the burning sensation while passing urine is due to prostate disease. The surgeon inserts a gloved finger into the rectum to examine the prostate gland in this test.\n\n【37】*   **Imaging Tests** - The imaging tests mainly include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and abdominal X-rays. These tests produce three dimensions (3D) images of the internal organs and help detect stones, tumors, and other abnormalities.\n\n【38】**How to Manage the Burning Sensation While Urinating?**\n\n【39】The condition that causes pain while passing urine needs to be treated first. The symptoms subside on their own once the disease is treated. For example, if the burning sensation is due to a urinary tract infection, the following treatment is done:\n\n【40】1.  **Antibiotics** \\- The following drugs are usually recommended to treat urinary tract infections:\n\n【41】    *   Cephalexin.\n\n【42】    *   Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【43】    *   Trimethoprim.\n\n【44】    *   Nitrofurantoin.\n\n【45】    *   Ceftriaxone.\n\n【46】    *   Fosfomycin.\n\n【47】If the burning sensation is due to sexually transmitted infections, the following antibiotics are recommended:\n\n【48】*   Azithromycin.\n\n【49】*   Doxycycline.\n\n【50】*   Erythromycin.\n\n【51】*   Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【52】*   Cefixime.\n\n【53】*   Penicillin G in the case of syphilis.\n\n【54】*   Antiviral drugs like Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, and Famciclovir are used in the case of herpes.\n\n【55】If the burning sensation is due to kidney stones, the following treatments are done:\n\n【56】*   **Lithotripsy** - It is a procedure in which shock waves are sent to the body to break the stone into small pieces. The small fragments easily pass through the urine, and the patient is relieved of the symptoms.\n\n【57】*   **Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy** - In this procedure, an incision is made in the lower back region. Then, a tube known as a nephroscope is inserted through the incision to locate and remove the stone.\n\n【58】*   **Ureteroscopy** - A small tube known as a ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra to examine the urinary system. The stone is removed directly or broken down into pieces to allow it to pass through urine.\n\n【59】If the burning sensation is due to prostatitis, the following antibiotics are recommended:\n\n【60】*   Doxycycline.\n\n【61】*   Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【62】*   Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【63】*   Norfloxacin.\n\n【64】*   Ofloxacin.\n\n【65】What Can Be Done to Prevent a Burning Sensation While Passing Urine?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】The following steps can be followed to prevent a burning sensation while passing urine:\n\n【67】1.  The patient needs to drink plenty of water daily to maintain optimum fluid balance, flush out the bacteria from the body and prevent urinary tract infections.\n\n【68】2.  Citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, and lemons should be consumed daily in case of kidney stones. These fruits contain an important compound called citrate that inhibits stone formation. Therefore, potassium citrate tablets are usually recommended to increase the citrate levels in urine.\n\n【69】3.  Salty food items, animal foods like chicken, meat, and fish, and food rich in oxalates like nuts, chocolates, and rhubarbs should be avoided to balance the sodium, calcium, and oxalate levels.\n\n【70】4.  If the patient wears pads due to urinary incontinence (leakage of urine), it is important to change them regularly to avoid infection.\n\n【71】5.  After urination, the patient should wipe from front to back to keep the area dry and clean.\n\n【72】**Conclusion:**\n\n【73】The conditions that commonly affect the urinary system include urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, kidney stones, and prostate diseases. The most common symptoms of these conditions are pain and burning sensation while urinating. If these conditions are left untreated for a long time, they can cause severe complications. Therefore, it is important to consult the doctor as soon as the symptoms are noted because the patient will get rid of the symptoms only when the condition is treated. Along with treatment, a good diet, drinking a sufficient quantity of water, and maintaining healthy bowel and bladder habits help a lot.\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>*   Definition & Facts of Bladder Infection in Adults  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-infection-uti-in-adults/definition-facts\n*   Dysuria, Frequency, and Urgency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK291/\n*   Prostatitis (Infection of the Prostate)  \n    https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/p/prostatitis-(infection-of-the-prostate)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It occurs mainly during pregnancy. The symptoms of pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy usually resolve after the delivery (postpartum). It is distinguished by a benign skin condition (dermatosis). Papules and pustular follicular lesions first occur on the torso and sometimes spread throughout the body. Therefore, pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy has a lot of differential diagnoses. However, histopathological tests revealed changes consistent with pruritic folliculitis during pregnancy. Therefore, diagnosis is made with its distinctive nature and clinical and histopathological characteristics.\n\n【2】What Is Pruritic Folliculitis in Pregnancy?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) is a benign, specific skin condition (dermatosis) with follicular lesions with papules and pustules. The lesions are primarily seen on the torso and then spread throughout the body. Zoberman and Farmer described pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) in 1981. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) dermatosis starts in the second or third trimester, more likely from the fourth to the ninth month of pregnancy. It involves gilts and multiparous women. The symptoms stay between two and three weeks, with immediate regression after delivery. The exact etiology of pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) is unknown, mainly due to its infrequent occurrence. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) has no maternal or fetal complications.\n\n【4】What Causes Pruritic Folliculitis in Pregnancy?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The exact cause of pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy is unknown. Hormonal changes during pregnancy are believed to cause it. However, it does not appear to be caused by irregularities in the parent's immune system. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy typically forms in the second and third trimesters. It resolves spontaneously after delivery within two to eight weeks. The good news is that this rash is benign and has no adverse effects on the baby.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Pruritic Folliculitis in Pregnancy?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The rash consists of several small red bumps and pustules that may or may not be filled with pus called abscesses. The condition resembles acne, but the significant difference is that no bacteria are present in the bumps in pruritic folliculitis. The pustules are sterile. These symptoms are usually observed on the shoulders, upper back, arms, chest, and abdomen. Itching is present. The clinical features of pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy are mentioned below.\n\n【8】*   Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy (PFP) is represented by an acneiform eruption consisting of features that include multiple pruritic, 2 to 4 mm, follicular papules or pustules.\n\n【9】*   Symptoms generally on the shoulders, upper back, arms, chest, and abdomen.\n\n【10】*   The rash usually starts over the abdomen, typically involving the striae gravidarum.\n\n【11】*   It may spread to the breasts, arms, and upper thighs.\n\n【12】*   The face, palms, soles, and mucosal surfaces usually are rarely involved.\n\n【13】*   The lesions commonly consist of polymorphous, erythematous, non-follicular papules, plaques, and sometimes vesicles.\n\n【14】*   The lesions can be painful.\n\n【15】*   The rash usually resolves near-term or in the early postpartum period.\n\n【16】How to Diagnose Pruritic Folliculitis in Pregnancy?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy is a rare skin condition observed during pregnancy and resolved after delivery. The lesions resemble acne, and the signs and symptoms of pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy are similar to other conditions common in pregnancy. The diagnosis is made with\n\n【18】**1\\. Physical Examination**\n\n【19】*   Small, 3 to 5 mm erythematous papules, and the symptoms are present on the upper torso.\n\n【20】*   follicular erythematous papules.\n\n【21】*   Pustular lesions.\n\n【22】*   In severe cases, prurigo is present.\n\n【23】*   Central crusts in the lumbar area.\n\n【24】**2\\. Biopsy**\n\n【25】An incisional biopsy can be done on one of the lesions on the lower back. Histopathology shows the following features.\n\n【26】*   Epidermis.\n\n【27】*   Mild psoriasiform acanthosis.\n\n【28】*   Wedge-shaped dermis.\n\n【29】*   Inflammatory infiltrates small and medium-sized mononuclear cells found around the vessels.\n\n【30】*   Discrete leukocytoclastic cells are present.\n\n【31】*   Slightly beveled cores were also found.\n\n【32】**3\\. Immunohistochemistry.**\n\n【33】Immunohistochemistry was positive for myeloperoxidase, HAM56 (a monoclonal antibody), lysozyme, and CD3 (a protein complex).\n\n【34】So it is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and also helps in the differential diagnosis. Some of the differential diagnoses of pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy are mentioned below.\n\n【35】*   Gestational pemphigoid.\n\n【36】*   Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP).\n\n【37】*   Prurigo of pregnancy.\n\n【38】*   Acne.\n\n【39】*   Bacterial folliculitis\n\n【40】**Acne**\n\n【41】Acne is a common and chronic skin problem due to the formation of blocks in the sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands are tiny glands containing sebum. Sebum is an oily substance secreted into the skin surface—increased production of sebum, dead cells, and bacteria accumulated to form a clog. Clog in the sebaceous gland leads to the inflammation of the gland causing the conditions like acne and pimples. In addition, acne can sometimes lead to other skin problems, including whiteheads, blackheads, cysts, nodules, and spots. Acne can also appear in the face, shoulders, chest, arms, and back region. Acne has no age predilection. Acne has several types, and the types of acne are given below.\n\n【42】*   Whiteheads are the bump beneath the skin due to the plugging of hair follicles.\n\n【43】*   Blackheads and clogged hair follicles form on the skin's surface and look black.\n\n【44】*   Papules, small pink inflamed and painful lesions.\n\n【45】*   Pustules, red lesions with pus.\n\n【46】*   Nodules, large deep-seated lesions.\n\n【47】*   Cystic acne is called severe nodular acne, a painful deep lesion with pus.\n\n【48】How to Treat Pruritic Folliculitis during Pregnancy?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy is a benign self-limiting condition, and the treatment is mainly done to manage the symptoms. The various treatment measures to manage the symptoms of pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy are mentioned below.\n\n【50】*   Topical medications such as low-potency corticosteroids.\n\n【51】*   10% benzoyl peroxide.\n\n【52】*   Combination therapy.\n\n【53】*   UVB (ultraviolet therapy B) therapy.\n\n【54】*   Antifungal medications.\n\n【55】*   Topical or systemic antibiotics.\n\n【56】*   If the lesions are asymptomatic, their natural resolution after delivery should be considered.\n\n【57】*   Pruritic folliculitis lesions develop during pregnancy and fade within weeks after delivery.\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy is a rare dermatosis condition characterized by papules and pustules. The symptoms appear in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Symptoms resolve after the delivery. Proper diagnosis is made to avoid misdiagnosis, and treatment is done to manage the symptoms. Topical corticosteroids will provide symptomatic relief.

There are around 113 phytocannabinoids identified in cannabis plants so far. It is being used for medical purposes in the form of hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, and liquid solution. These preparations have CBD as the active ingredient and it does not contain delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (D-9 THC). D-9 THC is the main psychoactive agent found in Cannabis plants, which causes altered sensory and time perception \"the high.\" The cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved in the US in 2018 for the treatment of epilepsy disorders. All other CBD formulations are still illegal to prescribe for medical use except special epilepsy syndrome like Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome.\n\n【2】What Is Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is extracted from the Cannabis plant and is said to have many therapeutic health benefits. It is believed to relieve symptoms commonly seen in anxiety, epilepsy, pain, spasticity, and cancer.\n\n【4】CBD oil is extracted from industrial hemp, which contains a higher concentration of CBD than marijuana. CBD levels are affected by how the plant is breed. Different methods are used to extract this compound. This extract is added to a carrier oil, which makes it CBD oil. This oil comes in different strengths for various uses. Always consult your doctor before using it.\n\n【5】CBD oils will not make you feel high, as they do not contain high amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (D-9 THC). Everyone reacts to these oils differently, so it is best to try it yourself to see how effective it is.\n\n【6】What Is the Difference Between CBD and THC?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Cannabidiol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are both found in marijuana, but they have very different effects. THC when inhaled or cooked with, makes a person high. It is a powerful psychoactive agent. CBD, on the other hand, is not a psychoactive agent, so it does not cause high. It is being used to manage the symptoms of many health conditions.\n\n【8】How Does CBD Work?\n------------------\n\n【9】CBD attaches to certain receptors e.g. CB 1 and 2, 5 HT1 alpha, etc. and produces specific effects in the body. Some cannabinoids are produced by the human body itself, and the body has two main receptors called CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors for cannabinoids.\n\n【10】CB1 receptors are majorly present in the brain, and some are present throughout the body. In the brain, these receptors help in coordination, movement, pain, mood, emotions, appetite, and memory. The agent THC attaches to these receptors.\n\n【11】CB2 receptors are commonly present in the immune system and affect pain and inflammation. It was believed that CBD attaches to these receptors, but now it has been agreed that it does not directly attach to the receptor. It is said to assist the body in using more of the naturally occurring cannabinoids.\n\n【12】Other receptors are GPR55 antagonist has some anti-cancer effect, TPVR 1, and 5HT alpha and Adenosine A2A agonist produces anti-inflammatory effect and pain relieving effect.\n\n【13】Can CBD Oil Make You High?\n--------------------------\n\n【14】An endocannabinoid system (ECS) is present in the human body, which receives and translates signals from cannabinoids. The body also produces some cannabinoids naturally called endocannabinoids. This ECS regulates functions like sleep, pain, and immune response.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>Everything You Should Know About Epilepsy</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>I have insomnia with weird emotional state and negative thoughts. How to deal with it?</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>Could my insomnia be due to increase in Zoloft dosage?</u>\n\n【20】THC makes a person high when it enters the body, as it affects the brain's endocannabinoid receptors. This activates the pleasure center in the brain, which releases dopamine.\n\n【21】CBD does not affect the brain but influences the body to use its endocannabinoids more effectively. Instead of affecting the ECS, it induces or blocks some compounds in this system. CBD helps in relieving pain by preventing the body from absorbing anandamide, which is a compound that regulates pain. This increases the levels of anandamide in the bloodstream, which reduces pain. It also controls inflammation in the brain and nervous system.\n\n【22】What Are the Health Benefits of CBD Oil?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【23】CBD is believed to help relieve symptoms in the following health conditions:\n\n【24】*   **Epilepsy (seizure) disorders** - The CBD drug Epidiolex has shown to reduce seizures in adults and children. It is a prescription drug used for treating and reducing seizures seen in Dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge-Weber syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).\n\n【25】*   **Multiple sclerosis (MS)** - A prescription nasal spray called Sativex is said to be effective in reducing pain, muscle tightness, and frequent urination in people with MS. It is only effective when CBD is combined with 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\n\n【26】*   **Painkiller and anti-inflammatory properties** - CBD is believed to be a natural painkiller and anti-inflammatory agent. It was found to significantly reduce chronic inflammation and pain in test animals. These studies showed promising results for the use of CBD as a new treatment for chronic pain.\n\n【27】*   **Quitting smoking** - Some studies indicate that CBD may be used to help people quit smoking. It was found that smokers who inhaled smoke containing CBD, smoked fewer cigarettes. It also controlled nicotine cravings.\n\n【28】*   **Drug withdrawals** - Some studies also showed promising treatment for people with Opioid, Morphine, and Heroin addictions. CBD helps reduce symptoms of drug withdrawal like anxiety, pain, insomnia, and mood swings.\n\n【29】*   **Cancer** - It was found that CBD suppresses the growth of cancer cells and destroys them. There is some evidence that also prevents the spread of cancer.\n\n【30】*   **Anxiety disorders** - Generally, people with chronic anxiety are advised against using cannabis, as it can cause anxiousness and paranoia. But recent studies have shown to reduce anxiety in conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n【31】*   **Type 1 diabetes** - CBD might reduce inflammation in the pancreas, which might prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.\n\n【32】*   **Acne** - Acne is caused by the overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous gland. CBD has found to lower sebum production and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin.\n\n【33】*   **Alzheimer's disease** - Initial studies found that CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficits in Alzheimer’s patients. These deficits make patients unable to recognize the faces of people they already know. CBD might also slow the progression of this disease.\n\n【34】*   **Parkinson's disease** - Taking CBD daily for 4 weeks showed to reduce the incidence of psychosis in Parkinson’s patients.\n\n【35】*   **Dystonia** - Dystonia is a muscle disorder that results in involuntary muscle contractions. Taking CBD for 6 weeks helped improve dystonia in 20 to 50 % of patients.\n\n【36】*   **Insomnia** - Some studies show that taking 160 mg of Cannabidiol before going to bed helps people with insomnia sleep better.\n\n【37】*   **GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease)** - It is a complication of bone marrow transplantation. Using CBD 7 days before and 30 days after bone marrow transplant increases the time it takes for GVHD to develop.\n\n【38】*   **Other conditions** - More studies are required to understand how CBD is helpful in conditions like bipolar disorder, Crohn’s disease, type 2 diabetes, dystonia, Huntington's disease, Schizophrenia, etc.\n\n【39】How to Choose the Right CBD Oil?\n--------------------------------\n\n【40】Always go for a full-spectrum CBD oil, as it contains cannabinoids and other compounds present in the hemp plant. It might have more therapeutic effects than an isolate CBD oil. A full-spectrum CBD oil contains proteins, fatty acids, fiber, chlorophyll, flavonoids, and terpenes.\n\n【41】Epidiolex is the only approved CBD drug, which is used for epilepsy. Always consult your doctor before you try any CBD oil, as it might result in adverse side effects.\n\n【42】Are CBD and Hempseed Oil the Same?\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】No, they are not the same. CBD or hemp oil is made from the flower, bud, stems, and leaves of the Cannabis plant, and hempseed oil is made from hemp seeds. Hemp Seed oil is normally used as a topical skin product or a food additive.\n\n【44】How Is CBD Oil Used?\n--------------------\n\n【45】Always shake the bottle properly before use. Most drugs are kept under the tongue for 30 seconds to a few minutes before swallowing. For the proper dose, consult your doctor. It is best to start with a smaller dose, which can be increased after consulting your doctor. The dosage depends on the use, weight, metabolism, and body chemistry.\n\n【46】You should not take consecutive doses before 4 to 6 hours. It can be taken at any time of the day. CBD usually starts acting within 30 to 90 minutes, but it might take several weeks to achieve long term effects.\n\n【47】Is CBD Oil Safe?\n----------------\n\n【48】CBD oil is tolerated well in adults. It has no significant side effects on the central nervous system, vital signs, or mood. The common side effects include:\n\n【49】*   Tiredness.\n\n【50】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【51】*   Changes in appetite.\n\n【52】*   Liver problems.\n\n【53】*   Irritability.\n\n【54】*   Infections.\n\n【55】*   Rashes.\n\n【56】*   Reduced urination.\n\n【57】*   Breathing difficulties.\n\n【58】### Is CBD Legal?\n\n【59】Currently, Epidiolex is the only approved CBD drug. Hemp and hemp-derived products are legal in the US if the THC content is less than 0.3 %. FDA has not approved the use of marijuana, but only approved a purified version of one CBD medication.\n\n【60】More studies are required to understand the therapeutic and side effects of CBD oil.

Usually, an individual with hemangioma has only one bump, but in some rare cases, there may be multiple hemangiomas. They do not turn into cancer or spread to other parts of the body.\n\n【4】What and in Whom Is the Prevalence of Hepatic Hemangiomas?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common in the age group of 30 to 50 years but they can happen at any age, can occur more commonly in adults, often in women than men, and in some cases can affect both equally. They are non-cancerous tumors of the liver, mostly harmless, affecting around 5 % of the adult population in the US.\n\n【6】What Causes Hepatic Hemangiomas?\n--------------------------------\n\n【7】The cause of hepatic hemangiomas remains unknown; some may be due to genetics (that runs in the family, which is an unknown cause). In most cases, they are discovered during imaging of some other condition. They rarely show any symptoms and need treatment.\n\n【8】It usually occurs as a single collection of blood vessels that is less than 4 cm wide. Occasionally they are larger, but it is rare and is seen in children.\n\n【9】Which Factors Increase the Risk of Hepatic Hemangioma?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The Risk factors of hepatic hemangioma are:\n\n【11】*   **Age:** This condition can be diagnosed at any age but most commonly in the 30 to 50 years of age group.\n\n【12】*   **Sex:** Women are more prone to this condition than men.\n\n【13】*   **Hormone Replacement Therapy:** Individuals who use hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms are diagnosed with hepatic hemangiomas.\n\n【14】*   **Pregnancy:** Pregnant women are prone to be diagnosed with hepatic hemangioma. The hormone estrogen is believed to be responsible; this may rise during pregnancy and play a key role in the growth of hepatic hemangioma.\n\n【15】*   **Estrogen Therapy:** Excess use of oral contraceptives and ovarian stimulation treatment are therapies that can risk increasing hemangiomas in females.\n\n【16】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hepatic Hemangioma?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】In most cases, they are asymptomatic. When they start growing in size, they may give certain signs and symptoms like:\n\n【18】*   Nausea.\n\n【19】*   Vomiting.\n\n【20】*   Malaise.\n\n【21】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【22】*   Bloating.\n\n【23】*   Decreased appetite.\n\n【24】*   Discomfort and ache in the upper right side of the abdomen.\n\n【25】How Is the Diagnosis Made for Hepatic Hemangioma?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Hepatic hemangiomas are not identified through routine check-ups or testing; they can be accidentally diagnosed from imaging tests done for different conditions.\n\n【27】After the identification of the hemangiomas, the further diagnostic tests that are advised are:\n\n【28】*   **CT Scan (Computed Tomography****)** - X-rays are used to produce images of the tissues of the body.\n\n【29】*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** \\- Radio waves and a large magnet are used to produce images of bodily tissues.\n\n【30】*   **Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound -** High-frequency sound waves are passed across the body, and echoes are recorded and transformed into images.\n\n【31】*   **Angiography** \\- Contrast X-ray is used and inserted in the vessel of the body and reflected in imaging.\n\n【32】*   **Scintigraphy** \\- A nuclear scan that uses radioactive trace material to form an image, substances like technetium-99m are used.\n\n【33】*   Some are diagnosed at birth and as an infant. Mostly, they decrease in size over time and may disappear in rare cases.\n\n【34】What Is the Treatment and Management of Hepatic Hemangiomas?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Monitoring asymptomatic hemangiomas are the first line of treatment for cases where there is no sign or symptom. This monitoring can be done with imaging tests for 6 to 12 months. No specific drug treatment is there for hepatic hemangioma. Surgery is done if the hemangiomas have significant growth and discomfort, and pain.\n\n【36】Arterial embolization is a technique in which obstruction is created in blood vessels that give blood supply to hemangioma; this will slow, restrict and reverse the growth of the hemangioma.\n\n【37】In some cases, healthcare providers may tie off the artery supplying blood to hemangioma. This technique is hepatic artery ligation. Surrounding structures in the liver do not get affected by this; they get the required blood supply from other arteries and remain unaffected.\n\n【38】Liver transplantation in rare cases may be required. An indication of this procedure is when the hemangioma is extremely large or has multiple hemangiomas and cannot be treated with other techniques.\n\n【39】What Are the Complications Associated With Hepatic Hemangioma?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Hepatic hemangiomas can rarely cause any complications. However, when they increase in the size, they may lead to the following conditions:\n\n【41】*   Severe abdominal pain.\n\n【42】*   Liver damage.\n\n【43】*   Extremely enlarged hemangioma.\n\n【44】*   Bleeding inside the hemangioma or outside the hemangioma into the abdominal cavity.\n\n【45】*   Rupture due to any kind of physical trauma.\n\n【46】*   Compression due to enlarged hemangioma can have a pushing effect on the adjacent organs like the stomach, bile ducts, and live capsule. This can cause feelings of fullness, jaundice, and even pain.\n\n【47】*   A degenerative complication of blood can clot inside hemangioma, and calcification can develop, which may lead to scar tissue.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】Hepatic hemangioma is a benign tumor that is mostly harmless and asymptomatic. The cause of this hemangioma is unknown; thus, the prevention of this condition is not possible. Most cases are identified during the diagnosis of other diseased conditions. It is upsetting to have a mass on the liver, though it is not harmful and has no symptoms, and causes no discomfort. There has been no such evidence of an untreated or undiagnosed hemangioma that has led to a serious consequence or any liver cancer.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hepatic hemangioma -review-  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564031/\n*   Liver Hemangioma  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17784-liver-hemangioma\n*   Liver hemangioma  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-hemangioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354234#:~:text=A%20liver%20hemangioma%20</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Since the imperfections are present at the time of delivery, it is referred to as a congenital defect or congenital disorder. The result of these conditions is a drastically low oxygen level in the blood. Cyanosis means a bluish discoloration of the skin as well as mucous membranes. In many cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease, there is an absence of cyanosis. Generally, there are additional defects in congenital cyanotic disease other than heart defects. Healthcare professionals use multiple imaging tests in order to confirm the presence of cyanotic congenital heart diseases, such as chest X-rays and echocardiograms. To some extent, medication may aid in relieving symptoms of cyanosis. Ultimately, the majority of infants need to undergo surgery to correct all the defects caused by the disease. The success of the surgery is highly dependent on several factors, such as the following,\n\n【2】*   The severity of the defect.\n\n【3】*   An interruption in the aorta.\n\n【4】*   Abnormalities in the large blood vessels of the cardiovascular system.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】In standard cases, blood returns from the body and smoothly flows all through the heart and the lungs. This flow is altered in children and adults suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease leading to less flow of blood to the lungs as well as the heart. It may eventually result in the mixing of pure or oxygenated blood with impure or deoxygenated blood. There are several reasons that lead to cyanotic congenital heart disease development.\n\n【7】Mentioned below are some of the causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【8】*   Less oxygen is delivered to the body.\n\n【9】*   Absence of the tricuspid valve.\n\n【10】*   Malfunctioning of the tricuspid valve.\n\n【11】*   Lack of the pulmonary valve.\n\n【12】*   Malfunctioning of the pulmonary valve.\n\n【13】*   Absence of aortic valve.\n\n【14】*   Malfunctioning of the aortic valve.\n\n【15】*   Complete interruption of the aorta or coarctation.\n\n【16】*   Ebstein anomaly.\n\n【17】*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\n【18】*   Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\n【19】*   Total anomalous pulmonary venous return.\n\n【20】*   Transposition of the great arteries.\n\n【21】*   Truncus arteriosus.\n\n【22】*   Chemical exposure.\n\n【23】*   Genetic and chromosomal syndromes.\n\n【24】*   Down syndrome.\n\n【25】*   Trisomy 13.\n\n【26】*   Turner syndrome.\n\n【27】*   Marfan syndrome.\n\n【28】*   Noonan syndrome\n\n【29】*   Infections during pregnancy.\n\n【30】*   Rubella syndrome.\n\n【31】*   Diabetes Mellitus is not managed during pregnancy.\n\n【32】*   Drugs overdose\n\n【33】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】One of the classic signs and symptoms of cyanotic congenital heart disease is bluish discoloration of the skin and membrane, also called cyanosis. This generally affects the lips, toes, or fingers. Another common clinical manifestation is a great difficulty in breathing. Mentioned below are some of the common signs and symptoms of cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【35】*   Rapid heartbeat.\n\n【36】*   Rapid breathing.\n\n【37】*   Breathing difficulty, becoming very severe with time.\n\n【38】*   Chronic respiratory infections.\n\n【39】*   Hyperventilation.\n\n【40】*   Anxiety.\n\n【41】*   Drastically low oxygen levels.\n\n【42】*   Tiredness.\n\n【43】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【44】*   Difficulty feeding.\n\n【45】*   Slow growth.\n\n【46】*   Chronic respiratory infections.\n\n【47】*   Slow weight gain.\n\n【48】*   Heavy sweating.\n\n【49】*   Low birth weight.\n\n【50】*   Clubbed, or rounded, large fingers.\n\n【51】*   Delayed growth.\n\n【52】*   No cognitive development.\n\n【53】*   Abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n【54】*   Abnormal heart murmurs.\n\n【55】How to Diagnose Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Early diagnosis is critical in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Cyanosis, rapid heartbeat, abnormal heart sounds, and other clinical manifestations may lead to several complications if not treated.\n\n【57】Mentioned below are some of the diagnostic tools that may help evaluate cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【58】*   Chest X-ray.\n\n【59】*   Electrocardiogram.\n\n【60】*   Ultrasound of the heart.\n\n【61】*   Cardiac catheterization.\n\n【62】How to Treat Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【63】The treatment for cyanotic congenital heart disease depends on the severity and onset of the symptoms and the risks and complications they pose to the patient. In the majority of the cases, surgical intervention in order to correct the present defects in the cardiovascular system is necessary. Such surgeries have proven to be successful to a great extent. Surgical intervention is not delayed in case the deficiency is severe in nature. In other instances, the surgery can be postponed until the child is older. There are occasions when more than one kind of surgery may be required in order to completely correct the defects produced by cyanotic congenital heart disease. Mentioned below are some of the necessary goals of any treatment modality given forward for cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【64】*   Eliminate excessive fluid accumulation from the body.\n\n【65】*   Get the heart pumping and functioning better.\n\n【66】*   Keep all the blood vessels open.\n\n【67】*   Regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】Cyanotic congenital heart disease is a disorder that results in bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane. It affects both children and adults but is primarily seen in children. The outlook and prognosis of cyanotic congenital heart disease vary because it is dependent on the severity of the underlying defects and clinical manifestation of the disease. It also is based on how quickly the diagnosis and treatment occur. In mild cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease, the individual is able to continue living a normal lifestyle.\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diagnosis and management of cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12098-009-0030-4\n*   Congenital heart disease in adults  \n    https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm200002033420507\n*   Pregnancy in cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.cir.89.6.2673\n*   Adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-109-5-406\n*   Cerebrovascular events in adult patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0735109796001969</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0ccad561-43ce-4bbe-8bad-b4eac1945a38", "title": "Management of Obesity in Older People", "text": "【0】Management of Obesity in Older People\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Obesity is also termed as the abnormal growth of the adipose tissue, which can either be an enlargement of the fat cells (hypertrophic obesity) or an increase in the number of the fat cells (hyperplastic obesity), or a combination of both. According to a report from the World Health Organization, 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. In addition, 44 percent of diabetics, 23 percent of ischemic heart disease, and 7 to 41 percent of certain cancers are attributable to overweight and obesity. Elderly people are vulnerable to obesity as aging is usually associated with a decrease in physical activity and an increase in a sedentary lifestyle. Obesity is becoming a major health problem, being a predisposing factor for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea.\n\n【2】What Are the Factors that Contribute to Obesity in Older People?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】As the elderly are a particularly vulnerable group, obesity and its complications may lead to disability, so it is a major health concern in this age group. Further, the health risks of obesity in the elderly are mostly underestimated due to survivor bias seen in elderly people. Obesity has more functional implications as compared to lean people in the older population. The following are the reasons that predispose the elderly to obesity-\n\n【4】*   The growth hormone secretion decreases with age which may result in the accumulation of fat, the reduction of fat-free mass, and energy balance.\n\n【5】*   The decline in growth hormone and testosterone production with increasing age decreases fat-free mass and increases fat mass.\n\n【6】*   Resistance to leptin could result in a decreased ability to down-regulate the appetite.\n\n【7】*   The metabolic syndrome (truncal obesity plus two low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, impaired fasting glucose/diabetes, and hypertension) is associated with raised inflammatory markers and sarcopenia, leading to a potentially vicious circle.\n\n【8】What Are the Consequences of Obesity in Older People?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Obesity causes serious health complications resulting in morbidity. The prevalence of various medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, urinary incontinence, and various types of cancers, is associated with obesity in old age.\n\n【10】1.  **Cardiovascular Disease -** Obesity is quantified as body mass index alone, which may potentially mask the association of abdominal fat and cardiovascular disease to events.\n\n【11】2.  **Pulmonary Abnormalities -** Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with pulmonary function abnormalities, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea. Increased weight in the chest wall decreases respiratory compliance, increases the work of breathing, and restricts ventilation. Older obese men may be particularly predisposed to developing weight-related sleep apnea.\n\n【12】3.  **Cancer -** Being overweight and obese is the most known avoidable cause of cancer after tobacco. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as breast, colon, gallbladder, pancreas, renal, bladder, uterine, cervical, and prostate cancers.\n\n【13】4.  **Urinary Incontinence -** This is a common and distressing problem for the elderly. Prevalence ranges from 5 to 25 percent in men and 7 to 42 percent in women. Obesity contributes to the increase in the prevalence of urinary incontinence in older persons, and the increase in urinary incontinence is directly associated with increased body mass index.\n\n【14】5.  **Cataracts -** Being overweight and obese are associated with an increased prevalence of cataracts and cataract surgery.\n\n【15】6.  **Sarcopenia -** The physical-related progression of sarcopenia and degenerative joint disease is increased due to obesity. A vicious cycle is established when such individuals become less physically mobile, progressing to the inability to perform the simple activities of their daily living. As a result, frailty develops impairment in function, and reduction in the physiological results is severe to bring in the disability.\n\n【16】7.  **Cognitive Functions -** Obesity is importantly associated with impaired cognitive functions. Obesity in mid-life is linked to the development of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The decline in cognitive function has also been observed to be associated with vascular wrist factors, including wrist dyslipidemia (high plasma cholesterol levels) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke) in the presence of inflammation.\n\n【17】How to Manage Obesity in Older People?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【18】The management of obesity in older adults should be individual-specific and aim to offset morbidity and disability. There are various means to manage obesity in older people, such as\n\n【19】1.  **Exercise -** Multimodality exercises such as resistance, endurance, balance, and flexibility training improve physical function and frailty. Aging is associated with lean mass, loss of muscles, and weight loss, which can exacerbate this. Resistance exercise can help offset sarcopenia. Weight loss attempts in older obese adults should include multidisciplinary exercise.\n\n【20】2.  **Hypo-caloric Diet -** It can be another management remedy. Most weight loss regimens described for people older than 65 years are designed with a 500 to 750 kilocalories deficit per day, which gives a weight loss of approximately 500 grams per week. The diet should contain adequate nutrients, serum iron, folate, vitamin D, calcium, and albumin, and then be implemented. Attention should be paid to protein intake, as increased protein intake offsets lean mass. An experienced dietitian can design a meal plan with the above requirements.\n\n【21】3.  **Very Low-Energy Diet -** Very low-energy diets are meal replacement formulations that are used for weight loss. These are nutritionally complete for healthy younger adults as older adults have higher dietary requirements for certain nutrients like calcium and vitamin D; additionally, illnesses may give rise to higher nutrient requirements.\n\n【22】4.  **Bariatric Surgery -** Bariatric surgery is the most effective method of intentional weight loss. Clinical benefits, including reduced need for medication and improvement of obesity-related conditions following bariatric surgery in older adults, have been demonstrated. Hospital stay for older patients is longer after procedures than for younger patients, but observed mortality rates are lower than expected.\n\n【23】5.  **Anti-obesity Medications -** When choosing anti-obesity medications in older patients, there are two main considerations- appetite is often lower in older people, particularly in those with low lean mass; therefore, it is sensible to ask about hunger and appetite before starting them on appetite suppressants, and another reason is polypharmacy is a common problem in the elderly, if anti-obesity medications are deemed important, efforts could be made to minimize other medications.\n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】Obesity is a common but increasing problem in the older population. The number of obese people is increasing because of the increased total number of older persons and the increase in the percentage of obesity among the elderly. Obesity has some important functional implications in older men and women because of their decline in physical activity and energy expenditure, which causes frailty or sarcopenic obesity. Among the elderly, many medical consequences, particularly obesity, are problematic, like diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, urinary incontinence, depression, and different types of cancer. The focus of the treatment is on the reduction of intra-abdominal fat initially with modest and conventional diet restriction and preservation of muscle mass and strength through physical activity.\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>*   How to Care for Obesity  \n    https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-care-for-obesity-5-actions-for-older-adults\n*   Weight Management in Older Adults  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387759/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c2b10ff4-adde-471b-ad72-6c81f7989e49", "title": "Normal Endometrial Thickness - An Overview", "text": "【0】Normal Endometrial Thickness - An Overview\nWhat Is Endometrium?\n--------------------\n\n【1】The endometrium is the uterine lining. Endometrium appears as a dark line on the screen during a woman's ultrasound or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This line is also known as the \"endometrial stripe.\" This term does not refer to a medical condition or diagnosis but a normal component of the body's tissue. As a symptom of endometriosis, endometrial cells can appear in other parts of the body, but an \"endometrial stripe\" refers to endometrial tissue in the uterus. This tissue changes naturally as women age and progress through various reproductive stages.\n\n【2】What Is the Function of Endometrium?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】The endometrium is the uterine lining. During the reproductive years, it is one of the few organs in the human body that undergoes monthly changes in size. During the menstrual cycle, the body prepares the endometrium to house an embryo every month. During the procedure, the endometrial thickness increases and decreases. These cycles of endometrial growth and shedding; if a pregnancy does not develop, are triggered by two hormones- estrogen and progesterone.\n\n【4】What Is Normal Endometrial Thickness?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】The normal range of thickness varies depending on a person's stage of life-\n\n【6】**1\\. Childhood-** The endometrial stripe appears as a thin line before puberty. It might not yet be ultrasound detectable in some circumstances.\n\n【7】**2\\. Premenopausal Female-** In women of reproductive age, the thickness and width of the endometrial stripe change according to the stage of their menstrual cycle. The stripe's width can vary from a little under 1 mm to slightly more than 16 mm. It all depends on the stage of her menstrual cycle when the measurement is taken.\n\n【8】*   2 mm to 4 mm during the periods.\n\n【9】*   5 mm to 7 mm in the initial proliferative stage.\n\n【10】*   Up to 11 mm during the late proliferative phase.\n\n【11】*   Up to 16 mm in the secretory phase.\n\n【12】**3\\. Pregnancy-** When a pregnancy develops, a fertilized egg will implant into the endometrium at its thickest point. An endometrial stripe of about 2 millimeters or more may be visible during early pregnancy imaging tests. In a typical pregnancy, the fetus will dwell in the endometrial stripe. A gestational sac and placenta will eventually cover the stripe.\n\n【13】**4\\. Postpartum-** Postpartum, the endometrial stripe is thicker than usual. This is due to the possibility of blood clots and residual tissue remaining after delivery. After 24 % of pregnancies, these remnants are visible. After a cesarean delivery, they become especially prevalent. Upon the resumption of the period cycle, the endometrial stripe should resume its typical cycle of thinning and thickening.\n\n【14】**5\\. Postmenopausal-** Following menopause, the endometrium's thickness stabilizes. The average stripe is thinner than 5 mm in menopausal women who still experience irregular vaginal bleeding. An endometrial stripe of 4 mm or more is thought to be a sign of endometrial cancer in women who are no longer bleeding vaginally.\n\n【15】How Is Endometrial Thickness Measured?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【16】The most popular method for assessing endometrium thickness is ultrasound. It is the approach that medical professionals employ initially, particularly if a patient has reported unusual vaginal bleeding. Doctors use MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) when an ultrasound is unsuitable, often due to a person's uterus position or other medical issues.\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Abnormal Endometrial Lining?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The following are the most typical symptoms of excessive endometrial thickness:\n\n【19】*   Extremely heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.\n\n【20】*   An irregular menstrual cycle lasts less than three weeks or longer than 38 days.\n\n【21】*   Spotting between periods.\n\n【22】*   Bleeding after menopause.\n\n【23】*   Difficulty in getting pregnant.\n\n【24】*   People with pelvic pain of unknown etiology should seek medical attention for a diagnosis and to rule out endometrial cancer. Bloating and a feeling of fullness in the stomach without eating much food are also some of the warning signs.\n\n【25】*   A woman with a thin endometrial lining may experience painful sex, pelvic pain at various times throughout the month, missed periods, or no menstruation.\n\n【26】What Causes Abnormally Thick Endometrial Lining?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Thick endometrial tissue is not a cause for alarm unless a woman exhibits unusual symptoms. A thick endometrial stripe may occasionally be an indication of-\n\n【28】*   **Endometrial Hyperplasia-** When endometrial glands accelerate the tissue's growth, it results in endometrial hyperplasia. On rare occasions, endometrial hyperplasia turns into malignancy. This disorder is more common in women who have had menopause.\n\n【29】*   **Fibroids-** The endometrium can become attached to uterine fibroids and appear thicker. Up to 80 % of women experience fibroids before the age of 50, making them a very common condition.\n\n【30】*   **Polyps-** Endometrial polyps are uterine tissue anomalies. On a sonogram, the endometrium looks thicker due to these polyps. Polyps are typically not harmful. Endometrial polyps have a small chance of developing into cancer.\n\n【31】*   **Use of Tamoxifen-** A drug called Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer. Early menopause and alterations in endometrium thickness and thinning are typical side effects.\n\n【32】*   **Endometrial Cancer-** The American Cancer Society states that the endometrial cells are the primary site of initiation for almost all uterine cancers. An early cancer sign could be an abnormally thick endometrium. Other signs and symptoms include irregular discharge after menopause, lower abdominal or pelvic pain, and heavy, frequent, or irregular bleeding.\n\n【33】What Causes Abnormally Thin Endometrial Lining?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Thin endometrial tissue is usually not a problem unless a woman exhibits unusual symptoms. A thin endometrial stripe may occasionally be an indication of-\n\n【35】*   **Endometrial Atrophy-** Endometrial atrophy is a condition caused by low estrogen levels. This is frequently related to the beginning of menopause. In younger women, hormonal imbalances, eating disorders, and autoimmune diseases can all cause atrophy. Low estrogen levels can prevent the endometrial tissue from thickening enough for an egg to implant.\n\n【36】*   **Menopause**\\- During and after menopause, the endometrium will stop thinning and thickening every month.\n\n【37】What Is the Treatment for Abnormal Endometrial Thickness?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】**1.** Progestin hormone (that prevents ovulation) and hysterectomy are two treatment options for excessive endometrial thickness.\n\n【39】**2.** According to studies, low endometrial thickness readings are associated with a more challenging pregnancy progression. Some possible remedies for a thin endometrium are-\n\n【40】*   Estrogen therapy.\n\n【41】*   Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)- which the placenta produces after an embryo implants in the uterus wall.\n\n【42】*   Drugs and supplements to increase blood flow.\n\n【43】**3.** Research shows, however, that these treatments are not always successful.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**:\n\n【45】Women who are trying to get pregnant can learn how to maximize their chances of conception by paying attention to endometrial thickness. Throughout a person's life, changes in endometrial thickness are typical.

While it can occur in anyone, it is more commonly seen in individuals who engage in intravenous drug use (IVDU).\n\n【2】What Is the Cause of Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Users?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Endocarditis in intravenous drug users (IVDUs) primarily occurs as a result of the introduction of bacteria or fungi into the bloodstream through contaminated needles, syringes, or substances injected directly into veins. This is often due to the repetitive injections and unsterile drug preparation techniques associated with intravenous drug use.\n\n【4】The process begins when the skin's natural protective barrier is breached by an unclean needle or contaminated drug solution. These germs can travel to the heart and infect the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, which can result in endocarditis when they are introduced into the bloodstream.\n\n【5】What Are the Most Common Causative Agents of Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Users?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】In intravenous drug users (IVDUs), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are the most frequent causes of endocarditis. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a drug-resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus, is particularly common among IVDUs. The potential for contamination at injection sites and during drug preparation is increased by the ability of this bacterium to colonize the skin and nasal passages.\n\n【7】The increased prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections in IVDUs is caused by a number of causes. Needles and syringes become more contaminated as a result of improper injection techniques and poor cleanliness. Bacteria enter the bloodstream when pharmaceuticals are prepared using non-sterile methods, such as exchanging drug solutions or diluting with non-sterile substances. Additionally, IVDUs are especially vulnerable because of their frequently weaker immune systems, which are brought on by conditions like starvation, underlying chronic illnesses, or concurrent infections.\n\n【8】The prevalence of MRSA infections among IVDUs has become a growing concern. MRSA is resistant to commonly used antibiotics, posing challenges in treatment. Its presence among IVDUs limits the effectiveness of standard antibiotic regimens, necessitating alternative treatment approaches.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Heart Valve Regurgitation</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Acquired Systemic Candidiasis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>What could be the reason for recurrent fever with high ESR and CRP levels?</u>\n\n【14】While Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are the primary causative agents, endocarditis in IVDUs can also be caused by other bacteria or fungi, including enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida species. The specific pathogen involved may vary depending on geographical location, local prevalence of microorganisms, and individual patient factors.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Users?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The symptoms of endocarditis in intravenous drug users (IVDUs) can vary, but there are common signs and symptoms to be aware of.\n\n【17】**1\\. Fever:** One of the defining signs of endocarditis is a chronic or recurrent fever. An increase in body temperature can be the result of the immune system's reaction to the infection.\n\n【18】**2\\. Chills:** IVDUs with endocarditis may experience chills, often accompanying the fever. These chills can be severe and cause shaking or shivering.\n\n【19】**3\\. Fatigue:** Unexplained fatigue or a general feeling of weakness is common in endocarditis cases. It may be attributed to the body's effort to fight off the infection\n\n【20】**4\\. Joint and Muscle Pain:** IVDUs with endocarditis may experience pain and discomfort in their joints and muscles. This can manifest as joint stiffness, swelling, or generalized body aches.\n\n【21】**5\\. Night Sweats:** Profuse sweating during sleep, particularly at night, is a characteristic symptom of endocarditis. The night sweats may be accompanied by a feeling of intense heat.\n\n【22】**6\\. Unintended Weight Loss:** IVDUs with endocarditis may experience a noticeable and unintentional loss of body weight. This weight loss can occur despite an adequate or increased caloric intake.\n\n【23】**7\\. Cardiac Symptoms:** It include chest pain, palpitations (awareness of irregular heartbeats), and shortness of breath. Endocarditis can also affect the heart. While exercising or when sleeping flat, the chest pain could get worse.\n\n【24】**8\\. New or Changed Heart Murmurs:** IVDUs with endocarditis may experience the development of new or altered heart murmurs, which are abnormal noises detected during a physical examination. Heart murmurs may be a sign of underlying valve malfunction or injury.\n\n【25】What Are the Diagnostic Methods of Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Users?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】**1\\. Medical History Assessment:** To uncover risk factors, such as a history of intravenous drug use, recent infections, prior cases of endocarditis, and any known cardiac issues, the healthcare professional will conduct a thorough medical history assessment. The diagnostic process is guided by this information.\n\n【27】**2\\. Physical examination:** To detect endocarditis and associated consequences, a complete physical examination is performed. With the aid of a stethoscope, the medical professional may listen for abnormal heart sounds (murmurs), and look for physical indicators like Janeway lesions (red, painless lesions on the palms or soles) and Osler's nodes (painful, tender subcutaneous nodules), and scan for indications of embolic events.\n\n【28】**3\\. Blood Tests:** The most important test is blood culture, which involves obtaining blood samples and incubating them to identify the causative organism. Multiple sets of blood cultures are typically obtained from different sites and at different times to increase the chances of detecting the infecting microorganism. Blood tests may also include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for signs of infection or anemia, as well as inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) that can be elevated in endocarditis.\n\n【29】**4\\. Echocardiography:** Echocardiography is a key imaging modality in diagnosing endocarditis. It allows visualization of the heart valves and structures, aiding in the identification of vegetation (abnormal growth of infected tissue) and evaluating the severity of valve damage. Two types of echocardiography are commonly used:\n\n【30】*   **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE):** To collect images of the heart during this non-invasive examination, ultrasound waves are passed through the chest. TTE gives a comprehensive picture of the heart's valves and structures, although it might not be able to pick up on minute vegetations or problems.\n*   **Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE):** To get precise pictures of the heart, a specialized probe is inserted into the esophagus during TEE. TEE offers higher-resolution pictures, which are very helpful for spotting tiny vegetation, spotting abscesses, and evaluating valve function.\n\n【31】**5\\. Other Imaging Studies:** In some circumstances, it may be necessary to do further imaging tests in order to evaluate complications or spot embolic occurrences. To assess the severity of an infection and its repercussions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans can produce comprehensive images of the heart and its surrounding structures.\n\n【32】What Are the Treatment Strategies for Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Users?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】A multidisciplinary strategy is used to treat endocarditis in intravenous drug users (IVDUs), including medical management, surgical intervention where necessary, and treatment of the underlying drug addiction.\n\n【34】**1\\. Antibiotic Therapy:** Intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for endocarditis in IVDUs. The choice of antibiotics depends on the causative organism and its antibiotic susceptibility. Empirical therapy is often initiated initially based on common pathogens seen in this population, such as Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【35】Blood cultures can be used to pinpoint the individual bacteria, and antibiotic medication can then be customized to its needs. Alternative antibiotics may be required in situations of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Endocarditis must be treated with lengthy antibiotic regimens, usually lasting 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n【36】**2\\. Surgical Intervention:** In some circumstances, surgery may be necessary to treat endocarditis complications or serious valve damage. Surgery tries to treat abscesses or other cardiac problems in addition to removing infected tissues and replacing or repairing damaged valves. Surgery alternatives include valve replacement (mechanical or biological valves), valve repair, and tissue removal for infections. The degree of valve failure, the scope of the infection, and the patient's general health all play a role in the decision to do surgery.\n\n【37】**3\\. Management of Drug Addiction:** Treating the underlying drug addiction is essential to prevent recurrent endocarditis episodes. Referral to addiction specialists, substance abuse counseling, and rehabilitation programs are crucial components of comprehensive care. This includes providing support for detoxification, counseling services, and facilitating access to harm reduction programs and long-term addiction management strategies.\n\n【38】**4\\. Follow-up Care:** After completing antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention, close follow-up care is necessary to monitor the patient's progress, assess for recurrence or complications, and ensure adherence to long-term addiction management programs. Regular monitoring through clinical evaluations, blood tests, and echocardiography helps detect any signs of relapse or recurrent infection.\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】In conclusion, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species frequently cause endocarditis in intravenous drug users (IVDUs), with Staphylococcus aureus, including the methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA), being particularly common. Poor injection techniques, non-sterile drug preparation techniques, and weakened immune systems are all to blame for the high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections in IVDUs.\n\n【41】Treatment of endocarditis among IVDUs is made more difficult by the rise of MRSA. But it's crucial to remember that in this population, endocarditis can also be brought on by other bacteria and fungi. The key elements of the treatment strategy include early diagnosis, adequate antibiotic medication, surgical intervention where required, and addressing the underlying drug addiction. Recurrent infections can be prevented with diligent follow-up care and commitment to long-term addiction management programs.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Infective Endocarditis in Intravenous Drug Abusers  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12866981/\n*   Acute endocarditis in intravenous drug users: a case report and literature review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714084/\n*   Endocarditis and Injection Drug Use: A Contemporary Perspective  \n    https://www.jwatch.org/na48499/2019/03/13/endocarditis-and-injection-drug-use-contemporary</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "912419ea-082b-41b0-baaa-08017c904922", "title": "Currants: Berries Filled With Antioxidants", "text": "【0】Currants: Berries Filled With Antioxidants\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Just like most of the members belonging to the berry family, currants are excellent sources of fiber and vitamin C content. They also comprise of numerous beneficial antioxidants such as flavonoids otherwise known as anthocyanins. These fruits have been long used ever since the ancient eras when traditional medicine was globally practiced. Researchers are currently gathering more scientific evidence to prove the anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potential of currant fruits. Recent nutrition research reveals that currants have antimicrobial properties that can be useful in fighting bacterial or viral systemic infections. As these fruits are primarily high in vitamin C, they support healthy immunity and metabolic functions in an individual.\n\n【2】Why Are Currants Healthy?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】The main advantage of eating currants regularly is their high iron content, which can help prevent anemia. They also contain calcium, an important mineral that supports bone metabolism, and phosphorus, which helps with muscle contraction. In contrast to free radicals, anthocyanins found in currants function as antioxidants to prevent cellular damage.\n\n【4】What Is the Nutrition Content of Currants?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The following nutrition information has been enlisted or provided by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for one single serving of currant fruits that is approximately 112 grams:\n\n【6】*   Potassium: 308 milligrams.\n\n【7】*   Iron: 1.12 milligrams.\n\n【8】*   Sodium: 1.12 milligrams.\n\n【9】*   Protein: 1.6 grams.\n\n【10】*   Vitamin C: 46 milligrams.\n\n【11】*   Carbohydrates: 15.5 grams.\n\n【12】*   Calories: 63 kilo calories.\n\n【13】Currants indeed contain natural amounts of sugar in them, however, black currants especially have a low glycemic index of only around 22. Because of the low glycemic index, these fruits cannot cause blood sugar spikes as such and can be consumed or included in the diet (specifically owing to their rich antioxidant properties) by diabetics as well as prediabetics.\n\n【14】Can Currants Cause Allergies and Who Should Avoid Them?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】A few cases of currant allergy have been reported in the past in medical literature. Reports have shown that currant allergies are associated with people who were sensitive to peaches and raspberries, or other grass pollens. Individuals who are not allergic to any other pollen or berry category fruits can easily include currants in their diet for all the right health benefits. However in case one suspects or experiences food allergy symptoms like hives or wheezing, then one would know that they have a fruit or pollen allergy. Consult a healthcare provider to discuss this condition. Currants may potentially interfere with blood-thinning drugs or agents like Coumadin or Warfarin. Individuals on Warfarin therapies should hence strictly avoid these fruits.\n\n【16】What Is the Difference Between Dried and Fresh Currants?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】As with all other fruits, most of the commercially available currants are in dried form. Drying currants significantly changes their nutritional profile even in a single serving. The loss of water content in a dried fruit makes it easier to consume at a time (than fresh currants). It is important to note that dried fruits have more sugar content in them as well. In commercial products, if dry fruits or currants are available, one has to look for added sugars that can alter the nutrition profile of the natural currant fruits. One cup serving, of dried currants, have over 11 times more sugar than the one-cup serving size of fresh currants. This difference is nearly 99.6 grams of sugar in a single serving of dried currants to only 8.25 grams of natural sugar in a fresh fruit serving.\n\n【18】What Are the Health Benefits of Currants?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   **Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Effect:** Apart from vitamin C and anthocyanins, these fruits are also rich in omega 6 fatty acids called gamma linoleic acid which can reduce inflammation in systemic inflammatory diseases of joints such as rheumatoid arthritis. More research is on to explore this potential of currant fruits. In addition to enhancing immunity and reducing cellular damage, the oils produced by currants can also act as a therapeutic in a number of systemic inflammatory disorders or disease processes in the body.\n\n【20】*   **Cardioprotective:** These fruit seed oils may contain heart-healthy fats that reduce the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or bad cholesterol content in the blood and reduce triglycerides in the body.\n\n【21】*   **Digestive Effect:** According to nutrition research the presence of soluble and insoluble fiber, may aid in digestion and also prevent the risk of colon cancer by eliminating toxins from the gut.\n\n【22】*   **Eye Health:** The stimulation of ocular blood flow (which has an eye-protective impact) while consuming currant fruits and their juice, in particular, may help relieve fatigue and improve eye function.\n\n【23】*   **Kidney Health:** Additionally, currants' nutritional components can aid in preventing conditions like kidney stones and recurrent urinary tract infections. Proanthocyanins, which are present in currants, help prevent dangerous bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract in the case of urinary tract infections, assisting in the prevention of urinary tract infections from developing or worsening. According to scientific research, currants may also be particularly efficient at preventing the formation of painful kidney stones.\n\n【24】How to Purchase, Store, and Use Currants?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   **Purchase:** Always inspect and buy firm, plump berries since they will not deteriorate or become infected readily. They also grow in clusters rather like grapefruits but are smaller in size like peas.\n\n【26】*   **Storage:** They can be fairly stored or frozen in the freezer for up to six months. They can be refrigerated only for two to three days which would be best for consumption.\n\n【27】*   **Usage:** Currants come in different varieties throughout the globe, the main varieties being black, red, pink, and white varieties. These fruits can be used best in jams and jellies for their delicious flavor and to add texture even for fillings as they are used commonly in pies and tarts. The characteristic acidic flavor of the fruits is common for most currants. However, the pink and white varieties are very sweet in comparison to the other colored varieties like black or red currants. Raw currants can be best consumed as a snack, but black currant fruits particularly are quite tart. Hence the best way to cook black currants is to use them as a jelly or sauce. The addition of sugar while cooking these fruits alters the nutritional profile because of the increase in sugar content.\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】To conclude, currants are fruits that are antioxidant, nutritious, and fiber-rich, and are low glycemic index (GI) fruits that add flavor and impact health positively.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Rarely, lymphoma develops in the skin and is called cutaneous lymphomas.\n\n【2】Two types of skin lymphoma are:\n\n【3】*   Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is the most common kind of skin lymphoma.\n\n【4】*   Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL).\n\n【5】What Causes Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】Specific DNA changes inside the normal lymphocytes (immune cells) might cause lymphoma.\n\n【7】Some genes control the cell's growth, cell division, and cell death at the appropriate time. They are:\n\n【8】*   Genes that regulate cell growth, division, or lifespan are called oncogenes.\n\n【9】*   Genes that control cell division or cell death are called tumor suppressor genes.\n\n【10】Cancers develop when changes in the DNA excite the oncogenes or suppress the tumor suppressor genes.\n\n【11】Cancer can also be inherited. However, it is usually acquired after birth.\n\n【12】Who Is at Risk for Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【13】The exact cause of cutaneous lymphoma is not known. Yet, some factors that influence are:\n\n【14】Most skin lymphomas occur in people between 50 years and 60 years. However some forms of skin lymphoma can also appear in children and younger people. It is more common in males than in females; blacks than in whites. People withweak immune systems such as AIDS, organ transplants, or under immunosuppression therapy. Infection can cause skin lymphomas.\n\n【15】For example, HTLV-1 virus infection can cause adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with extranodal nasal natural killer or T-cell lymphoma; Lyme's disease is linked to skin lymphomas.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>Phototherapy of Skin - Types, Contraindications, and Complications</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>Rituximab: Current and Future scope</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>Mikulicz Disease</u>\n\n【21】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Skin lymphomas appear red to purple, small, pimple-like, thick, flat, raised, or lowered lesions; larger lumps or bumps may be present under the skin. The lesion is often itchy and scaly. The lymphoma can occur in any part of the skin that is mostly not exposed to the sun. Some skin lymphomas look like a rash known as erythroderma. Sometimes larger lesions break open and cause ulcers.\n\n【23】Other general symptoms include:\n\n【24】*   Fever.\n\n【25】*   Unexplained weight loss.\n\n【26】*   Profuse sweating, particularly at night time.\n\n【27】*   Severe itch.\n\n【28】*   Lymph node swelling in the underarm, neck, or groin area.\n\n【29】How Is Cutaneous Lymphoma Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【30】Although skin lymphoma is often quickly noticed, the actual diagnosis might be delayed as it resembles other common skin problems. A skin biopsy is required to confirm the skin lymphoma.\n\n【31】1) Other tests that might be needed are as follows.\n\n【32】2) Complete personal and family medical history.\n\n【33】3) Complete physical exam.\n\n【34】4) **Biopsy:**\n\n【35】*   Skin biopsies like punch biopsies, incisional, and excisional skin biopsies are done to confirm the clinical diagnosis.\n\n【36】*   Lymph node biopsies like Excisional or incisional lymph node biopsies are done to determine the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes.\n\n【37】*   Needle biopsies such as fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or a core needle biopsy are done.\n\n【38】*   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are usually taken from hip bone to determine the extent of lymphoma that is already diagnosed.\n\n【39】*   Lumbar puncture is done to investigate lymphoma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n【40】5) **Lab Investigations:**\n\n【41】*   Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, chromosome tests, cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed to investigate the changes in the DNA structure.\n\n【42】6) **Blood Test:**\n\n【43】*   A blood test investigates the extent of specific cell types and chemicals present in the blood. During the treatment, they are also helpful to monitor bone marrow and other organ functioning.\n\n【44】*   Complete and differential blood count, blood chemistry tests, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tests may be done.\n\n【45】7) **Imaging Test:**\n\n【46】*   Imaging tests use x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan to picture the inside of the body. It helps determine the suspicious areas, the spread of lymphoma, prognosis with treatment, and possible signs for recurrence of lymphoma.\n\n【47】How to Treat Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n--------------------------------\n\n【48】**1) Skin-Directed Treatment:**\n\n【49】For early-stage skin lymphomas, the first-line treatment is direct skin treatment while trying to avoid side effects on other body parts.\n\n【50】**2) Surgery:**\n\n【51】*   Surgery is done when only a few skin lesions can be removed entirely. Surgery can be used to take a biopsy of a skin lesion or other tissue to identify and classify a lymphoma.\n\n【52】**3) Radiation Therapy:**\n\n【53】*   Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. It is painless and may require one or several days, depending on the extent of skin being treated.\n\n【54】*   The radiation most often used for skin lymphomas is electron beam radiation. The major side effect of this therapy is a skin reaction like sunburn. Localized thicker lymphomas are treated using high-energy radiation like x-rays or gamma rays.\n\n【55】**4) Phototherapy (UV Light Therapy):**\n\n【56】*   Phototherapy uses UV light to destroy skin cancer cells. Treatments may require several times a week.\n\n【57】**5) Topical Medications:**\n\n【58】*   Topical corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs (Mechlorethamine, Carmustine), retinoids (Bexarotene), and immunotherapy (Imiquimod) are applied to the skin.\n\n【59】**6) Systemic Treatment:**\n\n【60】Systemic treatments are helpful for advanced or fast-growing skin lymphomas and affect the whole body. Sometimes, systemic and skin-directed therapy is given for better results. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) or photoimmunotherapy is occasionally used for T-cell skin lymphomas. It is believed to kill the lymphoma cells and boost the body's immune reaction. Treatment is given for two days continuously and repeated every few weeks.\n\n【61】**7) Systemic Chemotherapy:**\n\n【62】Systemic chemotherapy can be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. It is preferred when the disease is in the more advanced stage, and no improvement is seen with other treatments. Chemo drugs used to treat skin lymphoma patients are Gemcitabine, Liposomal doxorubicin, Methotrexate, Chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, Cladribine, Pentostatin, Etoposide, Temozolomide, Pralatrexate. Single or combination drugs are used. The combination chemo regimen is CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone) and a monoclonal antibody (Rituximab). Likely side effects of chemotherapy are hair loss, mouth sores, increased infection, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, bleeding or bruising, and shortness of breath.\n\n【63】**8) Targeted and Biologic Therapy:**\n\n【64】These drugs specifically target the lymphoma cells, affecting all the fast-growing cells. These drugs include histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Vorinostat, Romidepsin), monoclonal antibodies (Rituximab, Mogamulizumab, Alemtuzumab), anti-CD30 antibody (Brentuximab vedotin), Interferons, systemic retinoids (All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Acitretin, Isotretinoin, and Bexarotene).\n\n【65】**9) High-Dose Chemotherapy With Stem Cell Transplant (SCT):**\n\n【66】Sometimes, stem cell transplants treat lymphoma when traditional treatments do not show any improvement.\n\n【67】Two main types of stem cell transplants are:\n\n【68】**1) Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant:** The blood-forming stem cells are transplanted from another person, such as relatives whose tissue type matches the patient.\n\n【69】**2) Autologous Stem Cell Transplant:** The patient's stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood. Stem cells are collected over several days before treatment, frozen and stored, and then reinfused into the patient's blood during treatment. Autologous transplants are rarely used for skin lymphomas.\n\n【70】How to Prevent Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n----------------------------------\n\n【71】As the cause of skin lymphoma is unknown, there is no sure way to prevent it.\n\n【72】*   As a weakened immune system increases the risk of skin lymphoma, maintaining a healthy immune system can limit the risk.\n\n【73】*   Avoid smoking.\n\n【74】*   Regular physical activity.\n\n【75】What Is the Prognosis of Cutaneous Lymphoma?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【76】Some skin lymphomas have a good prognosis. However when the lymphoma recurs, other treatments can be tried. But the recurrence of lymphoma has a poor prognosis, as more treatments may have little effect on the body or cause side effects. Advanced skin lymphomas have a poor prognosis and are very hard to cure.\n\n【77】**Conclusion:**\n\n【78】Cutaneous lymphoma is a skin cancer that develops due to abnormality in white blood cells called lymphocytes. Early diagnosis can help treat lymphomas with no so little recurrence rate. But as the skin lymphoma progresses, the treatment may be a failure.\n\n【79】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【80】* * *\n\n【81】#### **1.**删除换行**How Severe Is Cutaneous Lymphoma?**\n\n【82】Cutaneous lymphoma presents with rashes, itchy skin, and other skin issues, commonly appearing like a skin disorder.

However, in surface piercing, the hole is punctured and has an entry and exit point through which the needle can pass. Dermal piercings are single-point or micro-dermal piercings that lie flat on the skin's surface. Dermal piercings do not have a separate entry or exit point. It involves a single-point piercing that is held or anchored tightly to the surface of the skin with a flat piece of jewelry or gemstone on top. Mostly dermal piercings are made under the eyes or on the collar bones, arms, back dimples, or chest.\n\n【2】What Is the Procedure Involved in Dermal Piercing?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Dermal piercing involves a simple procedure. First, the skin is cleaned or sterilized to avoid any infection. Then a small mark is drawn to indicate the position of the jewelry. Then the skin is punctured with a needle or skin puncture to create an empty space or a pocket of 1.5 to 2 millimeters to hold the metal or the jewelry. The anchor of the jewelry is then inserted into the small opening by hand or with a pair of forceps until it is completely embedded under the skin. After this, the top or decorative part of the jewelry is screwed or placed on the anchor. The entire process usually takes a few minutes.\n\n【4】What Are the Common Areas on the Body for Dermal Piercings?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The best feature of dermal piercings is their ability to be placed anywhere flat on the body. The following are the most popular areas for dermal piercing.\n\n【6】*   Chest.\n\n【7】*   Lower back.\n\n【8】*   Forearm.\n\n【9】*   Thighs.\n\n【10】*   Cheekbones.\n\n【11】*   Back of the neck.\n\n【12】*   Dimples.\n\n【13】*   Hand.\n\n【14】What Kind of Pain Is Experienced During Dermal Piercings?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Some pain is experienced during dermal piercings. A certain amount of discomfort or a pinch-like feeling occurs during dermal piercings. Dermal piercings might feel like pressure.\n\n【16】The intensity of pain might differ in different individuals and mostly the pain is bearable.\n\n【17】What Precautions Must Be Taken During Dermal Piercing?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】It is important to choose the right spot for dermal piercing. The following elements must be kept in mind while choosing the site of the piercing:\n\n【19】*   Nerve placement.\n\n【20】*   Thickness of skin.\n\n【21】*   Proximity to veins.\n\n【22】What Are the Risks Associated With Dermal Piercing?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The side effects of dermal piercing include:\n\n【24】*   **Infection:** The new piercing can become infected if the healing process is not handled properly. Signs of infection include severe pain, severe swelling, warm skin around the piercing site, yellow or green pus, a rash, or a bad-smelling odor. Usually, the jewelry becomes displaced or detached completely from its anchor. In such cases, the individual must consult the doctor immediately to ensure the infection does not become worse.\n\n【25】*   **Tissue Damage:** The primary major risk involves tissue damage, which can be caused by the improper installation of the jewelry. If the piercing is too deep in the skin, a dermal piercing may become embedded or ultimately rejected by the tissues. On the contrary, a shallow piercing may be displaced easily.\n\n【26】*   **Hypergranulation:** Another risk associated with dermal piercing is hyper granulation. It leads to the formation of a red bump around the piercing site that develops due to too much pressure on the site. The pressure is usually caused by the jewelry and tight non-breathable clothes.\n\n【27】*   **Scarring:** Scarring can take place if the person plays with or removes jewelry during the healing process.\n\n【28】To avoid these risks and to ensure nothing goes wrong during healing the individual must follow the directions and keep the wound clean. The dermal piercing must be done by a certified professional.\n\n【29】What Type of Jewelry Is Used for Dermal Piercings?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】The dermal piercings require various components to ensure that they are properly applied to the skin. The dermal jewelry is composed of the following parts:\n\n【31】*   **Dermal Anchor:** The first major part is the dermal anchor. It is made up of a flat-footed and rounded-base variety. Both of these varieties can be used. However, a flat-footed anchor is used more frequently and more widely accepted because the foot is placed at an angle. This helps to keep the jewelry embedded and reduces its chances of coming out as compared to the rounded base.\n\n【32】*   **Diver:** Sometimes, a dermal piercing is available with a diver, a pointed-end base with preset jewelry. It is inserted by punching it under the surface of the skin, instead of a needle, and it cannot be replaced after insertion.\n\n【33】*   **Dermal Top:** The dermal top is the actual jewelry that is screwed onto the top of the anchor. It can be removed and interchanged with different jewelry. However, the replacement of dermal tops is generally done by a professional. The dermal tops are available in the form of magnetic or screw-on types. The magnetic ones can be changed easily by the wearer and do not require a visit to a piercing shop for changing the jewelry.\n\n【34】*   **Barbell:** It is more commonly used for surface piercing than dermal piercing. A barbell is used as an entry and exit point that is present on the surface of the skin. It is inserted by pinching the skin followed by piercing.\n\n【35】What Material Is Used for Dermal Piercing Jewelry?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The following metals are most commonly used for dermal piercings:\n\n【37】*   Titanium or anodized titanium.\n\n【38】*   Implant-grade stainless steel.\n\n【39】*   Niobium.\n\n【40】The most commonly recommended and frequently used metal for any body jewelry is implant-grade stainless steel. However, it might cause irritation to individuals with highly sensitive skin. In such cases, Titanium and anodized titanium is the safest option as their chances of causing irritation are very less. Niobium, on the other hand, is used less frequently and only because of its lightweight.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】The nature of dermal piercings is that the individual can imagine where the piercing can be made and how it will appear. There is no distinct point of entry or exit for dermal piercings. A flat piece of jewelry or gemstone is placed on top of a single-point piercing to hold it firmly to the skin's surface. Dermal piercings can be used to highlight a tattoo or a facial feature. It can also be worn as a piece of permanent jewelry on the wrist or the neck.\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   A Dermal Piercing Complicated by Mycobacterium fortuitum  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3773381/\n*   Dermal piercings: unregulated high street surgery?  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24635674/\n*   Health risks of body art and piercing sites  \n    https://www.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/F\\_I/Health-risks-of-body-art-and-piercing-sites</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This polyp is hypertrophic as the mucosa herniates through the natural or accessory ostium of the maxillary sinus into the nose. The soft palate region is the primary or common location to observe the Killian polyp in the oral cavity. This soft mass is rounded in appearance, originating from the nasopharynx and hanging down behind the soft palate into the oropharynx. This polyp has no specific gender preference, affects males and females equally, and is more seen in children and young adults below 18 years.\n\n【2】What Is the Classification of Killian Polyps?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The Killian polyps are classified into two types based upon the size of the polyp -\n\n【4】1.  **Early Polyp -** These polyps have two parts, namely antral and choanal. This early lesion or soft mass does not project into the nasal region.\n\n【5】2.  **Late Polyp or Advanced Polyp -** In this type, the polyps extend into the nose with three-part divisions - antral, choanal, and nasal.\n\n【6】According to the classification by Strammberger, the antrochoanal polyp or Killian polyp has two components -\n\n【7】*   The antral part.\n\n【8】*   The choanal part.\n\n【9】The two parts, antral and choanal, are connected by a stalk-like structure that passes through the accessory ostium or the natural ostium. The antral component is composed of cystic content in up to 80 % of the cases, while the choanal part tends to have solidified comparatively.\n\n【10】What Are the Clinical Features of the Antrochoanal Polyp or Killian Polyp?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The clinical features of antrochoanal polyp or Killian polyp include -\n\n【12】*   Patients mainly complain of nasal obstruction and dull voice, causing a change in the vocalization with a hyponasal tone of voice. Nasal obstruction is mostly unilateral, and in some cases, it can be bilateral too. This obstruction is observable or noticed by the patient while reporting to the physician. The obstruction is observed more during exhalation than during inhalation. This can be attributed to the ball valve mechanism that permits air into the nasal cavity unobstructed. But during expiration, the patient usually complains of discomfort because the polyp fills the nasopharynx and eventually blocks the choana part located opposite.\n\n【13】*   After taking a complete history, the medical practitioner might not find any history related to nasal allergies, rhinitis, or asthma.\n\n【14】*   Patients with the Killian polyp have either mucopurulent, mucoid, or thin to thick nasal discharge.\n\n【15】*   The nasal discharge may vary in consistency and can change due to long-standing or chronic maxillary sinus infection.\n\n【16】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of the Antrochoanal or Killian Polyp of the Maxillary Sinus?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Mucous polyps of nasal origin.\n\n【18】*   Inverted papilloma.\n\n【19】*   Angiofibroma.\n\n【20】*   Sphenochoanal polyp.\n\n【21】*   Concha bullosa.\n\n【22】*   Meningoencephalocele.\n\n【23】*   Neoplasms of the nasal cavity: schwannoma, intranasal glioma, meningioma, hemangiopericytoma.\n\n【24】*   Rhinosporidiosis.\n\n【25】How to Diagnose the Antrochoanal or Killian Polyp of the Maxillary Sinus?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The following methods can be used for the diagnosis of Killian polyp -\n\n【27】*   **Anterior Rhinoscopy -** If the growth of the polyp is more anterior-posteriorly, this method can help diagnose this condition as the polyps get large and may extend to the nares anteriorly.\n\n【28】*   **Probe test -** This test helps detect a movable grayish soft textured mass - polyp. The operator can move the mass up and down, which helps in the initial diagnosis of the polyp. However, in some cases where the polyp is attached more laterally and may not show any attachment to the nasal septum, it may remain undetected.\n\n【29】*   **Nasal Endoscopy Procedure -** This test may be recommended by the physician or the ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist in most suspected cases to confirm the diagnosis. In this procedure, the Killian or the Antrochoanal polyp can be observed as a solitary or unilateral mass arising from the middle meatus. And the smooth grayish lobular texture of this mass is confirmative of the diagnosis. The exposed surface of the Killian polyp at the region of the oropharynx behind the soft palate or sometimes in the nostrils itself appears pinkish and highly vascular in texture.\n\n【30】*   **Posterior Rhinoscopy -** This procedure is a more accessible and standard diagnostic method to detect polyps hanging behind the soft palate.\n\n【31】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) scan -** The ENT specialist or the otolaryngologist can also recommend a CT scan. In the CT scan, the antrochoanal polyp can be visualized as an opacity within the maxillary sinus that extends into the homogenous nasal cavity.\n\n【32】What Is the Management of the Antrochoanal or Killian Polyp of Maxillary Sinus?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】There are mainly three major surgical procedures to address or eradicate the Killian polyp of the oronasal region -\n\n【34】1.  **Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) -** Maxillofacial surgeons and physicians prefer this as mainline surgical treatment. The surgeon enlarges the accessory or natural ostium located within the posterior fontanelles. Some surgeons first prefer to decompress the cystic or the antral component of the polyp by performing the decompression or enteroscopy procedure. In ESS surgery, the stalk of the polyp that originates from the maxillary sinus is eliminated fundamentally to prevent the recurrence of the lesions.\n\n【35】2.  **Mini Caldwell Luc Operation -** Caldwell Luc procedure is the mainline or traditional surgical approach for maxillofacial cystic lesions. In this minor procedure, the polyp stalk is eliminated from the origin to prevent any damage to the oral cavity or developing tooth buds. The surgical opening is large, with the central mass of the polyp removed either through the nose or the mouth. The aperture is made by widening it enough to pass an endoscope and forceps in the anterior antral wall of the maxillary sinus.\n\n【36】3.  **Polypectomy -** Canine fossa approach by maxillofacial surgeons is the preferred surgery in children below 10 - 12 years of age by avulsion of the polyp through the oral or the nasal route. This procedure is preferred more than ESS because there is no risk of injury to the developing tooth buds as it is a simple avulsion surgery.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:**\n\n【38】To conclude, the diagnosis of antrochoanal polyps is challenging and should be confirmed by examination techniques elaborated above and by examining the clinical features of the patient. Surgical approaches aid in good long-term prognosis and prevent the recurrence of this maxillary sinus polyp.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In many cases, as the disease may have crossed the primary stages, it cannot be dealt with minimal treatment protocols using medications. Surgeries have been advised in older patients considering the risks associated with them. The patient's medical history and clinical examination play an important role in deciding whether the patient is an ideal candidate for surgery. Benefits over risks are evaluated and advised. In the end, the patient has the right to agree or disagree with surgery and also live with the outcome of the surgery. And hence, the various risk factors associated with major surgeries should be understood properly.\n\n【2】Why Are Elderly People More Affected Than Younger Individuals After Major Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The ability of the body to recover and bear the outcome of the surgery decreases with age. The effect in older adults is higher because the body cells take time to carry out the necessary process for recovery.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors Affecting Surgeries in Older Adults?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Factors that increase the possibility of causing disease are called risk factors. Risk factors after surgery hamper the estimated outcome of the surgery. The physician identifies all the possible risks before the surgery, and required precautions are taken to prevent them. Following are some of the risk factors:\n\n【6】*   **Age** - It is said that age is a number, but when one undergoes surgery, an older adult takes longer to recover than someone younger. Many factors disrupt the healing process, which includes age-related diseases like diabetes (uncontrolled sugar), as well as the healing process, which is slowed down as the body cells age too.\n\n【7】*   **Malnutrition** - Results in ongoing energy deficiencies as the patient might be restricted in the diet when they undergo surgery related to the digestive tract. An individual's body weight is considered to evaluate the tolerance to the surgical process, medications, and recovery.\n\n【8】*   **Smoking** - Chances of impaired heart and lung function can be experienced after surgery in older patients with a smoking habit. Smoking reduces blood flow which in turn reduces the healing process, leading to infection at the surgical site.\n\n【9】*   **Obesity** - Esophageal (food pipe) cancer surgery, gastric (stomach) cancer surgery, liver surgery, and surgeries of the digestive tract lead to adverse effects due to obesity by prolonging the operative time.\n\n【10】*   **Frailty** - Loss of weight, loss of grip strength, exhaustion, decreased physical activity, and decreased walking speed denotes frailty in an older adult, which worsens after major surgeries.\n\n【11】*   **Underlying Diseased Conditions** - Diabetes (uncontrolled sugar levels in the blood), hypertension (blood pressure), viral infections, and genetic disorders also affect the surgical process.\n\n【12】*   **Effect of COVID** - The SARS-CoV-2 virus might have already shown its effects on the body, like myalgia and muscle damage. Factors like these harm recovery after surgery. Covid related lung damage decreases the body's immunity, which places older patients at significant risk from surgeries.\n\n【13】*   People have already been under medication for years.\n\n【14】*   **Intolerance To Treatments** - Allergies to certain medications, reactions between drugs.\n\n【15】*   **General Anesthesia** - Cardiac complications occur as a result of longer anesthetic time. The type of anesthesia also determines the outcome of the surgery. Although rare, allergies due to anesthesia can also occur.\n\n【16】*   Excessive loss of blood during the surgery.\n\n【17】What Are the Risks After Major Surgeries in Older Adults?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   **Sleep Disturbance** - Many older patients can experience immediate sleep disturbance after surgery. This includes sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation, or loss of sleep, which will recover back after a certain time after surgery. Older adults find it difficult to adjust to sleep changes. The elderly are associated with a higher apnea-hypopnea (decreased sleep) index and lower sleep insufficiency after surgery and are hence prone to sleep disturbances than younger patients.\n\n【19】*   **Change In Blood Pressure** - Blood pressure can change after surgery, causing hypotension (low blood pressure) or hypertension (high blood pressure) for many reasons. Sudden withdrawal of medications, lowered oxygen level, anesthesia (drugs used to sedate during the surgery).\n\n【20】*   **Dyspnoea** - Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【21】*   **Infections** - Bacteria entering the surgical site can cause infection, which can delay healing. The spreading of infections from one site to another can occur through the bloodstream.\n\n【22】*   **Shock** - Severe decrease in blood pressure causes reduced blood flow.\n\n【23】*   **Hemorrhage** - Uncontrolled bleeding from the surgical site.\n\n【24】*   **Delirium** - Disturbance in the mental ability of the older patient leads to mental confusion. Postoperative delirium is a frequent risk among elderly patients and increases adverse events like lengthy hospital stays and mortality (death); hence, delirium prevention is essential.\n\n【25】*   **Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction** - Impairment in recollecting things or thinking processes after surgery.\n\n【26】*   Long recovery time.\n\n【27】*   Death.\n\n【28】How to Prevent Risk Factors After Major Surgeries in Older Adults?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The physician informs every patient of the risks involved during and after the surgery. Physicians usually do not suggest surgery when the risks involved are riskier or can be fatal than an expected positive surgical outcome. The decision is left to the patient and their family. Most of the patients opt for surgery based on the information provided. Below are how risk factors can be prevented:\n\n【30】*   Identifying the risk factors\n\n【31】*   Make the right decision based on the physician's advice.\n\n【32】*   Early identification of the risk factor for its complete management.\n\n【33】*   Anesthesia-related risks can be prevented by following a proper anesthetic care plan.\n\n【34】*   Reviewing medical records for underlying diseased conditions, the complexity of the surgery, type of anesthesia, and estimated blood loss.\n\n【35】*   Decreasing the effects of long-term hospitalization.\n\n【36】How Can Risks After Major Surgeries in Older Adults Be Treated?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Risks such as shock, change in blood pressure, and wound infections can be treated in the following ways.\n\n【38】**1) Shock Can Be Treated By:**\n\n【39】*   Preventing any blood loss.\n\n【40】*   Providing continuous IV (intravenous) fluids.\n\n【41】*   Providing required oxygen.\n\n【42】**2) Change in Blood Pressure Can Be Treated By:**\n\n【43】*   Prescribing medications to raise or decrease blood pressure, respectively.\n\n【44】*   Having a proper medical history and Administering medications through IV (intravenously).\n\n【45】**3) Wound Infections Can Be Treated By:**\n\n【46】*   Administering antibiotics.\n\n【47】*   Debridement (cleaning) of the infection site.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】All the associated risk factors owing to major surgeries are explained, and the patient is monitored to keep a check on the patient's reactions. The treatment is designed after taking risks under consideration, and the recovery of the patient is managed accordingly. It is very important for the physician to explain all the risk factors to the patient and for the patient to understand them.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   The Incidence and Cumulative Risk of Major Surgery in Older Persons in the United States  \n    https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239228v1.full\n*   Age  \n    https://www.asahq.org/madeforthismoment/preparing-for-surgery/risks/age/\n*   Should Older Seniors Risk Major Surgery?

{"seq_id": "1c957447-a61a-4f33-be03-73ebe3d78453", "title": "Gerstmann Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management", "text": "【0】Gerstmann Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Gerstmann syndrome is a brain disorder characterized by four classical cognitive defects. The syndrome usually occurs as a result of brain injury or developmental disorders. The condition affects both men and women and can develop at any age. When the disease affects children, it is known as developmental Gerstmann syndrome. However, according to some researchers, developmental Gerstmann syndrome is not a unique syndrome, but it is more likely to be a collection of symptoms resulting from another underlying condition. Moreover, the diagnosis procedure involves neuroimaging to determine the cause of the condition, and the treatment usually involves removing the underlying cause, rehabilitation, and counseling.\n\n【2】What Is Gerstmann Syndrome?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Gerstmann syndrome is a neurological disorder resulting from developmental disorders, trauma, or injury to the brain. This syndrome is characterized by a set of four hallmark symptoms, which include:\n\n【4】*   **Agraphia or Dysgraphia:** Inability to write or express thoughts in the form of writing.\n\n【5】*   **Acalculia:** Inability to perform simple mathematic calculations.\n\n【6】*   **Finger Agnosia:** Inability to recognize their own or others’ fingers.\n\n【7】*   **Left-Right Disorientation:** Inability to differentiate between left and right sides.\n\n【8】In addition, apart from these four symptoms, other systemic symptoms and cognitive defects may also be present. Josef Gerstmann, an Austrian neuroscientist, in the year 1924, first recognized this medical condition. The syndrome is also known as developmental Gerstmann's syndrome and is documented in seemingly normal but brain-damaged children who present with learning disabilities. Gerstmann syndrome is distinct from Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheink, an uncommon and inherited degenerative brain disorder.\n\n【9】What Are the Other Names for Gerstmann Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Other names of Gerstmann syndrome are:\n\n【11】*   GS.\n\n【12】*   Developmental Gerstmann syndrome.\n\n【13】*   Gerstmann tetrad.\n\n【14】What Causes Gerstmann Syndrome?\n-------------------------------\n\n【15】Adults who have experienced a stroke or other type of brain damage that impairs blood flow to the brain may develop the syndrome. Gerstmann syndrome affects the parietal lobe of the brain, which is part of the brain responsible for sensation, perception, and recognizing sensory output. Gerstmann syndrome, in rare cases, may arise due to brain trauma or brain tumors. In children, the exact cause of Gerstmann syndrome is unknown. However, some of the common causes of Gerstmann syndrome are:\n\n【16】*   Ischemic stroke (a condition in which the blood supply to certain brain parts is decreased or interrupted).\n\n【17】*   Brain tumors.\n\n【18】*   Carotid artery dissecting aneurysm (a medical condition in which the layers of the carotid artery are separated).\n\n【19】*   Stenosis (narrowing of a passage in the body).\n\n【20】*   Middle cerebral artery aneurysm (abnormal focal dilation of a brain artery).\n\n【21】*   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (disease affecting the white matter of the brain occurring due to viral infection).\n\n【22】*   Chronic subdural hematoma (collection of blood and its breakdown products between the brain surface and its outermost covering).\n\n【23】Other symptoms may include:\n\n【24】*   Chronic alcoholism.\n\n【25】*   Carbon monoxide toxicity.\n\n【26】*   Lead poisoning.\n\n【27】*   A severe allergic reaction that is frequently life-threatening in response to an antigen to which the body becomes sensitive (anaphylactic shock).\n\n【28】*   A complication of cerebral angiography.\n\n【29】*   A complication of contrast is used in angiography.\n\n【30】*   Adverse reaction of the drug Acetazolamide.\n\n【31】Is Gerstmann Syndrome a Common Condition?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【32】*   Gerstmann syndrome is a rare condition. However, the exact incidence rate of the condition in the general population is still unknown.\n\n【33】*   It is not unusual to encounter a patient who exhibits two to three of the characteristic symptoms of this syndrome, but it is rare to find a patient who exhibits all four symptoms of the syndrome.\n\n【34】*   Gerstmann syndrome affects both men and women equally.\n\n【35】*   The condition can affect individuals of all ages.\n\n【36】Is Gerstmann Syndrome an Inherited Condition?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Gerstmann is not an inherited condition which means parents cannot genetically pass down the condition to their children. Therefore, Gerstmann syndrome does not run in families.\n\n【38】What Are the Symptoms of Gerstmann Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Signs and symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome are:\n\n【40】*   Inability to do simple mathematic calculations.\n\n【41】*   Inability to distinguish between left and right.\n\n【42】*   Inability to recognize fingers.\n\n【43】*   Inability to write or express thoughts in the form of writing.\n\n【44】*   Two-way disturbance of comprehension and naming (semantic aphasia).\n\n【45】*   The presence of all four of these neurologic dysfunctions in a person with learning impairments is quite uncommon. The classic syndrome is only present when all four symptoms co-occur without mental retardation.\n\n【46】*   Affected individuals may occasionally experience difficulty in communicating verbally and/or comprehending other people's speech in addition to the four classic symptoms. Additionally, they might have trouble with reading and spelling.\n\n【47】*   Affected children exhibit poor handwriting, poor mathematic skills, and spelling problems.\n\n【48】*   Depending on the underlying reason, this syndrome may also be accompanied by additional symptoms such as apraxia (inability of the brain to deliver correct instructions of movement to the body), visual ataxia (the inability to reach for or aim accurately at an item under visual guidance), cognitive impairment, numbness, or weakness.\n\n【49】*   Toe agnosia is often associated with finger agnosia; therefore, it may be called digit agnosia instead of finger agnosia.\n\n【50】How Is Gerstmann Syndrome Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【51】A thorough medical history and physical examination should be performed to diagnose this syndrome and direct the physician to identify its underlying cause. The diagnostic procedures include:\n\n【52】*   **Study the Symptoms:** The four elements of Gerstmann's syndrome should be identified with a special neurological evaluation.\n\n【53】1.  **Finger Agnosia:** The patient's eyes should be covered, and the doctor should ask them to extend their fingers. The doctor should lightly touch the patient's fingers, and the patient should react by identifying the finger. If the patient has tactile insensitivity, the test may be impacted. A minimum of 20 % false recognition is required to confirm the diagnosis of finger or digit agnosia.\n\n【54】2.  **Right-Left Disorientation:** The doctor should hand the patient a card with written instructions, like \"put the left hand to the right ear,\" and ask them to read it aloud. If the patient fails to read it correctly, the doctor should read it to the patient, and then the patient is asked to perform similar instructions.\n\n【55】3.  **Dysgraphia:** The doctor may show the patient some particular objects and ask them to write their names. Moreover, the patient may also be asked to explain specific instructions.\n\n【56】4.  **Dyscalculia:** The patient should be given a card with a simple equation and asked to write it down and solve it. After that, the patient should be asked to multiply the equation without writing it down or looking at it.\n\n【57】*   **Imaging Tests:** A neuroimaging scan like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan (computed tomography) should be done to diagnose any patient exhibiting the symptoms and signs of Gerstmann's syndrome. Abnormalities are primarily noticed in the posteroinferior region of the brain's parietal lobe, with or without the involvement of the surrounding areas. In the case of an infarct, several abnormalities may be seen in an MRI or CT scan. The abnormalities usually vary depending on the cause of the condition.\n\n【58】How Is Gerstmann Syndrome Treated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【59】*   In the case of developing Gerstmann syndrome, special education, relevant rehabilitation, and counseling can be used as treatment. However, neurological evaluation is crucial to differentiate between the possible causes of the syndrome. In adults, the underlying neurological problem needs to be treated. Surgery may be performed to treat conditions with a brain tumor or injury. In some adults, Gerstmann syndrome symptoms get better with time.\n\n【60】*   In some cases, the causes of Gerstmann's syndrome are treatable and reversible, such as when a tumor, hemorrhage, epilepsy focus lesion, or diffuse etiology like carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Gerstmann syndrome is a rare condition with challenging diagnosis and treatment procedures. The severity of the right-left disorientation caused by Gerstmann's disease, combined with other disorders, can make leading a regular life impossible. However, intense speech therapy may be able to help children with developmental Gerstmann's syndrome, especially if they are identified early. After extensive rehabilitation and treatment, a patient with Gerstmann's syndrome may exhibit excellent recovery. However, acalculia may improve at a slower pace. Furthermore, children with developmental Gerstmann's syndrome might show improvement in the syndrome, albeit this necessitates early detection and identification of the syndrome.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   Gerstmann Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/gerstmann-syndrome/\n*   Gerstmann Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519528/\n*   Gerstmann's Syndrome  \n    https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/gerstmanns-syndrome</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Single fetal demise during the first trimester of twin pregnancy is very common and does not have serious consequences. However, single fetal death during twin pregnancy increases the risk of morbidity and mortality of the surviving co-twin.\n\n【2】Based on the timing of a single fetal demise during a twin pregnancy, it can be classified as follows-\n\n【3】*   **Vanishing Twin Syndrome -** This occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy. It can be considered a form of miscarriage. Initially, two fetuses are diagnosed in early ultrasound, but over time, in subsequent ultrasounds, only one fetus can be seen. The fetus that could not sustain life is termed the 'vanishing twin.' After the vanishing twin disappears, its fetal tissues are reabsorbed inside the mother's womb.\n\n【4】*   **Antepartum Single Twin Demise -** This occurs in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. This is a much more severe condition as it predisposes the surviving co-twin to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Single twin demise after 17 weeks of gestation (mid-pregnancy) can lead to complications like-\n\n【5】    *   Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) - Improper growth of existing co-twin.\n\n【6】    *   Pre-eclampsia - high blood pressure during pregnancy.\n\n【7】    *   Preterm labor.\n\n【8】    *   Perinatal mortality - It can be stillbirth (fetal death) or early neonatal death (ENND), which is the death of the newborn in the first seven days after birth.\n\n【9】What Are the Causes of Single Fetal Demise in Twin Pregnancy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Reasons for a single intrauterine demise can be as follows-\n\n【11】**1\\.

Other factors that impact the survival of co-twin are-\n\n【31】*   **Timing** \\- If the single fetal demise occurred in the first trimester, then no adverse outcomes can be expected, but if it occurs during the second or third trimester, there are increased chances of premature delivery, cerebral palsy, or even death.\n\n【32】*   **Chorionicity -** when one twin dies, chorionicity is the prime determinant of the outcome. In dichorionic (DC) pregnancies, twins do not share any placental circulation, and so the twins are hemodynamically independent. Thus, the risk of complications is comparatively lower. Monochorionic (MC) pregnancies are at higher risk as the twins share the placental circulation. Damage to the monochorionic co-twin after the death of one twin can be explained by the following theories-\n    *   **Thromboplastin Theory -** This theory says that the thrombotic material from the dead twin passes on to the surviving twin resulting in thromboses and neurological injuries.\n\n【33】    *   **Ischaemic Theory -** This theory says that immediately before death, the fetus becomes hypotensive and partially drains its co-twin by placental anastomoses, resulting in anemia, hypotension, and hypoperfusion for the surviving co-twin.\n\n【34】*   **Neurological Disorders -** After the demise of a single fetus, the surviving co-twin can develop various neurological disorders. These disorders can be seen in the co-twin as early as six days to six weeks after the fetal loss. Some commonly occurring neurological conditions are-\n\n【35】*   **Cerebral Palsy -** A disorder of movement or muscle tone by birth.\n\n【36】*   **Periventricular Leukomalacia** \\- A type of brain injury that affects premature babies.\n\n【37】*   **Multicystic Encephalomalacia (MCE)** \\- A condition where brain cells are replaced by cysts.\n\n【38】*   **Porencephaly** \\- Cysts filled with cerebrospinal fluid present in the brain.\n\n【39】*   **Hydranencephaly** \\- Characterized by neurological deficits and an enlarged head.\n\n【40】*   **Microcephaly** \\- Characterized by a smaller size of the head.\n\n【41】What Is the Management of Single Fetus Demise in Twin Pregnancy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】*   **Early Pre-viable Cases -** When a single fetus demise of twin pregnancy takes place in the first trimester, nothing much needs to be done. The fetal tissues of the dead twin are reabsorbed within the body, and no harmful consequences are observed on the living twin. However, there are chances of preterm delivery.\n\n【43】*   **Late Viable Cases -** When a single fetus demise of twin pregnancy takes place in the second or third trimester, much more complications can be expected.\n\n【44】The management of different types of twin pregnancies is as follows,\n\n【45】*   **Monochorionic -** In these cases, the surviving twin has the risk of preterm delivery or ischaemic brain damage or intrauterine death. The best way to prevent damage to living co-twin is immediate delivery after the single fetal demise.\n\n【46】*   **Dichorionic -** The main risk associated with dichorionic twin pregnancies is preterm delivery. Regular fetal and maternal surveillance for hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation is suggested.\n\n【47】*   **Fetal Surveillance -**\n\n【48】    *   **Ultrasound** \\- Ultrasound is performed to determine the chorionicity and for a thorough examination of the surviving twin. Regular ultrasound of the surviving fetus's brain is done to look for signs of any injury.\n\n【49】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** MRI screening of a surviving fetus is done to check the presence of any hemorrhage or intracranial injury.\n\n【50】    *   **Fetal Blood Sampling and Intrauterine Transfusion** - After the death of one fetus, the surviving twin has a risk of anemia or hypoxic tissue damage due to hemodynamic changes. Thus, fetal blood sampling of surviving co-twin is done within 24 to 48 hours of fetal death to check for hemoglobin, fetal hematocrit, and acid-base balance of the survivor.\n\n【51】*   **Gestation of Delivery -** If a single fetal demise occurs before 34 weeks of gestation and the lungs of surviving co-twin are yet to develop, then a course of Betamethasone is given to promote lung development.\n\n【52】*   **Mode of Delivery -** Vaginal deliveries can be done, but cesarean section deliveries are recommended to avoid risks.\n\n【53】*   **Post Delivery** \\- After the delivery, a full examination of the baby should be done. Neurological examinations like cranial ultrasound and MRI are recommended. The baby should be monitored regularly to reach normal milestones. If the cause of single fetal demise in twin pregnancy is not known, then placental examination must be done post-delivery.\n\n【54】*   **Maternal Monitoring** Regular blood pressure monitoring and urine analysis are required to rule out the related risks. Maternal counseling is required to avoid postnatal depression.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】The outcome of a single fetal demise in twin pregnancy depends on the gestational age and the chorionicity. The management of single fetal death in a twin pregnancy can be difficult, so identification of the cause, monitoring the surviving co-twin, deciding the mode and timing of delivery, and maternal counseling are essential factors in determining the prognosis. Parents must be counseled to relieve the grief and guilt of the loss of one baby, and they must celebrate the birth of the surviving baby.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Review of Twin Pregnancies with Single Fetal Death: Management, Maternal and Fetal Outcome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061330/\n*   Single Fetal Demise in Twin Pregnancy-A Great Concern but Still a Favorable Outcome  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33946946/\n*   Single fetal death in twin gestations  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236130108\\_Single\\_fetal\\_death\\_in\\_twin\\_gestations</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c8c26120-c8e9-440a-8fea-481c7b07a9eb", "title": "Mepolizumab Injection - Dosages, Indication, Contraindications, and Adverse Effects", "text": "【0】Mepolizumab Injection - Dosages, Indication, Contraindications, and Adverse Effects\n**Overview**\n\n【1】Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5. It is believed to be obtained from hamster ovary cells. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Mepolizumab in 2015 as an additional therapy to treat severe asthma. Identifying the drug to treat severe asthma has reduced the need for hospitalization. Later, it was also used to treat eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In addition, Mepolizumab was proven effective for treating adults and children above twelve years with non-blood-related hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\n【2】How Does Mepolizumab Work?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Mepolizumab reduces the white blood cell activity that stimulates asthmatic attacks. It happens by binding with the interleukin-5, thereby preventing its attachment to the receptor on the eosinophil surface.\n\n【4】**Uses**\n\n【5】*   Severe asthma patients above 12 years of age with an eosinophilic phenotype.\n\n【6】*   Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\n【7】**Dosage and Administration**\n\n【8】Mepolizumab can be administered subcutaneously.\n\n【9】*   **Asthma:** Mepolizumab 100 mg once every four weeks is injected into the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh.\n\n【10】*   **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis:** Mepolizumab 300 mg is separated into three 100 mg and injected once every four weeks.\n\n【11】For Patients\n------------\n\n【12】**Learn About Asthma**\n\n【13】Asthma is a respiratory condition associated with swelling of the lungs' airways. But a variant called eosinophilic asthma involves swelling the complete respiratory system from the nose to the small bronchioles. This is the reason for the shortness of breath experienced during the condition. In addition, as the name indicates, this type of asthma shows eosinophilia (increased eosinophil count) in the saliva and usually responds to corticosteroids. However, the identification of Mepolizumab has reduced the use of corticosteroids.\n\n【14】**Learn More About Mepolizumab**\n\n【15】When and How Often to Take Mepolizumab?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】Mepolizumab 100 mg injection is given subcutaneously every four weeks by a healthcare professional. Individuals can self-take the injection themselves or by a caregiver.\n\n【17】How Effective Is Mepolizumab?\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】The effectiveness of Mepolizumab on asthma control and lung function has reduced the daily use of oral corticosteroids.\n\n【19】**Things to Inform the Doctor Before They Prescribe Mepolizumab**\n\n【20】The following information must be informed to the doctor before they prescribe Mepolizumab.\n\n【21】*   Have parasitic infection.\n\n【22】*   Taking oral or inhaled corticosteroids.\n\n【23】*   Pregnant or planning for pregnancy.\n\n【24】*   Breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed.\n\n【25】*   Taking over-the-counter medications and herbal or nutritional supplements.\n\n【26】*   Have allergies to Mepolizumab.\n\n【27】*   History of shingles.\n\n【28】**Starting Mepolizumab**\n\n【29】How to Take Mepolizumab?\n------------------------\n\n【30】*   The healthcare provider injects Mepolizumab subcutaneously every four weeks.\n\n【31】*   If the injection is self-taken, get clarification from the doctor before administering it. Also, read the instructions given with the drug.\n\n【32】*   Inject Mepolizumab subcutaneously into the thigh or stomach while self-taking.\n\n【33】*   An injection can be administered in the upper arm if a care provider gives it.\n\n【34】**Things to Do After Start Taking Mepolizumab**\n\n【35】Inform the doctor about the symptom's progress and if it worsens after Mepolizumab administration. Also, do not stop taking other asthma medications without consent from the doctor. In addition, schedule regular appointments and get monitored regularly.\n\n【36】**Look Out for Side Effects**\n\n【37】The following side effects must be reported to the doctor immediately.\n\n【38】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【39】*   Painful blisters.\n\n【40】*   Breathing problems.\n\n【41】*   Dizziness.\n\n【42】*   Fever or chills.\n\n【43】*   Cough.\n\n【44】*   Difficult urination.\n\n【45】The side effects that are not bothersome until they persist for a long time are\n\n【46】*   Backache.\n\n【47】*   Headache.\n\n【48】*   Weakness.\n\n【49】*   Pain, irritation, and redness at the injection site.\n\n【50】**Dietary Alterations**\n\n【51】No specific dietary alterations are required while taking Mepolizumab. However, tell the doctor all the herbs and dietary supplements taken to ensure no interaction with the medications.\n\n【52】What Should Be Done When a Dose Is Missed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【53】If the injection is taken in the hospital, try to take the dose. If the dose is self-taken, take the injection as soon as possible if missed. Ensure to avoid taking an extra dose to compensate for the missed dose. However, get an opinion from the physician for better clarification.\n\n【54】What Should Be Done to Treat Mepolizumab Overdose?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】No specific treatment has been identified to treat Mepolizumab overdose. If an overdose occurs, immediately report it to the doctor and get monitored and treated.\n\n【56】How to Store Mepolizumab?\n-------------------------\n\n【57】Store the prefilled syringes or autoinjectors in the original container in the refrigerator at 36 to 46 degree Celsius. However, do not allow them to freeze. In addition, avoid using the medication if kept outside the refrigerator for more than seven days, even if left unopened. Keep them out of reach from children and pets.\n\n【58】How to Dispose of Mepolizumab?\n------------------------------\n\n【59】The used syringe and needle cap must be disposed of in a sharp disposal container immediately after administration. If a sharp disposal container is unavailable, a household container can be used with the following properties.\n\n【60】*   Heavy-duty plastic container.\n\n【61】*   Leak-resistant.\n\n【62】*   Tight-fitting and puncture-resistant cap.\n\n【63】*   Stable during use.\n\n【64】*   Labeled as hazardous waste on the container.\n\n【65】Once the container is full, the local pharmacy disposal company has to be contacted to dispose of it properly. In addition, avoid throwing the quick disposal with household trash.\n\n【66】**Avoid Self-Medication**\n\n【67】Avoid taking the injection without the doctor's consent. Also, do not recommend the injection to individuals with similar symptoms.\n\n【68】**Staying On Mepolizumab:-**\n\n【69】**Tips to Stay On Track**\n\n【70】If the injection is administered regularly in the hospital or at home, setting the alarm is the best way to stay on track and avoid missing the dose. If the patient is severely ill, the caregiver must be alert to give the injection to the patient.\n\n【71】However, if any adverse effects are noticed immediately, a few hours, or days after injection, the doctor must be informed for further monitoring and management.\n\n【72】For Doctors\n-----------\n\n【73】**Indication:**\n\n【74】Mepolizumab treats severe asthma patients above 12 years of age with an eosinophilic phenotype. It also treats adults with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, it cannot be used to ease symptoms of acute bronchospasm.\n\n【75】**Pharmacology:**\n\n【76】**Mechanism of Action**\n\n【77】Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with interleukin-5 and prevents it from binding to interleukin-5R cells. This process can reduce eosinophil levels and can treat eosinophilic disease. However, the exact mechanism of action of Mepolizumab has yet to be identified. Also, patients with mild asthma and a sub-type of hypereosinophilic syndrome do not benefit from Mepolizumab.\n\n【78】**Pharmacodynamics**\n\n【79】On administration of Mepolizumab 100 mg every four weeks for severe asthma, eosinophil count was reduced to a mean of 40 cells/microliters. This reduction can be noticed in four weeks and maintained throughout the treatment. On administration of Mepolizumab 300 mg every four weeks for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the eosinophil count was reduced to a mean of 38 cells/microliters.\n\n【80】**Chemical Taxonomy**\n\n【81】**Kingdom**\\- Organic compounds.\n\n【82】**Superclass**\\- Organic acids.\n\n【83】**Class**\\- Carboxylic acids and derivatives.\n\n【84】**Subclass**\\- Amino acids, peptides, and analogs.\n\n【85】**Direct Parent**\\- Peptides.\n\n【86】**Ingredients**\n\n【87】**Active Ingredient:** Mepolizumab.\n\n【88】**Inactive Ingredients:** The vials contain sucrose, polysorbate 80, and sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate.\n\n【89】The prefilled autoinjectors and syringes contain ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid monohydrate, disodium dihydrate, sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, polysorbate 80, and sucrose.\n\n【90】**Absorption**\n\n【91】When 100 mg of Mepolizumab is administered subcutaneously to an adult, the approximate bioavailability is 80 percent. When the dose is administered for four weeks, approximately two-fold drug accumulation occurs at a steady state.\n\n【92】**Distribution**\n\n【93】The volume of distribution of Mepolizumab is 3.6 liters in an adult asthma patient.\n\n【94】**Metabolism**\n\n【95】Mepolizumab undergoes proteolytic degradation (hydrolysis of peptide bonds of proteins) when distributed throughout the body.\n\n【96】**Elimination**\n\n【97】The mean half-life of Mepolizumab is around 16 to 22 days, and the systemic clearance is 0.28 liters a day.\n\n【98】**Toxicity**\n\n【99】The carcinogenic potential of Mepolizumab has been studied but has yet to be proven because the results of various studies indicate different properties of tumor rejection and growth.\n\n【100】In a clinical study, Mepolizumab was administered to monkeys, which showed no significant effects on their reproductive potential. No significant pathological findings in the monkeys’ reproductive organs are proof.\n\n【101】**Warning and Precaution**\n\n【102】*   **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** The hypersensitivity reactions that occurred after Mepolizumab administration are hypotension, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, rash, and urticaria. They can occur within hours or days after administration. In such a case, the drug has to be discontinued.\n\n【103】*   **Acute Asthma Symptoms:** Mepolizumab is not to treat acute asthma symptoms. If the patient experiences uncontrolled symptoms or it worsens after Mepolizumab administration, immediate medical attention is essential, and the drug must be discontinued for such acute symptoms.\n\n【104】*   **Opportunistic Infections:** In a clinical trial, Mepolizumab caused herpes zoster infection in a few subjects. Vaccination can be considered in such cases.\n\n【105】*   **Corticosteroid Dosage Reduction:** Beginning Mepolizumab administration, the corticosteroid intake should not be halted. However, the dosage can be reduced accordingly to avoid exacerbating the condition for which corticosteroids were taken.\n\n【106】*   **Helminth Infection:** Mepolizumab therapy should not be started before treating helminth infections. However, if an individual acquires helminth infection after Mepolizumab administration, discontinue the drug, treat the helminth infection, and then continue Mepolizumab.\n\n【107】**Dosage and Forms**\n\n【108】100 mg white lyophilized powder is reconstituted in a single-dose vial. The resultant injection solution is colorless to pale brown, injected using a single-dose auto-injector or prefilled syringe.\n\n【109】Mepolizumab 100 mg is used for asthma patients and 300 mg (three 100 mg doses) for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis once every four weeks.\n\n【110】**Administration of the Drug**\n\n【111】A 1 ml polypropylene syringe with a disposable needle is used for subcutaneous administration. Before administration, the reconstituted solution of Mepolizumab is made ready. The solution must not be shaken to avoid foaming or precipitation. Then, the 1 ml injection containing 100 mg of Mepolizumab can be administered subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen.\n\n【112】**Contraindications**\n\n【113】Individuals hypersensitive or allergic to the drug's ingredients, such as sodium phosphate, dibasic heptahydrate, polysorbate 80, and sucrose, are contraindicated to taking Mepolizumab.\n\n【114】**Clinical Studies for Mepolizumab**\n\n【115】A clinical trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of Mepolizumab for severe asthma. A randomized placebo-controlled trial for 24 to 52 weeks was conducted. The subjects selected were positive for eosinophils in the airways. Mepolizumab was administered subcutaneously or intravenously every four weeks. The common adverse effects noticed in the subjects were headache, injection site reaction, back pain, fatigue, influenza, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, pruritus, eczema, and muscle spasms. Post-marketing of Mepolizumab also resulted in a few adverse effects, which were not considered reliable as the population size of the study is negligible, and various external factors might also induce those adverse events.\n\n【116】**Drug Interactions**\n\n【117】1\\. The severity of adverse reactions can increase when the following drugs are administered with Mepolizumab.\n\n【118】*   Abciximab.\n\n【119】*   Adalimumab.\n\n【120】*   BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine.\n\n【121】2\\. The efficacy of anthrax immune globulin can decrease when administered with Mepolizumab.\n\n【122】**Other Specifications:-**\n\n【123】**Mepolizumab in Pregnant Women**\n\n【124】Mepolizumab can get transmitted through the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy. Hence they can cause adverse effects on the fetus during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The drug can cause low birth weight, infant prematurity, and preeclampsia (pregnancy complication with high blood pressure) in the mother. Hence the treatment for an asthmatic pregnant woman is maintained and adjusted accordingly.\n\n【125】**Mepolizumab in Lactating Women**\n\n【126】No data indicates the presence of Mepolizumab in breast milk and its effects on the fetus. However, the following factors must be considered before administration.\n\n【127】*   The clinical need of the mother for the drug.\n\n【128】*   The beneficial effects of breastfeeding.\n\n【129】*   Risks of potential adverse effects on the infant.\n\n【130】**Mepolizumab in Pediatric Patients**\n\n【131】The efficacy and safety of Mepolizumab use in pediatric patients have not been established yet.\n\n【132】In addition, no significant differences in dose alterations were identified between younger and older patients.\n\n【133】**Mepolizumab in Geriatric Patients**\n\n【134】No significant differences were identified between younger and older adults regarding the dosage of administration of Mepolizumab. However, on a cautious note, older individuals are started with a lower drug dose, which is then altered depending on the need.\n\n【135】**Mepolizumab in Renal Impairment Patients**\n\n【136】No significant data has been collected regarding the effects of Mepolizumab on renal impairment patients. However, certain evidence shows that Mepolizumab is not really excreted renally.\n\n【137】**Mepolizumab in Hepatic Impairment Patients**\n\n【138】No clinical studies have been conducted to establish the use of Mepolizumab in hepatic impairment patients. Also, Mepolizumab is metabolized primarily by proteolytic enzymes, so hepatic functioning and the elimination of the drug do not correlate.\n\n【139】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【140】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Mepolizumab Administered Subcutaneously in Children  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02377427\n*   Mepolizumab Injection  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a615058.html\n*   NUCALA (mepolizumab) for injection, for subcutaneous use  \n    https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2022/761122s008,125526s019lbl.pdf\n*   Mepolizumab  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896350/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A fracture is a bone break that commonly happens in accidents, falls, or sports injuries. It is treated by approximating and aligning the broken pieces and immobilizing them in a cast.\n\n【2】During healing, new bone forms between the broken pieces, forming a soft callus that ultimately ossifies (hardens) and joins the fragments. This healing process, with the formation of new bone, is known as osteogenesis.\n\n【3】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>Papilledema - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>Sertraline During Pregnancy - Safe or Not</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>Craniotomy - Procedure, Indications and Contraindications</u>\n\n【8】During CDO, an undersized bone is intentionally fractured, which will initiate osteogenesis, but instead of a cast, a mechanical device (distractor) is fixed to connect the broken fragments. This is done because the direction of the new bone that will form between the fractured parts will be under the surgeon's control. The entire process of breaking and forming new bone is done until the undersized bone has reached its desired length. This part of the process is called distraction osteogenesis (DO), and if it is done in the head and face, it is called craniofacial distraction osteogenesis (CDO).\n\n【9】**Who Needs a CDO?**\n--------------------\n\n【10】Patients with bone deformities in the face and the head will benefit from CDO. Most often, these deformities are congenital (present at birth) and occur due to genetic abnormalities. A few defects are mentioned below:\n\n【11】*   **Mandibular Hypoplasia**\\- Hypoplasia means arrested development, and when this happens in the mandible (lower jaw), it is known as mandibular hypoplasia. The arrested development results in a small-sized mandible called micrognathia. Micrognathia does not occur alone; it is always combined with glossoptosis (tongue pushed back into the throat) and cleft palate (a split in the roof of the mouth). All three signs occur in a sequence known as the Pierre Robin sequence. A genetic abnormality may have just the signs of the Pierre Robin sequence or can be in combination with other defects; for example, patients with stickler syndrome have the three cardinal signs of the Pierre Robin sequence along with eye defects, hearing impairments, and joint deformities.\n*   **Midface Hypoplasia**\\- Another set of bone deformities, but this time they are seen in the bones in the middle of the face. The associated features of midface hypoplasia are hypoplastic nasal bone, small maxilla (upper jaw), and cleft lip and palate. The presence of these signs depends on the penetrance of the abnormal gene. Penetrance in the proportion of the abnormal gene, for a better understanding of the same stickler syndrome, can be used; if the abnormal gene is present superficially, it may cause only the Pierre robin sequence, but if it gets completely mutated, then the same patient with stickler syndrome will have midface hypoplasia as well.\n*   **Craniosynostosis-** This is a cranial defect due to the early fusion of the bones in the baby's skull. The skull is not one huge bone; it is made of six bones (a total of eight in number), fusing together at different times after birth. The location of the fusion is known as a suture.\n\n【12】The fusion timing may range from three months to three years, facilitating the baby's brain growth after birth. However, if there is a genetic anomaly, the sutures fuse beforehand (craniosynostosis) and retard brain development. With CDO, the surgeon can correct the structural deformity in the conditions mentioned above, thereby improving the quality of life.\n\n【13】**Does CDO Only Restore the Shape of the Deformed Bones?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Craniofacial distraction osteogenesis (CDO) is more than an aesthetic treatment; it helps to restore normal physiology and brain development, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life. Patients with mandibular and midface dysplasia have their tongues pushed into the throat due to underdeveloped jaws; this will cause airway obstruction, sleep apnea, and difficulty swallowing.\n\n【15】If left untreated, craniosynostosis will lead to severe craniofacial (skull and face) deformity, intracranial (inside the skull) hypertension, cognitive impairment, developmental delays, seizures, blindness, and death. With CDO's help, patients can avoid possible tracheostomy (a surgical procedure to relieve airway obstruction) and craniotomy (brain surgery to relieve intracranial hypertension).\n\n【16】**What Happens During CDO?**\n----------------------------\n\n【17】The entire process of intentionally breaking the deformed bone and forming and stabilization of the new bone takes place in four stages, they are-\n\n【18】*   **Initial Osteotomy/Distractor Placement Phase-** The surgeon creates an osteotomy (cutting the bone) in the desired bone and places the distractor device. In cases of craniosynostosis, the surgeon will use the existing suture line as a guide to place the distractor. A distractor comes in different forms and sizes and can be external or internal; it is chosen depending on the type of deformity. This ends phase one of CDO.\n*   **Latency Phase-** This is a waiting period for the broken bone to begin to heal; a soft callus (a type of soft bone) forms during this time. This phase can last from 24 hours to 5 days after phase 1.\n*   **Active Distraction Phase-** The distractor placed in phase one is activated in this phase. It gently pulls the soft callus by applying traction at intervals in the desired direction, leading to osteogenesis. The activation is done twice per day for a few weeks.\n*   **Consolidation Phase-**The soft callus pulled during the distraction phase is now left in place to mineralize, remodel and mature into an ossified bone. During this phase, the distractor is kept in place to provide rigid fixation of the bony fragments. Once the consolidation phase is over, the distractor device is removed.\n\n【19】The surgeon will always extend the deformed bone beyond the normal measurements in account of relapse, which will happen in almost all bone remodeling procedures. Although the phases mentioned above outline the underlying principle of CDO, the interdisciplinary team managing the patient will always customize CDO depending on individual needs.\n\n【20】**What Are the Complications of CDO?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【21】The following are a few complications associated with CDO:\n\n【22】*   **Device Failure-** This rarely happens when the distractor device breaks; the location of the distraction plays an important role in the device failure.\n*   **Device Extrusion-** Also a rare complication, happens when the orthodontic forces (force applied by the teeth) exceed orthopedic forces (force applied by the bone). This will result in the movement of the device by the bone instead of the device moving the bone.\n*   **Relapse-** This happens more often than other complications, especially in the mandible. This is why the distraction is always done in excess to compensate for the reduction during relapse.\n*   **Injury to the Tooth Buds**\\- Thishappens when osteotomy extends beyond the cortical (outer) part of the bone in the mandible and maxilla and can be avoided with proper planning and 3D imaging.\n*   **Malocclusion-** This is more of a consequence rather than a complication because patients with mandibular and midface dysplasia already have distorted teeth; CDO only improves the size of the bone in which the distorted teeth are present; it does not align the teeth. Orthodontic treatment is essential for these patients after CDO.\n*   **Nerve Injury-** This happens in the mandible because the preferred site of osteotomy is at the angle (junction between the lower border of the ramus and the inferior border of the body) of the mandible, which is where the inferior alveolar nerve passes through.\n*   **Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak**\\- Extremely rare and can occur during cranial vault (skull) expansion.\n*   **Scarring**\\- Is seen when external distraction devices are used and can be minimized by placing tension-free sutures after the device placement.\n*   **Infection-** Can be prevented by prescribing prophylactic pre and post-op antibiotics.\n\n【23】**Conclusion-**\n\n【24】Managing genetic abnormalities with congenital defects requires an interdisciplinary team of craniofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, plastic surgeons, dentists, geneticists, physical therapists, etc. The success of CDO depends on all of them. Preoperative assessment with computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for treatment planning. CDO is a well-tolerated procedure, and with a standardized postoperative pathway, it can improve the patient's overall well-being.\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>*   Craniofacial Distraction Osteogenesis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560915/\n*   Distraction Osteogenesis in Oral and Craniomaxillofacial Reconstructive Surgery  \n    https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/63547\n*   Versatility of Distraction Osteogenesis for the Craniofacial Skeleton  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26999694/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor is a kind of rhabdoid tumor (RT) that affects the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n【2】A rhabdoid tumor (RT) is most commonly seen in infancy or childhood. Most of the time, the early symptoms are caused by the compressive effects of a large tumor, such as respiratory distress, abdominal mass, and peripheral nerve palsy.\n\n【3】What Is the Etiology of Rhabdoid Tumor?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】The etiology is unknown in most cases of rhabdoid tumor (RT); however, a change in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of a gene called SMARCB1 may play a role in the growth of this tumor. Scientists are attempting to understand how this occurs to develop novel therapies.\n\n【5】In around 90 % of instances, it is caused by a genetic mutation in the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1. In addition, a genetic mutation in the SMARCA4 gene may cause it in rare situations.\n\n【6】What Is the Occurrence of Rhabdoid Tumor?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】Rhabdoid tumors are rare. According to some research, fewer than one person in a million has this form of uncommon tumor. It is most frequent in babies between 11 to 18 months. A rhabdoid tumor is a form of tumor composed of several giant cells. Some rhabdoid tumors can develop in the brain and be atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.\n\n【8】They often grow in the kidneys and other soft tissues, such as the muscles linked to the skeleton's bones. Extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), refers to rhabdoid tumors that develop outside the brain. Rhabdoid tumors increase rapidly and spread to other regions of the body.\n\n【9】How Is Rhabdoid Tumor Classified?\n---------------------------------\n\n【10】Rhabdoid tumors are classified as follows:\n\n【11】1.  **Atypical Teratoid or Rhabdoid Tumors -** Tumors present in the central nervous system.\n\n【12】2.  **Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors -** Tumors present in the other parts of the body.\n\n【13】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Rhabdoid Tumor?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】A clinician utilizes the symptoms of the rhabdoid tumor to make a diagnosis. The rhabdoid tumor symptoms include:\n\n【15】*   A lump in the abdomen.\n\n【16】*   Crankiness and irritated infant.\n\n【17】*   Urinary incontinence.\n\n【18】*   Blood in the urine.\n\n【19】*   Fever.\n\n【20】*   Vomiting and nausea.\n\n【21】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【22】*   Reduced activity level.\n\n【23】*   Lack of coordination or difficulty walking.\n\n【24】*   Increase in the size of the head.\n\n【25】What Are the Risk Factors for Rhabdoid Tumor?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【26】A risk factor increases the chances of rhabdoid tumors compared to individuals without the risk factors. Certain risk factors are more significant than others. Furthermore, the absence of a risk factor does not rule out the possibility of developing the illness. Rhabdoid Tumor risk factors include:\n\n【27】*   **The Child's Age:** Newborns and very young children are frequently affected.\n\n【28】*   **Prevalence:** Boys are at a more significant risk than girls.\n\n【29】*   **Hereditary Predisposition:** Close family members with rhabdoid tumors or other brain tumors.\n\n【30】How Is Rhabdoid Tumor Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【31】Diagnostic techniques for the rhabdoid tumor are employed to detect and determine whether cancer has spread. In addition, the histologic test is also used to confirm the diagnosis of rhabdoid tumors. The following tests help diagnose rhabdoid tumor:\n\n【32】*   Examinations of the blood.\n\n【33】*   Complete blood cell count.\n\n【34】*   Calcium in the blood.\n\n【35】*   Urine analysis.\n\n【36】*   Imaging.\n\n【37】*   Computed tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【38】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【39】*   Ultrasound.\n\n【40】*   Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n【41】*   Biopsy.\n\n【42】*   SMARCB1 gene testing.\n\n【43】What Is the Treatment for Rhabdoid Tumor?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【44】A combination of therapies is used to treat rhabdoid tumors as it is more effective than using a single treatment alone in destroying tumor cells.\n\n【45】**Surgery**\\- Rhabdoid central nervous system tumors are diagnosed and treated surgically. Even if all visible cancer at the surgery is eliminated, most people are also given chemotherapy and maybe radiation therapy to eradicate any remaining cancer cells. In addition, adjuvant therapy is a treatment provided after surgery to reduce the probability of cancer returning. This procedure removes as much cancer as feasible. Sometimes the entire tumor is removed in total.\n\n【46】**Radiation Therapy**\\- Radiation therapy kills tumor cells while shrinking the tumor. The type of tumor being treated determines the radiation treatment used and whether it has spread. External radiation is used to treat the brain and spinal cord. As radiation therapy might impact growth and brain development in young children, especially those aged three and under, the dose is lowered than in older children.\n\n【47】**High-Dose Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant**\\- High-dose chemotherapy employs chemotherapeutic medications to kill tumor cells that are quickly growing. However, there are always side effects to chemotherapy. Large-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a technique for administering high doses of chemotherapy while also replenishing blood-forming cells damaged by cancer treatment. Stem cells are immature blood cells extracted from the person’s or donor's blood or bone marrow and then frozen and kept. After the treatment, the stored stem cells are thawed and infused back into the patient. These reinfused stem cells develop into and replenish blood cells in the body.\n\n【48】**Targeted Therapy**\\- is medicine or substance used to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies are less likely to harm normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The use of targeted therapy in treating recurring rhabdoid tumors is beneficial.\n\n【49】**What Are the Side Effects of Treatment?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Side effects of cancer treatment may occur during or after treatment and last for months or years. Cancer therapy may have the following long-term effects:\n\n【51】*   Physical issues.\n\n【52】*   Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\n\n【53】*   New types of cancer.\n\n【54】Some late consequences are treatable or controllable. It is critical to speak with the doctors about the impact of cancer therapy on the child.\n\n【55】What Is the Prognosis of Rhabdoid Tumor?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【56】Prognosis assesses the outcome of the treatment and is determined by a variety of circumstances, including:\n\n【57】*   The location of the tumor.\n\n【58】*   The spread of cancer to other organs.\n\n【59】*   The amount of tumor left after surgery.\n\n【60】Children with rhabdoid tumors have an extremely dismal prognosis. Although there are a few cases of long-term survival, most children survive only a few years. However, children diagnosed after two have a better prognosis than those diagnosed before.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Rhabdoid tumors are rare malignant tumors of soft tissue, the brain, and the kidney. They can affect older children and adults but mainly children under three. Rhabdoid tumors can develop anywhere in the brain or spinal cord but are most frequently seen in the cerebellum or brainstem. They often spread throughout the central nervous system, are of high grade, and tend to expand. Rhabdoid tumors that have returned after therapy are referred to as recurrent tumors. Thus, early management of symptoms and treatment is necessary.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   Reclassification of rhabdoid tumor and pediatric undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma with complete loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein expression: three subtypes of rhabdoid tumor according to their histological features  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27338635/\n*   Extra-Cranial Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-soft-tissue-tumors/extra-cranial-rhabdoid-tumor\n*   Rhabdoid tumor  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7572/rhabdoid-tumor/diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical excision is the only cancer treatment. Radiotherapy generates high energy, which has few side effects. The rife machine generates a low frequency, and supporters suggest that rife machines can cure cancer.\n\n【2】Royal Raymond Rife invented the Rife machine. The rife machine produces electromagnetic energy waves, similar to radio waves. The information is circulated on the internet that rife machines can cure cancer, but no evidence supports this. The Rife machine uses electromagnetic waves. Some studies suggest that the same frequency is used to cure cancer. With the development of technology, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of all types have become commonplace in our daily lives, including the radio frequency of cell phones, the low frequency of power lines, and even the natural frequency of the earth's magnetic field. Humans, animals, and plants are benefited from low frequency. Therefore, EMFs have generated attention to their benefits. In addition, several studies suggest that EMF exposure can be used as a non-thermal cancer treatment.\n\n【3】What Is Rife Machine?\n---------------------\n\n【4】In 1920, Royal Raymond Rife invented the rife machine. Royal Raymond Rife created exceptional microscopes in the 1920s and 1930s. He claimed that by using them, he could view living microorganisms, such as viruses, that are too small to be seen with any other technology. Raymond Rife claims that he can see these microorganisms by the hue of the auras that the machines vibrate out. Many of his microscopes are still in use. His ideas and purposes have never been proven and hence it is not used practically. Raymond Rife continued to expect to relate that the microbes he was observing were connected to human diseases like cancer. He invented a device which is called the Rife machine. According to him, rife machines could inject radio frequency radiation into humans and cause these bacteria to vibrate at a mortal oscillatory rate, killing them and curing the ailment they were causing.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>Role of Bnp (Blood Test) In Cardiovascular Diseases</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>T-Cell Disorders - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Cancer Stem Cells - Roles and Functions</u>\n\n【10】The Rife machine is the frequency generator that is claimed to cure cancer. Rife machines generate a low frequency that is electromagnetic frequency. Rife machines have a much lower frequency than radiotherapy and x-ray, which are used in cancer treatment. Cancer cells have an electromagnetic frequency of their own. Rife machines generate similar frequencies to kill cancerous cells. Studies and research are going on to find relevant evidence in support of the Rife machines.\n\n【11】How Rife Machines Are Used?\n---------------------------\n\n【12】Rife machines generate low electric frequency, which can be delivered to the body. There is an electric pad attached to the machine. These electric pads are given to the patient’s hands and feet, and thus patient delivers electric impulses generated through the rife machine. Rife machines are used several times a week and a few minutes a day. One study found that by this method, the growth of cancerous cells is prevented without affecting the normal cell. All these experiments are done in the lab and not experiment on humans under reliable resources.\n\n【13】How Can Rife Machines Cure Cancer?\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Rife machines use electromagnetic waves (EMFs), which have a similar frequency to cancerous cells.\n\n【15】*   Studies are increasingly focusing on how EMS affects biological processes such as cell growth, modification inside membrane potential, cell growth, activation of various enzymes, and deoxyribonucleic (DNA) expression.\n\n【16】*   According to several of these research studies, EMF can increase bone and stem cell (new growing cell) growth. Studies have shown that low-frequency ranges of less than 300 Hz of EMF can hinder the growth of some cancer cells. EMF exposure can be used as a non-thermal cancer treatment.\n\n【17】*   According to earlier studies, EMF impacts are linked to the effect of cell metabolism (the process of a chemical reaction that takes inside the cell is important for maintaining cell life is called metabolism).\n\n【18】*   According to several studies, EMF impacts are caused by a non-specific mechanism, such as altered cell activity and the encouragement of DNA (genetic) damage.\n\n【19】*   Several lab experiments consider the possibility that EMF exposure can increase the ion influx via voltage-gated channels (channels inside the cell that allow the entry and exit of ions). Exposure to EMF can alter the cell concentration of significant ions, such as calcium, which alter the metabolic rate of biological processes.\n\n【20】*   EMF has been discovered to usually have an impact on biological processes, but they have also been demonstrated to have different impacts on different cell types.\n\n【21】*   Researchers are trying to find out the possibility that EMF can slow the growth of cancer cells. However, the majority of the research only considers a single frequency at a time to assess how EMF affects biological function. Fewer studies examined the impact of EMF on the biological process and tissues, especially in unique frequency types.\n\n【22】What Are the Side Effects of Rife Machines?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】There are no any side-effects reported as such. Rife machines did not harm the cells as they generated low frequency. The frequency of cell phones is higher than that. According to cancer research UK, skin rashes and electric shocks are a few side effects of the rife machine. The benefits are more than the side effects of the rife machines. The traditional beliefs may harm the cancer patient by creating hindrances in opting the alternative treatment. The effectiveness and benefits of rife machines are not proven by studies. Alternative treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are reliable treatments for cancer. Patients can save their lives by opting for alternative treatments.\n\n【24】How Much Do Rife Machines Costs?\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】Rife machines are expensive. The cost of rife machines may range from hundreds to 1695 Dollars.\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】According to several studies and findings, EMF has a low frequency, which can successfully stop the growth of cancer cells. EMFs reduce cancer cell life span by sending various signals, including single frequency and mixed frequency. There are no published clinical trials or case reports of the Rife Machine usage. Neither benefits nor side effects are supported by relevant evidence. All data related to rife machines are unproven, and hence it is not in practical use. Ongoing trials and experiments are needed to prove the usage of the rife machines and facilitate the use of Rife machines if it is effective for cancer patients. Patients with cancer should opt for alternative treatments other than rife machines as the benefits of Rife machines are not supported by reliable evidence.\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- Effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on B16F10 cancer cells  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30889982/\n*   Cancer research UK- https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer\n*   NIH- ALSUntangled no. 23: the Rife machine and retroviruses  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24219300/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Inversion at the subtalar joint is vital for maintaining balance and stability on uneven surfaces.\n\n【5】*   **Eversion:** In this movement, the foot is outward or away from the midline of the body. This movement occurs when the ankle is turned so that the foot's sole faces outward. Eversion at the subtalar joint is essential for adapting to uneven surfaces and maintaining balance during weight-bearing activities.\n\n【6】Other than this, the subtalar joint also allows for some degree of rotation. This is important for proper foot and ankle mechanics during gait. However, this rotational movement is less significant than inversion and eversion in terms of its impact on the overall foot and ankle function.\n\n【7】What Are the Functions of Subtalar Joint?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【8】The subtalar joint has many important functions:\n\n【9】*   **Articulation Between Foot and Leg:** This joint serves as an important link between the foot and the leg, allowing for movement and stability in the ankle and foot complex.\n\n【10】*   **Shock Absorption:** The subtalar joint helps to absorb shock during weight-bearing activities such as walking, running, and jumping. The joint allows for a certain amount of movement and flexibility in the foot, which helps to reduce the impact of these activities on the bones, muscles, and other structures in the ankle and foot.\n\n【11】*   **Stability:** The subtalar joint plays an important role in the stability of the ankle and foot. It allows for controlled inward and outward movement of the foot, which helps to maintain balance and prevent injuries such as ankle sprains.\n\n【12】*   **Propulsion:** The subtalar joint is involved in the propulsion phase of gait, which is when the foot pushes off the ground to move forward. During this phase, the subtalar joint helps to transfer the weight of the body from the heel to the ball of the foot.\n\n【13】*   **Compensation for Ankle Dysfunction:** In some cases where there is dysfunction or injury to the ankle joint itself, the subtalar joint can compensate by allowing for increased movement and flexibility. This helps to maintain overall foot and ankle function and reduce the risk of further injury.\n\n【14】*   **Proprioception:** Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position and movements in space. The subtalar joint contains sensory receptors that provide feedback to the brain about the position and movement of the foot and ankle. This information is important for maintaining balance and coordination during movement.\n\n【15】*   **Adaptation to Uneven Terrain:** The subtalar joint helps the foot adapt to uneven surfaces by allowing for movement and flexibility. This is important for maintaining balance and stability on rough or uneven terrain.\n\n【16】*   **Distribution of Forces:** The subtalar joint helps to distribute forces across the foot and ankle during weight-bearing activities. By allowing for controlled movement and flexibility, the joint helps to reduce the stress on specific structures in the ankle and foot, such as the bones and tendons.\n\n【17】Overall, the subtalar joint is an important component of the ankle and foot complex, with a range of functions that contribute to normal gait, balance, and stability during weight-bearing activities.\n\n【18】What Are the Causes of the Subtalar Joint Pain?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   **Ankle Sprains:** Ankle sprains are a common cause of subtalar joint pain. When the ankle is sprained, the ligaments that support the subtalar joint can become stretched or torn, leading to pain and instability in the joint.\n\n【20】*   **Arthritis:** It is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the joints. Subtalar joint arthritis can result from wear and tear over time or from an autoimmune condition such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【21】*   **Tarsal Coalition:** Tarsal coalition is a condition where two or more bones in the foot become fused together. This leads to pain and limited mobility in the subtalar joint.\n\n【22】*   **Subtalar Joint Dislocation:** A dislocation of the subtalar joint can occur as a result of trauma, such as a car accident or sports injury. This can cause severe pain and instability in the joint.\n\n【23】*   **Overuse Injuries:** Repetitive strain on the subtalar joint because of some activities such as running or jumping can lead to inflammation and pain in the joint.\n\n【24】*   **Fractures:** Fractures of the talus or calcaneus bones, which form the subtalar joint, can cause pain and instability in the joint.\n\n【25】*   **Osteochondritis Dissecans:** This is a condition where a piece of cartilage and bone becomes detached from the joint surface, leading to pain and limited mobility in the subtalar joint.\n\n【26】*   **Gout:** It is a type of arthritis caused by uric acid crystals accumulation in the joints. Subtalar joint gout can cause severe pain and inflammation in the joint.\n\n【27】*   **Infections:** Infections can cause inflammation and pain in the subtalar joint. This results in a bacterial or fungal infection or as a complication of surgery.\n\n【28】*   **Nerve Compression:** Compression of the nerves that supply the subtalar joint can lead to pain and other symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in the foot and ankle.\n\n【29】*   **Abnormal Foot Mechanics:** Abnormal foot mechanics, such as flat feet or high arches, can cause excessive stress on the subtalar joint and lead to pain and instability in the joint.\n\n【30】*   **Poor Footwear:** Wearing shoes with improper fit or inadequate support can also contribute to subtalar joint pain. It is caused by excessive stress on the joint during weight-bearing activities.\n\n【31】Overall, there are many potential causes of subtalar joint pain, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.\n\n【32】What Are the Treatment Options?\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】There are a wide number of treatment options available, although it is best to seek professional advice before taking any treatment for joint pain.\n\n【34】**Home Remedies:**\n\n【35】*   **Rest:** Resting the affected foot and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain can help to reduce inflammation and promote healing.\n\n【36】*   **Ice Therapy:** Ice therapy on the affected area can help to reduce pain and inflammation. Ice can be applied for 15 to 20 minutes at a time and several times per day.\n\n【37】*   **Compression:** Compression with an elastic bandage or wrap can help to reduce swelling and provide support to the affected joint.\n\n【38】*   **Elevation:** Elevating the affected foot above the heart level can help to reduce swelling and promote healing.\n\n【39】*   **Over-the-counter Pain Medications:** Over-the-counter pain medications such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen can help to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\n\n【40】**Medical Treatments:**\n\n【41】*   **Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy aids in improving the range of motion, strengthening muscles that support the affected joint, and reducing pain and inflammation.\n\n【42】*   **Corticosteroid Injections:** Corticosteroid injections can be used to reduce inflammation and relieve pain in the subtalar joint.\n\n【43】*   **Orthotics:** Orthotic devices such as shoe inserts or custom-made braces can help to support the affected joint and improve foot mechanics.\n\n【44】*   **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** Prescription-strength NSAIDs can help to reduce pain and inflammation in the subtalar joint.\n\n【45】**Surgical Treatments:**\n\n【46】*   **Arthroscopy:** This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that can be used to remove damaged tissue or repair ligaments in the subtalar joint.\n\n【47】*   **Fusion:** Subtalar joint fusion involves permanently fusing the talus and calcaneus bones together to eliminate movement in the joint and reduce pain.\n\n【48】*   **Joint Replacement:** In severe cases of subtalar joint damage, joint replacement surgery may be necessary to replace the damaged joint with an artificial joint.\n\n【49】It is important to note that treatment options will depend on the underlying cause of the subtalar joint pain, as well as individual factors such as age, activity level, and overall health. A healthcare professional can help to determine the most appropriate treatment approach for each individual case.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】In conclusion, the subtalar joint may be a small and often overlooked part of the foot, but its importance cannot be understated. Whether one is a ballet dancer or a couch potato, taking care of the subtalar joint is crucial for maintaining a healthy and pain-free foot. Give the feet the love and attention they deserve.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Subtalar Impingement Syndrome  \n    https://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/care-near-you/northern-california/santarosa/departments/foot-ankle-surgery/foot-and-ankle-surgery/subtalar-impingement-syndrome/\n*   WHAT IS SUBTALAR ARTHROSCOPY?  \n    https://www.footcaremd.org/conditions-treatments/ankle/subtalar-arthroscopy</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This condition is believed to be brought on by the skin's blood vessels becoming permanently constricted and losing pigment due to being overly sensitive to chemicals like epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\n【2】According to dermatology research, nevus anemicus is present in one to two percent of control groups. However, the prevalence may be higher since it can be challenging to identify the condition's subtle symptoms, particularly in people with lighter skin. Additionally, females are slightly more likely than males to develop nevus anemicus.\n\n【3】What Is Nevus Anemicus?\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Nevus anemicus is a rare capillary vascular anomaly that manifests as a light-colored patch on the skin at birth. This happens as a result of increased catecholamine sensitivity, which causes the blood vessels in that area to constrict. Vorner first recognized this uncommon condition back in 1906.\n\n【5】What Causes Nevus Anemicus?\n---------------------------\n\n【6】Nevus anemicus typically manifests as a single skin patch without other associated symptoms. The hypopigmented patches seen in nevus anemicus are caused by vasoconstriction of the blood vessels. These blood vessels are highly sensitive to circulating catecholamines like noradrenaline and adrenaline, which interact with alpha-adrenergic receptors and cause constriction. Nevus anemicus has also been referred to as a \"pharmacologic nevus\" because of its sensitivity to catecholamines.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Does inhalation of Prednisone cause alteration in thyroid hormones?</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Should I consult a doctor for ADHD?</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Can Levothyroxine be taken along with MAO inhibitor?</u>\n\n【12】The disorder is considered a mosaic disorder brought on by mutations following fertilization. Interestingly, nevus anemicus appears resistant to dermatophyte infections like Trichophyton rubrum. This may be because the affected skin has less blood flow and a lower core temperature. Because they lack expression of specific molecules which attract T lymphocytes responsible for the inflammation of contact dermatitis, nevus anemicus lesions may also be spared by generalized contact dermatitis. These proteins include HLA-DR, epidermal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and endothelial E-selectin.\n\n【13】Whether isolated nevus anemicus lesions have a genetic component is not yet known. However, some genetic syndromes have been linked to this condition, including neurofibromatosis type I and types II to IV of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis. All forms of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis have the distinctive port wine stain, while types II and IV also have Mongolian spots, nevus spilus, and type III only has nevus spilus.\n\n【14】Nevus anemicus tends to appear earlier (around ten years of age) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 than in those without (around 17 years of age), though it does not increase the likelihood of other neurofibromatosis type 1-related conditions like optic gliomas.\n\n【15】Legius syndrome does not have nevus anemicus, even though it resembles neurofibromatosis type 1 due to the presence of cafe-au-lait (coffee-milk like) macules and intertriginous freckling. Rare reports have also linked nevus anemicus to Becker nevus and telangiectatic nevus, exhibiting abnormal vasodilation.\n\n【16】What Are the Clinical Features of Nevus Anemicus?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Nevus anemicus is characterized by hypopigmented patches with a clear border that appears at birth. These patches tend to be asymptomatic and can be found on the upper trunk, but they can also be found on the face and limbs. Nevus anemicus does not affect hair distribution, sweat production, or skin sensation. It does not turn erythematous on rubbing the lesion.\n\n【18】These patches are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in size. Still, in certain instances, they can be large enough to cover significant areas of the trunk, referred to as \"giant nevus anemicus.\" These patches may contain areas of normal skin within the lesion and smaller hypopigmented patches around the lesion. Lesions can also appear as linear or coalescing macules that resemble grape clusters.\n\n【19】How Is Nevus Anemicus Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【20】Since there are no definitive histopathologic features that distinguish nevus anemicus from other skin conditions, the diagnosis is heavily reliant on the patient's medical history and physical examination. It is important to note that nevus anemicus appears at birth, whereas other depigmented conditions, such as vitiligo (chronic skin condition characterized by loss of skin color), appear later in life.\n\n【21】*   One feature of nevus anemicus is the absence of reactive erythema in response to stimuli such as heat, cold, or trauma. This can be tested by rubbing the lesion and surrounding skin or by changing the temperature, which causes the surrounding skin to turn red while the nevus anemicus lesion persists as pale.\n\n【22】*   Diascopy is another diagnostic technique that involves pressing a glass slide against the lesion's border, causing the lesion to blend in with the surrounding skin.\n\n【23】*   The Wood's lamp, which produces UV (ultraviolet) light with a wavelength of 365 nanometers, can help diagnose skin conditions. It does not improve the hypopigmentation of nevus anemicus, but it improves the hypopigmentation and depigmentation of nevus depigmentosus and vitiligo.\n\n【24】*   A skin biopsy can be performed to rule out other hypopigmented or depigmented lesions that would show normal skin, such as vitiligo.\n\n【25】*   Electron microscopy of nevus anemicus reveals normal findings, whereas nevus depigmentosus reveals normal melanocyte numbers but reduced melanization with melanosome aggregation in melanocytes.\n\n【26】*   If tinea versicolor is suspected, lesional skin should be examined with potassium hydroxide (KOH), which reveals the spaghetti and meatballs appearance of Malassezia furfur hyphae and spores.\n\n【27】*   It is important to differentiate nevus depigmentosus from nevus anemicus during clinical examination. Redness occurs after rubbing the skin in nevus depigmentosus. However, erythema does not occur in nevus anemicus.\n\n【28】How Is Nevus Anemicus Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【29】Once diagnosed, nevus anemicus does not need any therapy. Nevus anemicus does not often require treatment because it is asymptomatic and causes no functional impairment. Patients with nevus anemicus who feel self-conscious about their cosmetic appearance, on the other hand, may benefit from camouflage makeup. Camouflage makeup can assist in blending the lesion with the surrounding skin, creating the illusion of a more even skin tone. It is a non-invasive and safe method for improving the appearance of nevus anemicus. Use of good quality cosmetic products can help to camouflage this cutaneous condition on the face.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Nevus anemicus is an uncommon congenital skin condition that causes hypopigmented patches with a distinct border that appears at birth. A thorough history and physical examination, as well as diagnostic tools such as a Wood's lamp, can help to determine the presence of nevus anemicus. While the condition is asymptomatic and does not usually necessitate treatment, patients may have cosmetic concerns due to the appearance of the lesions. Camouflage makeup can help patients bothered by the cosmetic appearance of their lesions.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Nevus Anemicus  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459139/\n*   Clinical Features of Naevus Anaemicus  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/naevus-anaemicus\n*   Nevus Anemicus  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083716/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, certain unsupported beliefs remain persistent even in the presence of contradicting results. The correlation between human milk feeding and obesity is one such domain that is frequently under debate. This article explores some of the truths and myths related to breastfeeding and obesity.\n\n【2】What Is Meant by Human Milk Feeding?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】It is well known that breast milk is an exclusive optimal nutritional source for newborns and babies. Lactation and breastfeeding cover a wide range of benefits such as improved gastrointestinal tolerance, reduced risk of infections, proper availability of nutrients, and so on. It also has positive effects on mothers’ health.\n\n【4】In recent times, the term breast milk is being replaced by “human milk\" which is more appropriate, asexual, and descriptive. Also, the term human milk includes not only breastfed milk but also other forms by which human milk could be fed to babies. Some of the common ways of human milk feeding are as follows -\n\n【5】*   **Direct Breastfeeding** \\- is the conventional method where the baby suckles the milk directly from the mammary glands through the nipple.\n\n【6】*   **Mother’s Own Milk (MOM)** - here human milk is expressed or pumped into bottles and delivered to infants or stored for later use. This practice is commonly followed when mother and baby are separated due to job or career options and other concerns.\n\n【7】*   Mother’s own milk is the best option for preterm or low birth weight babies who are under neonatal intensive care since direct feeding is not possible.\n\n【8】*   **Donor Human Milk (DHM)** -involves milk expression, collection, effective storage, and donation of human milk. It is widely used to feed adopted babies and for infants where breastfeeding is contraindicated (medical illness of the mother).\n\n【9】*   Donor human milk is available in homes, hospitals, and milk banks.\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Obesity?\n-------------------------------\n\n【11】Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by the excessive or increased weight of an individual higher than the normal healthy weight in relation to that individual's age and height. Obesity affects both adults and children. Multiple factors such as eating patterns, reduced physical activity, genetics, and certain medications are responsible for increased weight gain.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Breastfeeding Duration and Female Mortality</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Breastfeeding Techniques - Recommendations, Techniques, and Advantages.</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>Breastfeeding Beyond 12 Months - Benefits, Challenges, and Drawbacks</u>\n\n【17】Obesity among children is still more alarming because overweight and obese children have a higher chance of remaining obese into adulthood also and are at more risk of developing noncommunicable disorders such as diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases at a comparatively younger age.\n\n【18】The widely accepted causes and factors that lead to the development of obesity in both adults, as well as children, are as follows -\n\n【19】*   A negative imbalance between energy intake (food consumption) and expenditure (physical activity).\n\n【20】*   Genetic background of an individual and hormonal imbalance.\n\n【21】*   Sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【22】*   Uncontrolled dietary intake.\n\n【23】*   Diet with high-fat content.\n\n【24】*   Parenting style associated with their lifestyles.\n\n【25】*   Different ways of parental feeding styles such as authoritative feeding, and overfeeding.\n\n【26】*   Increased consumption of fast foods.\n\n【27】*   Sugary beverages and drinks.\n\n【28】*   Salty snacks with high preservative content.\n\n【29】*   Consuming large portions of food increases the threshold for hunger satisfaction thereby resulting in excessive intake of food.\n\n【30】*   Environmental factors like reduced sidewalks or unsafe surroundings where walking is decreased and people prefer to use vehicles even for walkable distances.\n\n【31】*   Psychological factors like stress eating.\n\n【32】What Are the Facts Associated With Human Milk Feeding and Obesity?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Human milk feeding is considered the gold standard method of providing adequate nutrition to newborns where its short-term, as well as long-term benefits, are widely accepted. The term ‘scientific fact’ refers to repeatable validated observations or measurements that result in authentic and reproducible evidence. These facts are frequently based on scientific theories or hypotheses.\n\n【34】Many such facts related to breastfeeding do exist correlating its benefits and its impact on human health. Some of the proven facts about the benefits of breast milk include the prevention of infections, passing on maternal antibodies to the newborn to boost its immunity, and enhancing the psychological wellness of the babies. One of the most important as well as frequently debated facts regarding the health benefit of breastfeeding is its role in the prevention of obesity. The following are some of the proven facts associated with human milk feeding and obesity.\n\n【35】*   Human milk is easily digestible and contains adequate nutrients, hence the baby could be exclusively fed on human milk for the first six months.\n\n【36】*   Breastfed babies are able to self-regulate the amount of food intake according to their filing threshold (positive feedback from the satiety center).\n\n【37】*   Breastfeeding the babies by their hungry cues and the mechanism by which the baby suckles the milk helps in the adequate intake of milk and prevents overfeeding.\n\n【38】*   Through breastmilk, the baby is able to form healthy eating patterns and proper portion size which greatly reduces the risk of developing obesity due to larger portioning and increased intake of food.\n\n【39】*   Early termination of breastfeeding and introduction of formula feeds or solid foods (cereal and jarred baby food) is related to an increased risk of food allergy and a higher chance of becoming overweight leading to childhood obesity.\n\n【40】*   Studies show that overfeeding (even with human milk) during the infancy period leads to an increased tendency of becoming obese in adulthood.\n\n【41】*   Nutritional scientific studies in humans prove that rapid weight gain in the first six weeks of neonatal life is associated with childhood obesity at eight years of age.\n\n【42】*   The prevalence of overweight and obesity is significantly reduced in children who are breastfed for a longer duration.\n\n【43】*   Exclusive breastfeeding has a positive effect on weight loss in breastfeeding mothers which is often attributed to proper hormonal balance and not due to the burning of extra calories.\n\n【44】What Are the Myths Related to Human Milk Feeding and Obesity?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Several beliefs exist interlinking human milk feeding and obesity in the absence of valid supporting scientific evidence. These are known as presumptions where some correlations are noticed but lack research proof. Myths generally refer to certain persistent beliefs despite showing contradicting scientific evidence. Promoting such unsupported beliefs often misleads the scientific community and the public, leading to inaccurate clinical as well as public health information and recommendations.\n\n【46】Some of the commonly persistent myths (fiction) associated with human milk feeding and obesity are as follows -\n\n【47】*   The most common presumption is that breastfeeding prevents obesity. The available reports suggesting that breastfed children have a reduced risk of becoming obese are based on observational studies and are done in small groups as isolated studies.\n\n【48】*   Randomized studies involving a wider population with accurate control of confounding (influencing criteria) factors are needed to validate this hypothesis.\n\n【49】*   Existing data indicates that human milk feeding does not have any direct antiobesity determinant on children but is a potential influencer of eating habits which is indirectly related to obesity.\n\n【50】*   Breastfeeding reduces obesity in lactating mothers is another popular myth.\n\n【51】*   Lactation definitely helps in regulating lactating and ovarian hormones that help in preventing the accumulation of excess fat due to hormonal changes.\n\n【52】*   However, the common belief that breastfeeding burns extra calories and reduces the risk of obesity is not true and is not yet scientifically proven.\n\n【53】*   In fact, more energy is consumed during breastfeeding and hence increases food consumption. Unplanned dietary intake due to hunger stimuli without proper exercise or physical activity could lead to weight gain.\n\n【54】**Conclusion**\n\n【55】There is a huge prevalence of facts and myths interconnecting human milk feeding and obesity among the present population. The use of the Internet for searches about scientific facts and recommendations is exponentially growing. Easy accessibility of unsupported beliefs could mislead the general public resulting in unwanted anxiety and doubts. The scientific community has to be responsible and open in sharing honest medical knowledge and health recommendations and thereby creating a well-informed global society.\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>*   The Impact of Human Milk Feeding on Long-Term Risk of Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486677/\n*   The Impact of Human Milk Feeding on Long-Term Risk of Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1117280/\n*   Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606061/\n*   Childhood obesity: causes and consequences  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408699/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a68e5b77-f5af-4f02-b128-1b245bcc9a6c", "title": "Nutrigenomics: Studying Nature vs Nurture", "text": "【0】Nutrigenomics: Studying Nature vs Nurture\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Nutrigenomics is a research specialty in the nutrition sphere or field that deals with the study and preventive measures of disease processes in the body through gene regulation or expression and dietary interventions.\n\n【2】What Is Nutrigenomics?\n----------------------\n\n【3】Nutrigenomics integrates genomic science with the field of nutrition. This research branch focuses not only on dietary factors but also on lifestyle variables such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, which can act as environmental or self-induced triggers for disease development in individuals. Although genes have a vital role in an individual's systemic health or predisposition, it cannot be fully responsible for disease occurrence in most cases since an individual's nutrition can also modify the extent to which these genes are expressed or modulated.\n\n【4】The scope of nutrigenomics is to study nutrient-based risk factors and their bioavailability to prevent the development of genetic or systemic diseases, including cancer in predisposed individuals. Genes cannot be fully responsible for disease occurrence in most cases since an individual's nutrition can also modify the extent to which these genes are expressed or modulated\n\n【5】The definition of nutrigenomics has recently been expanded to include all nutritional factors that govern or protect the human genome from intrinsic damage. Nutrigenomics primarily focuses on the dietary components consumed from food that affect the human genome. Health experts consider nutrigenomics to be similar to the field of pharmacogenomics, which studies drugs that have a diverse impact on different population groups.\n\n【6】What Is the Nature Versus Nurture Debate?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】In the last decade, significant efforts have been made in nutrition research to understand the etiology of human disease based on an individual's dietary intake. This has led to many experts debating the role of \"nature versus nurture,\" specifically the natural genetics governing an individual versus the food or environmental triggers responsible for health and disease. However, today's biologists believe that neither nature nor nurture alone can fully explain the complex physiological processes governing cellular health and multi-organ system health in humans.\n\n【8】The presence of a particular gene or mutation in predisposed individuals can be linked to a specific disease process. However, whether this genetic predisposition will manifest as a disease depends only on the individual's genome, which has a complex interplay with both environmental and behavioral factors. This understanding that both nature and nurture play equally important roles in the development of diseases has led nutrition experts to adopt a multidisciplinary gene-based approach in the study of health and disease. This area of study has developed into a field known as nutrigenomics.\n\n【9】How Does Diet Affect Health and Immunity?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】Studies conducted on both human and animal models, as well as cell cultures, have established that certain macronutrients, such as fatty acids and proteins, and essential micronutrients, such as vitamins, are important for maintaining body immunity and preserving cellular health.\n\n【11】Fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, and nuts contain naturally occurring bio-reactive compounds such as phytochemicals (flavonoids, carotenoids, coumarins, and phytosterols) that are known to affect gene expression and modulation in diverse ways. Therefore, it can be assumed that an individual's dietary needs have a significant impact on shaping their health and immunity. The micronutrients and bioactive compounds obtained from daily food intake have the following functions which include:\n\n【12】*   Being involved in metabolic reactions.\n\n【13】*   Maintaining hormonal balances.\n\n【14】*   Boosting immune competence, detoxification processes, and removal of waste compounds.\n\n【15】*   The utilization of these nutrients acts as fuel for cells and healthy growth.\n\n【16】*   They act as ligands for transcription factors and thus directly alter gene expression (for example genistein and resveratrol).\n\n【17】*   Influence signal transduction pathways and chromatin structure of DNA (for example choline).\n\n【18】What Are the Diseases That Nutrigenomics Focuses On?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】According to the European Nutrigenomics Organization, most researchers now hypothesize that all of the diseases occurring in the human body would be a result of an imbalance within these four processes which include:\n\n【20】1.  Inflammatory.\n\n【21】2.  Metabolic.\n\n【22】3.  Oxidative.\n\n【23】4.  Psychological.\n\n【24】According to this hypothesis, this process creates cellular stress, and eventually, disease arises as a result of these processes. Moreover, diseases may also occur due to an individual's genetic predisposition to one or more of these four stressors or imbalances.\n\n【25】Nutrigenomics is a field that makes a significant effort to improve understanding of dietary nutrition, environmental factors, and their corresponding genomic interactions.\n\n【26】The main focus of nutrigenomics is on preventive measures that individuals can adopt based on current research, including modifications to lifestyle or diet, to aid in improved health and resistance to disease processes. The focus is on preventing diseases like :\n\n【27】*   Obesity.\n\n【28】*   Diabetes.\n\n【29】*   Aging and systemic diseases related to it.\n\n【30】*   Age-related cognitive disorders.\n\n【31】*   Cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【32】*   Cancers.\n\n【33】*   Inflammatory disorders.\n\n【34】*   Visual or eye-related disorders.\n\n【35】*   Vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n\n【36】What Is the Key to Disease Prevention?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【37】According to nutrigenomics research, eliminating the high-sugar and high-fat diet, also known as the Western diet, is a key measure to prevent a significant portion of diseases globally. Reducing the dietary intake of sugar and fats in one's diet and replacing them with healthier alternatives like organic or natural sugar sources and monounsaturated heart-healthy fats can help prevent the development of central obesity and diabetes to some extent in almost all population groups worldwide.\n\n【38】Nutrigenomics also highlights that the abandonment of traditional diets rich in fiber and plant sources has significantly contributed to the rise of global diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. These diseases are risk factors for increased mortality rates worldwide. For instance, high alcohol consumption and high carbohydrate diets in women can lead to abdominal obesity, which is a common finding in both cases, triggered by their genetic predisposition.\n\n【39】Therefore, irrespective of one's genetic predisposition, it is crucial to prioritize healthy dietary and lifestyle habits. Consulting with a dietitian or nutritionist can help identify the foods that are best suited to an individual's body requirements based on their lifestyle.\n\n【40】**Conclusion:**\n\n【41】The proponents of the research field of nutrigenomics aim to promote the development of healthy dietary habits and can serve as a guide for a healthy lifestyle that is suited best to an individual's genotype or genomic status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Ultrasound-based fetal weight estimation is the most widely practiced technique. So there are different ultrasound-based models developed for fetal weight estimation. The differences in genetic, nutritional, and socioeconomic factors can impact fetal growth, and no single ultrasound-based model is equally applicable to all populations. The fetal weight estimation is essential to eliminate the potential complications that can arise from excessive or low fetal birth weight during delivery.\n\n【2】What Is the Importance of Estimating Fetal Weight?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Both low and excessive fetal weight at delivery is linked with an increased risk of newborn complications during labor. Complications associated with different birth weights are as follows:\n\n【4】*   The complications associated with low birth weight are fetal prematurity. It can also arise due to intrauterine growth restriction.\n\n【5】*   The complications associated with large babies can be shoulder dystocia (when baby’s shoulders get stuck inside the pelvis during birth), bony injuries, brachial plexus injuries, metabolic abnormalities (such as low calcium and blood sugar), higher hemoglobin levels, various congenital abnormalities, jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin), intrapartum asphyxia.\n\n【6】*   Almost one-third of large babies have feeding difficulties during an initial period.\n\n【7】*   Mothers also get injuries if the baby is large; the potential damage for the mothers can include birth canal injuries, postpartum hemorrhage, and pelvic floor injury damage. So by estimating the fetal weight, proper management of the complication can be planned ahead of time.\n\n【8】If the estimated weight suggests that a baby is big for its gestation period, then the doctors plan a scheduled cesarean or an induction. If a baby is estimated to weigh ten pounds or more, it is known as macrosomia, and this condition needs a C-section. The primary concern with the vaginal delivery of a big baby is shoulder dystocia. This can happen when the baby gets stuck in the birth canal and which can lead to damage to the shoulder nerve and arm. Shoulder dystocia can lead to permanent paralysis of the baby's arm muscles and injury to the mother.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Will receiving an injection during a second pregnancy of an Rh-positive mother harm the baby?</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Acute Appendicitis Secondary to Kaposi’s Sarcoma - An Overview</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Kidney disease and Pregnancy</u>\n\n【14】What Factors Can Affect the Birth Weight of the Babies?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The birth weight of the babies can be influenced by several factors that are:\n\n【16】**Large Babies:** A fetus can be born large when the mother is overweight or the parents are large. The following complications can occur when the baby is big:\n\n【17】*   If the pregnancy lasts longer than forty-two weeks.\n\n【18】*   Abnormalities in fetal chromosomes.\n\n【19】*   If the mother gets diabetes before or during pregnancy.\n\n【20】*   Mothers gain a substantial amount of weight during pregnancy.\n\n【21】*   If the growth of the fetus is overstimulated in the uterus.\n\n【22】*   The mother's ethnicity.\n\n【23】*   Having a boy.\n\n【24】**Small Babies:** A baby may be born small due to the following reasons:\n\n【25】*   Preterm birth (born before the estimated due date).\n\n【26】*   Born to too small parents.\n\n【27】*   The mother's ethnicity.\n\n【28】*   Abnormalities in fetal chromosomes.\n\n【29】*   Chronic diseases in mothers such as heart, kidney disease, or high blood pressure.\n\n【30】*   Malnutrition.\n\n【31】*   Substance abuse during pregnancy.\n\n【32】When Is the Fetal Weight Calculated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【33】The baby's weight is calculated along the ultrasound done during the 20 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and this scan is also called morphology ultrasound. This is performed by a sonographer. This milestone scan is strongly recommended as this checks for both a detailed assessment of any abnormalities and the baby's weight.\n\n【34】How Is the Weight of the Baby Measured Through Ultrasound?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】During the ultrasounds, the sonographer or a specialist will determine the baby's weight in the mother's uterus. The specialist can use many types of parameters to estimate the baby's weight. Head circumference (HC), biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) are the most commonly used parameters. The specialist uses the combination of the measurements mentioned above in a formula to calculate the fetus's weight and size.\n\n【36】*   **Biparietal Diameter -** This is the distance between the sides of the fetus's head. The biparietal diameter can be different for different babies that weigh the same. So, this measurement is not always reliable at the later stage of pregnancy.\n\n【37】*   **Head Circumference** - This measures the circumference of the fetus's head.\n\n【38】*   **Abdominal Circumference** \\- This measures the circumference of the fetus's abdomen. This measurement is achieved by measuring the distance between the top of the mother's belly and pubic bone with a measuring tape.\n\n【39】*   **Femur Length** \\- This is measured by the length of the longest bone (upper thigh bone). It can differ in babies of different weights, so this measurement collected cannot always be reliable.\n\n【40】What Is Fundus Height?\n----------------------\n\n【41】The symphysis-fundal height (SFH) is a measurement of the mother's abdomen used to assess the baby's growth. Using a simple tape, the measurement from the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus is taken. The measurements are taken in centimeters. Normally, the measurement of the fundus length should be the number of weeks of pregnancy. There is an allowance of two centimeters in either direction. For example, if a woman is 26 weeks pregnant, then the fundus length should measure between 24 and 28 cm. The health care professionals can measure the fundal height between 24 and 36 to 37 weeks.\n\n【42】If there is a variation of three centimeters or more, the doctor will perform an ultrasound scan to check the amount of amniotic fluid and the baby's growth. If there is any problem detected in the scan, then the scan will be done every two weeks to analyze growth patterns over time. If a woman is obese, if there are large uterine fibroids, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets), the only accurate way to measure the growth of the fetus is by ultrasound.\n\n【43】How Accurate Is Ultrasound Measurement?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【44】There are many different formulae for estimating fetal weight. It is essential to know there is a recognized 15 percent error in fetal weight estimation through ultrasound. This means the baby can be either 15 percent larger or 15 percent smaller than the estimated weight provided by the ultrasound. Ultrasound scans are usually more accurate for assessing the size of the baby during the first half of pregnancy. But as babies develop, they can grow faster.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Estimation of the fetal weight is done during the 20 to 22 weeks of pregnancy and even at the end of the third trimester. This helps the health care professionals to know the size and weight of the baby. The ultrasound measurements are mostly accurate. This helps the doctors to plan the treatment accordingly.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Tracking Your Baby's Weight and Measurements  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Tracking-Your-Babys-Weight-and-Measurements.aspx\n*   Birth weight and longitudinal growth in infants born below 32?weeks’ gestation: a UK population study  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888637/\n*   Ultrasound versus Clinical Examination to Estimate Fetal Weight at Term  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383430/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2f69077d-25b4-44f3-b499-ff7fe434fb04", "title": "Rheumatic Lung Disease", "text": "【0】**Introduction.**\n\n【1】Rheumatic diseases are autoimmune, inflammatory disease conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the healthy cells and tissues of the body. It mainly affects the joints, bones, and muscles, and the progression of the disease can affect internal organs - such as the lungs.\n\n【2】What Causes Rheumatoid Lung Disease?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Studies suggest that the high fatality rate among rheumatic individuals could be because of the breathing difficulties they experience. The exact cause of the deterioration in lung health is not known. However, most studies claim medications (such as Methotrexate) to be a possibility, as they can cause side effects, make individuals vulnerable to infections, or even cause toxicity that may affect the lungs.\n\n【4】Who Is at Risk of Developing Rheumatoid Lung Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Rheumatic diseases may progress and affect the lungs in some individuals. However, one may be at higher risk of the lungs getting affected in the presence of certain factors, such as:\n\n【6】*   A habit of smoking.\n\n【7】*   Severe rheumatoid disease condition.\n\n【8】*   Long-standing rheumatoid diseases.\n\n【9】*   Gender - Male.\n\n【10】*   Aged individuals.\n\n【11】*   Genetic factors.\n\n【12】What Are the Types of Rheumatoid Lung Disease?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Rheumatoid lung diseases include various forms that affect the lung parenchyma, pleura, airways, or vasculature and subsequently affect lung health. Some rheumatoid lung conditions are as follows:\n\n【14】1.  **Interstitial lung disease (ILD) -** This is the most common form of rheumatoid lung disease. Interstitial lung disease causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, and around the lung's air sacs and affects lung health. Interstitial lung disease causes breathing difficulties, chronic dry cough, weakness, and fatigue. Interstitial lung disease causes serious pulmonary complications in individuals with rheumatoid disease. Studies have shown that interstitial lung disease is responsible for mortality and morbidity among rheumatic individuals.\n\n【15】2.  **Bronchiectasis -** Bronchiectasis is a condition where the airway of the lungs widens. Widening of the airways causes mucus build-up which makes the individual more susceptible to infections and inflammations. Bronchiectasis individuals suffer from shortness of breath, weakness, fatigue, and a chronic dry cough.\n\n【16】3.  **Pleural Effusion -** This occurs when excess fluid accumulates in the pleural space (the space between the lung and chest wall). The tissue around the lungs can become inflamed, which can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. Pleural effusion of small areas is usually unnoticed and resolves on its own, however larger pleural effusion needs attention and treatment as it can cause shortness of breath along with pain, and fever in some individuals.\n\n【17】4.  **Pulmonary Nodules -** Pulmonary nodules are rounded abnormal growth found on the lungs that can be benign or malignant. The nodules may range in size and individuals may have single or multiple lung nodules present. The nodules are usually harmless and show no signs or symptoms of lung disease. However, if the nodule ruptures (rarely) it could cause pneumothorax (air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall).\n\n【18】5.  **Pulmonary Hypertension -** Pulmonary hypertension is a condition when the blood pressure in the blood vessels running from the lungs to the heart is high. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to heart failure.\n\n【19】How to Diagnose Rheumatic Lung Disease?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【20】A medical history of rheumatic disease, a physical examination, and a few tests can confirm the diagnosis of rheumatic lung disease. The tests required are as follows:\n\n【21】*   **Chest X-ray -** To examine lung health and detect the presence of air around the lung tissue, infection, or cancer.\n\n【22】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan -** CT scan of the chest is recommended to check for scarring of the lung tissue.\n\n【23】*   **Echocardiogram -** To check for pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【24】*   **Biopsy -** Biopsy is done to check for the presence of lung malignancies or the nature of lung nodules (if benign or malignant).\n\n【25】*   **Lung Function Tests -** To determine the impairment of the lungs by measuring the lung capacity, the volume of air in the lungs, and how much oxygen passes into the bloodstream.\n\n【26】*   **Thoracentesis -** Thoracentesis is a procedure to check for the presence of fluid or air around the lungs and remove it using a thin needle inserted through the chest wall into the lung space (pleural space).\n\n【27】*   **Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis -** Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein show the presence of inflammation as in the case of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【28】How to Treat Rheumatoid Lung Disease?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【29】The treatment of rheumatoid lung disease depends on the type and severity of the disease. The prime goal of the treatment modality is to reduce inflammation and prevent or slow down the progression of lung damage, as reversing any existing lung damage is not possible. Some of the common treatments for rheumatoid lung disease are as follows:\n\n【30】1.  **Medications -** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen), corticosteroids (Prednisolone), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs - Methotrexate), and biologicals (a new line of DMARDs- Adalimumab) are some of the medications prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid diseases. Managing rheumatic disease progression with the help of medication can prevent or reduce the risk of lung involvement.Studies have shown that the use of Nintedanib (a kinase inhibitor drug) helped slow the progression of interstitial lung disease by acting on the enzyme responsible for lung tissue scarring.\n\n【31】2.  **Oxygen Therapy -** For individuals with severe breathing difficulties, the extra oxygen is given through nasal cannula or masks. Supplemental oxygen therapy can improve oxygen levels in the blood and body thereby making breathing easier.\n\n【32】3.  **Pulmonary Rehabilitation -** Pulmonary rehabilitation involves exercise training, breathing exercises, and education to improve lung function and quality of life for individuals suffering from debilitating lung conditions.\n\n【33】4.  **Surgery -** In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged lung tissue or treat complications such as pleural effusion. In severe cases,(for example: interstitial lung disease) lung transplant may also be required to improve the quality of life for the individual.\n\n【34】5.  **Lifestyle Changes -** Quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, and avoid exposure to environmental irritants (such as air pollution, chemical fumes, aerosol particles, and exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos and pesticides). This can help manage symptoms and prevent further damage to the lungs.\n\n【35】6.  **Exercise -** Regular exercise does not necessarily improve rheumatic lung conditions but it can improve rheumatic conditions and eventually slow the progression of lung involvement.\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】The majority of respiratory manifestations occur within the first five years for rheumatoid individuals. Respiratory symptoms may precede the onset of articular symptoms in some. However, they may be masked by poor functional status from joint disease or chronic inflammation. It is important for individuals with rheumatoid lung disease to have regular check-ups to monitor their symptoms, lung function and adjust treatment as needed.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Rheumatoid lung disease  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000113.htm\n*   Rheumatoid Lung Disease  \n    https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/rheumatoid-lung-disease\n*   What You Need to Know About RA and Lung Disease  \n    https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/what-you-need-to-know-about-ra-and-lung-disease</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Despite advanced treatments for cancer, like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the death rate is more with cancer of the pancreas. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is also called the Whipple procedure; a complex surgical procedure is done to remove benign and malignant cancers of the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and periampullary region, or distal common bile duct, gallbladder, and associated lymph nodes.\n\n【2】There are two main types of Whipple procedure, conventional and pylorus-sparing Whipple procedure. The conventional Whipple procedure includes the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, a portion of the stomach and gallbladder, and a portion of the bile duct. And the remaining stomach, pancreas, and bile duct are reconnected to a tract of the digestive system to restore function. In pylorus-sparing Whipple surgery, a portion of the stomach is not removed. This treatment requires the role of interprofessional team management of cancer patients.\n\n【3】What Are the Objectives of Pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple Procedure?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   To specify the need for pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n【5】*   Define the procedure of pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n【6】*   Check the probable complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n【7】*   Outline interprofessional team methods for enhancing care coordination and transmission in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n【8】What Is Pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】It is a surgical procedure to treat resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The difficulty in surgeries is due to their complex intra-abdominal dissection and difficulty repairing the digestive system. Due to its complexity previously, it was associated with high mortality and perioperative morbidity. Two types of pancreaticoduodenectomy are classical or conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy and pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy. This procedure can be performed laparoscopically as well as in an open method. Recent studies found that the laparoscopic approach is associated with lower blood loss, adequate recovery, shorter hospital stays, and more suitable lymph node dissection. Physicians found difficulty with the laparoscopic approach may be due to its difficulty with dissection and anastomosis in this approach.\n\n【10】What Are the Anatomy and Physiology to Be Considered in Pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ located within the loop, which is C shaped by the duodenum. Dividing into the head, uncinate process, neck, body, and tail. Superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries supply the head and uncinate processes. The splenic artery supplies the neck, body, and tail through the dorsal pancreatic artery, greater pancreatic artery, and transverse pancreatic artery. Four veins supply the head of the pancreas. They drain into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV). Venous drainage of the body, neck, and tail into the splenic veins.\n\n【12】The main duct of the pancreas is Wirsung which starts in the tail, drives the whole distance of the pancreas, and extends into the second portion of the duodenum concurrently with the bile duct on the major duodenal papilla. Several anatomical factors should be taken into account before pancreas surgery. The pancreas and c loop of the duodenum have the same blood supply; thus, that part should be removed along with the pancreas. The uncinate process extends superiorly and posteriorly behind the superior mesenteric vein. Tumor involving the uncinate process has been associated with vascular invasion and has a poor prognosis compared with the others.\n\n【13】What Are the Indications of Pancreaticoduodenectomy Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   If the cancer is located at the head of the pancreas.\n\n【15】*   **PNETs** - pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n【16】*   **GIST** - gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\n\n【17】*   **IPMN** - intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.\n\n【18】*   Duodenal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic trauma.\n\n【19】*   Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.\n\n【20】What Are the Contraindications of Pancreaticoduodenectomy Procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The contraindications of pancreaticoduodenectomy are based on multifarious factors. Three grades of resectability are found for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\n【22】They are resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable.\n\n【23】*   In localized and resectable procedures, there will be no distant metastasis and no evidence of distortion of the portal or superior mesenteric vein radiographically. There is an obvious dissection plane around the celiac axis, hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric artery.\n\n【24】*   In borderline resectable, superior mesenteric vein and portal vein involvement with distortion and occlusion but the existence of appropriate vessels proximally and distally for reconstruction. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with brief component encasement of the hepatic artery without spreading to the celiac axis. Tumor abutment of superior mesenteric artery not expanding greater than one hundred and eighty degrees of the circumference of the vessel wall.\n\n【25】*   Unresectable for head cancer or contraindication of the procedure includes celiac abutment, metastasis distantly, involvement of IVC, aorta, and Irreparable SMV or PV occlusion.\n\n【26】What Are the Preparations Done Before Pancreaticoduodenectomy Procedure?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】*   Before putting an incision on the skin, antibiotics should be given intravenously.\n\n【28】*   Based on the preference of the surgeon, octreotide is administered.\n\n【29】*   Colonic bowel preparation is done only if colonic bowel resection is needed.\n\n【30】*   Vascular surgeon consultation should be done if vascular resection and reconstruction are planned.\n\n【31】How Is the Pancreaticoduodenectomy Procedure Done?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】This procedure begins with a vertical midline incision or bilateral subcostal incision. Then a self-retaining retractor is placed. First, understand the extent of the disease. Staging laparoscopy is used to define resectability. The liver is examined to find metastasis by palpation if suspected imaging techniques are used. The parietal and visceral peritoneal surfaces, the ligament of Treitz, the omentum, and the entire intestine are reviewed for metastasis. The celiac axis was checked for lymph node involvement.\n\n【33】The proper hepatic artery and common hepatic artery are evaluated for any existence of tumor tissue. Kocher maneuver is committed by elevating the duodenum and head of the pancreas out of the retroperitoneum. Cattell-Braasch maneuver is usually not required besides for mobilization and resection of SMV. The gallbladder is dissected from the liver, and the distal common hepatic duct is split near the level of the cystic duct entrance location. The bile duct is retracted caudally, and portal dissection is resumed at the front part of the portal vein. The portal structures should be evaluated for a substituted right hepatic artery and saved during these schemes.\n\n【34】The gastroduodenal artery is ligated to reduce the possibility of erosion. The sectioning of the gastroduodenal artery also reveals the front surface of the portal vein and enables the dissection of the portal vein behind the neck of the pancreas. The surgeon recognizes the portal vein above the neck of the pancreas and SMV inferior to the pancreas neck. Blunt dissection downwards along the portal vein is desired to create a plane anterior to the portal vein and behind the neck of the pancreas. Kocher maneuver will reveal SMV inferior to the pancreas neck. PV and SMV junctions should be visualized.\n\n【35】In the Whipple procedure, antrectomy is done by sectioning the right gastric and gastroepiploic arteries and dividing by a stapler. Pylorus is preserved by the pylorus-preserving procedure.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the curative treatment of pancreatic cancer. Early detection of cancer is very much needed in these types of cancer. The rate of morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure is high. Its complications include delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, postoperative hemorrhage, wound infection, etc. Early detection and organized multiple team management of the patient is necessary in this case of disease.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pancreaticoduodenectomy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560747/\n*   Whipple Procedure (Pancreaticoduodenectomy)  \n    https://columbiasurgery.org/conditions-and-treatments/whipple-procedure-pancreaticoduodenectomy\n*   Whipple Procedure  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/whipple-procedure</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The new technologies provide precise monitoring and treatments, which help physicians rescue patients from critical conditions. In addition, they help the practitioners in the decision-making process. The new technologies should be non-invasive and easily accessible. Most intensive care unit patients are inactive, which may cause delirium and impairment of physical activities. Some alternative methods and new technologies, like virtual reality and robotics, are used in the rehabilitation program to improve the activity level in intensive care units (ICU) patients.\n\n【2】What Are the Technologies Used in Critical Care and Rehabilitation?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Critical care and rehabilitation technologies provide innovative and effective solutions to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. The various technologies used in critical care and rehabilitation include the following:\n\n【4】**1\\. Technologies Used in Critical Care:**\n\n【5】*   Patient monitoring systems help to monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.\n\n【6】*   Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving technology that delivers oxygen to patients who cannot breathe independently.\n\n【7】*   Hemodynamic monitoring uses invasive or non-invasive sensors to measure blood pressure, blood flow, oxygenation, and heart and circulatory system performance.\n\n【8】*   Telemedicine enables remote patient monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, and teleconsultations for patients without specialized care available locally.\n\n【9】**2\\. Technologies Used in Rehabilitation:**\n\n【10】*   Assistive technologies include mobility aids such as wheelchairs, walking aids, prostheses, and communication aids such as text-to-speech and speech recognition software.\n\n【11】*   Virtual reality is used to treat conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder with a simulated environment for the patients to engage in rehabilitation.\n\n【12】*   Robotic therapy uses robotic devices to assist patients with rehabilitative exercises.\n\n【13】*   Musculoskeletal remodeling and simulations.\n\n【14】*   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\n\n【15】*   Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\n【16】*   Motion analysis.\n\n【17】What Is Virtual Reality-Based Rehabilitation?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Virtual reality is a tool for rehabilitation and exercises in intensive care patients. Virtual reality-based rehabilitation engages and motivates the patients and provides a positive learning experience. In virtual reality, patients wear special glasses to immerse themselves in an artificial three-dimensional world. The tasks include imitations or video-game-like activities for the patients. The virtual environments are customized according to the patient’s physical or cognitive impairments.\n\n【19】Virtual reality (VR) has been increasingly used in critical care and rehabilitation settings to improve patient outcomes and experiences. The following are some examples.\n\n【20】**1\\. Pain Management:**\n\n【21】*   VR is a non-pharmacological intervention used for pain management in critical care settings.\n\n【22】*   It distracts and comforts the patients, and reduces pain and anxiety during wound care, burns dressing changes, and intravenous catheter insertion.\n\n【23】*   In rehabilitation, virtual reality manages the patient’s chronic pain with engaging environments to distract them from pain.\n\n【24】**2\\. Rehabilitation:**\n\n【25】*   Virtual reality is used as a tool for physical and cognitive rehabilitation.\n\n【26】*   A combination of VR and brain-computer interface (BCI) improve motor functions in chronic stroke survivors.\n\n【27】*   It improves gait rehabilitation after a stroke and lower limb amputation by providing treadmill training systems with head-mounted devices or screens.\n\n【28】*   It provides balance and mobility in patients with Parkinson’s disease and is also used for early mobility exercises to prevent deconditioning in critically ill patients.\n\n【29】**3\\. Mental Health:**\n\n【30】*   VR treats anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in critical care and rehabilitation settings.\n\n【31】**4\\. Education and Training:**\n\n【32】*   VR provides a safe, low-risk environment and immersive and realistic simulations for healthcare providers to train in critical care and rehabilitation scenarios.\n\n【33】*   Biosensors such as EMG sensors, force sensors, and inertial measurement units allow the therapist to provide timely feedback to the patients as they record the activities of the patient’s muscles.\n\n【34】**Disadvantages of Virtual Reality:**\n\n【35】*   Virtual reality can cause patients cybersickness in which they experience nausea, vomiting, and headache.\n\n【36】What Is Robotic Technology in Critical Care and Rehabilitation?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】The uses of robotic technology in critical care and rehabilitation settings include the following:\n\n【38】**1\\. Critical Care:**\n\n【39】*   Robots are used in critical care units to monitor and care for patients.\n\n【40】*   For example, they administer medications, monitor vital signs, and help patients turn and reposition.\n\n【41】*   It reduces the caregiver's workload.\n\n【42】*   Telepresence robots help in communication between patients, families, and healthcare providers.\n\n【43】**2\\. Rehabilitation:**\n\n【44】*   They are tools for physical and cognitive rehabilitation.\n\n【45】*   Robots provide repetitive and controlled movements to the patients.\n\n【46】*   Motivate patients to engage in rehabilitation exercises with biofeedback and gamification.\n\n【47】**3\\. Surgical Assistance and Prosthetics:**\n\n【48】*   Robots assist in complex surgical procedures, suturing, manipulating tissues, and visualization during surgery.\n\n【49】*   They develop prosthetic devices to provide mobility and functionality for amputees.\n\n【50】*   Exoskeletons provide support and mobility for patients with spinal cord injuries and mobility impairments.\n\n【51】What Is Musculoskeletal Modeling and Simulation?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】In critical care, musculoskeletal modeling is used to understand the effects of prolonged bed rest and immobility on a patient’s musculoskeletal system. In addition, musculoskeletal modeling assesses a patient’s biomechanics and muscle function in rehabilitation settings. It helps clinicians design more effective treatment plans for patients.\n\n【53】What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to stimulate neural activity in the brain. TMS assesses and monitors the level of consciousness in patients with brain injuries in critical care units. In addition, it improves muscle strength, balance, and coordination in patients by stimulating the brain's motor areas.\n\n【55】What Is Motion Analysis?\n------------------------\n\n【56】Motion analysis is used to monitor the movement patterns of bedridden patients. It identifies the areas of weakness or imbalance, pressure ulcers, and other complications associated with prolonged bed rest. In rehabilitation settings, motion analysis improves patient outcomes by providing data on movement patterns and biomechanics.\n\n【57】What Are the Benefits of Using Technology in Critical Care and Rehabilitation?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】The benefits of using technology in critical care and rehabilitation include the following.\n\n【59】*   **Improved Patient Outcomes** - Technologies help in earlier detection, and effective treatment plans to improve patient outcomes.\n\n【60】*   **Increased Efficiency** - The use of technology helps healthcare providers to work more efficiently.\n\n【61】*   **Cost Savings** - Technology reduces the length of hospital stays and prevents readmissions, thereby reducing costs.\n\n【62】*   **Access to Specialized Care** - Telemedicine and other technologies benefit patients living in remote areas.\n\n【63】**Conclusion**\n\n【64】The use of technology in critical care and rehabilitation has provided innovative and effective solutions to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital stays, and increase efficiency.

These cranial nerves control the muscles that move the eyeball. Due to this condition, a person suffers from orbital pain or headache. These symptoms usually subside on their own without any treatment. It is a rare condition that is only seen in around one in a million cases. Idiopathic swelling of the cavernous sinus can also be associated with this condition which typically affects only one side. This causes a myriad of symptoms such as double vision, paralysis, and numbness. Moreover, the affected eye is usually seen abruptly bulging due to this condition. Although the condition is believed to be benign, there are higher chances of recurrence along with neurological defects. Patients with this condition are recommended immunosuppressants for longer periods. Also, the condition is known as\n\n【2】*   Ophthalmoplegia syndrome.\n\n【3】*   Painful ophthalmoplegia.\n\n【4】*   Recurrent ophthalmoplegia.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The etiological factor affecting this condition is still unknown. However, the following is the theory behind its possible association with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【7】*   **Autoimmune Response:** Inflammation of the orbital fissure and cranial sinus occurs due to the accumulation of granulomatous cells. It is the result of the body’s weak immune system, which cannot defend against the foreign organism and causes generalized inflammation of the blood vessels and the body.\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The following are the signs and symptoms associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【10】*   Severe periorbital headache.\n\n【11】*   Dropping of the upper eyelid.\n\n【12】*   Large pupil.\n\n【13】*   Numbness of the face.\n\n【14】*   Chronic fatigue.\n\n【15】*   Pain.\n\n【16】*   Reduced eye movements.\n\n【17】*   Double vision.\n\n【18】*   Paralysis.\n\n【19】*   Fatigue.\n\n【20】How to Diagnose Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】There are the following diagnostic methods used for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【22】*   **Diagnostic Criteria Are Given by the International Headache Society:** International headache society has given some criteria for diagnosing this condition, such as:\n\n【23】    *   Unilateral headache.\n\n【24】    *   Inflammation of cavernous sinus or orbital fissure.\n\n【25】    *   Paralysis of one or more cranial nerves on the same side.\n\n【26】    *   If the headache is localized around the eye.\n\n【27】*   **Neuroradiological Studies:**\n\n【28】    *   **Computed Tomography (CT Scan):** CT scan is used with a high resolution to see the abnormal soft tissue changes.\n\n【29】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** MRI is an excellent diagnostic tool used for getting a good coronal view. With the help of this tool, the thickening of soft tissue in the cavernous sinus can be evaluated. Moreover, it also shows the lateral wall convexity of the cavernous sinus and its extension into orbit.\n\n【30】*   **Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Study:** This evaluation method is used to test ophthalmoplegia and its possible involvement.\n\n【31】    *   **Hematological Tests:**\n\n【32】        *   Complete blood count.\n\n【33】        *   Serum chemistry (glucose, electrolytes, liver, and renal function).\n\n【34】        *   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\n【35】        *   C-reactive protein.\n\n【36】        *   Hemoglobin A1c.\n\n【37】        *   Fluorescent treponemal antibody test.\n\n【38】        *   Antinuclear antibody.\n\n【39】        *   Anti-dsDNA antibody.\n\n【40】        *   Anti-Sm antibody.\n\n【41】        *   Serum protein electrophoresis.\n\n【42】        *   Antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody.\n\n【43】        *   Angiotensin-converting enzyme. \n\n【44】    *   **Cerebrospinal Fluid:**\n\n【45】        *   Opening pressure.\n\n【46】        *   Cell count and differential.\n\n【47】        *   Protein.\n\n【48】        *   Glucose.\n\n【49】What Are the Complications Associated With Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】The following are the complications associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【51】*   Paralysis of an eyelid or face.\n\n【52】*   Double vision.\n\n【53】*   Severe headache.\n\n【54】How to Manage Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【55】Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is usually managed with short-term steroid drug therapy. Symptoms, such as pain, usually subside in 20 days without treatment. However, with medication such as steroids, the pain goes away within 2 to 24 hours. The following is the management option for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【56】*   **Glucocorticoids:** An ophthalmologist gives glucocorticoids according to the patient's condition and physical capacity. The dose of this medication varies from person to person. Usually, with this medication, the patient might feel an immediate effect on the pain. However, cranial nerve palsies may or may not improve with it. The treatment involves high-dose steroid therapy with a gradually decreasing dose over a month or week.\n\n【57】*   **Immunosuppressant Therapy:** This is the second line of treatment, and not every patient requires it. This medication can be given along with steroid therapy. Additionally, Azathioprine, Methotrexate, or Cyclosporine are the medication that can be used for this condition.\n\n【58】What Are the Differential Diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】The following are the differential diagnoses associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【60】*   **Ischemic Disease:** Such as ischemic hemorrhage (when the blood vessel to the brain is clogged and leaks) or diabetic mononeuropathy.\n\n【61】*   **Syphilis:** It is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacterial infection.\n\n【62】*   **Basal Meningitis:** This condition usually develops due to the rupture of the intracranial tuberculoma.\n\n【63】*   **Aneurysm:** Aneurysm is an unusual elevation of the blood vessel caused by high blood pressure. Usually, this condition is seen in the brain, behind the knee, intestine, or spleen.\n\n【64】*   **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula:** It is the abrupt joining between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus.\n\n【65】*   **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis:** It is a fatal condition caused by a blood clot in the cavernous sinus.\n\n【66】*   **Sarcoidosis:** Sarcoidosis is a condition caused by an overgrowth of inflammatory cells in the body. It is usually seen in the lungs, skin, or eyes.\n\n【67】*   **Varicella Zoster:** It is a fatal viral infection caused by the herpes virus.\n\n【68】*   **Polyarteritis Nodosa:** It is a rare condition that causes arterial inflammation and its weakening. It affects multiple systems and organs of the body.\n\n【69】*   **Neurosarcoidosis:** It is the condition where any part of the nervous system has abrupt cell accumulation.\n\n【70】*   **Bechet’s Disease:** It is a rare condition that causes abrupt inflammation of any part of the body.\n\n【71】*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** It is an autoimmune disorder that majorly affects the skeletal muscles of the body.\n\n【72】*   **Lupus:** When the body’s immune system attacks its cells, this condition arises. Lupus affects multiple organs of the body, such as skin, lungs, joints, and blood cells.\n\n【73】*   **Migraine:** It is severe and unbearable throbbing pain of the head, which is usually seen as unilateral.\n\n【74】**Conclusion**\n\n【75】Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a condition that can cause many severe symptoms in the patient. Due to its idiopathic cause, the diagnosis of the condition is very difficult. However, due to the severity and recurrence of the condition, it is essential to follow regular treatment without skipping any dose of the medication. Also, regular follow-up is very important for patients with this condition.\n\n【76】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【77】* * *\n\n【78】#### **1.**删除换行**How to Recover From Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?**\n\n【79】The first line of treatment involves high-dose oral steroid therapy with glucocorticoids for pain relief after which the dose is decreased gradually over a few weeks or months.

This \"post adrenalectomy\" syndrome was first reported through case studies of patients in 1959 by Dr. Fon H Nelson, an endocrinologist, and physician who first elaborated on this pituitary tumor.\n\n【2】Nelson's syndrome is a clinical challenge to both physicians and patients due to its features’ complexity. This article elaborates the features of this pituitary tumor, the disorders of the adrenal gland that are indicated for surgery, and the management of Nelson’s syndrome.\n\n【3】What Are the Clinical Features of Nelson Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】In this pituitary tumor, multiple clinical symptoms arise, all of which start with hyperpigmentation of the skin, hyperpigmentation of the scrotum, the areolae, and of the gingiva. Gingival hyperpigmentation or the oral mucosal membrane hyperpigmentation that may be accompanied or preceded by gingival hypertrophy (enlargement or overgrowth of gingival tissue causing variations in its contour) is a very obvious oral characteristic feature of this disease, just like the hyperpigmented skin surface of the individual.\n\n【5】The serious clinical feature of this disease or tumor is hemianopia, wherein there may be partial loss of the visual field in one eye. Hemianopias can be temporary or permanent, usually depending on the extent of the pituitary tumor. Complete visual loss is not uncommon in very large pituitary tumors of this disease which can be progressive and also a hindrance to the patient other than accessory clinical symptoms like headaches, severe fatigue (malaise or weakness), the underlying reason mainly being the pituitary gland dysfunctionality.\n\n【6】The characteristic feature that distinguishes this syndrome is that it is seldom found in patients suffering from an adrenal disease and is instead found in those patients who have undergone surgical adrenalectomy or removal of one or both of the adrenal glands. In the past decades, the surgical procedure to avoid long-term complications as a result of Cushing's disease has led to the physician's and surgeon’s recommendation of it, that is, the bilateral adrenalectomy procedure. However, in the recent decade, this surgical modality is not preferred anymore as it can make the patients more prone to the risk of developing Nelson's syndrome.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>Is the lump in breast cancer or cyst?</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>I have facial hair, weight gain, and breastmilk secretion even after two years of delivery. Please help.</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>What are the recommended procedures to reach brain by a neurosurgeon?</u>\n\n【12】What Adrenal Gland Disorders Necessitate Adrenalectomy?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The adrenal glands situated bilaterally above the kidneys are major endocrine hormonal organs that secrete for the purpose of growth and development, sexual function, and metabolism in the human body.\n\n【14】Though in normal individuals not suffering from any systemic disease, the problems of adrenal glands should be definitely rare, still, the conditions that impact the adrenal glands are varied, ranging from cancerous tumors to hypercortisolism (increased production of cortisol or stress hormone - Cushing’s syndrome or disease), hyperaldosteronism (excess production of aldosterone - the pituitary hormone that regulates salt metabolism as well as blood pressure), and pheochromocytoma (a condition characterized by overproduction or over secretion of hormones like catecholamines and metanephrines that severely causes an imbalance or an unregulated mechanism of blood pressure control).\n\n【15】Overproduction of steroid hormones or cancers of the adrenal gland themselves though less common, definitely is indicative for the patient to undergo adrenalectomy.\n\n【16】Why Is Adrenalectomy Done?\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Adrenalectomy is a procedure done through an open incision and open surgery for large cancers of the adrenal glands. For mild to moderate-sized cancers, the adrenalectomy can be performed in smaller incisions by robotic surgery or through a laparoscopy that is minimally invasive in comparison (laparoscopic adrenalectomy).\n\n【18】Unilateral adrenalectomy usually allows the other existing adrenal gland in the body to cope. It allows the patient a better long-term prognosis from either cancer or Cushing’s syndrome or the above-enlisted conditions that interfere with the adrenal gland metabolism.\n\n【19】However, it is bilateral adrenalectomy that is of the most risk to the patient as both glands are bilaterally eliminated atop the kidneys, and medications replace the normal metabolic function of the glands. Hence it makes the patient more prone to Nelson's syndrome.\n\n【20】What Investigations Help Diagnose Nelson’s Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Primarily tests for evaluation are conducted by the physician for assessing the plasma ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) levels. An ACTH increase greater than 30 % and with a positive history of adrenalectomy is confirmative of diagnosis of the syndrome.\n\n【22】An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may show either a new tumor or enlargement of a long-standing or previously recurrent tumor. MRI and plasma ACTH levels with patients' medical history along with certain severe clinical features limited exclusively to pituitary tumor enlargements like sudden or progressive visual loss and hemianopias are very confirmative and hence gold standard diagnosis for detection and confirmation prior to surgical intervention.\n\n【23】Mainly diagnosis proves useful only in the long-term prognosis of these cases after surgery of the tumor as early diagnosis can help prevent the postoperative complications. This tumor, though slow, can often be clinically asymptomatic for a limited duration (also early detection can help the physician manage endocrine complications like diabetes insipidus or hypopituitarism in these individuals prior to surgery).\n\n【24】How Can Nelson’s Syndrome Be Treated?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【25】1.  The mainline treatment is usually surgical resection of the tumor and is performed mainly by either craniotomy surgery or endoscopic or transsphenoidal route surgeries.\n\n【26】2.  Radiosurgery that usually directs the radiation specifically (using a gamma source and knife) to the enlarged or the cancerous tissue in the pituitary gland proves an effective option both as an alternative to surgery and if post-operative outcomes fail after surgery in these individuals. Radiosurgery is thus proven very effective as per current research and an effective alternate modality for improving long-term recovery outcomes in these cases. Radiotherapy, on the other hand, can be prophylactically used post-surgery in bilateral adrenalectomy cases.\n\n【27】3.  This would be a contraindication in patients who have already received radiation therapy (though previously). Also, as these individuals cannot produce cortisol anymore, the Glucocorticoids and Mineralocorticoids are administered permanently to compensate for the loss of natural cortisol production. Somatostatin analogs and Dopamine agonists are other drugs that have proved effective as per recent research alongside Hydrocortisone or Glucocorticoid/Mineralocorticoid administration every day.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Nelson’s syndrome is a complex clinical entity and challenge. With current treatment modalities, though the prognosis is improved for these cases, early detection and recognition of symptoms are essential in adrenalectomy patients to combat this tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c147319c-6cf7-4fd4-8b5c-69ea6c42c77f", "title": "Frotteuristic Disorder - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Frotteuristic Disorder - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Frotteuristic disorder is a paraphilic or sexual disorder characterized by recurrent, intense, or otherwise inappropriate sexual urges and fantasies involving rubbing against another person, usually in crowded or public places. According to a recent study, about ten to 14 percent of adult males being treated for paraphilic disorders also showed frotteuristic behaviors. It is sometimes referred to as frotteurism or frotteuristic tendencies. Although frotteuristic urges are considered pathological, frotteurism itself is not considered a mental illness, nor can it necessarily be used to diagnose some other sexual dysfunction. Instead, the disorder goes hand-in-hand with other mental illnesses like schizophrenia and dissociative disorders.\n\n【2】What Are Paraphilic Disorders?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Paraphilic interests can be considered a mental health condition. They are intense and persistent sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that cause distress to the person who experiences them. Sexual disorders are also considered mental health conditions because they interfere with normal sex drive and sex life functioning. Paraphilic interests and behaviors can affect individuals of any gender identity or sexual orientation. There are several types of paraphilic interests, fetishes (sexual objects), zoophilia (sexual contact with animals), and sadomasochism (sadistic behavior). Paraphilic interests may change over time or from one situation to another.\n\n【4】What Is Frotteuristic Disorder?\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】Frotteurism is a disorder that involves a person becoming sexually aroused by rubbing or grinding against a nonconsenting person, mostly in public places. The term frotteurism refers to the act of rubbing against someone else without permission. It is not uncommon for people to have this disorder. Research has shown that as many as 30 percent of men have engaged in frotteurism acts at one point in their lives. Frotteurism is different than toucherism, in which a person becomes sexually aroused after a physical touch like genital areas (groping or rubbing their hands on the breasts, buttocks) of a nonconsenting person in a crowd.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Frotteuristic Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Indulging in sexual contact with others in a public place.\n\n【8】*   Grinding one’s pelvic area or erect penis against a nonconsenting person.\n\n【9】*   Experiencing sexual thoughts affecting daily activities.\n\n【10】*   Having sexual fantasies in public places.\n\n【11】*   The impulse to inappropriately touch someone else's body with sexual intent.\n\n【12】*   Tendencies may cause individuals to engage in behaviors that resemble those of an infant with his mother.\n\n【13】*   Some people may have problems with tactile interactions that may occur during normal human erotic or sexual interactions.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Frotteuristic Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Though frotteurism is not well understood, there are several theories about why it happens.\n\n【16】*   Some scientists believe that some people may have frotteurism interests from birth.\n\n【17】*   While others believe they develop over the years or through experiences of living with people of similar behaviors and interests.\n\n【18】*   Childhood trauma may also impact the person's mental health, indulging in frotteurism behaviors.\n\n【19】*   Sexual abuse or early childhood anxiety disorders could also affect the person's psychosexual development.\n\n【20】*   People have trouble expressing affectionate and sexually intimate behavior due to brain abnormalities that affects their emotional health and reflexes (impulse control).\n\n【21】*   Signs of paraphilias are often noticeable before adolescence. People already showing signs of hypersexuality or previously indulging in sexual activities may be at a higher risk of frotteurism.\n\n【22】How to Understand If One Has Frotteuristic Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】One or two incidences may not necessarily indicate frotteuristic disorder. However, repeated sexual urges and inappropriate behavior in public places over six months could suggest the disorder. Seeking consultation from a therapist will help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【24】Therapists usually start by asking numerous questions to reach a diagnosis and rule out other paraphilic and sexual disorders. The first session usually starts by reviewing medical and psychological history. Sharing information about underlying medical and mental health conditions often helps therapists reach a diagnosis. Counselors also discuss the sexual history, including any unusual behaviors. They would also determine whether or not there are signs of mental health problems.\n\n【25】Who Is Likely to Have Frotteuristic Disorder?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Studies show males (usually 15 to 25 years) are more affected by this disorder than females. Frotteuristic disorder is also seen in socially insecure adults and older men. Females usually are targeted by these men. Men likely to be victims of this disorder usually have the following:\n\n【27】*   Social anxiety.\n\n【28】*   Mental health disorders.\n\n【29】*   Clinical depression.\n\n【30】*   Traumatic brain injury.\n\n【31】*   A history of sexual abuse, in general, has been associated with a paraphilic disorder.\n\n【32】*   Intellectual disabilities.\n\n【33】*   Substance abuse and drug addiction.\n\n【34】*   Presence of other or more than one paraphilic disorder, especially exhibitionism, and frotteurism.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment for Frotteuristic Disorder?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】*   **Seeking Help for Frotteurism**\\- Many people who seek treatment for frotteurism have a history of sexual offenses or other related crimes. Recognize habits and behaviors according to signs and symptoms. On self-recognition, one must consult a therapist or a mental health expert to diagnose the disorder and prevent future frotteuristic incidences.\n\n【37】*   **Therapy and Counseling** - Psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, solution-focused therapy, psychoanalysis, stress relieving and relaxation therapy, and meditation practices have been successful. However, most therapists usually approach psychotherapy and behavior therapies to treat frotteuristic patients first. Failure to treat the disorder with these methods would require medications and isolation until the symptoms disappear.\n\n【38】*   **Psychotherapy** - This method focuses on identifying triggers for frotteuristic behavior and developing strategies to:\n    *   Redirect the thoughts, feelings, and impulses.\n    *   Control the urges.\n    *   Supress sexual drive.\n*   **Behavior Therapy** - Helps the person to control their impulses and not touch another nonconsenting person.\n\n【39】*   **Medications** - That suppress sexual drive (medications that suppress testosterone levels), anti-anxiety medications, and serotonergic antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, Sertraline, and Paroxetine have benefited people with obstructive compulsive disorder. In addition, at times, anti-androgens like GnRH analogs may be given to patients to reduce impulsivity (frequency of frotteuristic disorders) and symptoms of hypersexuality.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Frotteurism is not only rare, but it is also seldom reported. When repeat offenses are associated with other sexually deviant behaviors, taking action and recognizing the situation is essential. Failure to do so could get one arrested, as frotteurism is considered an offense. It may or may not require treatment if lacking any clinical impairment, but it requires counseling and behavioral therapy. Victims must be informed of the behaviors, so they can take action and seek help to prevent them from happening again.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Frotteurism  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563260/\n*   Prevalence and treatment of frotteurism in the community: a systematic review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25492074/\n*   Frotteurism  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33085407/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The fats that accumulate are called phytosterols or plant sterols. There are several types of plant sterols, out of which sitosterol is commonly accumulated in the body, causing the blood levels to increase 30 to 100 times the average level. In addition, cholesterol is a type of animal fat that deposits in the body in some people with sitosterolemia. The body takes up plant sterols through food. People start showing signs and symptoms once the foods are introduced into their diet. However, certain people may not show any features.\n\n【2】What Are the Other Names of Sitosterolemia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The other names of the condition include:\n\n【4】*   Phytosterolemia.\n\n【5】*   Phytosterolemia.\n\n【6】*   Sitosterolemia.\n\n【7】*   Beta-sitosterolemia.\n\n【8】*   Plant sterol storage disease.\n\n【9】How Common Is Sitosterolemia?\n-----------------------------\n\n【10】Sitosterolemia is an extremely rare genetic disorder that occurs in one in 50,000 people. Only about 80 to 100 cases have been documented in the medical literature, as many patients go unnoticed due to mild symptoms.\n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Sitosterolemia?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】The main cause of the occurrence of sitosterolemia is genetic change (mutations). For example, a defect in the gene ABCG5 or ABCG8 is responsible for plant fat accumulation in the body. The body cannot use plant sterols or fats. In normal people, the body sends out the sterols with the help of a protein called sterolin, a transporter protein that helps remove plant sterols from the cells. Sterolin is found mainly in the cells of the intestine and the liver. When the intestine cells take up the plant sterols, the transporter protein, sterolin, helps pump the plant fats back into the intestine, thereby decreasing the absorption.\n\n【13】The fats in the liver cells are removed by moving them into the fluid called bile, which then moves the fats into the intestines, to be removed by the feces. ABCG5 and ABCG8 are the genes that give instructions to make the protein sterolin. The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive pattern, which means one defective gene copy is transferred to the child from each parent. Therefore, the parents have two copies of genes in each cell, out of which one copy is normal, and the other is defective. As the parents have one normal copy each, they are called carriers, but they do not show any signs and symptoms.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Sitosterolemia?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【15】People affected with sitosterolemia mostly show the following signs and symptoms that include:\n\n【16】*   **Atherosclerosis**: Blocking the artery wall by fatty deposits can occur in patients with sitosterolemia in early childhood, which eventually causes the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing the chance of stroke, heart attack, and death.\n\n【17】*   **Xanthomas:** People with sitosterolemia develop yellowish growths on or below the skin, called xanthomas, occurring commonly from childhood. Xanthomas are made up of fats that can occur anywhere on the skin, mainly on the elbows, buttocks, knees, and heels. They can also occur in the tendons, which connect the bones to the muscles, commonly involving the Achilles tendon (connecting the heel to the calf muscles). Big xanthomas can cause pain and difficulty moving or walking.\n\n【18】*   **Joint Stiffness:** Accumulation of plant-based fat deposits in the joints can lead to pain and stiffness of the joints.\n\n【19】*   **Blood Abnormalities**: Though rare, blood abnormalities can occur in people with sitosterolemia, they are the only sign of sitosterolemia sometimes. The red blood cells (RBCs) that carry oxygen may break down early, causing a type of anemia called hemolytic anemia. Occasionally, abnormally shaped red blood cells (coffee bean-shaped instead of disc-shaped) occur in the bloodstream called stomatocytes. In addition, blood cells that help blood clot, called platelets, may be abnormally large, called macrothrombocytopenia.\n\n【20】How Is Sitosterolemia Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【21】The normal level of the protein sitosterol in blood plasma is 1 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Any value above 1mg/dL is diagnostic of sitosterolemia. The values of people who do not receive treatment may be as high as 10 to 65 mg/dL. A particular blood test called GC-MS (gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry) helps to determine elevated phytosterol levels, diagnosing sitosterolemia. The condition is confirmed in people with high blood levels of plant sterols like sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol. Genetic testing that helps in determining the changes in the genes ABCG8 and ABCG5 is also recommended.\n\n【22】How Is Sitosterolemia Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【23】The goal of treatment is to bring back the levels of plant sterols in blood to near normal, reduce the levels of blood cholesterol, reduce the size of xanthomas, and prevent the formation of new xanthomas.\n\n【24】The therapies that are followed include:\n\n【25】*   **Dietary Changes:** Doctors recommend a diet with foods containing fewer plant sterols.\n\n【26】*   **Medications:** Tablet Ezetimibe 10 mg daily is the standard therapy doctors advise. It acts by reducing the amount of plant sterols and cholesterol absorbed by the body. If well tolerated, the tablet may also be combined with other medications that act better. Combination therapies have been shown to decrease the levels of sitosterol and cholesterol by 10 to 50 percent. However, Ezetimibe is not recommended for pregnant patients as studies are still in progress on the fetal effects.\n\n【27】*   **Bile Acid Sequestrants:** Bile acid sequestrants like Cholestyramine are included in the treatment for cases that do not respond to Ezetimibe. They bind the plant sterols to bile juice, which helps excrete the sterols through stools.\n\n【28】*   Sitosterolemia does not respond well to statin treatment as to other types of cholesterol in the body. Treatment is given for blood and joint disorders according to the symptoms.\n\n【29】What Is the Recommended Diet for Sitosterolemia Patients?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Dietary changes are advised along with Ezetimibe therapy, in which patients have to stop or reduce the foods containing plant sterols, like:\n\n【31】*   Vegetable oils.\n\n【32】*   Nuts and seeds.\n\n【33】*   Avocados.\n\n【34】*   Olives.\n\n【35】*   Chocolates.\n\n【36】*   Shellfish.\n\n【37】*   Sources of vegetable fats.\n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】Sitosterolemia is when plant-based sterols accumulate in the blood vessels and tissues beneath the skin. As it is a very rare condition, the outlook is not predictable. However, early diagnosis and the start of treatment lead to better results. Delayed or untreated cases can increase the risk of complications and death in affected people. The availability of the medicine, Ezetimibe, has helped the patients lead a better quality of life.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Sitosterolemia  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/sitosterolemia/#causes\n*   Sitosterolemia  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/sitosterolemia/\n*   Sitosterolemia  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7653/sitosterolemia\n*   Boston Children's Hospital: What is sitosterolemia?  \n    https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/sitosterolemia\n*   NIH: Sitosterolemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572142/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is pretty rare, but it can be aggressive, and the chances of recurrence may be high. It is a type of head and neck cancer. A thin layer of flat cells called squamous cells (They are thin, flat cells, that look like fish scales and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin or the lining of respiratory and digestive tracts) forms the inner buccal mucosa. So the buccal cancer is also classified as squamous cell carcinoma. It usually interferes with eating, speaking, swallowing, and even breathing in severe cases. So it is necessary to take treatment in the initial stages. The incidence is higher among men, and it can be completely cured when treated at early stages.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes for Buccal Cancer?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】The major reason for buccal cancer is the use of tobacco and alcohol as well as continuous chewing of betel nut is also one of the reasons causing buccal cancer. The excessive use of cigars, chewing tobacco, and cigarettes can damage the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of the cells in the buccal mucosa, leading to the cells' abnormal proliferation.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors for Buccal Cancer?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The main risk factors for buccal cancer include;\n\n【6】1.**Oral Hygiene** – If there are persistent ulcers or some sharp tooth irritating buccal mucosa for a long time which causes ulcer, there are chances that it may develop into cancer.\n\n【7】2.**Poor Nutrition** – Unhealthy food habits such as junk foods, less consumption of fruits and vegetables, can generally increase the incidence of cancer.\n\n【8】3.**Virus Attack** – Certain viruses like human papillomavirus (HPV) may cause abnormal proliferation of tissue inside the mouth. HPV infection is generally through sexual contact; even skin-to-skin contact is sufficient.\n\n【9】4.**Age Factor** –With elderly people who have the prolonged habit of chewing tobacco as a routine are more likely to be diagnosed with buccal cancer.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Oral Submucous Fibrosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Leukoplakia - Types, Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Why am I having gums and face swelling with pain in capped teeth?</u>\n\n【15】5.**Genetic Factors** - The gene mutations, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) damage repairs, and defects are some of the genetic factors that may lead to buccal cancer.\n\n【16】6.Weakened immune system.\n\n【17】What Are the Premalignant Lesions That Can Turn Into Buccal Cancer?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The main premalignant lesions that can transform into buccal cancer include;\n\n【19】1.**Leukoplakia** – They are the white patches or plaque present on the surfaces of the oral cavity. Its prevalence is more in people who smoke.\n\n【20】2.**Oral Lichen Planus** – It is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the mucous lining of the mouth.\n\n【21】3.**Erythroplakia** – They are the abnormal red patches found in the oral cavity. They cannot be defined clinically or pathologically as any other condition.\n\n【22】4.**Oral Submucous Fibrosis** – It is the chronic inflammatory disease of the oral cavity characterized by progressive fibrosis. It is prevalent in betel chewers.\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of Buccal Cancer?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【24】The most common symptoms of buccal cancer include mouth ulcers that do not heal for many weeks, erythematous (abnormal redness) patch that may bleed easily, persistent lumps in the cheek, white or dark patches in the mouth, numbness of the buccal mucosa, jaw pain, pain around the teeth, difficulty in moving jaw, hoarseness (sound when it is scratchy or rough) of voice, persistent lumps in lymph glands of the neck, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and unintentional weight loss.\n\n【25】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【26】If you notice any symptoms mentioned above, for more than two to three weeks, especially if you are a habitual smoker or an alcoholic, then seek the help of a dentist or general physician at the earliest.\n\n【27】How to Diagnose Buccal Cancer?\n------------------------------\n\n【28】The main diagnostic tools involve physical examination, blood tests, X-rays to determine the stage of cancer in the lungs, if any, imaging studies, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA), and an incision biopsy.\n\n【29】1.  **Physical Examination** - In the physical examination, the physician evaluates the symptoms, examines the location and size of the tumor and lymph nodes.\n\n【30】2.  **Fine-Needle Aspiration** - The fine-needle aspiration biopsy is almost similar to a blood test. In this, a thin needle is placed in the mouth, and cells from the lesion are aspirated and the cells are observed under a microscope. It is done to see whether the cells are cancerous.\n\n【31】3.  **Incision Biopsy** \\- The incision biopsy can also be done where a small section of tissue is cut under local anesthesia and is observed under a microscope.\n\n【32】4.  **Imaging Studies** - The imaging studies involve computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan to determine the tumors' spread.\n\n【33】What Is the TNM Staging System?\n-------------------------------\n\n【34】The TNM staging helps to know the seriousness of the tumor and to treat the patient accordingly.\n\n【35】‘T’ refers to tumor size, ‘N’ refers to lymph node involvement, and ‘M’ refers to the distant metastasis or extent of spread of cancer to other areas of the body.\n\n【36】**Primary Tumor - T**\n\n【37】**Lymph node involvement - N**\n\n【38】**The distant metastasis - M**\n\n【39】What Is the Treatment for Buccal Cancer?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【40】The main treatment approaches for buccal cancer involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The main goals of the treatment involve treating cancer, maintaining the function and appearance of the mouth, and preventing recurrence. Depending upon the stage of tumor treatment will vary. The habits like drinking and smoking should be avoided before and after the treatment, in order to let the treatment work effectively. If the cancer is restricted to the cheek area alone, it can be completely cured with surgery. If the spread is large and has affected other parts, then a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be essential. During surgery, the tumor is completely excised.\n\n【41】The size of the tumor determines the size of the incision. If it is a small tumor, an incision can be made on the inside of the cheek, which will preserve the skin. But if the tumor is large, the skin will also be involved. In such cases, reconstruction of the cheek will be necessary. Reconstruction surgery can be done using a skin graft from the forearm or chest. The lymph nodes adjacent to the site of cancer may also be removed in some cases. Radiation therapy is generally given as an adjuvant (a substance given to enhance immunity or to prevent recurrence of tumor) after surgery to prevent the tumor's recurrence. It is mainly indicated when the cancer is not completely removed or it has spread to the lymph nodes. Chemotherapy is recommended only when the tumor is spread to lymph nodes and other organs. The medicine as it circulates in the blood interrupts the proliferation of cancer cells. Wherein this cannot cure the disease completely. It has to be combined with surgery or radiation therapy to see effective results.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Buccal cancer when treated in the initial stages has a good prognosis. With proper care and medical intervention, it is curable to an extent. But as always, prevention is better than cure. Habits like smoking, betel nut chewing should be avoided in order to prevent the incidence of this condition. Follow a good lifestyle and habits for a healthy and long life.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Causes of Buccal Cancer  \n    https://thancguide.org/cancer-types/oral/buccal/causes-signs-symptoms/\n*   What is Carcinoma Buccal Mucosa?  \n    https://www.medanta.org/cancer-hospital/head-and-neck/disease/carcinoma-buccal-mucosa/\n*   Treatment Options for Oral Cavity Cancer by Stage  \n    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/treating/by-stage.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Many common causes like food, iron supplements, and other medicines can make your stool appear black. When food is not digested properly in the stomach because of some surgery or including licorice and beet in the diet, it will make the stool appear black or red. Black stool does not always mean you are bleeding internally. But, if you notice that your stool is black and has a foul smell often, then it is best to consult a doctor, as it can also be caused due to bleeding or injury in your gastrointestinal tract. So if you notice a change in color, always consult your doctor so he or she can rule out if blood is present in the stool with a simple test. Black stool that results from bleeding is called melena.\n\n【2】What Are the Important Facts to Remember About Black or Tarry Stools?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】1.  The most common cause is eating dark foods or iron supplements.\n\n【4】2.  Bleeding ulcers also commonly cause melena.\n\n【5】3.  Blood in stools indicates an upper gastrointestinal problem.\n\n【6】4.  A stool test can detect blood in stools.\n\n【7】5.  Always consult your doctor if your poop is black and you have vomiting or diarrhea.\n\n【8】What Are the Causes of Black or Tarry Stools?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Some of the common causes are:\n\n【10】*   **Iron Supplements -** Black stool is the most common side effect of iron supplements, which are given for anemia. The other common side effects of iron tablets are nausea, constipation, heartburn, and abdominal pain. If you notice these side effects, consult your doctor to change or stop iron supplements.\n\n【11】*   **Dark Foods -** Eating dark-colored foods can result in black stools. Examples of such foods include black licorice, chocolate cookies, blueberries, beets, etc. But once you stop eating them, your stool should not be black anymore.\n\n【12】*   **Peptic Ulcer -** A bleeding peptic ulcer is one of the most common causes of your poop becoming dark. When the sore in the lining of the stomach bleeds, the blood mixes with the bowel movement and makes it black. The other symptoms of peptic ulcers are burning abdominal pain, belching, heartburn, and nausea. Inform your doctor if you notice these symptoms along with blood in stools or vomit, breathing problems, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss.\n\n【13】*   **Gastritis -** Inflammation of the stomach lining is called gastritis. It can result from the indiscriminate use of painkillers, eating spicy food, smoking, and bacterial or viral infection.\n\n【14】*   **Bismuth Medicines -** Drugs that contain Bismuth subsalicylate is used to treat an upset stomach and heartburn. The Bismuth in these medicines makes your tongue and stool black. Get immediate medical help if you have a buzzing sound in your ears or do not feel fine after taking Bismuth medicines.\n\n【15】*   **Esophageal or Gastric Cancer -** Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract can also be due to esophageal or gastric cancer. Some of the symptoms that indicate esophageal cancer are difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss, chest pain, indigestion, and coughing. The symptoms of gastric cancer are tiredness, bloating, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【16】*   **Mallory-Weiss Tear -** Your esophagus can tear due to intense cough or vomiting. This can result in internal bleeding. Most tears heal on their own, but if you notice symptoms like blood in vomit, weakness, dizziness, difficulty breathing, pale skin, and chest pain, get immediate medical help.\n\n【17】*   **Esophageal Varices -** Swollen veins in the esophagus are called esophageal varices. These veins can rupture and bleed, resulting in melena. This is commonly seen in people suffering from liver disease. The other symptoms of varices are jaundice, easy bruising, abdominal swelling, blood in vomit, and losing consciousness.\n\n【18】*   **Diverticulosis -** The formation of tiny pockets (diverticula) in the lining of the bowel is called diverticulosis. When this gets infected, inflamed, or ruptured, it can result in gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【19】*   **Constipation -** Straining to pass hard stools can cause blood in the stool.\n\n【20】*   **Ulcerative Colitis -** Ulcerative colitis can result in pus-producing ulcers, which can bleed and cause black stools.\n\n【21】*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) -** IBD can cause inflammation in your digestive tract, and can cause tarry stools.\n\n【22】*   **Colon Polyps -** Small painless clumps seen on the lining of the colon are called colon polyps. These polyps can rupture and bleed.\n\n【23】*   **Hemorrhoids -** Swollen veins in the anus or rectum are called hemorrhoids or piles.\n\n【24】How Can the Cause of Black or Tarry Stools Be Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】After taking a complete medical and family history, your doctor will perform a physical examination to determine the cause. The doctor might tell you to perform the following tests:\n\n【26】*   **Blood Tests -** Complete blood count, serum levels, and clotting abilities.\n\n【27】*   Stool test.\n\n【28】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), X-ray, and CT (computed tomography) scans are used to see if there is any pathology in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【29】*   Gastroscopy or colonoscopy to assess the gut condition.\n\n【30】What Are the Treatment Options Available for Black Stools?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Treatment for black stools depends on the cause. Treating the underlying condition will treat this problem. The treatment options include:\n\n【32】*   Sitz bath for preventing hemorrhoids from bleeding.\n\n【33】*   Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) will be prescribed to heal the ulcers.\n\n【34】*   Stool softener to treat constipation.\n\n【35】*   Antibiotics and immunosuppressants for IBD and infection.\n\n【36】*   Antacids for bleeding ulcers.\n\n【37】*   In severe cases, surgery will be recommended.\n\n【38】*   Surgery is necessary for vein abnormalities, polyps, and obstructions.\n\n【39】*   For cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery might be needed.\n\n【40】Too much bleeding can result in severe anemia, which can also be fatal. If you have developed severe anemia, a blood transfusion might be necessary.\n\n【41】How Can Black Stools Be Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】Dietary changes are the most suggested way to prevent black stools. Some of the causes of black stools can be prevented by:\n\n【43】*   Drinking plenty of water. It is recommended to drink 2 liters of water every day.\n\n【44】*   Eating a diet rich in fiber. Beans, green peas, and lentils are found to be rich in fibers.\n\n【45】*   Consume whole grains.\n\n【46】*   Avoid eating processed meats.\n\n【47】*   Avoid consuming refined sugars, trans fat, and saturated fat.\n\n【48】*   Consume more fruits and vegetables.\n\n【49】*   Exercise regularly.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Black or tarry stools do not always suggest a serious condition. If the cause is food (licorice and beetroot), then black stool is not a problem. If it is accompanied by other symptoms, then consult a doctor online. So ultimately, the severity of black stools is measured by the accompanying symptoms.\n\n【52】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【53】* * *\n\n【54】#### **1.**删除换行**What Does a Black Stool Indicate?**\n\n【55】Black stools are termed as “melena.” Black stools most often indicate the presence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There can be many causes for upper digestive tract bleeding like peptic ulcer disease, a tumor, or liver disease, etc. Black stools can also be caused by the intake of certain medicines like iron supplements.\n\n【56】#### **2.**删除换行**What Does Tarry Stool Look Like?**\n\n【57】The appearance of black tarry stools is because the red blood cells that are released from the bleeding site are broken down by the digestive enzymes. This process turns the stool black. A dark tarry stool looks very sticky, and it is very foul-smelling. Thus, gastrointestinal bleeding is a medical emergency, and if a person notices his or her stools with these features, immediate medical treatment is necessary.\n\n【58】#### **3.**删除换行**Should I Worry If My Stool Is Black?**\n\n【59】Black stools can be caused by varied reasons, the simplest reason would be the intake of dark-colored foods, and the most severe cause could be ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. It is mandatory for the doctor to rule out internal bleeding when you have a black stool. When you have other symptoms like vomiting, pain, and diarrhea, immediate medical care is needed. Therefore, the black stool is something you have to worry about.\n\n【60】#### **4.**删除换行**What Medications Cause Black Stool?**\n\n【61】Medications that cause a patient to present with black stool are iron supplements, activated charcoal, and medicines that contain bismuth in them. Therefore, when a doctor prescribes these kinds of medications to patients, it is necessary to educate the patients about black stools. This will avoid unnecessary fear in patients.\n\n【62】#### **5.**删除换行**How Long Does Black Stool Last?**\n\n【63】When the black stools are induced due to the intake of medicines, it might last during the complete period of medications.

In the United States, 6% to 12% of women are diagnosed with PCOS. This condition can continue after delivery also.\n\n【5】What Is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome?\n----------------------------------\n\n【6】*   One of the common causes of female infertility is PCOS. An irregular menstrual cycle and infertility characterize the condition due to abnormal hormone levels. Sometimes affected women may not have periods, or they may not occur regularly. They encounter missed periods.\n\n【7】*   The condition causes numerous small cysts in the ovaries that are formed along the outer edge of the ovary. Some may or may not have a cyst in their ovaries. The body has excess male hormones (androgens) and the eggs are not formed properly in the ovary and are not released during ovulation. The lack of ovulation causes the ovaries to start developing numerous small cysts.\n\n【8】*   The progesterone hormone is also deficient in women since progesterone is needed to form eggs, and the ovaries fail to develop mature eggs. Instead, they develop small cysts in the ovaries, and such ovaries are called polycystic ovaries.\n\n【9】*   Due to increased insulin levels, the ovaries release more androgens, suppressing the ovulation process. Women also develop insulin resistance that leads to excess glucose circulating in the blood. Elevated insulin level indicates insulin resistance that ultimately poses a risk for type 2 diabetes. Obesity and overweight are the contributing factors to insulin resistance.\n\n【10】**Factors Contributing to PCOS Include:**\n\n【11】*   Genetic factor, X-linked autosomal dominant.\n\n【12】*   Obesity.\n\n【13】*   Family history of PCOS (mother, sister, or aunt with a previous history of PCOS).\n\n【14】*   Diabetes.\n\n【15】*   Chronic low-grade inflammation.\n\n【16】*   Hyperinsulinemia (defect in insulin action or secretion).\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Irregular menstrual cycle with heavy bleeding during menstruation.\n\n【19】*   Abnormal hair growth in the chest, abdomen, arms, and face.\n\n【20】*   Acne on the back, face, and chest.\n\n【21】*   Women with PCOS have obesity and trouble losing weight.\n\n【22】*   Pockets of cysts lining the ovary.\n\n【23】*   Hair thinning on the scalp (male pattern baldness).\n\n【24】*   Inability to conceive because of lack of ovulation.\n\n【25】*   Darkening of the skin (milky white patches) in the neck, armpit, and groin (between the legs).\n\n【26】*   Androgen increases visceral fat in women.\n\n【27】*   Pelvic pain.\n\n【28】*   Hyperandrogenism.\n\n【29】*   Difficulty getting pregnant.\n\n【30】*   Increase in muscle mass due to androgen.\n\n【31】*   Low back or lower abdominal pain during periods.\n\n【32】Women with PCOS are often insulin resistant. This condition is caused as their bodies can produce insulin but are not taken up by the tissues, which leads to excess insulin circulating in the blood.\n\n【33】How Does PCOS Impact Cardiac Health?\n------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   Elevated cholesterol levels, high insulin, high blood pressure, and glucose tolerance are common in PCOS and contribute to developing cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【35】*   Cholesterol is a fatty substance required to make vitamin D, hormones, and bile acids. The liver and intestine make up 80% of the cholesterol in the body. High cholesterol levels can bind with other substances in the blood, leading to plaque (fibrofatty tissue) that sticks to the artery walls. This fibrofatty plaque obstructs the blood flow, so the pressure is increased in circulation to push the blood through the blood vessels.\n\n【36】What Is the Link Between High Cholesterol Levels and Insulin Resistance in PCOS?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   Carbohydrates from the meal are broken down into glucose and absorbed through the intestinal wall. Then insulin, the primary regulator of carbohydrates, transports glucose to various parts of the cells. Insulin breaks the fat into fatty acids.\n\n【38】*   During insulin resistance, the insulin receptors become unresponsive to insulin. It leads to elevated fat levels in the body. The LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and triglyceride result in fibrofatty deposits in the walls of the blood vessels. When cells no longer respond to insulin, there is an elevated blood glucose level.\n\n【39】*   As a result of insulin resistance, patients may develop abnormal cholesterol profiles, an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or bad cholesterol, and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides.\n\n【40】*   These cholesterol abnormalities increase the risk of heart diseases, like atherosclerosis (plaque formation in the artery) and stroke. Thus diabetes and cardiac diseases are interlinked in PCOS.\n\n【41】**Lipid profile is highly influenced by PCOS that includes;**\n\n【42】*   Elevation in triglycerides (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL).\n\n【43】*   Decreased HDL cholesterol levels (less than 50 mg/dL).\n\n【44】*   Increased LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n【45】*   Increased VLDL cholesterol levels.\n\n【46】*   Women suffering from PCOS have a greater risk of obesity and vice versa.\n\n【47】How Is Obesity Linked With Cardiovascular Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】*   Insulin resistance is a contributing risk factor for obesity. Women with PCOS either have more insulin, or the insulin they produce does not work as it should. So the liver produces abnormal insulin levels to compensate for the high blood glucose level.\n\n【49】*   The abnormal insulin levels in the body produce more male sex hormones and androgens. The androgens play a significant role in the increase of visceral fat. High visceral fats increase blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the risk for type 2 diabetes. The women become vulnerable to the apple-shaped abdomen where the fat get deposited in the abdomen, which is highly risky for cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【50】*   Obese patients have hypertension (high blood pressure), cholesterol abnormalities, and type 2 diabetes which are factors for heart diseases.\n\n【51】*   Obesity can build up excess fat in the blood vessels. The high blood glucose and plaque build-up constantly insult the endothelium of the heart and cause vascular inflammation that results in coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke.\n\n【52】What Are the Diagnostic Tests for PCOS?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Pelvic ultrasound.\n\n【54】*   Laparoscopy.\n\n【55】*   Specific blood test - Testosterone level test.\n\n【56】*   Androgen level test.\n\n【57】*   Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test.\n\n【58】*   Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\n\n【59】*   Glucose tolerance test.\n\n【60】*   Fasting blood glucose test.\n\n【61】*   Blood pressure level check-up.\n\n【62】What Is the Treatment for PCOS?\n-------------------------------\n\n【63】Weight loss with a low-calorie or mediterranean diet prevents the risk of cardiovascular diseases. A mediterranean diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, potatoes, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, heart-healthy fats, spices, and extra virgin olive oil.\n\n【64】*   This diet limits fried and processed food containing trans fats, which have no nutrition.\n\n【65】*   The diet limits saturated fat and trans fat. Saturated fats can raise high LDL, which is responsible for plaque (fat and cholesterol build up in the blood vessels) formation (atherosclerosis) in the blood vessels. Trans fat has no nutrition. Both saturated and trans fats cause inflammation of blood vessels.\n\n【66】*   The diet emphasizes healthy unsaturated fats, including omega-3 fatty acids. Healthy unsaturated fats fight high blood glucose levels, support brain health, and maintain cholesterol levels in the body.\n\n【67】*   Women experience heavy bleeding during pregnancy which can cause anemia. They should consider taking iron-rich foods such as eggs, spinach, green leafy vegetables, and folic acid supplements.\n\n【68】*   Hormonal birth control includes pills, shots, and an intrauterine device (IUD) that helps regulate the period cycle and treats acne and excess hair growth.\n\n【69】*   Progestin therapy by taking progestin for 10 to 15 days for two months can regulate the menstrual cycle.\n\n【70】*   Progestin helps with getting pregnant and inhibits androgen production.\n\n【71】*   Exercise plays a vital role in weight management. An hour of exercise minimum for a day is compulsory.\n\n【72】*   Gentle exercises, aerobic exercises, cycling, and swimming are recommended.\n\n【73】*   Metformin is a drug used to treat diabetes as well as control insulin levels. These help with controlling the androgen level, and one can see improvements in their menstrual cycle.\n\n【74】*   Avoiding smoking and alcohol.\n\n【75】*   Essential oils from the plant have a variety of fragrances that help one feel good.\n\n【76】**Conclusion:**\n\n【77】PCOS can sometimes be difficult and frustrating for some women, but healthy food and lifestyle modifications can help cure this condition. There is no permanent cure for PCOS. But lifestyle changes, a good diet, and constant motivation can prevent all odds. Consulting a doctor and taking treatment is the best option. Under the expert guidance of the physician and by following a healthy lifestyle with required modifications, one can conceive naturally.

It can be understood by an example- replacement of bone and joint, such as those found in hip replacement, could also be considered as an artificial organ; a pacemaker that controls the electrical events of the heart is also considered as an artificial organ. But people should not get confused between an artificial organ and an artificial device, for example- dialysis is a device that is used in kidney failure and supports the patients to retain their life, and it is an artificial device but not an organ.\n\n【2】What Is the Purpose of Artificial Tissues and Organs?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The use of artificial organs is first tested and implemented on animals to determine their success rate. There are many factors responsible for constructing and installing artificial organs; they are:\n\n【4】*   Providing life support to prevent imminent death while awaiting a transplant.\n\n【5】*   Improving the patient's quality of life through cosmetic restoration after cancer surgery or an accident.\n\n【6】*   Dramatically improving the patient’s ability for self-care, for example, artificial limbs.\n\n【7】*   Improving the patient’s ability to interact socially, for example, cochlear implant.\n\n【8】Some examples of artificial organs and tissues are:\n\n【9】1.  **Brain:** A neural prosthesis is considered a substitute for motor, sensitive or cognitive functions that might have been damaged due to some injury or disease. Neurostimulators and deep brain stimulators send electrical impulses to the brain to treat movement and neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and urinary incontinence. These devices often serve to eliminate the symptoms by disrupting the output of malfunctioning nerve centers.\n\n【10】2.  **Eye:** It is the most successful function in replacing artificial eyes implanted on the retina, optic nerve, or other related locations inside the brain. Its function is to recognize the levels of brightness, swatches of color, and basic geometric shapes, proving the potential of concepts.\n\n【11】3.  **Ear:** In case when a person is deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears, an implant called a cochlear implant is surgically implanted. Cochlear implants bypass most of the auditory system to facilitate a sense of sound through a microphone, and some other electronic devices are there used to place behind the ear. This is a type of implant that receives the signal and transfers it to the electrodes, which in turn activates the cochlear nerve.\n\n【12】4.  **Artificial Limbs:** The artificial prosthesis of arms and legs is intended to restore form and function and facilitate them to walk again or continue the use of two hands in people who have gone through amputation or peg leg people. It is made up of new plastic and carbon fiber, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. A prosthesis can roughly be categorized as upper and lower extremities and can take many shapes and sizes.\n\n【13】5.  **Lungs:** Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to take a significant load of lung, tissue, and heart in which one or more catheters are placed into the patient, and a pump is used to flow blood over the hollow membrane fibers which exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood. Similar to ECMO, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has a similar setup but mainly benefits the patient through carbon dioxide removal. Rather than oxygenation to allow the lungs to relax and heal.\n\n【14】6.  **Liver:** The artificial liver is used to restore form and function in the replacement of a normal liver or is only made possible by the fact that it uses cells of the real liver.\n\n【15】7.  **Kidney:** An artificial kidney deals with the blood clot, which can both plug up the devices and would allow blood to filtrate continuously, which would help reduce kidney disease illness and increase the quality of life of patients.\n\n【16】8.  **Ovaries:** Artificial ovaries are generally used with women; those oocytes are damaged and received early menopause due to chemotherapy in cancer patients, with self-assembled microtissues, and will be used for the purpose of in vitro maturation of immature oocytes.\n\n【17】9.  **Pancreas:** An artificial pancreas is used in place of a healthy pancreas and works as a substitute for those who suffer from endocrine disturbances, especially in diabetic patients, and is used to improve insulin replacement therapy. It includes using an insulin pump under closed-loop control, developing a bio-artificial pancreas that is made through certain beta cells, bio-compatible sheets, and various gene therapy also involved in the manufacturing.\n\n【18】10.  **Bladder:** The two ways to replace bladder function include either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder in situ. Standard methods for replacing the bladder involve constructing a bladder-like pouch from intestinal tissue using stem cells.\n\n【19】11.  **Red Blood Cells:** Artificial RBCs (red blood cells) are made from purified human hemoglobin proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer that can capture oxygen when blood pH is low. Artificial RBCs are 100 % dependent on nanotechnology. A successful artificial RBC can perform all the functions that a human RBC does.\n\n【20】12.  **Testes:** Men who have testicular abnormalities through birth defects or injury have been able to replace the damaged testicles using a testicular prosthesis. The prosthesis cannot restore biological reproductive function. However, it improves the mental health of such patients.\n\n【21】13.  **Thymus:** When people become old, their thymus does not work well, so to restore its form and function through various foreign materials, an artificial thymus supports the body to fight infections and also grants the body to eliminate cancer cells. The artificial thymus plays an important role in the immune system by using blood stem cells to produce more T cells to fight infections and also gives the ability to eliminate cancer cells.\n\n【22】14.  **Trachea:** An artificial trachea can get fully developed and integrates with the host while withstanding respiratory forces as well as the rotational and longitudinal movement the trachea undergoes.\n\n【23】Conclusion:\n-----------\n\n【24】As discussed above, artificial tissue and organs are proven to improve lives and help those who are disabled in any way to live meaningful lives. It is helpful in many circumstances and makes a diseased person live long with the help of restoring the form and function of the organs. Nowadays, it has succeeded at a high rate, and people with organ failure can rely on artificial organs as the demand will increase in the coming days as the lifestyle of people at present is getting worse.\n\n【25】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】#### **1.**删除换行**What Organs Can Be Replaced With Artificial Organs?**\n\n【28】The heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, stomach, and intestine are the organs that can be replaced through transplantation. In addition, the cornea, bone, tendon, skin, islets of the pancreas, heart valves, nerves, and veins are all types of tissue that can be replaced. Stem cells and bone marrow cells can also be replaced.\n\n【29】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is Artificial Organ Transplantation?**\n\n【30】It is replacing a malfunctioning natural organ with a duplicate artificial organ to improve a specific function so the patient can return to everyday life as soon as possible.\n\n【31】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Major Challenges of Fully Artificial Organs?**\n\n【32】Human vital organs are complicated, so making them out of artificial materials is hard. In addition, all artificial organs can only function to a certain extent. Other (non-vital) organs in humans, such as the sense organs and the blood vessels that bring them blood, which often needs multiple fixations.\n\n【33】#### **4.**删除换行**Can Humans Live With Artificial Organs?**\n\n【34】Yes, humans can live a good life with artificial organs.\n\n【35】#### **5.**删除换行**What Organ Do We No Longer Use?**\n\n【36】\\- Appendix: The appendix is a well-known useless organ. The appendix once helped individuals digest cellulose-rich plants. Plant-eating vertebrates still use their appendix to digest plants, but humans do not change it.  \n\\- Third molars: Because of soft foods and cooked grains, humans no longer need powerful jaws. We have smaller jaws. Thus our wisdom teethchange fit and have become useless.  \n\\- Arrector Pili: When the arrector pili contracts, they are made up of muscle fibers that cause goosebumps. Our ancestors, who had a lot more hair on their bodies, made good use of these fibers, but we do not  need them anymore.  \n\\- Auricular Muscles: Auricular muscles control the part of the ear that can be seen, but people no longer know how to use them. These muscles help other mammals to find prey and detect potential harm.  \n\\- The Pyramidalis Muscle: The pyramidalis muscle, located in the lower belly, has a triangular form. There are zero to two of these muscles in humans, but they are useless.\n\n【37】#### **6.**删除换行**How Long Do Artificial Organs Last?**\n\n【38】Many organ transplants do not  last a lifetime. Some transplantations may cause low-grade inflammation following the transplant or a chronic sickness or condition. In addition, young people often outlast transplanted organs.\n\n【39】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Biggest Problem with Organ Transplants?**\n\n【40】The severe lack of organs available for transplantation all around the world is a serious cause for concern. According to estimates provided by the World Health Organization, just ten percent of the global organ transplantation demand is satisfied.\n\n【41】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are the Advantages of Artificial Organs?**\n\n【42】They do not pose any risk of disease transmission from the donor to the receiver, and there is no longer any requirement to match tissue types. In addition, because cartilage replacement is frequently a cosmetic procedure, the patient typically has the luxury of waiting the necessary time to culture the tissue.\n\n【43】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Future of Artificial Organs?**\n\n【44】Scientists are discovering better, cheaper, and safer paths to make artificial organs with these pathways can potentially cut the waiting time for organ transplants. In the laboratory, researchers are successfully fabricating artificial organs such as hearts, livers, lungs, urethras, windpipes, and more organs.\n\n【45】#### **10.**删除换行**Do Artificial Organs Get Rejected?**\n\n【46】Yes, they do due to the body's immune response. Blood clots and vascular blockage are typical symptoms of the immune rejection reaction that follows the transplantation of an artificial organ or medical device. These symptoms are brought on by the coagulation of blood that occurs when the blood vessels of the donor organ and the recipient's blood vessels are connected. At this point, the success or failure of the transplantation procedure can be determined.\n\n【47】#### **11.**删除换行**Can We Grow Artificial Tissues and Organs in the Lab?**\n\n【48】Even though more sophisticated organ tissues like those of the heart, lungs, and liver have been successfully replicated in the laboratory, these organs still need to be fully reproducible and ready to be implanted into a patient. These tissues, on the other hand, have the potential to be highly beneficial in research, particularly in the process of medication (drug) development.\n\n【49】#### **12.**删除换行**Can Artificial Organs Extend Life?**\n\n【50】The response to that question is absolutely no. There is currently no artificial organ replacement that offers the same improvement in chances of survival as an allotransplant, which is a transplant of organs from one human to another.\n\n【51】#### **13.**删除换行**What Are the Benefits of Genetically Engineered Organs?**\n\n【52】In humans, genetic engineering can be utilized to regrow organs, which has the potential to save lives. In humans, certain diseases can be cured by using genetic engineering to replace damaged or faulty genes. Scientists working in the field of genetic engineering can develop drugs that will help individuals recover from their illnesses.\n\n【53】#### **14.**删除换行**What Is an Artificial Organ Called?**\n\n【54】The artificial organ can be called as human made prostheses.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine  \n    https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/tissue-engineering-and-regenerative-medicine\n*   NCBI Bioartificial Organ Manufacturing Technologies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6322143/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "85f580c8-21bd-4885-ad3c-3acbe38412ef", "title": "Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: Type, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment", "text": "【0】Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: Type, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The term nephrogenic diabetes insipidus appeared in the medical literature for the first time in 1947. This condition was previously known as diabetes insipidus renalis. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is distinct from central diabetes insipidus, a rare disorder characterized by the body's inability to produce vasopressin. Scientists are unsure how common nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is, but they believe it is uncommon. Diabetes insipidus is classified into four types:\n\n【2】*   **Central Diabetes Insipidus:** It is brought on by damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Due to the damage, the body cannot normally produce, store, or release antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\n\n【3】*   **Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus:** It impairs the kidneys' ability to respond to ADH.\n\n【4】*   **Dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidus:** It is also known as primary polydipsia, and occurs when the hypothalamus' thirst mechanism fails. As a result, it causes one to become excessively thirsty and drink an excessive amount of fluids.\n\n【5】*   **Gestational Diabetes Insipidus:** It is a condition that occurs only during pregnancy.\n\n【6】What Is Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a medical condition in which the kidneys cannot balance bodily fluids properly. The body does not properly respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin). As a result, it excretes an excessive amount of urine, which can result in rapid, sometimes dangerous dehydration. It can be inherited or acquired. NDI is caused by complete or partial arginine vasopressin resistance in the kidneys. Vasopressin is an antidiuretic hormone that the kidney uses to maintain body water balance. NDI causes excessive urine production (polyuria), chronic excessive thirst (polydipsia), and potentially severe dehydration. Repeated bouts of severe dehydration can occur if left untreated, leading to serious complications.\n\n【8】What Causes Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The kidneys filter blood to eliminate waste and excess fluid from the body in the form of urine. ADH (vasopressin) is a hormone that aids the body in maintaining a healthy balance of fluid intake and urine output. ADH assists the body in determining when to produce less urine in a healthy person. When a person sweats excessively or does not drink enough fluids, higher levels of vasopressin causes the kidneys to produce less urine. When a person's body has enough fluid, lower levels of ADH signal the kidneys to produce urine.\n\n【10】However, if the body does not know how to respond to vasopressin properly, the kidneys produce an excessive amount of urine. This is seen in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be inherited or acquired.\n\n【11】*   **Inherited NDI**\n\n【12】The most common inherited nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is an X-linked trait that affects the arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor 2 gene and has variable penetrance in heterozygous females. Females who are heterozygous for the gene may have no symptoms or a variable degree of polyuria and polydipsia, or they could be as severely affected as males. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused in rare cases by an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant mutation in the aquaporin-2 gene, which can affect both males and females.\n\n【13】*   **Acquired NDI**\n\n【14】Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when disorders (majorly tubulointerstitial diseases) or medications disrupt the medulla or distal nephrons and hinder urine concentrating ability, causing the kidneys to appear vasopressin insensitive. Among these disorders are the following:\n\n【15】*   Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\n\n【16】*   Sickle cell nephropathy.\n\n【17】*   Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease complex.\n\n【18】*   Release of obstructing periureteral fibrosis.\n\n【19】*   Bardet-Biedl syndrome.\n\n【20】*   Medullary sponge kidney.\n\n【21】*   Hypercalcemia.\n\n【22】*   Amyloidosis.\n\n【23】*   Sjögren syndrome.\n\n【24】*   Pyelonephritis.\n\n【25】*   Certain types of cancer (e.g. myeloma, sarcoma).\n\n【26】Many medications, particularly Lithium, but others (for example, Demeclocycline, Amphotericin B, Dexamethasone, Dopamine, Ifosfamide, Ofloxacin, Orlistat) may cause chronic hypokalemic nephropathy. Idiopathic-acquired NDI is also possible. Any patient who is elderly, sick, or has acute or chronic renal insufficiency can develop a mild form of acquired NDI.\n\n【27】Furthermore, certain clinical syndromes may resemble NDI:\n\n【28】*   During the second half of pregnancy, the placenta can secrete vasopressinase (a syndrome called gestational diabetes insipidus).\n\n【29】*   Some patients, after pituitary surgery, secrete an ineffective ADH precursor rather than vasopressin.\n\n【30】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The following symptoms are common in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus:\n\n【32】*   Dehydration symptoms include dry mouth, fatigue, and dizziness.\n\n【33】*   Extreme thirst.\n\n【34】*   Urine output in large quantities (more than three liters a day in adults and two liters daily in children).\n\n【35】Signs of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in an infant may include:\n\n【36】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【37】*   Inability to thrive or gain weight.\n\n【38】*   Fever.\n\n【39】*   Irritability.\n\n【40】*   Poor appetite.\n\n【41】*   Seizures.\n\n【42】*   Vomiting.\n\n【43】How Is Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The healthcare provider can diagnose nephrogenic diabetes insipidus based on the following criteria:\n\n【45】*   Blood tests.\n\n【46】*   Symptoms.\n\n【47】*   Urine tests.\n\n【48】*   Water deprivation test, in which no liquid is consumed for several hours and urine output is measured.\n\n【49】*   A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland will be performed to look for abnormalities.\n\n【50】*   If there is a family history of diabetes insipidus, one should consider genetic testing.\n\n【51】How Is Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Treated?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【52】The treatment of NDI is tailored to the specific symptoms that each person exhibits. The primary goal of therapy is to increase fluid intake while decreasing urine output. Dietary changes and drug administration are examples of specific treatments.\n\n【53】*   Individuals suffering from NDI must drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Water may be required regularly for infants. If the child is unable to consume enough water to match their urine output, a feeding tube may be inserted into the stomach or intestine. Heavy sleepers may need to be roused in the middle of the night to drink water and urinate.\n\n【54】*   To reduce urine output, dietary changes and drug therapy are used. As sodium contributes to water loss, people with NDI may be put on a very low sodium diet (0.5 grams per day).\n\n【55】*   Diuretics (drugs that reduce the amount of water excreted in the urine) may also be used. Diuretics, such as Hydrochlorothiazide or Chlorothiazide, reduce water loss by inhibiting the amount of salt absorbed by the kidneys. These medications can be taken alone or in combination with other medications, such as Indomethacin or Amiloride. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase urine concentration while decreasing urine output. Indomethacin, which can be used alone, has been linked to negative side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【56】*   Amiloride is a diuretic that aids in the maintenance of potassium levels, which may fall during Hydrochlorothiazide therapy.\n\n【57】*   Individuals with acquired NDI can reverse their kidney's resistance to vasopressin by treating the underlying cause (correcting metabolic imbalances or discontinuing the drug use). This reversal, however, could take weeks. In some cases, such as those caused by the use of Lithium, it can take years for the kidneys to respond to vasopressin again, or the damage may be irreversible.\n\n【58】*   Individuals with NDI who are scheduled for surgery and need no food or drink for a period of time before the surgery should consult the doctors. Before or during surgery, affected individuals will require proper hydration, usually through an IV.\n\n【59】*   Genetic counseling is recommended for people with inherited forms of the disorder and their families. Other forms of treatment are symptomatic and supportive.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**\n\n【61】Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a condition that affects urine output. When the body does not properly respond to the antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), it produces an excessive amount of urine. This can result in rapid dehydration. It can be managed by based on the symptoms through medications or dietary changes. A healthcare provider must be consulted if an individual suspects the condition.\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>*   Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/\n*   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/\n*   Diabetes Insipidus  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/diabetes-insipidus</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

So the term aortitis refers to inflammation of the aorta, which can occur either due to trauma, infections, connective tissue disorders, or autoimmune disorders. If the cause of aortitis is unknown, then it can be called “isolated aortitis.” As the aorta is the main blood vessel in the human body, any inflammation of the aorta can affect the entire system.\n\n【2】The inflammation can restrict blood flow which can be a threatening condition for all the vital organs. It can also cause aortic insufficiency in that blood flows in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole due to dilation of the aorta. The aortitis also leads to decreased pulses in the upper extremities. Depending on the involvement of other blood vessels, symptoms can vary in aortitis. It is generally treated by curing the underlying pathology that causes aortitis.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of Aortitis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】As aortitis can be due to various pathologies, symptoms also vary depending upon the underlying conditions. Generally, aortitis has three phases. At the earlier phase, aortitis is very much asymptomatic. The three phases of aortitis are;\n\n【5】*   **Phase 1** - It is characterized by nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, arthralgia, weight loss, and fever.\n\n【6】*   **Phase 2** - It involves tenderness of arteries associated with pain.\n\n【7】*   **Phase 3** \\- It involves permanent injury to walls leading to symptoms of ischemia, occlusion of vessels in extremities, etc.\n\n【8】Depending upon each phase, symptoms will vary; general symptoms include;\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>I have an ear infection in both ears, and it has started to itch.

But the exact cause is still unknown. The causes can be categorized as;\n\n【25】a)**Infectious** - Caused due to bacterial infections, viral infections, tuberculosis, and syphilis.\n\n【26】b)**Non-infectious** - Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet’s disease, etc. This category is mainly responsible for chronic pain in the case of aortitis.\n\n【27】c)**Idiopathic**.\n\n【28】What Is Takayasu Arteritis and Giant Cell Arteritis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】These are the most common causes of aortitis.\n\n【30】a)**Takayasu Arteritis** - It is also known as Martorell syndrome or pulseless disease. It generally occurs in young women. It often appears as a secondary reaction to an autoimmune disorder. It has two stages; the first one is a pre-pulseless phase which is generally asymptomatic, and the second is a pulseless phase which includes symptoms related to stenosis, occlusion, or dilation of the aorta. The pulse is very feeble and almost nil in Takayasu arteritis. But we can hear bruits over narrowed arteries and brisk pulses in the legs on auscultation.\n\n【31】b)**Giant Cell Arteritis** \\- It is often identified as a systemic vascular disease. It is seen in age groups above 50 years. It is not just limited to cranial arteries. The main symptoms include severe headaches that are persistent, vision loss, scalp tenderness, etc.\n\n【32】The difference between the Takayasu and giant cell arteritis lies in the clinical pattern of vessels involved. Giant cell arteritis mainly involves the temporal artery, whereas Takayasu arteritis involves the aorta and its branches. This is the main reason for the difference in symptoms among them. The pathologic changes are the same for both.\n\n【33】When to See a doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【34】If you suddenly develop persistent headaches, decrease in vision, shortness of breath, any symptoms of stroke, and a sudden increase in blood pressure, seek medical attention as soon as possible.\n\n【35】What Is the Prognosis of Aortitis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】Affected people with the disease identified at the earlier stages, have a high chance of survival. As the disease progresses, the complications involved are also high, which can lead to an unfavorable prognosis.\n\n【37】How to Diagnose Aortitis?\n-------------------------\n\n【38】For the diagnosis of aortitis, understanding the medical history of the patient, physical examination, laboratory studies, imaging studies, and biopsy should be done. It is very important to identify the cause of aortitis to initiate the proper treatment as the use of immunosuppressants is contradictory in the case of aortitis caused due to infectious disease.\n\n【39】a)**Physical Examination** \\- Any alterations in blood pressure and pulse can be identified. Physical examination also reveals bruits in narrowed blood vessels and diminished pulse in any of the limbs.\n\n【40】b)**Laboratory Studies** - Blood tests are done to estimate levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, which are indicators of inflammation.\n\n【41】c)**Imaging Studies** - Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are widely used. It is useful in finding out acute and chronic changes in the arterial walls due to inflammation, edema, and fibrosis.\n\n【42】d)**Biopsy** - The tissue from the arterial wall is taken for biopsy. The characteristic feature of aortitis is the inflammation of all layers of the aorta.\n\n【43】What Is the Treatment for Aortitis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【44】The treatment for aortitis can include both medical and surgical management.\n\n【45】The primary objectives of the treatment should include:\n\n【46】*   Preventing the progression of inflammation.\n\n【47】*   Treating the complications.\n\n【48】*   Preventing the chances of reappearance of the disease.\n\n【49】The management will vary according to the cause of the disease.\n\n【50】a)**Medical Management** - The aortitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can be treated with antibiotics like Minocycline. In the case of non-infectious aortitis, corticosteroids form an integral part of the treatment. Corticosteroids are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. They mainly suppress the activity of leukocytes and decrease capillary permeability. Drugs like Prednisone are generally recommended in corticosteroid therapy (corticosteroids are a class of drugs that lowers inflammation in the body. They also reduce immune system activity). Another class of drugs that play a vital role in the treatment of aortitis is immunosuppressants. Immunosuppressants like Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Cyclophosphamide are usually advised for the treatment.\n\n【51】b)**Surgical Management**\\- When there is a narrowing of the blood vessel due to aortitis, angioplasty or stents or bypass grafts are the surgical options available. Surgical repair is indicated when there is no response to medical treatment, significant hypertension, and cerebral ischemia.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】If you could relate the above-discussed symptoms and your condition to aortitis, do not panic. Identifying and treating the underlying cause can improve your condition and prevent you from encountering life-threatening complications.

The increased arterial pressure, when transmitted to the glomerular microcirculation, will result in injury to the glomeruli and result in glomerulosclerosis. It serves as one of the common causes of renal failure. The symptoms may be attributed to renal failure, and the treatment is aimed at controlling elevated blood pressure.\n\n【2】What Is Arteriolar Nephroscelerosis?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Arteriolar nephrosclerosis is a progressive impairment of the kidneys due to poorly controlled blood pressure. The poorly controlled hypertension results in damage to the renal tubules, blood vessels, glomeruli, and the interstitium. This, in turn, progresses to end-stage renal disease.\n\n【4】**What Is the Difference Between Benign and Malignant Hypertension?**\n\n【5】Benign hypertension is a chronic condition with an unknown cause slowly affecting the tissues as sequelae. Whereas malignant hypertension is a very high blood pressure that occurs rapidly, affecting the organs and causing damage. Arteriolar nephrosclerosis occurs as a complication of benign or chronic hypertension.\n\n【6】What Is the Pathophysiology of Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】In patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure, it affects the components of the kidneys, causing nephropathy. In arteriolar nephrosclerosis, there is a narrowing of the renal arteries caused by the deposition of homogenous pink hyaline material along the walls of the blood vessels. This, in turn, reduces the blood flow and oxygenation to the tissues causing ischemia;\n\n【8】slowly affecting the renal tissues causing interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and morphological changes in the glomeruli.\n\n【9】What Are the Morphological Changes Encountered in Glomeruli Due to Arteriolar Nephroscelerosis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The glomeruli show three types of morphological changes, it includes;\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>If a person with chronic kidney disease receives Toradol 60 mg,can that lead to acute renal failure?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>What diet can a chronic kidney disease patient follow?</u>\n\n【16】*   **Obsolescent Glomeruli** - Partially or fully collapsed glomerular tuft with the extracellular material in the Bowman's capsule.\n*   **Solidified Global Glomerulosclerosis** - The glomeruli are completely replaced by collagen, and the glomerular tuft is expanded.\n*   **Segmental Glomerulosclerosis** - In which the part of the glomeruli undergoes sclerosis.\n\n【17】**How Does Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Progress to Kidney Failure?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The above-said alterations in the glomeruli and periglomerular sclerosis (scarring around the glomeruli) will affect the functional nephrons reducing the functioning capacity of the kidneys, which subsequently progresses to kidney failure. Two proposed pathogenesis for kidney failure through hypertensive nephrosclerosis are;\n\n【19】*   **Glomerular Sclerosis** - The blood flow to the kidneys is decreased due to the narrowing of the renal arteries; thus, the kidneys shrink and lose function, causing kidney failure.\n*   **Glomerular Hypertension and Hyperfiltration** - The glomeruli undergo sclerosis and renal tissue ischemia due to chronic hypertension. On the other hand, the unaffected nephrons try to compensate for the functional loss and do more work to filter the waste products leading to renal failure.\n\n【20】**What Is the Epidemiology of Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?**\n\n【21】Arteriolar nephrosclerosis is one of the common causes of kidney failure. 17 to 25% of the patients under dialysis are affected by this condition due to uncontrolled hypertension. Studies report that the black population is highly susceptible to arteriolar nephrosclerosis.\n\n【22】**Who Is at High Risk for Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   High blood pressure.\n*   Old age.\n*   Pre-existing kidney disease.\n*   Diabetes.\n*   Obesity.\n*   Chronic inflammation.\n*   Smoking.\n\n【24】What Are the Symptoms of Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Symptoms may be attributed to progressing renal failure. It includes:\n\n【26】*   Tiredness.\n*   Lethargy.\n*   Vomiting.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Pruritus (itching all over the body).\n*   Loss of appetite.\n*   Confusion.\n*   Proteinuria (presence of protein in the urine).\n\n【27】How Is Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Diagnosis of this condition is based on the following:\n\n【29】**1\\. Clinical History:**\n\n【30】A thorough clinical history of the symptoms associated with the condition and the elevated blood pressure gives a major clue in diagnosing arteriolar nephrosclerosis.\n\n【31】**2\\. Monitoring Blood Pressure:**\n\n【32】The patient's blood pressure levels are elevated.\n\n【33】**3\\. Ultrasound of Kidney:**\n\n【34】Ultrasonographic examination of the kidney would reveal the deterioration of the kidney tissues owing to sclerosis and reduced kidney size due to reduced blood supply and tissue ischemia.\n\n【35】**4\\. Kidney Biopsy:**\n\n【36】Microscopic examination of the kidney tissues would reveal sclerosis of the glomeruli. The presence of homogenous pink hyaline material along the walls of the blood vessels causes the thickening of the blood vessels. Biopsy also shows the capillary basement membrane's thickening, the capillary lumen's collapse, and periglomerular scarring.\n\n【37】**5\\. Blood Examination:**\n\n【38】Blood examination would reveal the signs of decreased kidney function, such as elevated serum creatinine and urea levels.\n\n【39】**6\\. Urine Examination:**\n\n【40】Examination of urine would reveal the presence of protein in the urine, and the tiny tube-shaped particles called urinary casts in the urine sediments.\n\n【41】How Is Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Managed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The prime goal of treatment in arteriolar nephrosclerosis is to control elevated blood pressure levels. Followed by correcting the complications;\n\n【43】**1\\. ACE Inhibitors** - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be prescribed to reduce the high blood pressure levels.\n\n【44】**2\\. ARB Drugs** - Angiotensin II receptor blockers would also help in controlling hypertension.\n\n【45】**3\\. Combination Drugs** - A combination of ACE Inhibitors and ARB can be given in cases with severely high blood pressure levels.\n\n【46】**4\\. Calcium Channel Blockers And Thiazide Diuretics** - Can also be given to reduce hypertension.\n\n【47】**5\\. Chronic Kidney Disease** - Kidney disease caused by ischemia can be managed by restricting salt and fluid intake.\n\n【48】**6\\. End-Stage Renal Disease** - In such cases, dialysis is indicated, or kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice.\n\n【49】**7\\. Non-pharmacological Measures**\\- Other general measures such as:\n\n【50】*   Regular exercise.\n*   Weight loss.\n*   Salt restrictions.\n*   Limited water intake.\n\n【51】This would help control blood pressure and reduce the load on the kidneys.\n\n【52】**What Is the Prognosis of Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?**\n\n【53】The prognosis of this condition largely depends on blood pressure control and the amount of kidney damage. As renal failure develops slowly, the prior treatment would help prevent permanent kidney damage. Studies state that only 1 to 2 % of people develop renal failure after 5 to 10 years of arteriolar nephrosclerosis.\n\n【54】**Conclusion**\n\n【55】Arteriolar nephrosclerosis is a blood vessel disorder of the kidney caused as a result of chronic uncontrolled hypertension. It is reported to be one of the common causes of renal failure. The prognosis is reported to be good, with prompt management of hypertension.\n\n【56】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【57】* * *\n\n【58】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Nephrosclerosis Be Considered a Glomerular Disease?**\n\n【59】Nephrosclerosis shows glomerular involvement. Certain mechanisms suggest that glomerular ischemia can lead to nephrosclerosis and result from chronic hypertension. There is a narrowing of preglomerular arteries and arterioles, with a further reduction in glomerular blood flow.\n\n【60】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Most Common Condition Related to Nephrosclerosis?**\n\n【61】The most common condition related to nephrosclerosis is chronic hypertension. Once hypertension develops in a patient it further leads to a cycle of kidney injury, worsening of hypertension, nephrosclerosis, and further kidney injury is established.\n\n【62】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Nephrosclerosis Reversible?**\n\n【63】Nephrosclerosis can be reversed by treating hypertension and the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system through chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. It is considered a good method of reversing the process of malignant nephrosclerosis.\n\n【64】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Risk Factors for Patients With Nephrosclerosis?**\n\n【65】The factors for patients with nephrosclerosis involve metabolic disturbances, like obesity, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis. Histomorphometric studies have shown certain lesions occur due to aging apart from chronic hypertension.\n\n【66】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is Arteriolar Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis?**\n\n【67】Arteriolar hypertensive nephrosclerosis is a progressive kidney disorder caused by chronic uncontrolled hypertension. Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease may develop due to anorexia, vomiting, nausea, pruritus, somnolence, or confusion. There might be signs of end-organ damage secondary to hypertension. Treatment involves controlling blood pressure and supporting renal function.\n\n【68】#### **6.**删除换行**What Are the Disorders That Affect the Kidneys?**\n\n【69】The most common disorder that affects the kidneys is diabetes (both type 1 and type 2).  Other disorders include heart disease and obesity which can cause kidney failure. A long-term functional decline of the kidneys can lead to urinary tract issues and inflammation in different parts of the kidney.\n\n【70】#### **7.**删除换行**Which Type of Kidney Disease Is Caused by Hypertension?**\n\n【71】Uncontrolled high blood pressure or hypertension is the second leading cause of kidney failure in the United States. Severe high blood pressure can damage kidney function over a relatively short period of time. Complications of renal hypertension include heart attack and stroke.\n\n【72】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is Understood by Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease?**\n\n【73】Hypertensive chronic kidney disease causes high blood pressure resulting from the narrowing of arteries that carry blood to the kidneys. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common cause of hypertension and is also a complication of uncontrolled hypertension that can increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects.\n\n【74】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Hypertension Related to Chronic Kidney Disease?**\n\n【75】Hypertension is considered both a cause and effect of chronic kidney disease. Adequate control of hypertension is essential in chronic kidney disease patients as it leads to slow progression of the disease.\n\n【76】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is Stage 3 Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease?**\n\n【77】In Stage 3 chronic kidney disease, the kidneys show mild to moderate damage. Further, the kidneys are unable to filter waste and fluid properly out of the blood. This waste builds up in the body and begins to harm other areas, leading to anemia, high blood pressure, and problems with the bones.\n\n【78】#### **11.**删除换行**Can Stage 3 Kidney Disease Be Considered a Chronic Condition?**\n\n【79】In Stage 3 chronic kidney disease, the kidneys show mild to moderate damage. It occurs when the estimated glomerular filtration rate falls between 30 and 59, indicating moderate kidney damage and an apparent loss of kidney function.\n\n【80】#### **12.**删除换行**What Is Understood by Benign Hypertension?**\n\n【81】Benign hypertension is high blood pressure that has a relatively long and symptomless course. It amounts to around 95 percent of all cases of hypertension. This type of high blood pressure occurs with no other medical condition.\n\n【82】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is Understood by Malignant Hypertension?**\n\n【83】Malignant hypertension is extremely high blood pressure that occurs suddenly and quickly. The kidneys filter the waste products and excrete fluid when the blood pressure in the bloodstream forces blood through the structures inside the kidney.\n\n【84】#### **14.**删除换行**How Can Malignant Hypertension Be Treated?**\n\n【85】Malignant hypertension can be treated with various parenteral and oral agents like Nitroprusside sodium, Hydralazine, Nicardipine, Fenoldopam, Nitroglycerin, and Enalaprilat. The treatment of malignant hypertension usually starts in the emergency room these drugs are administered through a vein or intravenously.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Vascular mechanisms of renal fibrosis.

{"seq_id": "5da929ef-b0d6-4e46-b16a-b41a5b6111c3", "title": "Cellular Aging - Definition and Causes", "text": "【0】Cellular Aging - Definition and Causes\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Soon after birth, the cellular aging process begins; as cells multiply, divide, and increase in size, they age too. The body has planned a process to replace these aging cells with newer cells. Aging is one of the periods in the cell life cycle. The regulation and subsequent breakdown of cellular processes represent a programmatic decision by the cell to either continue or abandon maintenance procedures with age.\n\n【2】What Is Cellular Aging?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Cellular aging is referred to as cellular senescence. Cellular aging is a defense mechanism of the cell to prevent further damage. The cell becomes incapable of re-entering the cell cycle. The aging cell is larger when compared to surrounding cells. Older cells do not divide further. Cell division of aging cells can lead to some errors and can harm themselves or the surrounding tissues. It takes around six weeks for a normal cell to turn into a senescent, aging cell.\n\n【4】What Causes Cellular Aging?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】**DNA -** Deoxyribonuclease replication is an important part of the cell life cycle. The body has specific triggers involved, which stop the replication process. These triggers are present within the aging cell or from the environment. Cell aging takes place as a physiologic as well as a pathologic response. Cell aging can also be linked to overnutrition. The following are the causes of cellular aging:\n\n【6】*   **DNA Damage:** Every cell consists of chromosomes. These chromosomes have all the genetic information. The end of these chromosomes is called a telomere. After each replication cycle, the telomere shortens. Without telomere, cell replication is unstructured and dangerous. Ultraviolet rays or UV rays can cause DNA damage. So cells are altered to maintain the genetic code.\n\n【7】*   **Oxidative Stress:** The reactive oxygen species in a cell's environment can lead to replication errors. Cellular replication discontinues in the presence of such reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress acts as a trigger for cell aging.\n\n【8】*   **Reduced Autophagy:** Autophagy is a self-destructive process. A cell and its components fail as the cell ages. A cell self-digests its products in a process called autophagy. A cell consists of digestive enzymes called lysozymes. These lysosomes are responsible for breaking down damaged cell components. This increases protein levels within the cell and hampers replication. This process triggers aging.\n\n【9】What Is the Difference Between Apoptosis and Cellular Aging?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】An aging cell loses its ability to replicate. They can perform their original function. They are less efficient and less productive. However, apoptosis is programmed cell death. Older cells apoptose, but not all aging cells apoptose. Apoptosis is triggered to control the replication of poorly structured cells.\n\n【11】What Causes Premature Cellular Aging?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】Cellular aging cannot be controlled. Some activities can act as triggers for premature aging. Following are the activities:\n\n【13】*   Smoking.\n\n【14】*   Drug use.\n\n【15】*   Stress.\n\n【16】*   Sunburns and tanning.\n\n【17】*   Obesity.\n\n【18】What Are the Physiologic Roles of Senescence?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Cellular aging affects tissue homeostasis. Cellular aging also plays an important role in tissue remodeling and wound healing; it acts as a protective stress response. During repair, excessive connective tissue formation triggers fibrosis. Accumulation of extracellular proteins leads to the formation of scars, unstable structures, and non-functional tissue. It acts as an anti-cancer phenomenon and limits the malignant transformation of cells. If aging cells accumulate, it leads to age-related diseases. The aging of cells is required for the proper development of embryos and tissue repair. In cancer, cell aging helps to prevent tumor formation.\n\n【20】What Are Age-Related Diseases?\n------------------------------\n\n【21】All organisms exhibit loss in tissue and function over a period. This leads to age-related diseases. Markers of aging accumulate in the tissues triggering the diseases mentioned below.\n\n【22】*   **Atherosclerosis:** Accumulation of lipoproteins in the arteries activates certain smooth muscle cells. These cells trigger an inflammatory response. These cells form a wax-like substance called plaque. The smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells from this plaque release aging markers. Thus, the gaining of cells acts as a protective barrier against atherosclerosis.\n\n【23】*   **Osteoarthritis:** Osteoarthritis is decreased function of the synovial joint due to degeneration of cartilage between the joint, presence of bony projections, inflammation, and thickening of ligaments. These changes cause pain and difficulty in moving. The cartilage-forming cells called chondrocytes secrete extracellular matrix for the maintenance of the cartilage between the joints. They also release aging markers. Chondrocytes lose this ability over time. Transplantation of aging markers through ear cartilage helps with the treatment of osteoarthritis.\n\n【24】*   **Osteoporosis:** Osteoporosis occurs due to a change in bone turnover rate. In osteoporosis, bone resorption is more than bone formation. This leads to a decrease in bone density and strength, which increases the risk of fracture. Aging bone cells activate osteoclast and bone-resorbing cells and stimulate bone resorption.\n\n【25】*   **Glaucoma:** Glaucoma is a condition in which blindness occurs due to progressive degeneration of the optic nerve. This occurs due to increased pressure in the eye, followed by the death of retinal cells. The role of aging cells in glaucoma development is unclear.\n\n【26】*   **Cancer:** Cellular aging has oncogenic signal transduction. This is a response that inhibits the conversion of cells into malignant cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy and radiation can induce the aging of cancer cells. Aging controls proliferation and prevents the spread of cancer.\n\n【27】How Can We Prevent Cellular Aging?\n----------------------------------\n\n【28】We cannot completely stop aging; however, we can slow down the process. Following are the ways we can follow:\n\n【29】*   **Healthy Diet:** A well-balanced and nutritious diet helps against damage and repair.\n\n【30】*   **Stress Management:** Managing stress well by means of meditation, yoga, and indulging in hobbies will reduce stress hormones.\n\n【31】*   **Exercise:** Regular exercise and lifestyle modifications help us against chronic diseases and build strong cells and tissues.\n\n【32】*   **Avoid Exposure to the Triggering Agents:** Limited exposure to the sun and pollutants and the use of protective gear can control aging.\n\n【33】*   **Prevention Is Better Than Cure:** Routine health checkups and management of weight, diet, and blood pressure keep the risk factors under control.\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】Aging cells stop division; aging protects against tumor formation and regulates cell division, and enters senescence after damage. It occurs due to DNA damage, oxidative stress, or autophagy. Cellular aging plays a vital role in age-related diseases.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   Senescence and aging: Causes, consequences, and therapeutic avenues  \n    https://rupress.org/jcb/article/217/1/65/39207/Senescence-and-aging-Causes-consequences-and\n*   The cell biology of aging  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4678010/\n*   Mechanisms of Cellular Senescence: Cell Cycle Arrest and Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.645593/full</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This procedure works best for those who are unsatisfied with the shape and size of their nose and want to correct it without surgery. In addition, non-surgical rhinoplasty is more affordable for the temporary enhancement of the nose and costs less than surgical rhinoplasty. This procedure is a 15 to 45 minutes procedure in which a liquid (dermal filler) is injected underneath the nose skin.\n\n【2】What Is Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Non-surgical rhinoplasty or nose job is a non-surgical procedure used to shape the nose with the help of dermal fillers temporarily. This procedure involves using a liquid (dermal fillers), which is also called a liquid rhinoplasty or liquid nose job. This procedure allows minor nose imperfections to be corrected on the same day.\n\n【4】How Is Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Done?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】The procedure is non-invasive, so the patient does not have to go under the knife. Topical anesthesia is applied first to make the area numb and the procedure painless and comfortable. After that, dermal fillers are injected underneath the skin of the nose with fine needles. Pictures are taken before and after the procedure for evaluation.\n\n【6】How Does Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Work?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】The dermal filler that is injected underneath the skin of the nose is primarily hyaluronic acid which is a gel-like substance, and this adds volume and changes the shape of the nose. It usually takes 15 to 45 minutes to complete. After the procedure, patients can do their daily routine without complications.\n\n【8】What Does Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Do?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】It can correct the following imperfections:\n\n【10】*   Modify the tip of the nose (asymmetric nose tip).\n\n【11】*   Enhanced and smoothed out irregularities in the nasal bridge.\n\n【12】*   Correction of the dorsal hump.\n\n【13】*   Nasal contouring (overall enhancement of the nose shape and size).\n\n【14】*   Correction of a crooked nose.\n\n【15】*   Removing irregularities post-surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【16】What Not to Do After Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Avoid applying makeup and skincare products in the procedure area for 24 hours.\n\n【18】*   Do not go for heavy exercise for 48 hours to prevent the worsening of bruising.\n\n【19】*   Avoid extreme sun exposure for a week.\n\n【20】*   Avoid massaging or pressing at the operated area.\n\n【21】How Long Does Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Last?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Non-surgical rhinoplasty is a temporary solution to correct nasal imperfections. The results last for about six to 12 months. This procedure will not make skin droopy or loose after 12 months, and patients can repeat the procedure after 12 months without any side effects.\n\n【23】Is Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Safe?\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】This procedure is safe as it is non-invasive. However, there might be minor redness and swelling at the injection site, which resolves on its own within two to three days.\n\n【25】What Are Some Side Effects That Can Occur?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   Blindness.\n\n【27】*   Bruise.\n\n【28】*   The filler material may move to other areas.\n\n【29】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【30】*   Bumps.\n\n【31】*   Fever.\n\n【32】If any of these side effects occur, the concerned doctor should be immediately contacted as these side effects are manageable with the medicines.\n\n【33】What Are the Benefits of Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   They are not painful.\n\n【35】*   There is no downtime. Right after the procedure, a regular daily routine can be resumed.\n\n【36】*   The results are not permanent; they will fade away after six to 12 months, so if the patient is not satisfied with the look they get after the procedure, the doctor can reverse the procedure by dissolving the filler.\n\n【37】*   Results can be appreciated right after the procedure.\n\n【38】*   The duration of the procedure is significantly less.\n\n【39】What Are the Benefits of Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【40】*   The results are permanent.\n\n【41】*   Medical as well as aesthetic concerns, are corrected with surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【42】*   All major aesthetic corrections can be done by surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【43】What Are the Drawbacks of Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】*   Not all aesthetic corrections can be done with this procedure.\n\n【45】*   Only minor corrections can be made with this procedure.\n\n【46】*   The nasal tip cannot be narrowed down with this procedure.\n\n【47】*   Nostrils cannot be narrowed down to the width of the nose at the base with this procedure.\n\n【48】*   The results are temporary, and the patient has to get this procedure repeated after six to 12 months.\n\n【49】*   This procedure is useful only for aesthetic improvements; corrections that improve nasal functions cannot be done with this procedure.\n\n【50】What Are the Drawbacks of Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【51】*   It is an invasive procedure.\n\n【52】*   It is expensive as compared to non-surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【53】*   The results cannot be reversed after the procedure, so if the outcome of the surgery is unsatisfactory, they cannot be changed.\n\n【54】*   Recovery and healing take more time as compared to non-surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【55】*   It can be painful and takes a long time compared to non-surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【56】*   There are more chances of post-operative complications than non-surgical rhinoplasty.\n\n【57】Which Is Better Non-Surgical Or Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】It depends on the following factors:\n\n【59】*   The type of nasal imperfection (major or minor) the patient has.\n\n【60】*   The kind of correction the patient wants (functional or esthetic).\n\n【61】*   The expenses (more or less) the patient wants to go for.\n\n【62】*   The results the patient wants (temporary or long-lasting).\n\n【63】When to Choose Surgical Nasal Rhinoplasty?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【64】It can be a better choice in the following cases:\n\n【65】*   When correcting a deviated nasal septum, airway correction or any other medical issue related to the nose is a primary concern.\n\n【66】*   When a drastic change in the shape and size of the nose is expected.\n\n【67】*   When budget is not a problem.\n\n【68】*   When the patient wants a permanent correction.\n\n【69】When to Choose Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【70】It can be a better choice in the following cases:\n\n【71】*   When an aesthetic correction in the shape and size of the nose is the primary concern.\n\n【72】*   When the patient does not want to spend more on the procedure.\n\n【73】*   When the patient is scared of surgical procedures.\n\n【74】*   When the patient wants immediate and temporary results or just wants to try a new look with the enhanced nose.\n\n【75】*   When the patient wants a quick recovery after the procedure with minimal complications.\n\n【76】**Conclusion:**\n\n【77】Non-surgical rhinoplasty is a safe and efficient procedure to temporarily correct and enhance the nose's appearance. The dermal fillers used in this procedure add volume to the area injected, which masks the imperfections of the nose. Unlike the traditional surgical rhinoplasty or nose job, the results are temporary and last for six to 12 months. So, if the patient does not want to go for surgery and still wants a contoured nose with minimum expenses, non-surgical rhinoplasty is the best treatment option available.\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- The Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty: A Retrospective Review of 5000 Treatments  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32097303/\n*   AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS-How a nonsurgical rhinoplasty can provide amazing results  \n    https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/how-a-nonsurgical-rhinoplasty-can-provide-amazing-results?amp=1\n*   NIH-Safety and Early Satisfaction Assessment of Patients Seeking Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty with Filler  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820838/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c9e438a1-df5c-487b-bee1-ea8aa81c3c21", "title": "Fucosidosis - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Fucosidosis - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is Fucosidosis?\n--------------------\n\n【1】Fucosidosis, also known as an alpha-L-fucosidase deficiency, is a rare condition occurring due to a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L fucosidase. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of certain complex compounds (fucose-containing compounds). The condition is characterized by an inability to break down or metabolize fucose-containing compounds. Fucosidosis belongs to a group of disorders called lysosomal storage disease. Cells include membrane-bound particles called lysosomes that serve as the cell's central digestive units. Nutrients such as specific fat and carbohydrates are broken down or digested by enzymes within lysosomes. The tissues of fucosidosis patients abnormally accumulate fucose-containing substances due to low or inactive levels of the alpha-L-fucosidase enzyme. Fucosidosis affects several parts of the body, specifically the brain. Fucosidosis causes skeletal disorders, coarse facial features, developmental delay, stunted growth, abnormal skin, and progressive neurological degeneration. The intellectual incapacity of those who are affected worsens with age, and many go on to develop dementia (a cluster of disorders affecting memory and thinking capacity).\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Fucosidosis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】According to symptoms and age of beginning, researchers identified two forms of fucosidosis; however, the latest theories suggest that the two categories are one condition with a wide range of signs and symptoms. The two types are:\n\n【4】1.  **Fucosidosis Type 1:** It is a severe and infantile form of the condition. This type usually manifests between three to 18 months after birth.\n\n【5】2.  **Fucosidosis Type 2:** It is the milder form of the condition with delayed manifestation. The symptoms start showing after 18 months of age.\n\n【6】Who Is Affected by Fucosidosis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Fucosidosis is an extremely rare disorder, and approximately only 100 cases have been reported globally.\n\n【8】*   Fucosidosis is prevalent in the southern parts of Italy, Cuba, and southwestern parts of the United States of America.\n\n【9】*   The condition does not show gender bias, affecting men and women equally.\n\n【10】*   According to one estimate, the incidence rates are less than 1 per 200,000 births. However, researchers believe that the condition is heavily underdiagnosed; therefore, the exact incidence rate of fucosidosis is uncertain.\n\n【11】Is Fucosidosis an Inherited Condition?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Yes, fucosidosis is an inherited disorder which means the condition is genetically passed down from parents to their children.\n\n【13】*   Fucosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the condition develops when both parents carry a copy of the defective gene. However, the parents may not show any signs and symptoms of the disease because they are only carriers.\n\n【14】What Causes Fucosidosis?\n------------------------\n\n【15】*   Fucosidosis is a genetic disorder due to changes or mutations in the FUCA1 gene (alpha-L-fucosidase gene).\n\n【16】*   The FUCA1 gene is responsible for providing information for the production of the alpha-L-fucosidase enzyme.\n\n【17】*   Alpha-L-fucosidase activity is significantly decreased or completely lost due to FUCA1 gene mutations. The breakdown of glycolipids and glycoproteins is incomplete when there is insufficient enzyme activity. These partially metabolized substances eventually collect in several body tissues and cells, leading to cell dysfunction.\n\n【18】*   Some researchers believe that the FUCA1 gene mutation and other genetic and environmental factors contribute to the severity of the disease in individuals. However, more research is required to identify these risk factors.\n\n【19】*   Pseudogenes, genes that can no longer make proteins or are no longer expressed in the body, are also present in people with fucosidosis. The pseudogene present in the case of fucosidosis is known as FUCA1P.\n\n【20】What Are the Symptoms of Fucosidosis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】Even among members of the same family, there are significant differences in the symptoms of fucosidosis. Fucosidosis can progress rapidly and cause serious, life-threatening consequences in children. However, during adolescence, the condition progresses at a slower rate and subsequently causes severe complications in adulthood.\n\n【22】The symptoms of fucosidosis are:\n\n【23】*   Infants with fucosidosis may not start showing symptoms for six to 12 months after birth.\n\n【24】*   Mental degradation.\n\n【25】*   Motor skill deterioration.\n\n【26】*   Psychomotor retardation (delayed learning of the abilities needed to combine physical and mental activity).\n\n【27】*   The coarseness of the facial features.\n\n【28】*   Thick lips and tongue.\n\n【29】*   Multiple bone deformities.\n\n【30】*   Hypotonia (loss of muscle tone).\n\n【31】*   Retarded growth.\n\n【32】*   Intellectual disability due to progressive neurological degradation.\n\n【33】*   Movement disorders.\n\n【34】*   Weight loss.\n\n【35】*   Cachexia (loss of muscle mass).\n\n【36】Less common symptoms of fucosidosis include:\n\n【37】*   Enlargement of organs.\n\n【38】*   Seizures (sudden electrical disturbance of the brain).\n\n【39】*   Loss of hearing.\n\n【40】*   Kyphoscoliosis (abnormal spine curvature).\n\n【41】*   Recurrent respiratory infections.\n\n【42】*   Excessive sweating with unusually high levels of salt in the sweat.\n\n【43】*   Symptoms of less severe fucosidosis are comparable to those of more severe forms; they typically start milder and proceed more slowly.\n\n【44】*   Wart-like skin growths.\n\n【45】*   Muscle spasms that are involuntary.\n\n【46】*   Some people could have specific joints fixed in a permanently flexed state.\n\n【47】*   Less severe forms of fucosidosis can cause people to survive long into their second, third, or fourth decades before the condition worsens and poses a threat to their lives.\n\n【48】How Is Fucosidosis Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【49】The diagnosis of fucosidosis is confirmed when:\n\n【50】*   **Clinical Examination:** Infants with skeletal deformities during the first year of life that are accompanied by neurological deterioration and intellectual incapacity may be suspected of having fucosidosis. A thorough clinical examination, a complete patient history, and several specialized tests could be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【51】*   **Electron Microscopic Examination:** When tissue samples from the skin, liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney, sweat glands, and other cells are examined under an electron microscope, atypical \"cavities\" (vacuoles) within these cells may be seen. These vacuoles may be transparent or contain thin, disc-like structures or granules that resemble sand.\n\n【52】*   **Imaging Tests:** Modern imaging methods, such as computer-assisted tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can confirm the degeneration of the brain's white matter.\n\n【53】*   **Urine Examination:** To check for any partially metabolized sugars, a specific urine test is available. Increased quantities of specific fucose-containing complex compounds in the urine may be found through laboratory examination of urine samples. If present, a skin or blood sample will be obtained to check for less than average levels of alpha-fucosidase.\n\n【54】*   **Enzyme Assays:** Enzyme assays on cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes can detect diminished alpha-L-fucosidase activity.\n\n【55】*   **Chorionic Villus Sampling:** Through the use of specific tests such as chorionic villus sampling, fucosidosis can be successfully identified prenatally. During chorionic villus sampling, tissue samples of the fetus are taken, and white blood cells and cultured tissue cells are subjected to enzyme tests.\n\n【56】*   **Amniocentesis:** This test also determines the presence of fucosidosis before birth. An amniocentesis is a procedure where a sample of the fluid that surrounds the growing baby is taken and examined.\n\n【57】How Is Fucosidosis Treated?\n---------------------------\n\n【58】The treatment of fucosidosis is done in the following ways:\n\n【59】*   The disorder cannot be reversed or treated. The main focus of the treatment is on alleviating the patient's symptoms.\n\n【60】*   Recurrent respiratory infections may be treated with antibiotic medication, and fluid replacement therapy may be recommended to prevent dehydration due to excessive sweating.\n\n【61】*   Antiseizure drugs may be given to patients who present with symptoms of seizures.\n\n【62】*   It is advised that affected individuals and their families seek genetic counseling.\n\n【63】*   Some fucosidosis patients have been treated with bone marrow transplantation. However, research is going on to determine this treatment method's efficiency and long-term safety.\n\n【64】**Conclusion:**\n\n【65】Fucosidosis is an uncommon genetic disorder with a limited number of cases reported to date. The condition belongs to a group of disorders known as lysosomal storage diseases. Fucosidosis is characterized by the reduced amount or diminished activities of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase. Depending upon the severity of the symptoms and time of onset, the condition is categorized into two types. The treatment and prognosis of fucosidosis also depend upon the symptoms' severity and the onset time. In severe cases, symptoms frequently start in early childhood, and affected people normally live into their late childhood years. In milder cases, symptoms appear at one to two years old, and affected people typically live into their mid-adult years.\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>*   Fucosidosis  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6473/fucosidosis\n*   Fucosidosis  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/fucosidosis/#inheritance\n*   What is fucosidosis?  \n    https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/fucosidosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0deb922c-2144-4acc-8e12-7e42f2d8a7c7", "title": "Glomus Jugulare Tumor - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Glomus Jugulare Tumor - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Glomus jugulare tumors or glomus tumors originate in the glomus cells and tissues. Glomus cells are specialized cells that are present in some blood vessels and along nerves. These cells are engaged in the detection of any changes in the bloodstream, like a change in temperature or the presence of a particular chemical. They also react to changes by releasing hormones. The region beneath the temporal bone in the skull encompasses numerous nerve bundles with glomus cells. Tumors that develop in this region are called glomus jugulare tumors since they develop on the top of the jugular vein (the vein that carries blood from the brain to the heart).\n\n【2】Are Glomus Jugulare Tumors Cancerous?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Glomus tumors are mostly not cancerous but can proliferate extensively and extend throughout the inside of nerves, along arteries and veins, inside the ear, and the Eustachian tube (a tube connecting the ear with the nose). These tumors usually manifest later in life, around 60 or 70 years though they can occur at any age. No known risk factors seem to be associated in most of the cases. Though these tumors are usually benign (noncancerous), they are associated with causing hearing loss, difficulty swallowing, and facial paralysis.\n\n【4】How Do Glomus Jugulare Tumors Develop?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】The exact cause of these tumors' occurrence is unknown, but the involvement of genetic factors is held under suspicion. Healthcare professionals believe that acquired mutations can result in the occurrence of these tumors rather than hereditary genes. These tumors are more common in women than in men, and also in the elderly. However, they can develop in any individual at any age.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Glomus Jugulare Tumors?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Since this tumor develops in the skull, just beneath the middle ear, signs and symptoms linked to the ear are common. These are as follows:\n\n【8】*   Pain in the ear.\n\n【9】*   Dizziness.\n\n【10】*   Partial or complete loss of hearing.\n\n【11】*   Tinnitus (a pulsing or ringing sound in the ears).\n\n【12】A large tumor that extends toward the face or neck can cause the following symptoms:\n\n【13】*   Facial paralysis.\n\n【14】*   Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).\n\n【15】*   Hoarseness.\n\n【16】*   Weakness in facial muscles.\n\n【17】*   Weakness of tongue.\n\n【18】*   Drooping shoulders.\n\n【19】In a minority of glomus jugulare tumors, there can be a production of hormones which can result in the following symptoms:\n\n【20】*   Headaches.\n\n【21】*   Tremors.\n\n【22】*   Anxiety.\n\n【23】*   Flushing.\n\n【24】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【25】*   Rapid heart rate.\n\n【26】How Can Glomus Jugulare Tumors Be Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Initially, a thorough physical examination is done to check for the presence of a glomus jugulare tumor. The ear and throat areas are examined for the presence of any tumor, and the physician inquires the individual regarding the symptoms. A lump can be noticed in the neck region, and the tumor may even be seen inside the ear. With the help of imaging tests like a CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, a clear image of the suspected area can be viewed, and then a diagnosis can be made. Even cerebral angiography (a procedure in which a special dye and X-rays are used to view how the blood flows through the brain) can be used to diagnose glomus jugulare tumors.\n\n【28】How Can Glomus Jugulare Tumors Be Treated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The only option that is available to treat glomus jugulare tumors is surgery. Irrespective of whether the tumor is small or big, surgery is advisable. Even small, less severe tumors also need to be surgically removed. If left without removal, it can gradually proliferate and cause problems in the future by growing bigger. The following are the different surgical methods:\n\n【30】*   **Complete Surgical Removal:** With the help of traditional neurosurgical techniques, glomus jugulare tumors can be completely removed. Because of the presence of too many nerves in this region, complete surgical removal of these tumors can be difficult. However, no further treatment is required if the tumor is successfully removed without any damage to the nerves.\n\n【31】*   **Stereotactic Radiosurgery:** It is not exactly a surgical procedure but involves X-rays that are targeted at the tumor to blow up the abnormal tissue. This technique is less likely to damage normal tissue and is more targeted when compared with traditional radiation therapy.\n\n【32】*   **Surgery Followed by Radiation Therapy:** In many cases, traditional surgery is paired up with follow-up radiation. The radiation aims to clear the tumor remnants which a surgeon could not physically remove.\n\n【33】Surgeries to remove glomus jugulare tumors are performed by head and neck surgeons, neurosurgeons, and ear surgeons (neurotologists). Surgery is done in the following ways:\n\n【34】*   To begin with, a cerebral angiogram is performed to establish the blood supply to the tumor and check if it is possible to obstruct the blood supply safely.\n\n【35】*   Surgery can be safely done only after proper embolization (obstructing the blood flow to the tumor) of the glomus jugulare tumor since they are enriched with blood vessels. In a few cases, embolization is done before the surgery to avoid the tumor from bleeding excessively during surgery. Even alpha and beta blockers are given prior to the surgery to prevent serious blood pressure abnormalities and heart arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat).\n\n【36】*   Following angiography and embolization, surgery is performed after a few days. This involves an approach that is made through the top portion of the neck and also drilling the bone from the skull base. This is done to ensure that the tumor is approached safely and control is maintained on the neighboring large blood vessels.\n\n【37】Surgery is rarely preferred in cases of large glomus jugulare tumors that press on the brain, cause loss of voice, and engulf the nerves. If surgery is preferred, it is a complex task involving the whole medical team to perform it safely.\n\n【38】What Are the Complications of a Glomus Jugulare Tumor?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】The complications are mostly due to damage to the nerves, which are caused either by the tumor itself or as a result of damage done during surgery. Nerve damage can result in the following complications:\n\n【40】*   Difficulty swallowing.\n\n【41】*   Facial paralysis.\n\n【42】*   Alteration in voice.\n\n【43】*   Hearing loss.\n\n【44】When Should One Seek Medical Help?\n----------------------------------\n\n【45】One must seek medical help if they experience the following:\n\n【46】*   Pulsations or ringing sounds in the ear.\n\n【47】*   Difficulty swallowing.\n\n【48】*   Difficulty hearing.\n\n【49】*   Presence of lump in the neck.\n\n【50】*   Issues with the muscles in the face.\n\n【51】*   Aspiration.\n\n【52】*   Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n【53】*   Vocal cord paralysis.\n\n【54】*   Osteoradionecrosis (a serious complication that occurs after radiation therapy that causes the radiated bone to be exposed and necrotic) of the temporal bone.\n\n【55】*   Brain radionecrosis (the death of a healthy tissue due to radiation therapy).\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】The glomus jugulare tumor develops in the temporal bone region of the skull that encompasses the middle and inner ear structures. This tumor can cause damage to the ear, the base of the skull, the upper neck, and the neighboring blood vessels and nerves. The earlier the tumor is removed, the greater the chances for a complete recovery. A smaller, less extensive tumor is comparatively easy to remove without causing any damage to the adjacent vital structures. A tumor that has attacked the blood vessels and nerves can be difficult to be removed. Though the extraction of glomus jugulare tumors and radiation therapy are most successful in most cases, these tumors have a high recurrence rate and may require subsequent surgeries.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Glomus Jugulare  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560489/\n*   Glomus Jugulare Tumor  \n    https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/neurosurgery/conditions-treated/glomus-jugulare-tumor\n*   Glomus jugulare tumor  \n    https://ufhealth.org/conditions-and-treatments/glomus-jugulare-tumor</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These cells are present at the cornea's posterior surface facing the eye's anterior chamber. These specialized, flattened mitochondria-rich cells are important to maintain the cornea's transparency. The normal structure of these cells is affected by various factors like aging, systemic disorders, and genetic disorders. As a result, assessing corneal endothelial health is important for identifying underlying conditions.\n\n【2】**Why Is It Important?**\n------------------------\n\n【3】William Bowman first described the corneal endothelium cells in the mid-19th century. These cells are derived from the neural crest (an embryonic structure that forms tissues) during embryonic development. During birth, the endothelium cell density is 6000 cells per square millimeter. But gradually, the number of cells in the epithelium decreases with age. By the age of 85, approximately 2300 cells/square millimeters are only present. The rate of decrease of the cells is 0.6% per year. Maintaining a healthy structure is important for good ocular health, as these cells never divide.\n\n【4】The corneal endothelium maintains hydration and the movement of nutrients and molecules. The corneal endothelium has three functions.\n\n【5】*   When corneal endothelium is healthy, and a sufficient number of cells are present, it acts as a barrier. It prevents the bulk flow of the fluid from aqueous humor (clear liquid in the front part of the eye) to the corneal stroma (thick layer of the cornea). Only selective molecules and nutrients can pass the barrier.\n\n【6】*   Cells of the corneal endothelium (single layers of cells in the cornea) are rich in mitochondria and transport proteins. These two factors are essential for creating osmotic gradients. With the help of transport proteins, the osmotic gradient helps move various ions. This mechanism is known as a pump-leak mechanism.\n\n【7】*   Corneal endothelium also secretes extracellular proteins that form collagen fibers. This helps to form Descemet's membrane.\n\n【8】Any abnormality of the cellular function of corneal endothelium or reduction in the number of cells disrupts these functions. Disrupting the corneal endothelium's function leads to visual acuity problems and altered intraocular pressure.\n\n【9】**What Are Corneal Diseases?**\n------------------------------\n\n【10】The diseases responsible for changes in the normal form and function of the corneal epithelium can be of two types:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>Can glaucoma and cataract be operated at the same time?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>Does glaucoma treatment require multiple laser sittings?</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>Diagnosed with Glaucoma: What Next?</u>\n\n【16】**1\\. Primary Corneal Endotheliopathy:**\n\n【17】These are the inflammatory conditions that disrupt the normal functioning of the corneal endothelium. They can be of four types.\n\n【18】*   **Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy:** The condition is a slow progressive inherited bilateral disorder. This disease mainly affects during the fifth or sixth decades of life. The exact etiology responsible for this condition is not known. Still, epigenetic changes (changes in cellular function at the molecular level) or mutation of certain genes like COL8A2 might be the causative factor. In this condition, the number of endothelial cells decreases, but cellular size increases. The cells secrete an excess amount of collagen, and the barrier function of the cells is lost; as a result, the following things can be seen.\n\n【19】*   **Corneal Edema:** Cells cannot maintain fluid balance, resulting in swelling of the cornea and loss of transparency.\n\n【20】*   **Guttate Cornea:** The enlarged endothelium appears as drop-like warts projected from Descemet's membrane's posterior surface.\n\n【21】**2\\. Posterior Polymorphous Dystrophy:** This autosomal dominant disorder affects both eyes. It is also known as Schlichting dystrophy. The mutation of several genes like OVOL2 and COL8A2 causes this. The clinical features are:\n\n【22】*   Gray-white plaques or broad bands with serrated edges on the endothelium.\n\n【23】*   Presence of clustered vesicles.\n\n【24】*   Epithelial-like abnormal cell infiltration is seen in the isolated areas of the endothelium.\n\n【25】**3\\. Congenital Hereditary Endothelial** **Dystrophy:** This autosomal recessive disorder affects both eyes and is associated with the mutation of the SLC4A11 gene. Affected persons suffer from clouding of vision and nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movement). The clinical manifestations are:\n\n【26】*   Thickened and laminated Descemet's membrane.\n\n【27】*   Degeneration of the endothelial cells.\n\n【28】**4\\. Iridocorneal Endothelial (Ice) Syndrome:** This is an acquired disorder of three syndromes: iris atrophy, Chandler's syndrome (associated with proliferation of corneal epithelium), and Cogan–Reese iris nevus syndrome (presence of nodules in the iris). This syndrome usually affects one eye but sometimes may affect both eyes also. This syndrome typically affects adults (more often women in the third to fifth decades of life). The clinical manifestations are:\n\n【29】*   Beaten metal or cobblestone appearance of the endothelium.\n\n【30】*   Affected endothelium cell shows pleomorphism and polymegethism (alteration in the normal form and function of the cells).\n\n【31】*   Loss of normal cell junction.\n\n【32】*   Abnormal cells present on the periphery of the iris form a membrane that gradually displaces the iris.\n\n【33】*   **Secondary Corneal Endotheliopathy:**\n\n【34】In this type, the corneal endothelium cells are affected indirectly by some other disorder or systemic conditions or may be affected by trauma.\n\n【35】*   **Contact Lens Wear:**\n\n【36】One of the common causes of corneal endothelium trauma is contact lenses. Due to repeated trauma, the normal hexagonal shape of the cell is lost. The cells show a large number of variations in form and function. This can be attributed to the excessive use of lenses which leads to hypoxia (decrease in oxygen level).\n\n【37】*   **Age-Related Changes:**\n\n【38】As discussed earlier, the number of corneal endothelial cells decreases with age. A minimum of 2000 cells/square millimeters is required to maintain normal form and function. The normal gap and tight junction between the cells are also lost. As a result, the normal permeability is lost, and fluid accumulation occurs. This leads to corneal edema and loss of transparency. Ultimately separation of the corneal epithelium from its underlying matrix occurs, and small blister-like elevations known as bullae are formed.\n\n【39】*   **Surgical Injury:**\n\n【40】The rapid loss of corneal endothelial cell count is observed after cataract surgery. The loss may be caused by surgical trauma during the procedure or maybe a lack of supply of nutrition from aqueous humor post-surgically.\n\n【41】*   **Glaucoma:**\n\n【42】These are a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve. Glaucoma is associated with increased intraocular pressure. This pressure alters the osmotic gradient, and the gap and the tight junction between the endothelial cells are lost.\n\n【43】**How to Treat Corneal Disorders?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【44】The main treatment option for the loss of corneal endothelium is corneal decompression (reduction of pressure), along with keratoplasty. Corneal decompression helps to maintain pressure gradient and reduces corneal edema. Keratoplasty is a procedure in which corneal tissues are taken from the donor site and implanted into the patient's eye.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】The corneal endothelium maintains the natural form and function of the cornea. Endothelial cells maintain the integrity and permeability of the cornea. Several genetic disorders and systemic conditions affect the natural health and number of corneal endothelial cells. Modern treatment procedures like corneal transplantations and cell therapy can help regenerate corneal health.\n\n【47】.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Biology of the corneal endothelium in health and disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14631396/\n*   Corneal endothelial cell dysfunction: etiologies and management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6293368/\n*   Age-related changes in the cornea  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6969271/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e6ce47cb-65f0-4b72-a502-dae6e623655a", "title": "Cluster Feeding and Growth Spurts", "text": "【0】**Introduction:**\n\n【1】As the child's growth continues, it also develops a habit of constant eating. This is called cluster feeding. Often mothers are confused and doubt if breast milk is insufficient for the child and find alternative ways to nourish the child. Cluster feeding is a natural process. The growth and development of a baby occur at different stages and levels. At certain age groups, there is an abrupt change in physical development, and such sudden and increased growth changes are called growth spurts.\n\n【2】How Frequently Does a Child Cluster Feed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Constant cluster feeding can turn frustrating and make the mother tired. On average, cluster feeding in babies occurs every fifteen to twenty minutes or more frequently. It is commonly observed during afternoon naps and can happen anytime the baby awakens. This can continue for days to a week. It is caused as a result of growth changes occurring in newborns. Some commonly observed patterns in which cluster feeding occurs are on day two of life, weeks two to three, weeks four to six, and at three months.\n\n【4】How Can a Mother Prepare Herself for Cluster Feeding?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A pre-education on cluster feeding can help the mother to forsake any wrong confusion due to the child’s overeating habit and as well as get prepared for the other alternative methods to meet the crying baby’s needs. Some of the management strategies are:\n\n【6】*   Prepare a nursing place. The mother can create a space to sit and lactate the child easily and comfortably. The place can be arranged with other essential tools handy, like mouth pacifiers, hydrating creams, wipes, nappies, and other items beside it.\n\n【7】*   During cluster feeding, the mother can adapt techniques to pacify the baby, like rocking two and fro and switching off lights and other alarming sounds.\n\n【8】*   The mother can create skin-to-skin contact with the baby to create a bond between the child.\n\n【9】*   A constant twenty-hour vigil is required while nursing the baby. Hence, someone should help the mother carry out the house's day-to-day chores.\n\n【10】*   While constantly lactating the baby, the mother should also take care of her breast hygiene. The mother can use moisturizers to keep the nipples hydrated.\n\n【11】*   The mother should eat healthily and stay healthy while breastfeeding. Frequent feeding of the child takes away five hundred calories a day. So a mother should keep herself nourished.\n\n【12】*   A mother can analyze the baby’s food intake by checking the diaper output and the overall health.\n\n【13】What Is a Growth Spurt?\n-----------------------\n\n【14】Every born species grows itself out until it reaches maturity. Human beings also undergo different stages of growth and development. From the time a baby is born, it goes through different visible stages of development like the lying stage, leaping stage, crawling stage, standing stage, and walking stage. The child may seem to be growing at a regular pace, but at certain ages, the child shows a sudden acceleration of growth, known as a growth spurt. Such growth is the result of cell multiplication which is required for the development of tissues and organs. Growth spurts occur in two stages.\n\n【15】*   **Prenatal Period:** This period is when the fetus starts developing inside a mother's womb from conception to childbirth or forty weeks of pregnancy. Factors that influence growth are maternal health, age, nutrition, genetic disorders, and other toxic substances that can interfere with the child's growth.\n\n【16】*   **Infantile Period:** It is the period after the baby is born.\n\n【17】What Are the Different Stages of Growth Spurts?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Different growth milestones are achieved at different stages of life. Such development stages differ from child to child. For example, some babies start crawling from six months of age, but some do not. However, there are still certain growth patterns that occur in children. They are:\n\n【19】*   **1 Month:** The baby starts recognizing faces, especially bold patterns like black and white. The child showcases excitement through sounds and laughter and develops body movements like moving the head sideways.\n\n【20】*   **2 Months:** The child starts recognizing people at a distance and smiles. The child shifts eye movement according to the movement of the object. The baby develops a thumb-sucking habit to calm themselves. The child sometimes shows a fussy character when bored and lifts the head up, trying to move the body when in the tummy position.\n\n【21】*   **3 Months:** By this time, the child can clearly distinguish faces. The child starts making sounds for different needs, like hunger, diaper change, and pain. The baby also learns to fold their hands and express boredom. The child loves playing and moves their head according to the noises made.\n\n【22】*   **4 Months:** The child starts to giggle and laugh, pushes their head, and reaches out for things.\n\n【23】*   **5 Months:** The baby starts rolling on its tummy back, puts toys in their mouth, loves to look in the mirror, makes babbling sounds, and plays with themselves.\n\n【24】*   **6 Months:** The baby starts crawling on the floor, starts sitting without falling back, passes things from one hand to the other, starts understanding words, and responds to names.\n\n【25】*   **7 Months:** The child starts playing simple games, begins to respond by saying no, and finds partially hidden objects.\n\n【26】*   **8 Months:** The child starts crawling and slowly stands and develops a grip to hold objects for some time in hand.\n\n【27】*   **9 Months:** The child does not cooperate with strangers and only mingles with familiar people. The baby starts making different sounds like mama, and baba ba baba, copies sounds and gestures of others, has favorite toys and uses fingers to point things.\n\n【28】*   **10 Months:** The child expresses feelings like throwing and banging. They start standing on their own and move forward by shufflings on the way. The baby sits on its own, starts feeding with little fingers, and develops better hand-eye coordination.\n\n【29】*   **11 Months:** The child understands objects, climbs stairs, makes varied sounds with tones like speech, and develops separation anxiety.\n\n【30】*   **12 Months:** The child responds to requests and commands and responds vice-versa by shaking hands or saying bye-bye. The baby starts using things correctly, like brushing their hair and drinking from their own cup. The child starts walking step by step without anyone to hold them.\n\n【31】What Is an Adolescent Growth Spurt?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid growth seen during the puberty period. This is also known as an accelerated growth period. Many hormones are responsible for such rapid growth patterns in adults. The growth spurt period differs in males and females. A female reaches maturity fast and achieves it in eleven to thirteen years. On the other hand, males show growth spurts from fourteen years to sixteen years. Such differences in maturity can also be observed in their mental and emotional maturity. It is also when all milk teeth or mixed dentition period shifts to complete permanent dentition. There is development in sexual organs followed by a change in voice and changes in the hair growth patterns, like pubic hair.\n\n【33】What Are the Physical Changes Observed During Puberty Growth Spurt in Males and Females?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The rapid physical changes during teenage years result from puberty growth spurts that operate under the influence of hormones.\n\n【35】**In Males:**\n\n【36】**Stage 1:** Boys gain weight during this period and start developing fat deposition. This is also known as a fat spurt. This is caused due to the production of estrogen hormone by Leydig cells.\n\n【37】**Stage 2:** This occurs one year after stage one. During this time, boys increase in height and decrease in fat deposition. The development of sexual organs also takes place.\n\n【38】**Stage 3:** It occurs a year after stage two and is followed by a rapid increase in height, development of facial and axial hair, development of sexual organs, and increase in muscle structure.\n\n【39】**Stage 4:** This occurs after one and a half to two years of stage three. It is a stage where boys reach full maturation, and the increase in height stops.\n\n【40】**In Females:**\n\n【41】**Stage 1:** During this time, the girls start developing breast buds, and pubic hair starts coming.\n\n【42】**Stage 2:** Development of sexual characters begins. This begins after a year of stage one.\n\n【43】**Stage 3:** It occurs after one to one and a half years of stage two. It is marked by the beginning of menstruation. The girls start gaining weight during this period.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】Different physical demands a child makes during infancy are natural processes. A mother should be taught about the developmental changes which occur in a child. Most women transform into child-like behavior after spending time with their babies. This increases the emotional bond between them. Similarly, such growth patterns should also be handled with complete awareness during puberty. This helps to understand the growing child’s emotions without being apathetic towards them.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cluster Feeding and Growth Spurts  \n    https://wicbreastfeeding.fns.usda.gov/cluster-feeding-and-growth-spurts\n*   Cluster feeding  \n    https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/cluster-feeding\n*   What Is Cluster Feeding? 6 Tips for Cluster-Feeding Newborns  \n    https://flo.health/being-a-mom/your-baby/baby-care-and-feeding/what-is-cluster-feeding-6-tips</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Many urological treatments depend on ureteral stents. While stents can be used for various purposes, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, urethral stricture, or detrusor sphincter dyssynergia are typically employed for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures. Although there have been considerable advancements in the design and materials of the stent, infection, and encrustation (a hard layer), remain serious issues when used for a long period.\n\n【2】What Is a Urethral Stent?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】The word ‘stent’ can be defined as a thread, rod, or catheter resting inside the lumen of tubular structures, employed to offer support during or after an anastomosis, or to ensure patency of an intact but constricted lumen. Urethral stents are made primarily of a metal alloy, polymeric or biodegradable material and come in a range of forms that are hard enough to keep the urethra open.\n\n【4】What Are the Characteristics of the Ideal Urethral Stent?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Insertion and removal are easy.\n\n【6】*   Biocompatibility (it does not cause a response in the surrounding tissue and is unaffected by the in vivo environment).\n\n【7】*   Radiopaque (to facilitate the insertion of the stent using fluoroscopy and to confirm the position of the stent during follow-up radiography).\n\n【8】*   Strong enough to alleviate the urethral blockage.\n\n【9】*   Resistant to encrustation and infection even after long periods of indwelling\n\n【10】*   Mobility to resistance.\n\n【11】*   Comfortable for the patient and the physician.\n\n【12】*   An internal lumen is large enough to relieve the blockage and allow cystoscopy if necessary.\n\n【13】What Are the Indications of the Urethral Stents?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   In suitable patients, placement of the urethral stents includes urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), and bladder outlet blockage leading to locally advanced prostate cancer.\n\n【15】*   Patients with BPH with a failed medical treatment or those with locally advanced prostate cancer allowing bladder outlet obstruction in which anesthesia can be induced are candidates for urethral stent insertion rather than an indwelling Foley catheter or intermittent catheterization.\n\n【16】*   A urethral stent may also assist patients with neurogenic bladder and DSD.\n\n【17】*   Endoscopically urethral stents are implanted under either radiologic or cystoscopic supervision and should be readily placed or withdrawn and large enough in diameter to ease urethral blockage and permit cystoscopy if required.\n\n【18】What Are the Contraindications of Urethral Stents?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Contraindications for the placement of the urethral stent include:\n\n【20】*   Acute prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland).\n\n【21】*   An ongoing infection of the urethra or bladder.\n\n【22】*   Cystolithiasis (stone in the bladder).\n\n【23】*   Penile urethral stricture.\n\n【24】*   Stricture affects the external urethral sphincter.\n\n【25】*   Recurrent bladder tumors.\n\n【26】*   Patients should be assessed with appropriate investigations for the underlying disease process before inserting a urethral stent. Regardless of the reason for the stricture, an extensive anatomical and functional assessment of the urethra should be conducted, including retrograde or antegrade (if a suprapubic catheter is present) urethrography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), uroflowmetry, video urodynamic analysis, and cystoscopy. In addition, a urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out urinary tract infections.\n\n【27】What Are the Types of Urethral Stents?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【28】Several types of urethral stents are available, either temporarily or permanently implanted:\n\n【29】**Temporary Stents:**\n\n【30】*   Temporary urethral stents preserve the lumen of the urethra open and are not integrated into the urethral wall. These stents offer a temporary alternative to an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter to treat bladder outlet blockage.\n\n【31】*   Temporary urethral stents allow regular micturition and have a 50 to 90 percent success rate. Stainless steel, biodegradable polymers, or a nickel-titanium alloy are used to make temporary stents.\n\n【32】*   According to the manufacturer's instructions, temporary urethral stents must be changed every six to 36 months. Some temporary stents are manufactured with biodegradable poly-D or L-lactic acid, which degrades naturally over time.\n\n【33】*   Postoperatively, similar stents are utilized with minimally invasive urethral or prostate surgery, such as transurethral microwave treatment (TUMT) and visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP), providing temporary drainage and progressive disintegration over time.\n\n【34】*   However, cystoscopy for urethral catheterization cannot normally be performed with these stents in situ because of the tiny lumen size.\n\n【35】*   Examples of temporary stents include - Urospiral and Prostakath, Memokath, and ProstaCoil.\n\n【36】**Temporary Stents Made of Polyurethane Stents:**\n\n【37】Polyurethane is used to make three types of temporary stents:\n\n【38】*   **The Intra-Urethral Catheter (IUC):** The intraurethral catheter (IUC) is a 16-18 Fr (French scale measurement system) device that looks like a double-Malecot catheter and comes in lengths ranging from 25 to 80 milimeters. A 22 Fr cystoscope is used to install the device while under local anesthetic and direct eyesight.\n\n【39】*   **The Barnes Stent:** The Barnes stent is a 75 milimeters long 16 Fr urethral device. The stent's proximal end looks like a conventional urethral catheter, while the distal end mimics a Malecot catheter proximal to the verumontanum.\n\n【40】*   **The Trestle Catheter****:** The Trestle Catheter comprises two 22 Fr tubes joined by a compressible thread across the sphincter to preserve continence. Under local anesthetic, the catheter is placed and positioned using transrectal ultrasonography.\n\n【41】**Permanent Stents:**\n\n【42】*   As the urothelium covers the device, permanent urethral stents are directed into the urethral lumen and integrated into the urethral wall. In situations with urethral stricture, DSD, or anastomotic stricture following radical prostatectomy, permanent stents relieve bladder outlet blockage.\n\n【43】*   A few examples of permanent stents include - UroLume, Memotherm, and Ultraflex.\n\n【44】What Are the Complications of the Ureteral Stents?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】*   Many risks always accompany the use of urethral stents in urology. Patients requiring cystoscopy to treat and monitor specific urological disorders such as urinary stone disease, transitional cell carcinoma, or any other condition that necessitates recurring endoscopic manipulations should be restricted from receiving certain stent types.\n\n【46】*   Since urethral stents are foreign bodies, they might produce irritative urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, dysuria (burning during urination), or urge incontinence. In addition, encrustation, stent fracture, migration, urinary tract infections (UTI), hematuria (blood in urine), and clot retention are all possible consequences.\n\n【47】*   When a stent is inserted distal to the bulbous urethra, problems might result in incontinence or discomfort while sitting or during intercourse. Other causes for the removal of the stent include worsening of the symptoms, stent encrustation, and inadequate luminal epithelialization were all seen.\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】Urethral stent implantation may be indicated for various reasons, including urethral stricture illness, BPH, and DSD. Advancement has occurred in the area of urethral stenting over the past decade. As a result, temporary and permanent urethral stents are available for selection. Urethral stenting is a less invasive surgery that can alleviate symptoms of bladder outlet blockage in high-risk surgical patients and as a substitute to open urethroplasty.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ureteral stenting and urinary stone management: a systematic review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18076928/\n*   Ureteral Stent-Associated Pain: A Review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27125392/\n*   Ureteral stents: new ideas, new designs  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126070/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ea66baf9-03ea-404e-8749-1d0ce84e41e9", "title": "Cutaneous Larva Migrans - Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention", "text": "【0】Cutaneous Larva Migrans - Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention\n**Introduction**:\n\n【1】Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin infection caused by animal hookworm. It is caused by the parasite known as Ancylostomatidae. The parasite lives in the intestine of dogs, cats, and wild animals. Cutaneous larva migrans means moving larvae in the skin. It is also known as creeping eruption, which means lesions migrate or move due to the moving parasite in the skin. Cutaneous larva migrans are called by different names in different countries. It is known as ground itch or sandworms as larvae reside in the sandy soil in the southern United States. The term Cutaneous larva migrans was described by Crocker in 1893. The disease occurs worldwide but is more common in warmer climates and tropical and subtropical areas, including the southeast United States, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. The larvae penetrate the skin when an individual walks barefoot on contaminated soil. Humans are infected through contact with contaminated soil.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Cutaneous Larva Migrans?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Cutaneous larva migrans are caused by multiple types of hookworms. The parasite lives in the intestine of dogs and cats. The common causes are:\n\n【4】1.  Ancylostoma braziliense is a hookworm of dogs and cats found in the United States, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\n【5】2.  Ancylostoma caninum is a hookworm of a dog found in Australia.\n\n【6】3.  Bunostomum phlebotomum is a cattle hookworm.\n\n【7】Who Are at Risk of Cutaneous Larva Migrans?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Cutaneous larva migrans affects all age groups, sex, and race. When exposed to hookworm larvae, a person acquires a disease. The disease is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas. The person at risk includes:\n\n【9】*   People whose occupation or hobby is in contact with warm, moist, and sandy soil are at more risk.\n\n【10】*   The person who walks barefoot on the beach.\n\n【11】*   Sunbathers.\n\n【12】*   The children who play in the sandpit.\n\n【13】*   Farmers, gardeners, hunters, electricians, and carpenters.\n\n【14】*   Pest exterminators (a person whose job is to kill insects and animals).\n\n【15】*   The people who work in the forest areas.\n\n【16】How Do Cutaneous Larva Migrans Spread?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】The disease life cycle starts with the presence of adult hookworm in the intestine of dogs and cats. The life cycle is described as follows:\n\n【18】*   The adult hookworm lays eggs in the intestine. Eggs are passed into the feces of the dogs and cats and then into the soil.\n\n【19】*   Under warm and moist conditions, the larvae incubate and mature within one to two days. The mature larvae are the rhabditiform larvae that grow for five to ten days.\n\n【20】*   The eggs passed through several molts (to shed hair or feathers to form a new growth) to form infective filiform or third-stage larvae. They are capable of surviving outside the body for four weeks.\n\n【21】*   Once the filiform larva comes in contact with the skin of an animal, the larva penetrates the skin and enters the blood and lymph vessels. It can enter through intact skin, hair follicles, or tiny cracks. Then the larvae are transported to the pulmonary vessels through the heart and bone through the lung alveoli.\n\n【22】*   They enter the airways to reach the pharynx, where they are swallowed, enter the stomach, and then into the small intestine. In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult worms. The adult worms attach to the gut wall and lay more eggs to repeat the life cycle.\n\n【23】In humans, the larvae can penetrate through the hair follicles, cracks, or intact skin. The larvae can rarely penetrate the basement membrane (the layer between the upper layer and the underlying skin). In animals, the larvae can penetrate the deeper layer of the skin.\n\n【24】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cutaneous Larva Migrans?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The clinical features of the disease are as follows:\n\n【26】*   The eruption occurs at the penetration site of hookworm larvae. The eruption can be red, itchy, and look like a wheel lesion.\n\n【27】*   There may be a tingling or pricking sensation within 30 minutes of larva penetration. Then the larva remains latent for weeks or months.\n\n【28】*   After some weeks, it shows migration activity that creates two to three-millimeters-wide snake-like tracts (erythematous tunnels) stretching three to four centimeters from the penetration site.\n\n【29】*   The eruptions are slightly raised, pink-colored, and cause itching.\n\n【30】*   There may be perianal involvement due to reinfection from the stool.\n\n【31】*   Urticaria (a raised, itchy rash on the skin).\n\n【32】*   Swelling can also be present.\n\n【33】*   The sites most commonly affected are the feet, hands, and spaces between the toes, knees, and buttocks.\n\n【34】How Can Cutaneous Larva Migrans be diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The diagnosis can be made in the following ways:\n\n【36】1.  **Doctor Evaluation** - The doctor evaluates the diagnosis based on the location of the rashes and the patient's history of contact with the soil.\n\n【37】2.  **Microscopy** - To find the hookworm eggs or larvae in the feces.\n\n【38】3.  **Skin Biopsy** - The test reveals the larva within the circular canal.\n\n【39】There is no blood test for zoonotic hookworm infection.\n\n【40】How Can Cutaneous Larva Migrans be Managed?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【41】*   Cutaneous larva migrans normally disappear within six months. If the infection continues even after six months, the possible complication proposes that treatment be given to prevent the disease.\n\n【42】*   Anthelmintic drugs such as Tiabendazole, Albendazole, Mebendazole, and Ivermectin are effective drugs prescribed to prevent the disease. The doctor should give oral Albendazole 400 mg daily for three to five days.\n\n【43】*   Topical Thiabendazole (10 % solution or 15 % ointment) is prescribed for localized lesions. If topical treatment gets failed, then oral treatment is prescribed.\n\n【44】*   Itching decreases after 24 to 48 hours of taking antihelmintic drugs, and the lesion will cure within one week.\n\n【45】*   Physical treatment such as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy (application of extreme cold or freeze to destroy the abnormal tissue) or carbon dioxide laser is used to destroy the larvae.\n\n【46】*   Antihistamines and topical corticosteroids with antihelmintic drugs are prescribed to relieve an itch.\n\n【47】*   If a person acquires a secondary infection, then antibiotics are prescribed.\n\n【48】How Can Cutaneous Larva Migrans be Prevented?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【49】These are the steps that the person should adopt to prevent the disease.\n\n【50】*   A person in the community should wear shoes while walking on sand because walking barefoot in contaminated areas will acquire the disease.\n\n【51】*   People should wear proper clothes because the disease is a skin infection.\n\n【52】*   Avoid sitting or lying down in contaminated areas.\n\n【53】*   Avoid the areas invaded by animals, especially dogs, and cats.\n\n【54】*   Avoid traveling to disease-prone areas.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**:\n\n【56】Cutaneous larva migrans are a skin disease found in tropical and subtropical areas. People should adopt preventive measures to prevent and eliminate the disease. The healthcare team, including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, should work together to educate the people about the disease and the treatment's importance.

The fallopian tube also gets twisted in some cases. The twisted fallopian tubes are a painful condition, which can eventually cut off the blood supply to the ovaries and other affected organs. The medical emergency in which an individual might lose the twisted ovary. It usually affects only one ovary. It is commonly seen in women who have larger or multiple cysts in their ovaries. An ovarian cyst causes the ovary to enlarge, which makes it more likely to get twisted. Medications like oral contraceptive pills might help reduce the size of the cyst in some patients and lower the risk of ovarian torsion.\n\n【2】What Is Ovarian Torsion?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Ovarian torsion is a condition when the ovary or fallopian tube twists around the ligaments and cuts off the blood supply leading to ovary loss.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Ovarian Torsion?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】Although the exact reason for the ovary to get twisted is not known, some of the factors or conditions that are commonly associated with ovarian torsion are:\n\n【6】*   **Ovarian Cysts or Growth -** Ovarian cysts or any other growth adds extra weight to the ovary. This displaces the ovary, which starts to twist and rotate around the supporting tissues.\n\n【7】*   **Longer Ovarian Ligament -** When the ligament that connects the ovary to the uterus is longer than usual, it makes ovarian torsion more likely.\n\n【8】*   **Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) -** Taking medicines to induce ovulation can also increase the risk.\n\n【9】*   **Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) -** The condition occurs in females who take medications to stimulate eggs.\n\n【10】*   **Pregnancy -** Some pregnant women develop corpus luteum cysts during the first trimester. This can cause the ovary to twist. The hormone levels are high during pregnancy, which relaxes the tissues in the body. This also relaxes the ligaments around the ovaries and makes them more prone to twisting.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Ovarian Torsion?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The symptoms commonly seen are as follows:\n\n【13】*   Sudden lower abdominal pain.\n\n【14】*   The pain will be severe and on the side of the affected ovary.\n\n【15】*   Fever.\n\n【16】*   Abnormal bleeding.\n\n【17】*   Dizziness.\n\n【18】*   Weight gain.\n\n【19】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【20】*   Pelvic pain.\n\n【21】*   Severe abdominal cramps.\n\n【22】*   Vomiting.\n\n【23】*   Nausea.\n\n【24】*   Pain during sex.\n\n【25】*   Back pain.\n\n【26】An individual might experience these symptoms suddenly or it might come and go for many weeks.

Urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\n【51】2.  Kidney stones.\n\n【52】3.  Gallstones.\n\n【53】4.  Gastroenteritis (stomach flu).\n\n【54】5.  Ovarian abscess.\n\n【55】6.  Appendicitis.\n\n【56】7.  Ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【57】What Are the Treatment Options for Ovarian Torsion?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】The treatment options for twisted ovary or ovarian torsion are as follows:\n\n【59】**Surgery:**\n\n【60】Surgery is done to untwist the ovary and fallopian tube. The surgical procedures include:\n\n【61】**1) Laparoscopy -** This procedure is done under general anesthesia. Here, the doctor will make a small incision through which specialized lighted instruments are inserted. These instruments are used to view the internal organs. Then, another incision is made to access the ovary, and a blunt tool is used to untwist it.\n\n【62】**2) Laparotomy -** Here, the surgeon makes a larger cut on the lower part of the stomach to reach the twisted ovary. The surgeon then untwists it manually.\n\n【63】If the ovary, fallopian tube, or surrounding tissues are dead due to prolonged loss of blood flow, then the affected part is removed.\n\n【64】*   **Oophorectomy -** The surgical removal of the ovary is called oophorectomy. It is done if the tissues in the ovary are dead.\n\n【65】*   **Salpingo-Oophorectomy -** It is the surgical removal of the ovary and fallopian tube of the affected side. This procedure is also done to prevent recurrence in postmenopausal women.\n\n【66】Most patients recover within a week following surgical treatment.\n\n【67】**Medicines:**\n\n【68】To help the patient with ovarian torsion pain, the doctor will prescribe painkillers like Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen. For severe pain, the patient will need opioids like Oxycodone. To reduce the risk of recurrence, the doctor might put the patient on high-dose birth control pills.\n\n【69】What Are the Complications of Ovarian Torsion?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【70】If detected and treated early, ovarian torsion does not cause permanent damage. But if the blood supply to the organs is cut off for a long time, then it can result in irreversible tissue changes in the involved ovary. The condition is treated by removing the affected ovary and fallopian tube.\n\n【71】If an individual has a fever, redness in the incision sites, smelly discharge, and severe pelvic pain after getting surgery, they should seek immediate help as these are signs of an infection.\n\n【72】If treatment is done promptly, then ovarian torsion does not cause permanent damage or does not impact the ability to conceive. Consult a gynecologist online to know more.\n\n【73】**Conclusion**\n\n【74】Ovarian torsion is a condition when the ovary twirl over the ligaments leading to cuts off the blood flow. The hormonal imbalance leads the ovary to twist. The symptoms include fever, back pain, lower abdominal pain, pain during sex, and severe abdominal cramps. The condition can be treated by surgery and medications. A regular gynecological examination helps in identifying different abnormalities that may increase the chances of ovarian torsion.\n\n【75】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【76】* * *\n\n【77】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Ovarian Torsion?**\n\n【78】Ovarian torsion, or adnexal torsion, is a condition where the ovary twists around the ligaments that support it.

{"seq_id": "1ab95a6b-5843-428d-b930-de7123db70eb", "title": "Joint Arthroplasty - Indications, Contraindications, Types, and Procedure", "text": "【0】Joint Arthroplasty - Indications, Contraindications, Types, and Procedure\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】A joint is a part of the body where two or more bones meet to allow movement. The joint contains various ligaments, tendons, and muscular attachments and makes the skeleton flexible. There are 360 joints in an adult human body. Most of the joints have fluid within for lubrication and frictionless movement.\n\n【2】Damage to the joint from trauma or inflammation can lead to joint dislocation or degeneration. These joint disorders may cause pain and limit their movements. Arthroplasty is a Greek word; arthro means joint, and plasty means molding or forming. However, the term arthroplasty is the other name for joint replacement in medical practice.\n\n【3】**What Is Joint Arthroplasty?**\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】*   Arthroplasty is a surgical treatment for joint injury or disorders. In arthroplasty, the articular surface of the musculoskeletal system is replaced, reconstructed, remodeled, or realigned. An artificial joint (prosthesis made of plastic or metal) can also be used. Arthroplasty is a major surgery that removes pain significantly and preserves the biomechanics and functionality of the joint.\n\n【5】*   In some situations, hemiarthroplasty is preferred over total replacement, where only a portion of the damaged part is operated. The procedure can be carried out immediately after a fall or injury since it has less preparation time. The advantage of hemiarthroplasty is less surgical time, less blood loss, and less chance of dislocations after treatment.\n\n【6】*   The most common type of arthroplasty is knee replacement and hip replacement.\n\n【7】**What Are the Principles of Joint Arthroplasty?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The following are the principles applied to replacement surgery with a prosthesis.\n\n【9】*   Proper patient and procedure selection are essential for any surgery.\n\n【10】*   The operative site must be exposed satisfactorily for better visualization and good access.\n\n【11】*   Soft tissue balance is critical to the success of the procedure.\n\n【12】*   The selected prosthesis must be durable and reliable.\n\n【13】*   After replacement, it must not provoke any unwanted reactions in the tissue.\n\n【14】*   The prosthesis must be firmly attached to the skeleton and allow low friction movement in the joints.\n\n【15】**What Are the Indications of Joint Arthroplasty?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】1.  **Osteoarthritis:** A degenerative joint disorder where the flexibility of the joint tissue is lost over time due to normal wear and tear reaction. The most common form of osteoarthritis affects joints in the hand, knee, hip, and spine.\n\n【17】2.  **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the joint tissues' healthy cells, causing inflammation (painful swelling). It is a chronic disorder affecting many joints in the body.\n\n【18】3.  **Fracture:** A broken joint has severe manifestations since it is usually a displaced fracture (broken bone moves out of alignment). Therefore, treating a joint fracture immediately is essential to restore the harmonization of the joint.\n\n【19】4.  **Birth Defects:** Some of the birth defects of the joints, especially hallux valgus, need replacement surgery.\n\n【20】5.  **Avascular Necrosis:** A localized death of bone due to lack of blood supply may result from injury or drug side effects.\n\n【21】6.  **Tumors:** Any cancerous or noncancerous tumor may cause severe damage to the joints.\n\n【22】**What Are the Contraindications of Joint Arthroplasty?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   **Absolute Contraindication:**\n\n【24】1.  Active joint infection.\n\n【25】2.  Systemic infection or sepsis.\n\n【26】3.  Chronic osteomyelitis (bone infection).\n\n【27】4.  Muscle dysfunction.\n\n【28】5.  Vascular disease (a condition affecting the system of blood vessels).\n\n【29】*   **Relative Contraindication:**\n\n【30】1.  Localized infection.\n\n【31】2.  Insufficient bone.\n\n【32】3.  Severe soft tissue damage.\n\n【33】4.  Debilitating diseases (diabetes, heart or lung disease).\n\n【34】**What Are the Types of Joint Arthroplasty?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The most successful and common form of arthroplasty is replacement surgery. Hence, joint arthroplasty and joint replacement are used interchangeably. However, theoretically, arthroplasty can be of various types.\n\n【36】**Replacement Arthroplasty:** A procedure where the dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an external prosthesis for functional continuity is called replacement arthroplasty. It can be;\n\n【37】*   **Hemi Arthroplasty:** It is also known as a hemi replacement, where only one of the joint surfaces is removed and replaced by a prosthesis.\n*   **Total Arthroplasty:** It is also known as a total replacement where both of the opposing joint surfaces are removed and replaced with prosthetic components.\n\n【38】**Excisional Arthroplasty:** In excisional arthroplasty, one or both joint surfaces are removed and left empty. The gap created between the joints is filled with fibrous or scar tissue. It is the most common type of surgery preferred in chronic infection conditions.\n\n【39】**Interpositional Arthroplasty:** Grafting (moving tissues from one site to another in the body) the joint surface with other tissues like skin, muscles, or tendons to keep away inflammation.\n\n【40】**Resurfacing Arthroplasty:** Trimming or slicing away the damaged joint surface is called resurfacing arthroplasty. It is an excellent alternative treatment for replacement surgery, especially in younger and active adults, because of its bone-preserving nature.\n\n【41】**How Is Joint Arthroplasty Performed?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n【42】Knee, hip, shoulder, ankle, and fingers are the most common joints for arthroplasty.\n\n【43】*   A complete history of the patient is evaluated.\n\n【44】*   Pre-surgical medical examination and routine laboratory investigations are done. Since the replacement surgery should be performed under general anesthesia, the necessary safety precautions are followed.\n\n【45】*   The standard protocols before any surgery are preparing the patient by starting an intravenous line, inserting a urinary catheter, and monitoring vitals (heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen level, breathing).\n\n【46】*   The surgical site is cleaned with an antiseptic solution.\n\n【47】*   An incision is made in the area of the joint.\n\n【48】*   The damaged area is removed and replaced with prosthetic material mimicking the natural shape of the joint.\n\n【49】*   The prosthesis is either fixed with the bone cement or press-fit type (cementless). Then the incision is closed and placed together with a stitch or staple. A sterile bandage or dressing is applied.\n\n【50】A few days of hospitalization followed by several weeks of rest to promote healing and rehabilitation is advised.\n\n【51】**What Are the Complications of Joint Arthroplasty?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】*   Pain, swelling, infection, bleeding or blood clots, and damage to any nearby nerve or blood vessel are some common complications anticipated post-surgery.\n\n【53】*   Stiffness, soft tissue imbalance, weakness, instability, and fracture of adjacent bone are risks specific to the joints.\n\n【54】*   Rejection of the material, malposition, loosening, and dislocation of the prosthesis are the problems pertaining to the artificial joint.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Arthroplasty is an elective surgery to reduce pain and restore the functions of the joint. It is the most successful surgery with a high satisfaction rate. In addition, replacement surgeries can significantly improve the quality of life. Recent advancements in arthroplasty like minimally invasive techniques, a porous-coated prosthesis (for better adhesion to the bone), and 3D-printed patient-specific prostheses are appreciable and motivate many people to opt for this procedure with much confidence.\n\n【57】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【58】* * *\n\n【59】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Difference Between Arthroplasty and Replacement?**\n\n【60】The term arthroplasty means joint molding. So arthroplasty refers to any reconstruction, remodeling, realignment, or replacement of the joints. However, in medical practice, the term arthroplasty is often used as an alternative to joint replacement surgeries.\n\n【61】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Arthroplasty a Joint Replacement?**\n\n【62】Joint replacement is also a form of arthroplasty where the damaged joints are replaced by artificial materials like metals, plastic, or ceramics. The joint replacement can be total or partial depending on the clinical scenario.\n\n【63】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Arthroplasty a Major Surgery?**\n\n【64】Yes, arthroplasty is a major surgery that restores the biomechanical structure and function of the joints and reduces joint pain significantly.

{"seq_id": "6f23143a-4971-4f5f-ae35-1f1ea5a9a266", "title": "Gilteritinib - Dosage, Indications, Contraindications, and Side Effects", "text": "【0】**Introduction**\n\n【1】Gilteritinib is an anti-cancer drug particularly used to manage specific forms of acute myeloid leukemia. The drug works as an FLT3 or tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The drug is beneficial to patients in whom cancer has relapsed or returned and are unresponsive to other treatment options. Leukemia is a cancer that primarily affects the body's white blood cells. The drug is recommended for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients associated with FLT3 gene mutation. Mutations or alterations in the genetic structure affect the working of genes. People with AML must get tested for FLT3 gene mutations. As Gilteritinib belongs to the class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it works by targeting and attacking cancer cells. Gilteritinib was developed by Astellas Pharma and granted the orphan drug designation by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on July 20, 2017. Finally, Gilteritinib was approved by the FDA on November 28, 2018.\n\n【2】**Safety and Effectiveness of Gilteritinib:**\n\n【3】A clinical study was performed to compare the efficacy of Gilteritinib to other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, the study aimed to look for complete cancer remission. Hence, a trial named ADMIRAL was done on 138 adults with relapsed or refractory AML due to FLT3 gene mutation. The patients were given Gilteritinib 120 mg orally until acceptable toxicity. After a follow-up of 4.6 months, 29 patients had complete remission along with partial hematologic recovery. The other 106 patients became independent of RBC (red blood cells) or platelet transfusion during a period of 56 days. The common adverse reactions reported by trial participants were:\n\n【4】*   Malaise.\n\n【5】*   Fever.\n\n【6】*   Fatigue.\n\n【7】*   Nausea.\n\n【8】*   Stomatitis.\n\n【9】*   Edema.\n\n【10】*   Rashes.\n\n【11】*   Cough.\n\n【12】*   Headache.\n\n【13】*   Hypotension.\n\n【14】*   Vomiting.\n\n【15】*   Dizziness.\n\n【16】How Does Gilteritinib Work to Treat AML?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【17】AML is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells in the bone marrow. It commonly occurs due to mutations in the FLT3 gene or tyrosine kinase. This is the time when Gilteritinib comes into action. As the drug is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it inhibits the tyrosine kinase receptors, including FLT3. Certain cells express FLT3, including tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-D835) and FLT3-ITD-D835Y. Gliterititnib particularly inhibits FLT3 receptors and the signaling pathways that stimulate their proliferation. In addition, the drug also induces cell death in leukemic cells, which express FL3-ITD.\n\n【18】How Long Does Gilteritinib Take to Work?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【19】The onset of duration varies from one individual to the other. For example, people who are responsive might respond within two months. However, the drug's action and efficacy depend on the body and medical history. The following factors affect the duration of the onset of drug action:\n\n【20】*   The severity of the patient's condition.\n\n【21】*   The previous treatment the patient has undergone for a particular condition.\n\n【22】*   The type of FLT3 mutations one experiences.\n\n【23】The doctor can check the drug's effectiveness by measuring the number of cancer cells in the body. The patient might show significant improvements within a few months. However, anti-cancer drugs have several associated side effects. Studies report that some patients developed a response within 27 days after taking Gilteritinib. It means that cancer symptoms have lessened over time, along with the partial recovery of blood count.\n\n【24】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【25】**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):**\n\n【26】AML is a cancer that initiates in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. It has been named acute because of its rapid speed of progression. As cancer is characterized by the rapid proliferation of body cells, the blood cells divide and move out of the bloodstream quickly in AML. Sometimes, cancer can spread to other body parts, including the liver, lymph nodes, spleen, brain, spinal cord, or testicles. Several factors, including smoking, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, increase the risk of AML.\n\n【27】**Signs and Symptoms of AML:**\n\n【28】The general signs and symptoms of AML are listed below:\n\n【29】1.  Bone pain.\n\n【30】2.  Fever.\n\n【31】3.  Fatigue.\n\n【32】4.  Shortness of breath.\n\n【33】5.  Pale skin.\n\n【34】6.  Increase in the frequency of infections.\n\n【35】7.  Bleeding from the nose or gums.\n\n【36】What Is the Most Important Information One Should Know About Gilteritinib?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Gilteritinib must be used cautiously as it might cause some serious side effects listed below:\n\n【38】*   **Differentiation Syndrome -** It is a life-threatening condition that affects the blood cells. Differentiation syndrome is usually noticeable within two days of starting the Gilteritinib therapy and during the first three months of treatment. Hence, the patient must consult the doctor or visit the emergency room immediately if he notices the following symptoms of differentiation syndrome:\n\n【39】    *   Fever.\n\n【40】    *   Cough.\n\n【41】删除1:<u>        Related Topics\n\n【42】        * * *\n\n【43】        Benzene Toxicity - Health Effects and Management\n\n【44】        Gilteritinib - Dosage, Indications, Contraindications, and Side Effects\n\n【45】        Kostmann Syndrome\n\n【46】    *   Respiratory difficulties.\n\n【47】    *   Rashes.\n\n【48】    *   Lightheadedness.\n\n【49】    *   Dizziness.\n\n【50】    *   Weight gain.\n\n【51】    *   Swelling of the arms or legs.\n\n【52】    *   Decreased urine frequency.\n        </u>\n\n【53】What Should the Patient Inform the Doctor Before Taking Gilteritinib?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Before taking Gilteritinib, the patient must inform the doctor if he or she has the following:\n\n【55】*   Heart disease, including long QTc syndrome.\n\n【56】*   Abnormal levels of electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium.\n\n【57】*   Conceived or planned for the same in the future. Gilteritinib can harm the unborn baby, so one must avoid getting pregnant during the therapy.\n\n【58】    *   For patients planning to become pregnant, the doctor might perform a pregnancy test seven days before the treatment.\n\n【59】    *   Females must use appropriate birth control measures during Gilteritinib therapy for six months after the last dose.\n\n【60】    *   Males with female partners that can become pregnant must use birth control measures for four months after the last Gilteritinib dose.\n\n【61】*   Breastfed or planning for the same. Not much information is available regarding the presence of Gilteritinib in breast milk. Hence, one must avoid breastfeeding for two months after the last Gilteritinib dose.\n\n【62】How Should the Patient Take Gilteritinib?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【63】*   Take Gilteritinib exactly as directed by the doctor.\n\n【64】*   Avoid changing the drug dose or stop taking it without consulting the doctor.\n\n【65】*   Gilteritinib tablets must be swallowed as a whole. Avoid breaking, crushing, or chewing them.\n\n【66】*   The drug can be consumed with or without food.\n\n【67】*   For people who missed the drug or did not take it at the scheduled time, they must take the drug soon and 12 hours before the next dose.\n\n【68】*   Follow the normal schedule for the next dose. However, avoid taking two doses within 12 hours.\n\n【69】What Are Some of the Side Effects of Gilteritinib?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【70】Gilteritinib can cause some of the following serious side effects:\n\n【71】*   **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)** - People taking Gilteritinib are at a higher risk of developing PRES, which affects brain cells. Hence, the patient must inform the doctor immediately in case of the following symptoms:\n\n【72】    *   Headache.\n\n【73】    *   Decreased alertness.\n\n【74】    *   Seizures.\n\n【75】    *   Confusion.\n\n【76】    *   Eyesight problems.\n\n【77】    *   Blurred vision.\n\n【78】The doctor will perform a test to evaluate the symptoms of PRES and might recommend the patient discontinue the drug.\n\n【79】*   **QTc Prolongation -** Gilteritinib can induce changes in the electrical activities of the heart resulting in QTc prolongation. Hence, the doctor will evaluate the patient's ECG (electrocardiogram) for the electrical activity of the heart before and during Gilteritinib therapy. The patient must inform the doctor in case of dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. There is a higher risk of QT prolongation in people with depressed blood potassium and magnesium levels.\n\n【80】*   **Pancreatitis -** Patients with pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas have stomach pain that does not subside easily. The pain might be accompanied by vomiting or nausea.\n\n【81】Some of the other common side effects of Gilteritinib are listed below:\n\n【82】*   Muscle or joint pain.\n\n【83】*   Changes in liver function tests.\n\n【84】*   Fever.\n\n【85】*   Tiredness.\n\n【86】*   Pain or sores in the mouth or throat.\n\n【87】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【88】*   Nausea.\n\n【89】*   Cough.\n\n【90】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【91】*   Constipation.\n\n【92】*   Headache.\n\n【93】*   Dizziness.\n\n【94】*   Low blood pressure.\n\n【95】*   Eye problems.\n\n【96】*   Decreased urination.\n\n【97】For Doctors:\n------------\n\n【98】**Indications and Usage:**\n\n【99】Gilteritinib has been approved by the FDA for managing relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with mutations in the FLT3 gene.\n\n【100】**Contraindications:**\n\n【101】Gilteritinib must be avoided in patients with allergies to its ingredients.\n\n【102】**Dosage and Administration:**\n\n【103】**Patient Selection:**\n\n【104】The ideal candidates for Gilteritinib therapy are those with AML and mutations in the FLT3 gene in the bone marrow or blood. The response might be delayed. The drug must be given for six months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity to allow time for response.\n\n【105】**Recommended Dosage:**\n\n【106】The recommended initial dose of Gilteritinib is 120 mg once daily, with or without food. The response might be delayed. Avoid crushing or breaking the tablets, and take them at the same time daily. In case of a missed dose, the drug must be taken on the same day and 12 hours before the next dose.\n\n【107】**Dosage Modifications:**\n\n【108】The patient's blood count and creatinine phosphokinase levels must be assessed before the initiation of the therapy. The count must be checked once weekly or monthly, depending on the severity. The dosage modifications based on adverse reactions are mentioned as below:\n\n【109】**1\\. Differentiation syndrome:** The patient must be given systemic corticosteroids with hemodynamic monitoring until the symptoms subside for at least three days. Interrupt the therapy if symptoms persist for 48 hours or above. Resume the therapy only when the symptoms improve to grade 2.\n\n【110】**2\\. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome:** Discontinue the drug.\n\n【111】**3\\. QTc interval above 500 milliseconds:** Interrupt Gilteritinib therapy. Resume the therapy only when the QTc interval is between 30 to 480 milliseconds.\n\n【112】**4\\. QTc interval above 30 msec on ECG on day eight of cycle 1 -** Perform an ECG on day nine. Reduce the dose to 80 mg.\n\n【113】**5\\. Grade 3 or higher toxicity -** Interrupt the therapy until toxicity subsides and then resume at 80 mg.\n\n【114】**6\\. Pancreatitis -** Interrupt the therapy until pancreatitis subsides and then resume at 80 mg.\n\n【115】**Contraindications:**\n\n【116】Gilteritinib is specifically contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients. Some patients have experienced anaphylactic reactions during clinical trials.\n\n【117】**Warnings and Precautions:**\n\n【118】*   **Differentiation Syndrome** - Differentiation syndrome was reported in 3 % of patients out of the 319 trial participants. This syndrome is characterized by rapid differentiation and proliferation of myeloid cells and can be fatal or life-threatening. The common symptoms of differentiation syndrome in people treated with Gilteritinib are listed below:\n\n【119】    *   Fever.\n\n【120】    *   Dyspnea.\n\n【121】    *   Pericardial effusion.\n\n【122】    *   Pleural effusion.\n\n【123】    *   Hypertension.\n\n【124】    *   Weight gain.\n\n【125】    *   Pulmonary or peripheral edema.\n\n【126】    *   Rashes.\n\n【127】    *   Renal dysfunction.\n\n【128】    *   Concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.\n\n【129】Differentiation syndrome was reported as early as two days or 75 days after the therapy. It has been observed with or without leukocytosis. Patients with differentiation syndrome must be given Dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours. In addition, hemodynamic monitoring is required until improvement. Corticosteroids can be tapered after the resolution of symptoms. Gilteritinib therapy must be stopped if the symptoms persist for more than 48 hours.\n\n【130】*   **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome -** Out of the 319 patients treated with Gilteritinib, 1 % of them experienced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, including seizures and altered mental status. However, the symptoms got resolved after discontinuing Gilteritinib therapy. Hence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【131】*   **Prolonged QT Interval -** Gilteritinib can be associated with prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarization or QT interval prolongation. During the clinical trial, 1 % of patients had an increase in the QTc interval. Hence, an ECG must be performed on days 8 and 15 of the first cycle and before the initiation of the next cycle.\n\n【132】*   **Pancreatitis -** Out of the 319 patients, 4 % of them reported pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas. Hence, dosage adjustments must be made in such patients.\n\n【133】*   **Embryo-Fetal Toxicity -** Based on the mechanism of action, Gilteritinib can cause problems in the embryo or fetus. When the drug was administered in animals during organogenesis, teratogenicity and suppressed fetal growth were observed. Hence, females of reproductive potential must be counseled to use effective birth control methods during the therapy and four months after the last dose.\n\n【134】**Description:**\n\n【135】Gilteritinib is particularly a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The chemical name of the drug is 2-Pyrazinecarboxamide, 6-ethyl-3-\\[\\[3-methoxy-4 \\[4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-piperidinyl\\] phenyl\\] amino\\]-5-\\[(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl) amino\\]-, (2E)-2 butenedioate (2:1). In addition, the molecular weight of Gilteritinib is 1221.50, and the molecular formula is (C29H44N8 O3)2. The drug is light yellow and sparingly soluble in water. In contrast, the drug is slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol.\n\n【136】**Clinical Pharmacology:**\n\n【137】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【138】Gilteritinib is a small molecule that works against multiple receptor tyrosine kinase or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3. The drug has the ability to inhibit the FLT3 signaling pathway, the exogenous proliferation of cells, and tyrosine kinase domain mutations (TKD) FLT3-D835Y and FLT3-ITD-D835Y.

It can also be called accidental bowel leakage. The condition is characterized by accidental passing of bowel substances such as solid stools, liquid stools or mucus from the anus. Fecal incontinence can be upsetting and embarrassing. Some people may feel ashamed and try to hide the problem. The condition is more common in older adults or adults admitted to hospitals and nursing homes. People with diarrhea, type-2 diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome or poor health are also prone to fecal incontinence.\n\n【2】**What Are the Types of Fecal Incontinence?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   The most common type of pooping pants condition is called urge incontinence. It is like having a very strong urge to have a bowel but could not stop it before reaching the toilet. In cases of urge incontinence, the pelvic floor muscles may be very weak to hold back a bowel movement because of muscle injury or nerve damage.\n\n【4】*   Another type of fecal incontinence is called passive incontinence. In these cases, the leakage occurs without even knowing. In cases of passive incontinence, the body cannot sense when the rectum is full.\n\n【5】**In What Population Fecal Incontinence Is Common?**\n\n【6】According to medical experts, fecal incontinence is a common problem affecting 1 in 3 people who visit a primary health provider.\n\n【7】*   It is common in adults who are admitted to hospitals or nursing homes for a long time.\n\n【8】*   Commonly seen in adults above 65 years of age.\n\n【9】*   Physiologically inactive individuals.\n\n【10】*   People with certain chronic diseases, health problems or medical problems.\n\n【11】*   Individuals with gallbladder removed due to some diseases or gallstones.\n\n【12】*   People who are frequent smokers.\n\n【13】*   Children with birth defects of spinal cord, rectum or anus are prone to fecal incontinence.\n\n【14】What Are the Complications of Pooping Pants?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【15】People suffering from incontinence or pooping pants may also have problems such as:\n\n【16】*   Poor overall health due to uncontrolled bowel movement and upsetting mindset.\n\n【17】*   **Diarrhea:** Uncontrolled bowel movements with passing of watery stools.\n\n【18】*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome:** It is a group of symptoms which occur together, including repeated pain in abdomen and changes in bowel movements leading to constipation, diarrhea or both.\n\n【19】*   Diseases or conditions affect the nerves of anus, rectum or pelvic floor.\n\n【20】*   **Type-2 Diabetes:** Increase in the blood glucose levels due to deficiency of insulin in the body.\n\n【21】*   Weakness or damage of the muscles and nerves of anus, rectum or pelvic floor.\n\n【22】*   **Urinary Incontinence:** Uncontrolled passing of urine.\n\n【23】*   **Proctitis:** A condition with constant urge to pass stool even when the bowel is empty.\n\n【24】What Are the Problems Caused by the Pooping Pants?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The problems caused by pooping pants or fecal incontinence are:\n\n【26】*   Irritation or discomfort of skin around the anus region.\n\n【27】*   Compromised quality of life issues such as being unable to work, exercise, attend school or visit social gatherings.\n\n【28】*   Emotional or social distance such as embarrassing fear, loss of self-esteem, social isolation, anger and depression.\n\n【29】What Are the Symptoms of Pooping Pants?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】The symptoms of pooping pants depend on the type of incontinence:\n\n【31】*   In cases of passive fecal incontinence, the person passes the stool or mucus without knowing.\n\n【32】*   In cases of urge fecal incontinence, the patient will know the urge of passing stool but will not be able to control it before reaching the toilet.\n\n【33】*   Soiling: Streaks or stains of mucus or stool on the underwear.\n\n【34】What Are the Causes of Pooping Pants in Adults?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Fecal incontinence has several causes including some chronic diseases and digestive tract disorders.\n\n【36】Some of them are:\n\n【37】**1\\. Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools which fill the rectum quickly and are harder to control than solid stools. Diarrhea is one of the common risk factors for fecal incontinence in people admitted in hospitals and nursing homes.\n\n【38】The causes of diarrhea can be:\n\n【39】*   Irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【40】*   Inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【41】*   Proctitis.\n\n【42】**2\\. Muscle Injury or Weakness:** If the muscles of the pelvic floor, anus or rectum are injured they may not be able to keep the anus sphincter closed and stool may leak out. The reason behind muscle injury or weakening could be:\n\n【43】*   Surgeries include removal of cancer in the anus or rectum, hemorrhoids removal or treamtment of anal abscess and fistulas.\n\n【44】*   Trauma due to accidents, sports or fights.\n\n【45】**3\\. Nerve Damage:** If the nerve tissue of rectum, anus or pelvic floor are damaged, the muscle may have an impaired function. This might make it difficult for muscles of these regions to hold the stool and give the signal to the brain when rectum is full.\n\n【46】The cause of nerve damage are:\n\n【47】*   Long-term straining habit to pass stool.\n\n【48】*   Spinal cord injury.\n\n【49】*   Brain injury.\n\n【50】**4\\. Constipation:** This can lead to large, hard stools which are very difficult to pass. These hard stools stretch and with time weakens the muscles in the rectum. These weakened muscles cause leakage of watery stools which build up behind the hard stool.\n\n【51】**5\\. Neurological Diseases:** These are the diseases which affect the nerves of the anus, pelvic floor or rectum and cause fecal incontinence.\n\n【52】These diseases are:\n\n【53】*   **Multiple Sclerosis:** It damages the myelin sheath which surrounds the nerve cells and protects them.\n\n【54】*   **Dementia:** Loss of mental functions that are severe enough to hinder daily activities.\n\n【55】*   **Parkinson’s Disease:** It is a movement disorder caused due to lack of dopamine in the body.\n\n【56】*   **Type-2 Diabetes:** Extreme high blood glucose levels can affect the nerves and lead to nerve damage.\n\n【57】*   **Stroke:** Loss of blood flow to a part of the brain causing brain damage, long term disability or death.\n\n【58】**6\\. Loss of Stretchability in Rectum:** If the rectum is scarred or inflamed, it becomes stiff and cannot stretch enough to hold enough stool. This leads to early filling of rectum and leaking out of the stool.\n\n【59】**7\\. Rectal Prolapse:** Slipping down of rectum from the anus.\n\n【60】**8\\. Childbirth by Vaginal Delivery:** Childbirth in conditions such as large body size of baby, forcep use in delivery and use of vacuum in delivery can damage the anal sphincter leading to fecal incontinence.\n\n【61】How to Diagnose Pooping Pants?\n------------------------------\n\n【62】**\\- Medical History:** A proper medical history along with physical examination is important.\n\n【63】**\\- Lab Tests:** It includes blood tests to look for signs of anemia, infection or inflammation. Stool test showing presence of blood or signs of infection in the stool. Urine test to check for type-2 diabetes.\n\n【64】**\\- Bowel Function Test:** One or more of the following tests are formed to see the functioning of muscles and nerves of anus, pelvic floor and rectum.\n\n【65】1.  **Anorectal Manometry:** This test is performed to check the sensitivity of rectum and fucntioning of anal sphincter.\n\n【66】2.  **Defecography:** X-ray the area around the anus and rectum to see how well the person can hold and release the stool.\n\n【67】3.  **Electromyography:** Test to check the functioning of muscles and nerves of the anus and pelvic floor.\n\n【68】4.  **Endoscopy:** It is performed to look for any signs of inflammation, or infection inside the anus, rectum, colon or digestive tract.\n\n【69】Endoscopes of fecal incontinence include:\n\n【70】*   Anoscopy\n\n【71】*   Colonoscopy\n\n【72】*   Flexible sigmoidoscopy\n\n【73】*   Rectoscopy\n\n【74】What Is the Treatment for Pooping Pants?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【75】The treatment for pooping pants or fecal incontinence include management of the disease.\n\n【76】**1\\. Absorbent Pads:** Wearing absorbent pads inside the underwear is the most common treatment for fecal incontinence.\n\n【77】**2\\. Dietary Changes:** Diet intake should be followed according to the underlying cause such as diarrhea or constipation.\n\n【78】**3\\. Over-the-Counter Medicines:** Depending on the cause, medicines can help cure fecal incontinence. If diarrhea is the cause, medicines such as Loperamide and Bismuth subsalicylate should be advised. Whereas in cases of constipation, laxatives, stool softeners, or fiber supplements such as psyllium should be advised.\n\n【79】**4\\. Pelvic floor Muscle Exercise:** It is also known as Kegel exercise. Tightening and relaxing pelvic muscles many times a day can strengthen the muscles of anus, pelvic floor and rectum.\n\n【80】**5\\. Sacral Nerve Stimulation:** Sacral nerves control the functioning of anal sphincters, rectum and colon. Doctors can use sacral nerve stimulation (electrical stimulation) to treat fecal incontinence.\n\n【81】**6\\. Vaginal Balloons:** For women with pooping pants, the doctor may suggest a device which inflates the balloon inside the vagina which puts pressure on the rectal wall through the vaginal wall.\n\n【82】**7\\. Non-absorbable Bulking Agents:** These are substances injected into the anus wall to bulk up the tissue around the anus. The bulkier tissue makes the anus opening narrower, so that the sphincter can close better.\n\n【83】**8\\. Surgery:** Surgery is opted when other options fail to stop fecal incontinence.\n\n【84】*   **Sphincteroplasty:** It is the most common surgery for pooping pants which reconnects the separated ends of anal sphincter torn by child birth or another injury.\n\n【85】*   **Artificial Anal Sphincter:** A cuff is placed around the anus and a small pump is implanted under the skin which can inflate or deflate the cuff. Inflating the cuff controls the path of the stool. This surgery is not recommended generally as it has side effects.\n\n【86】*   **Colostomy:** In this surgery, the colon is brought through the opening in the abdominal wall and stools are collected outside the body in a bag. This is the last resort for the treatment of fecal incontinence.\n\n【87】**Conclusion:**\n\n【88】Pooping pants is a disorder in which a person has no voluntary control over bowel movements and may poop whenever there is urge. In this condition the voluntary sensations of external sphincter are suppressed. Treatment of the disorder is important as it becomes embarrassing for the person in social and personal life.\n\n【89】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【90】* * *\n\n【91】#### **1.**删除换行**Is It Normal to Poop in Your Pants?**\n\n【92】No, it is not a normal phenomenon to poop in the pants as it is an embarrassing and unhygienic situation for the individual and the surroundings. Accidents can occasionally happen due to illness, certain medical conditions, or other factors, but if someone frequently experiences involuntary bowel movements, it may indicate an underlying medical issue.\n\n【93】#### **2.**删除换行**Why Would a Child Start Pooping Their Pants?**\n\n【94】If a child is younger than four, it is normal for them to poop in pants, but if a child older than four years poops in pants, it can be due to fecal incontinence. In this condition, the child loses voluntary control over bowel movements.\n\n【95】#### **3.**删除换行**What Do I Do if I Poop My Pants?**\n\n【96】Suppose the pooping in pants is involuntary and regular. In that case, it should be addressed to the doctor as it is a medical condition that affects the digestive system and psychiatric status of the person. If someone is experiencing this problem, it is advisable to consult a doctor for an evaluation and appropriate treatment.\n\n【97】#### **4.**删除换行**How Do I Stop Pooping My Pants?**\n\n【98】If pooping pants are normally due to the urge to have bowel movements, it can be controlled by pressing the butt cheeks together or avoiding the squat position. However, in cases of fecal incontinence can be controlled by following a proper diet and taking some medications to stop diarrhea or constipation.\n\n【99】#### **5.**删除换行**How Do I Get My 8-Year-Old to Stop Pooping His Pants?**\n\n【100】Try to understand the underlying reasons for the child's difficulty. It could be due to physical, emotional, or behavioral issues. Consider any recent changes or events that may have triggered this behavior.  Consult a pediatrician to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to the problem. The doctor can provide a thorough evaluation and recommend appropriate treatments or interventions.\n\n【101】#### **6.**删除换行**Do Marathon Runners Poop in Their Pants?**\n\n【102】During long-distance races like marathons, it is not uncommon for some runners to experience bowel issues, including the urge to poop. However, most marathon runners aim to prevent accidents by managing their bowel movements before the race and using available restroom facilities along the course.\n\n【103】#### **7.**删除换行**How Do You Fix Bowel Leakage?**\n\n【104】Various factors, including muscle or nerve damage, digestive disorders, or other medical conditions can cause bowel leakage. Consult a healthcare specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, colorectal surgeon, or urologist, specializing in treating bowel-related issues.\n\n【105】#### **8.**删除换行**Is There a Poop Disorder?**\n\n【106】Yes, there are several disorders related to bowel movements and fecal elimination, including fecal incontinence, diarrhea, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements, leading to involuntary passage of stool. It can range from occasional leakage to complete loss of bowel control. Fecal incontinence can be caused by muscle or nerve damage, rectal surgery, or certain medical conditions.\n\n【107】#### **9.**删除换行**Why Does Someone Lose Control of Their Bowels?**\n\n【108】Losing control over the bowel can be due to a neuromuscular disorder which leads to decreased control of the voluntary muscles of the rectum and anus. The sphincter muscles at the end of the rectum help control the release of stool. If these muscles are weakened or damaged, they may be unable to hold the stool, resulting in fecal incontinence effectively.\n\n【109】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【110】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- Bowel Control Problems (Fecal Incontinence)  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/bowel-control-problems-fecal-incontinence\n*   NIH- Diagnosis of Fecal Incontinence  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/bowel-control-problems-fecal-incontinence/diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "4771f2ba-3cb8-4b44-88ed-1a343cc0d44a", "title": "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Immunotherapy for Bladder Cancer", "text": "【0】Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Immunotherapy for Bladder Cancer\nWhat Is a BCG Immunotherapy or BCG Treatment?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【1】BCG or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Immunotherapy is a treatment in which the doctor delivers the immunotherapy drugs directly to the patient’s urinary bladder through a catheter. It is intravesical immunotherapy because the drugs are directly injected into the urinary bladder. BCG treatment differs from other oral and injectable medications because it specifically targets the cancer cells in the bladder lining and does not have any adverse reactions on the other body cells. The drug is a liquid derived from the strain of Mycobacterium bovis; the bacteria used to develop the tuberculosis vaccine. When this bacteria is used in the drug, it is attenuated or weakened so that it does not harm the body. BCG treatment is usually done after the transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (a surgery done to remove cancer).\n\n【2】What Is Bladder Cancer?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Cancer is a condition in which the cells in the human body show uncontrolled growth. Usually, there are genes present in the body that control cell division and proliferation. However, when these genes fail to regulate cell growth and are predominated by defective genes, the condition is known as cancer. It can occur in any organ of the body. When cancer originates from the bladder's inner lining, the condition is known as bladder cancer. The urinary bladder is a balloon-shaped structure that stores urine temporarily. It consists of muscles that contract and relax to facilitate urine drainage.\n\n【4】What Conditions Can Be Managed With BCG Treatment?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】BCG immunotherapy is mainly used to treat early-stage bladder cancer. Early-stage bladder cancer is when the cancer cells remain confined to the bladder and do not invade the bladder wall muscle. Early-stage bladder cancer is non-invasive muscle bladder cancer and carcinoma in situ. The limitation of BCG treatment is that it is ineffective against bladder cancer that has metastasized or spread to other body parts. Some clinical trials are being done to test the effectiveness of BCG treatment for fibromyalgia and diabetes. Some experts believe that BCG treatment could help eliminate these diseases because they stimulate the production of cytokines. BCG treatment should not be confused with intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy because different drugs are administered in both treatments. Cancer drugs or chemotherapeutic agents directly attack cancer cells, whereas immunotherapy drugs increase the power and capabilities of the immune system.\n\n【6】How Should the Patient Prepare for the BCG Treatment?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】BCG treatment has become one of the most common treatments for intravesical cancer, and before the test, the doctor will give specific guidelines to the patient. The patient must not drink caffeine-containing beverages or have Diuretics (water pills) four hours before the procedure. Ensure the patient passes urine before the procedure because the urine might interfere with the drug.\n\n【8】What Happens During the BCG Immunotherapy?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   The doctor will administer local anesthesia before the treatment to make the patient comfortable so that the procedure can be carried out quickly.\n\n【10】*   Next, the doctor inserts a tube known as a catheter into the urethra and injects the BCG liquid through the catheter.\n\n【11】*   The primary aim of this procedure is that the BCG solution should come in contact with the cancer cells to kill them. Therefore, after the solution is injected, the doctor will remove the catheter and ask the patient to lie on his back, stomach, and sides for 15 minutes.\n\n【12】*   When the procedure is complete, the patient can return home the same day but should not pass urine for at least one hour.\n\n【13】*   Hold the BCG solution in the urinary bladder for two hours and urinate only after this time. Once the solution enters the bladder, the immune system gets activated and attacks the cancer cells.\n\n【14】*   The initial BCG treatment is done for six weeks, and this stage is known as induction therapy.\n\n【15】*   If the doctor finds the treatment effective and working, he might prescribe maintenance therapy. It is given once a week for three weeks in the third, sixth, and 12th months.\n\n【16】*   Some people might undergo the treatment for three years.\n\n【17】Is BCG Immunotherapy Contagious?\n--------------------------------\n\n【18】The drugs used in BCG immunotherapy contain live tuberculosis bacteria that might transmit to others. However, the patient can follow the below-mentioned instructions for six hours after every BCG treatment:\n\n【19】*   Do not use public toilets.\n\n【20】*   Drink plenty of water to dilute the urine.\n\n【21】*   Sit down on the toilet while urinating to avoid splashing.\n\n【22】*   After passing urine, the patient must add two cups of undiluted bleach to the toilet and wait for 15 to 20 minutes before flushing.\n\n【23】*   People with urinary incontinence or urine leakage must wash their clothes separately.\n\n【24】*   If the patient wears an incontinence pad, soak the pad in bleach before discarding it in the trash.\n\n【25】What Are the Advantages of BCG Treatment?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【26】The patient must not engage in sexual activities for a few days after the BCG treatment. Use a condom before having sexual intercourse until the BCG treatment is done. Then, the patient can consult the doctor to learn about the guidelines for sexual intercourse. BCG treatment has proven to be most effective when combined with transurethral resection of bladder tumors for early-stage bladder cancer. It helps slow tumor growth and reduces the chances of cystectomy or bladder removal surgery.\n\n【27】What Are Some of the Side Effects of BCG Treatment?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Side effects are commonly seen in the first 24 hours of BCG treatment. The side effects of BCG treatment are listed below:\n\n【29】1.  Blood in the urine.\n\n【30】2.  Low-grade fever.\n\n【31】3.  Burning sensation while passing urine.\n\n【32】4.  Fatigue or tiredness.\n\n【33】5.  Urinating frequently or more than eight times a day.\n\n【34】6.  Muscle pain.\n\n【35】7.  Pain in the joints.\n\n【36】The doctor will provide medication to overcome these side effects or might ask the patient to take some over-the-counter drugs to reduce fever and discomfort. Mostly the side effects of BCG treatment subside within 72 hours, but the patient must consult the doctor if they persist. The less common side effects of BCG treatment are listed below:\n\n【37】*   Skin rash.\n\n【38】*   High-grade fever.\n\n【39】*   Vomiting and nausea.\n\n【40】*   Loss of bladder control.\n\n【41】*   Bladder spasm.\n\n【42】*   Inability to pass urine.\n\n【43】*   Urinary tract infections.\n\n【44】*   Testicular inflammation.\n\n【45】*   Ureteral obstruction.\n\n【46】*   Thickening and scarring of the bladder muscles.\n\n【47】*   Cell death or necrosis.\n\n【48】*   BCG sepsis might occur if the BCG solution enters the bloodstream.\n\n【49】*   Neutropenia (reduced white blood cell count).\n\n【50】*   Hepatitis and BCG-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\n【51】Can Bladder Cancer Recur After the BCG Treatment?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】Bladder cancer can return after BCG immunotherapy, similar to other cancers. Studies have reported that cancer recurs in about 40 % of the people who receive BCG treatment. However, an important point to note here is that cancer might recur but does not progress or spread to the other organs. Early-stage cancer usually does not metastasize or infect other organs, but people having low-grade cancer might develop other cancers in their lifetime. As per the report, aggressive bladder cancer is less likely to occur after BCG treatment. If it happens, bladder removal surgery or cystectomy must be done.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】Bladder cancer is a common condition and can affect males and females of any age. Several treatment options are available for the treatment of bladder cancer, including cystectomy, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and chemotherapy. Among all these treatment options, BCG immunotherapy is becoming popular among doctors and patients because it is a conservative option to address early-stage bladder cancer. The procedure gets completed in 15 to 20 minutes, and the patient is saved from the surgical trauma.

Any disruption or disturbance in these coordinated reflexes can result in the risk of apnea, bradycardia, failure to thrive, oxygen desaturation, and aspiration in infants. Therefore, the identification of abnormal sucking patterns is very crucial to prevent feeding disorders and other associated complications due to abnormal sucking patterns. Read the article to know more about the factors responsible for the abnormal sucking pattern in neonates.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Sucking Patterns?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】There are basically two types of sucking patterns observed in infants according to the research:\n\n【5】1.  **Nutritive Sucking:** It appears at a slow pace and is around one sucks per second. Burst usually appears with a pause initially. The rooting reflex (movement of the infant's head towards the touch on the cheek followed by mouth gaping) develops at birth in infants with normal neurological development.\n\n【6】2.  **Non-Nutritive Sucking:** The sucking pattern observed in a few infants shows the sucking of the thumbs, pacifiers, or other objects. This is referred to as non-nutritive sucking. It varies around two sucks per second and the burst duration is around 2 to 12 seconds. However, the burst duration and frequency increase with time. As soon as the milk ejection reflex develops the infant is encouraged to nutritive sucking.\n\n【7】When Does the Normal Sucking Reflex Develop?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The normal sucking reflex usually develops during the twenty-eighth week of the gestational period. The infants, after birth, begin the sucking mechanism, which is divided into 2 phases:\n\n【9】*   **Expression Phase:** in this phase, the infant puts their lips around the areola with the nipple far back between the hard and soft palate and presses the breast between tongue and palate, resulting in the expression phase -forcing the milk out.\n\n【10】*   **Milking Action:** In this phase, the tongue shifts from the areola towards the nipple, resulting in milk ejection into the baby's mouth.\n\n【11】These coordinated reflexes of sucking, swallowing, and breathing become one complex task for newborns.\n\n【12】What Is an Abnormal Sucking Pattern?\n------------------------------------\n\n【13】An abnormal sucking pattern develops due to disturbances affecting the coordination of normal sucking, swallowing, and breathing reflexes. Abnormal sucking patterns affect the growth and development of the baby due to non-nutritive sucking. Therefore, it is important to urgently diagnose and treat the underlying condition to prevent serious health complications.\n\n【14】What Are the Factors Responsible for Abnormal Sucking Patterns in Newborns?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Various factors can result in abnormal sucking patterns in the newborns, such as:\n\n【16】*   **Abnormal Jaw Movements:** Abnormal movements of the jaws result in an inability to form a proper seal during the sucking.\n\n【17】*   **Abnormal Tongue Movements:** Uncontrolled or abnormal tongue movement is seen in infants resulting in an inability to suck properly.\n\n【18】*   **Delayed Formation of Suckling Reflex:** In some cases, the suckling mechanism is delayed in infants' formation, resulting in abnormal sucking patterns. It becomes very difficult for doctors to diagnose and rule out the difference between early brain damage signs and developmental delay of the suckling mechanism.\n\n【19】*   **Presence of Neonatal Brain Injuries:** Injuries to the brain in neonates can disrupt the coordinated movements needed for an effective normal sucking mechanism. In addition, damage to the brain can disrupt the transmission of signals to the brain. At the same time, the sucking mechanism of the brainstem is responsible for the normal and coordinated suckling and swallowing mechanism.\n\n【20】*   **Premature Births:** Infants born preterm usually show abnormal sucking patterns. Preterm births have a greater impact on the brain's normal development, such as disturbance in the formation of the white and gray matter of the brain and formation of myelin sheath on the nerve (myelination). These disturbances during brain development can impair the infant's cognitive and motor skills development. Regular follow-ups with the doctor and monitoring of the sucking reflexes at each appointment to diagnose and rule out if the infant is developing a normal swallowing reflex or not with time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be performed for accurate diagnosis.\n\n【21】*   **Infants Born With Underlying Systemic Disease:** Infants born with systemic conditions like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are more likely to have an abnormal or uncoordinated suckling pattern due to arrhythmic swallowing and sucking reflex.\n\n【22】What is Neonatal Oral-Motor Assessment (NOMAS)?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】A neonatal oral-motor assessment scale (NOMAS) can be used to assess the sucking patterns in infants. It is the most reliable tool for evaluating nutritive and non-nutritive sucking patterns. In addition, this tool helps to diagnose and rule out the different sucking patterns like:\n\n【24】*   **Normal Sucking Patterns:** Infants with coordinated swallowing, suckling, and breathing reflex due to normal movements of the tongue and jaws.\n\n【25】*   **Disorganized Sucking Patterns**: Infants with uncoordinated swallowing, suckling, and breathing reflex due to arrhythmic movements of the tongue and jaws.\n\n【26】*   **Dysfunctional Sucking Patterns:** Infants with abnormal movements of the tongue and jaw resulting in a disruption in the sucking mechanism.\n\n【27】What Are Different Technologies Developed to Assess Neonatal Sucking?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Different technologies developed to quantify neonatal sucking are:\n\n【29】1.  **Kron Nutritive Sucking Apparatus (KNSA):** It was developed by Kron in the year 1963 and was used to measure the pressure exerted on the nipples while suckling. The software was used to measure the sucking parameters of KNSA (Kron Nutritive Sucking Apparatus) like sucking duration, frequency, and the total number of bursts in a session.\n\n【30】2.  **Nutritive Sucking Apparatus (NSA):** It was the modified version of KNSA developed by Medoff-Cooper. The device consisted of a standard milk bottle and customized nipple which is attached to a pressure sensor, signal processor, and memory drive.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:** Nutritive sucking is very crucial for the growth and development of the child. There are various factors like preterm births, early neonatal brain injuries, or congenital anomalies that have a greater impact on normal nutritive sucking. Therefore, doctors need to diagnose and rule out the exact underlying cause behind the abnormal sucking patterns of the infant and treat them in the early stages of life. Any delay in diagnosis and management can result in potentially serious complications to the health of newborns.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Newborn Reflexes  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Reflexes.aspx\n*   Abnormal Nutritive Sucking as an Indicator of Neonatal Brain Injury  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2020.599633/full\n*   Abnormal developmental patterns of suck and swallow rhythms during feeding in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11463175/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Other organs involved in these disorders are the kidney, heart, brain, and genital areas. People affected by Townes - Brocks syndrome present at least two main features of the triad along with the other symptoms. Townes-Brocks syndrome is referred to as renal-ear-anal-radial (REAR) syndrome.\n\n【2】What Is the Prevalence of Townes-Brocks Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact prevalence of Townes-Brocks syndrome is unknown, but it is estimated to be present in one in 250,000 people in the general population.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Townes-Brocks Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Townes - Brocks syndrome is supposed to be caused by a genetic mutation of the SALL1 (spalt-like transcription factor 1) protein and DACT1 (disheveled binding antagonist of beta-Catenin 1) gene on chromosome 14q23.\n\n【6】*   Almost 50 percent of cases are due to hereditary causes (runs in the family).\n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Associated With Townes-Brocks Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms related to Townes-Brocks syndrome are:\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>Can reduction in blood supply to testes lead to de novo single gene mutation?</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>Why do I have fatigue, breathlessness, and slightly abnormal blood test reports?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>What can be the cause for high B12 level in a person with MTHFR mutation?</u>\n\n【14】How Can We Diagnose Townes-Brocks Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Diagnostic criteria for Townes-Brocks syndrome are:\n\n【16】*   **Based on Clinical Symptoms:** Confirmatory diagnosis of Townes-Brock syndrome is considered only when it involves at least two major clinical symptoms of the triad, along with the presence of some other associated symptoms.\n\n【17】*   **Single Gene Testing:** Genetic evaluation for detecting the presence of SALL1 gene alteration helps in confirming the diagnosis.\n\n【18】*   **Multigene Panel Test:** Along with the SALL1 gene, other gene mutations are also noted, like the DACT1 (disheveled binding antagonist of beta-catenin 1) gene.\n\n【19】*   **Other Comprehensive Genome Test:** Other molecular genome tests like DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequencing and mitochondrial sequencing are done if a single gene and multigene panel test fail to diagnose the condition.\n\n【20】*   **Auditory Brainstem Response Test (Hearing Test):** If the genetic test confirms the diagnosis of Townes syndrome, an immediate hearing test is done to evaluate if any hearing impairment is present.\n\n【21】*   **Kidney Ultrasound:** An ultrasound of the kidney is done to detect any kidney disorders like cysts in the kidney and abnormal shape or size of kidneys.\n\n【22】*   **Eye Examination:** It is done by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) to check for any abnormalities in the eyes, like clouding of the eye lens or vision disturbances.\n\n【23】*   **Echocardiogram (ECG):** It is done by a cardiologist (heart specialist) to evaluate for any defects in the heart, like ventricular (chamber of the heart) defects.\n\n【24】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scans:** These scans are performed on the temporal bone (lateral part of the skull) to detect the structural defects of the ears, like stenosis (narrowing) of the external ear canals.\n\n【25】What Is the Treatment of Townes-Brocks Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Management of Townes-brocks syndrome needs a multidisciplinary approach (need various specialties and doctors). Different treatment modalities based on the symptoms diagnosed are:\n\n【27】*   **Treatment of Hearing Loss:** Management of hearing loss is done by using different hearing aids like hearing headbands (given in the first months of life) and bone-anchored hearing devices (given in the early age of life till five years) until the child reaches seven years of age (surgical treatment is done after seven years of age). Cochlear implants (artificial hearing devices) are surgically implanted (placed) in the bones of the inner ear after the age of seven years for a clear and sound hearing.\n\n【28】*   **Anal Surgery:** Surgical treatment is done to treat the obstruction in the anal opening.\n\n【29】*   **Treatment of Kidney Disorders:** Kidney functions should be monitored completely even if there are no symptoms related to the kidney, as some patients develop the symptoms in later stages. If required, hemodialysis (purifying of body blood if a kidney is not functioning) and kidney transplantation are done if the kidney is not functioning properly. Drugs toxic to kidneys are avoided after surgery.\n\n【30】*   **Heart Surgery:** Inborn heart defects are treated surgically by a cardiologist (heart specialist).\n\n【31】*   **Treatment of Malformed Fingers and Toes:** Structural defects of thumbs and toes, like the presence of an extra thumb, are treated surgically by removing extra thumbs, and treatment of overlapping toe bones is also done.\n\n【32】*   **Genetic Counseling:** Genetic counseling of the affected person is done to explain the risk factors to the offspring or reproduction options, and the availability of prenatal testing should be done before pregnancy to avoid risk.\n\n【33】*   **Prenatal Tests (Test Before Childbirth):** Prenatal testing is done in patients if any of their family members have been identified by the SALL1 gene. This test identifies if the child has inherited the SALL1 gene or not. This test cannot predict the severity of the clinical symptoms that can occur after birth.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Townes syndrome is a rare genetic disorder comprising a triad of symptoms like obstructed anal opening, and structural defects of the ears and the thumbs, along with other minor symptoms affecting kidneys, heart, brain, lower limbs, and eyes in some cases. Most affected people have two major symptoms of the triad, which confirms the presence of Townes-brocks syndrome. As soon as the diagnosis of Townes-brocks syndrome is confirmed, treatment should be started by a multidisciplinary (doctors specializing in different fields) team approach to treat all the underlying symptoms associated with the syndrome. Although there are multiple genetic tests available for diagnosing Townes syndrome, further research is still needed in this area for the early detection and treatment of Townes-brocks syndrome for a better outcome.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   A family with Townes-Brocks syndrome with congenital hypothyroidism and a novel mutation of the SALL1 gene  \n    https://www.e-cep.org/journal/view.php?number=2010531208\n*   TOWNES-BROCKS SYNDROME  \n    https://www.omim.org/entry/107480\n*   Townes-Brocks Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/townes-brocks-syndrome/\n*   Townes-Brocks Syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/townes-brocks-syndrome/#resources\n*   Townes-Brocks syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7784/townes-brocks-syndrome\n*   Townes-Brocks Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1445/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "5f493734-f8d2-44b4-9a14-d58daeb3dd2f", "title": "Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention", "text": "【0】Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】A naturally occurring marine biotoxin called paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) is created by specific types of tiny algae. Shellfish can retain the poison after consuming these algae. Eating seafood tainted with paralytic shellfish poison can make people sick. The phrase \"paralytic\" shellfish poison refers to the biotoxin's effects on the neurological system and paralysis of the muscles. Paralytic shellfish poison can result in severe disease and even death at high doses.\n\n【2】**Which Kind of Shellfish Are Impacted?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】Paralytic shellfish poison can build up in Bivalve molluscan shellfish like clams, mussels, oysters, geoducks, and scallops. The same is true for other gastropods and moon snails. Sea cucumbers and other marine creatures could be impacted. Due to their diet of shellfish, crabs can also develop poisonous qualities. Even though the crab flesh is harmless, toxins often build up in the crab gut and butter (the white-yellow fat found in the shell's back). Avoid eating the fat and guts of the crab, and properly clean it.\n\n【4】**Why Are Paralytic Shellfish Poison Levels So High?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】It is typical for seawater to include algae that produce biotoxins. They often exist in small populations that pose no issues. But when the algae \"blooms,\" the number of algae that produce biotoxins may rise. Shellfish now have a better food source thanks to the increasing algae. The amount of biotoxin that shellfish ingest depends on how much algae they consume. Shellfish are not harmed by biotoxins. Therefore, their tissue level will increase until the bloom dies down. The shellfish gradually flush the toxin from their bodies when the number of toxin-producing algae cells returns to normal low levels. It may take a few days, a few months, or even longer before they are once more safe to eat.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Tingling, sometimes known as paresthesia or a pins-and-needles sensation.\n\n【8】*   Lips and mouth numbness that extends to the face, neck, and limbs.\n\n【9】*   Dizziness.\n\n【10】*   Paralysis weakened arms and legs.\n\n【11】*   Breathing problems, and in extreme circumstances, death.\n\n【12】*   Headache.\n\n【13】*   Nausea.\n\n【14】*   Vomiting.\n\n【15】The average period between consumption and the onset of symptoms is one hour (between 30 minutes and three hours). The rate of symptom progression and severity varies according to the severity of the toxin poisoning. In severe situations, death, respiratory failure, and muscle paralysis can happen within 12 hours.\n\n【16】**What Are the Causes of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Bivalve shellfish and crustaceans that have been tainted with a toxin can result in paralytic shellfish poisoning. Dinoflagellate algal blooms, which typically occur from June through October when the weather is warmer, cause an accumulation of toxins in filter feeders like bivalves. Clams, mussels, whelks, moonshell, dog winkles, oysters, entire scallops, crabs, and lobster hepatopancreas (tomalley) are the fish species most frequently afflicted.\n\n【18】In some species of shellfish, the toxin bioaccumulates in specific tissues and can last for a very long time. Butter clams, for instance, which go by the Latin name Saxidomus and are the source of the term saxitoxin, can retain toxin for up to a year after an algal bloom that produces it. Butter clams acquire toxins in the siphon, throat, and gills; it is advised to remove and discard them before eating. Avoid giving the pets these substances. Butter clams have been connected to sea otter deaths in Alaska.\n\n【19】**What PSP Tests Are Available Right Now?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Liquid chromatographic post-column oxidation (LC PCOX) is the method used in laboratories to test for PSP in shellfish. This innovative test isolates fluid samples at the molecular level, allowing for the identification and measurement of specific hazardous chemicals. It replaces the conventional mouse bioassay approach that has been in use since the 1950s. Human PSP is primarily diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and recent shellfish exposure.\n\n【21】**What Can Be Done for People Who Are Suspected to Have PSP Sickness?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The accompanying healthcare professional is in charge of the treatment. People should get medical help right away. PSP has no recognized antitoxin. Supportive care is provided. Serious patients should be admitted to the hospital and given breathing support. The foundation of PSP treatment is typically supportive measures, including ventilator support in severe cases. Up to 75 percent of severely affected people pass away within 12 hours without supportive care.\n\n【23】Staff from public health will carry out an investigation to identify any potential sources of the sickness and to talk about contacts. Even though the infection cannot be passed from person to person, contact follow-up is advised for anyone else who may have eaten tainted food. These people ought to get education on disease symptoms when to seek medical help, transmission, the length of the incubation period, and preventative actions.\n\n【24】**How Can One Be Safeguarded From Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】One can safeguard from PSP poisoning with a certain method.\n\n【26】*   **Do Not Eat Them**: Avoiding eating bivalves (such as clams, mussels, scallops, and cockles) from beaches is the simplest and most effective strategy to prevent PSP poisoning. PSP testing is necessary for shellfish sold at wholesale and retail marketplaces, and they are thought to be safe for human consumption.\n\n【27】*   **Know the Species**: One can lower the risk if they consume bivalves from beaches by staying away from the two most deadly species, butter clams, and blue mussels. Littleneck clam toxicity levels often rise less in littleneck clams than in butter clams and decline more quickly in littleneck clams. Under Alaska's official policy, eating untested shellfish is dangerous. Since the quantities of toxicity have been documented, this also applies to littleneck clams. Littleneck clams are less prone to PSP than other shellfish. However, this does not mean they are always safe when other species nearby are also affected. One should become familiar with all the clam species if one gathers or consume clams from Alaskan beaches. Consuming any clams, scallops, or mussels from Alaska's shores requires extreme caution.\n\n【28】It is advisable to remove the crab's back shell and clean out all the dark soft tissues that make up the digestive system and crab butter before cooking since crabs that eat hazardous shellfish can accumulate PSP toxin in their digestive systems.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】In conclusion, eating shellfish tainted with saxitoxins can result in paralytic shellfish poisoning, a dangerous condition. It is critical to be informed about shellfish harvesting advisories, to stay away from locations that are closed or contaminated, and to seek medical help if PSP symptoms appear after consuming shellfish. Pay attention to regional advice and stay away from eating shellfish from known contaminated locations to prevent PSP.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n无关删除-1:<u>*   Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) | Washington State Department of Health.  \n    https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/shellfish/recreational-shellfish/illnesses/biotoxins/paralytic-shellfish-poisoning\n*   Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning  \n    https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/fss/shellfish/paralytic-shellfish-poisoning/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This surgery is done for the child’s well-being. Many types of heart defects. Some are minor, and some are major. Defects occur inside the heart and in large blood vessels outside the heart. Some surgeries require immediate surgery right after the infants are born.\n\n【2】Corticosteroids are routinely given to infants who undergo cardiac surgery with CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) to facilitate the response to inflammation. However, this is controversial, and the decision to administer the intervention varies between the center and the healthcare provider within the center.\n\n【3】What Corticosteroids Are Used in Infants After Cardiac Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Many infants who undergo congenital heart surgery receive per-operative corticosteroids to reduce postoperative inflammation and to control capillary leaks following the cardiopulmonary bypass. Many proofs show a reduction in many inflammatory markers associated with corticosteroids during, before, and after the surgery.\n\n【5】Impact of corticosteroids on perioperative mortality, potential risk of corticosteroids that include infections and hyperglycemia. Significant reduction in duration of ventilation and intensive care unit stay associated with corticosteroids in infants with congenital heart surgery. The impact of corticosteroids on infants with heart surgery remains unclear and is a matter of debate.\n\n【6】What Is the Indication of Corticosteroids in Pediatric Infant Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Corticosteroids are mainly used in infant heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The indications are\n\n【8】1.  To blunt the systemic inflammatory response that is induced by extracorporeal circuits.\n\n【9】2.  It provides perioperative supplementation that is presumed relative to adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【10】3.  The presumed neuroprotective effect that occurs to arrest operations during deep hypothermic circulatory.\n\n【11】The use of corticosteroids in these three overlapping conditions is a matter of discussion.\n\n【12】What Are the Conditions Where Steroids Are Used as Treatment?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Steroids are used to reduce overall systemic inflammation post-infant heart surgery, and this trial included 1200 patients with modified intention-to-treat individuals who received double-blind methylprednisolone or placebo. The most common conditions where steroids are used in infants are atrioventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defect.\n\n【14】Other conditions where steroids are indicated for better outcomes post-surgery are:\n\n【15】1.  Post-operative hospital length stays less than 90 days.\n2.  Renal failure with temporary dialysis.\n3.  Ventilator support for less than 7 days.\n4.  Multiple-system organ failure.\n5.  Postoperative unplanned interventional catheterization.\n6.  Post-operative cardiac arrest.\n7.  Preoperative bleeding.\n8.  Unplanned delayed sternal closure.\n9.  Postoperative mechanical circulatory support.\n10.  Unplanned cardiac operation.\n11.  Multisystem organ failure.\n12.  Respiratory failure with permanent dialysis.\n13.  The neurologic deficit persists at discharge.\n14.  Operative mortality.\n\n【16】Do Corticosteroids Lead To Less Inflammation and Better Clinical Outcomes?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】For many years, measured the effect of glucocorticosteroids on markers of inflammation but, importantly, tried to correlate them with the clinical outcomes. Steroids can blunt inflammation, but some others are the opposite.\n\n【18】*   It is difficult to characterize the multifaceted nature of SIRS response, a variety of activated cytokines that interact occur in an unpredictable manner.\n\n【19】*   The use of corticosteroids is subject between centers and various types of steroids, routes of administration, various regimes, and making a more difficult correlation between clinical outcomes and inflammation.\n\n【20】*   Small-sized and displaying a variability between endpoints, the standard corticosteroid regimen recommended to all individuals may not address host inflammatory response but the approach to SIRS.\n\n【21】Are Steroids Worth the Risk?\n----------------------------\n\n【22】It is difficult to assess the short-term risk of steroid administration. Some groups of infants have no effect of steroids during their administration after undergoing heart surgery. However, some cases raised concerns about infection and steroid-treated groups.\n\n【23】*   Children undergoing heart surgery have no significant benefits from steroids. Steroids are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in low-risk individuals.\n\n【24】*   The course of steroid administration is associated with increased rates of sepsis, fractures, and venous thromboembolism.\n\n【25】*   Infants with premature lung disease and early administration of steroids harm cognition outcomes and neuromotor effects on children.\n\n【26】*   Infants with respiratory distress found steroids associated with delayed development and cerebral palsy incidence.\n\n【27】*   Long-term follow-up is aimed at studying the effects of steroids on neurocognition.\n\n【28】How Do Steroids Lead to Benefits in Infant Heart Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】When the steroid comparison is compared to two groups that include postoperative infection and mortality, hospital stay and mechanical ventilation support are:\n\n【30】*   The rate of mortality postoperative complications was 17.2 percent for the steroid group and 20.3 percent for the placebo group.\n\n【31】*   The mortality rate of infants who received steroids was 2.8 percent for the placebo group and 2 percent for the steroid group.\n\n【32】*   Postoperative infections occurred around 5.2 percent in steroid administration, while 4 percent in placebo administration.\n\n【33】*   6.8 percent steroid administration was required to prolong mechanical ventilation, while 8.5 percent was in the placebo group.\n\n【34】*   Individuals who received steroids had ten days of hospital stay and 11 days for the placebo group.\n\n【35】*   Steroid-administered infants had more risk of high blood sugar, where 19 percent required insulin within surgery, while 6.7 percent of infants in the placebo group required insulin within 24-hour surgery.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】Steroid use in pediatric cardiac surgery in three main areas: adrenal function, neuroprotection, and effect on inflammation. Characterized by the complex inflammation in response to the surgery, the effects of steroids remain limited on the outcomes.

Hemorrhoids appear as swollen veins occurring in the anus and rectum area. Hemorrhoids appear to be common in pregnancy. It can occur during any period (trimester) of the pregnancy. However, it is mainly seen in the second and third trimesters due to an increase in the size of the fetus leading to pressure over the uterus. Hemorrhoids do not pose any threats to life and is not considered a life-threatening condition. It also does not cause any harm to the health of pregnant women and fetuses. There are two types of hemorrhoids based on their appearance in the location. They are:\n\n【2】*   Internal hemorrhoids.\n*   External hemorrhoids.\n\n【3】Internal hemorrhoids are seen in the rectum, and external hemorrhoids are seen in the area of the anus. People who have experienced hemorrhoids before pregnancy have more chances of having them during pregnancy. Hemorrhoids usually resolve after delivery.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>My hemorrhoids have popped and are bleeding.

As the month progresses, the size of the fetus increases, which puts pressure on the uterus. The pressure of the uterus is transferred to the organs, structures, and blood vessels beneath it. As a result of this pressure present on the blood vessels, the veins become swollen in the rectum and anus area leading to hemorrhoids in pregnancy.\n\n【11】*   During pregnancy, the total blood volume increases due to the growing fetus. This extra blood volume causes inflammation over the veins in the anus and rectum area, leading to hemorrhoids in pregnancy.\n\n【12】*   If the food intake contains low fiber, it causes difficulty in passing the fecal matter, leading to swelling of veins over that area and hemorrhoids.\n\n【13】*   In some pregnant women, taking iron supplements cause difficulty in passing the stools. As a result, straining over the rectus and anal area will lead to swollen veins over the area, leading to hemorrhoids.\n\n【14】*   The hormonal change present during pregnancy lead to the formation of hemorrhoids in some patients. The hormone that is increased during pregnancy is progesterone.\n\n【15】*   The pregnancy hormones sometimes delay the digestive process and decrease bowel movements. This decrease in bowel movements leads to constipation in pregnancy. In constipation, it is difficult to pass the stools out. The stool becomes hard. Then, extra effort made to pass the fecal matter out lead to swelling of the blood vessels in the anus and rectum, leading to hemorrhoids.\n\n【16】*   Long-standing posture or sitting for a prolonged time cause pressure over the anus and rectum area so that swelling appears in the veins over that area can lead to hemorrhoids.\n\n【17】**What Are the Symptoms Observed?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】Hemorrhoids can be symptomatic and asymptomatic. In some cases, the patient does not experience any difficulty or does not come to know about the situation itself. It is seen in cases of internal hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids are often symptomatic. The symptoms include:\n\n【19】*   Pain around the anus and rectum is felt. It is often referred to as anal pain. The reason for anal pain is that the area has many nerve endings. Pain presents as a dull aching pain or throbbing type.\n\n【20】*   The sensation of itching is felt in the anal and rectum area. It initially appears as a small discomfort over the area, leading to an itching sensation. Itching at the anal area is called pruritus ani.\n\n【21】*   Pain is present while passing the fecal matter through the anus, where hemorrhoids are present.\n\n【22】*   The presence of blood can be identified in the stools, which are passed out through the anus.\n\n【23】*   Swelling or a small lump-like area may be noted in the area of the anus.\n\n【24】*   Bleeding from the rectus may be observed in some patients. It should be noted well, and appropriate care should be taken immediately.\n\n【25】**How Is the Diagnosis Made?**\n------------------------------\n\n【26】The diagnosis is made based on several pieces of information observed and noted by the healthcare provider:\n\n【27】*   The history of the disease stage and the symptoms encountered.\n\n【28】*   The doctor would also like to know if the patient has prior history of disease before the pregnancy.\n\n【29】*   The doctor physically examines the patient to know the overall status.\n\n【30】*   The doctor will check for any swelling or lump present near the anus. After that the doctor will have an examination of the rectum. The doctor inserts gloved fingers into the rectum and observes the changes. For the confirmation of diagnosis, some endoscopic procedures are performed.\n\n【31】These endoscopic procedures may cause slight discomfort in the area of hemorrhoids. Considering the occurrence of hemorrhoids in pregnancy, endoscopic procedures will not be performed. It may be a uncomfortable for pregnant women. If the healthcare provider requires the endoscopic procedure, it will be done using the following:\n\n【32】*   **Colonoscopy:** It is a diagnostic procedure to view the colon, a part of the gastrointestinal tract. In this procedure, the doctor places a long flexible tube into the patient's colon through the anus and rectum. The tube is fitted with a camera at the tip, known as a colonoscope. This colonoscope helps to view the changes in the rectum and anus area. Then, based on the history and physical examination, the doctor concludes the disease.\n\n【33】*   **Sigmoidoscopy:** It helps to view the rectum. This procedure passes a flexible lubricated tube into the rectum through the anus. A camera is present at the tip of the tube, known as a sigmoidoscope. After placing the tube inside, the air is passed into it to visualize the area easily. Sigmoidoscope records the images and sends them to the computer for recreation images for diagnostic procedures.\n\n【34】**What Is the Treatment Plan?**\n-------------------------------\n\n【35】The goal of the treatment is to avoid discomfort and pain caused by the hemorrhoids.\n\n【36】*   Have a diet with high-fiber content for easy bowel movements and prevention of constipation.\n*   Do regular exercise, which allows good circulation and ease in bowel movements.\n*   Pregnant women are advised to avoid standing or sitting in the same position for longer.\n*   The doctor sometimes recommends stool softeners to prevent strain while passing fecal matter.\n*   In some cases, according to the opinion of healthcare, laxatives are considered.\n*   Topical creams to apply over the hemorrhoids are not considered because they are not proven safe during pregnancy.\n*   Soaking the anus region in a tub of slightly warm water. This method is called a sitz bath. It helps to get relief from the anal pain present. It is considered a home remedy for hemorrhoids.\n*   Ice cubes or packs can be placed in the area of hemorrhoids as a home remedy.\n*   Surgery is not considered a treatment option during pregnancy; it will be done after delivery.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】Hemorrhoids are swollen veins seen in the anus and rectum area. It is a treatable condition. They do not pose any threat to the life of the mother and fetus. A good fiber-rich diet and exercises help to relieve constipation and straining of the muscles, which helps to prevent discomfort to some extent.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Introduction Hemorrhoids are commonly known as piles.

It is a condition where the body produces an increased number of basophils. Basophils are white blood cells that protect the body against infections caused by viruses, parasites, fungi, and even during cancer. Basophils are also present in the body to fight against allergens. If the basophil count is elevated unusually, the condition is called basophilia. Basophilia may be a clinical sign usually suggestive of an infection. It may also suggest a sign of underlying medical pathologies like leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells) or an autoimmune disorder.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Basophilia?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Basophilia occurs when the body has an increased number of basophils. The basophil count can be increased due to various reasons. Sometimes, the symptoms of basophilia signify that the body is defending against a serious medical pathology such as hyperthyroidism or cancer. Other times, these symptoms indicate the body is fighting a persistent infection or fighting against an allergen.\n\n【4】Certain medical conditions are associated with basophilia, including:\n\n【5】*   Chronic myeloid leukemia (blood cancer of adults).\n\n【6】*   Primary myelofibrosis (a rare form of chronic leukemia).\n\n【7】*   Thrombocythemia (a disease where the bone marrow produces an increased number of blood platelets).\n\n【8】*   Myelodysplastic syndrome (a condition where the production of blood cells is disrupted).\n\n【9】*   Inflammatory bowel disease (an inflammatory disorder of the whole or part of the digestive tract).\n\n【10】*   Ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory disorder characterized by sores and ulcers in the digestive tract).\n\n【11】*   Rheumatoid arthritis (an inflammatory disease of the joints).\n\n【12】*   Certain food allergies to milk, dairy, peanuts, fish, etc.\n\n【13】*   Drug allergies (allergy to certain medicines).\n\n【14】*   Hay fever (characterized by cold-like symptoms including itchy eyes, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, and congestion).\n\n【15】*   Chickenpox (a contagious viral infection causing a rash on the skin).\n\n【16】*   Tuberculosis (a bacterial infection affecting the lungs).\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Basophilia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【18】The symptoms of basophilia resemble many other medical conditions. The symptoms may include:\n\n【19】*   High fever.\n\n【20】*   Weakness.\n\n【21】*   Tiredness.\n\n【22】*   Severe headache.\n\n【23】*   Recurrent infections.\n\n【24】*   Severe itching and pruritus.\n\n【25】*   Rashes on the skin.\n\n【26】*   Arthritis (swollen and painful joints).\n\n【27】*   Dizziness.\n\n【28】*   Easy bleeding.\n\n【29】*   Breathlessness.\n\n【30】*   Bone pain.\n\n【31】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【32】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【33】*   Sudden weight loss.\n\n【34】*   Numbness in the fingers.\n\n【35】How Is Basophilia Diagnosed?\n----------------------------\n\n【36】The healthcare professional might discover the high basophil count while performing a routine complete blood count (CBC) for another cause. After an abnormal complete blood count, the physician might suggest a blood smear. A drop of the patient’s blood is taken on a slide and spread to examine for abnormal red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood platelets.\n\n【37】The various tests to identify the causes of basophilia include:\n\n【38】*   **Blood Tests-** The healthcare professional usually advises these tests to look for abnormal counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood platelets. Blood tests can also be done to check for inflammation or to evaluate abnormal levels of proteins and other substances in the blood. Allergies can also be checked by the blood test.\n\n【39】*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy-** The doctor removes a bone marrow sample from the hipbone. This bone marrow sample is then sent to a laboratory and tested in a lab to identify if the bone marrow is producing healthy blood cells.\n\n【40】*   **Genetic Tests-** These tests check for gene mutations that may cause diseases like polycythemia vera (when increased red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow) and chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\n【41】*   **Ultrasound-** This test makes use of sound waves to scan pictures of the body organs. It is usually done to check whether the spleen is enlarged. Usually, an enlarged spleen can also be seen in a few cancer patients and infectious diseases.\n\n【42】What Is the Treatment and Management of Basophilia?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Basophilia is not treated directly, but the condition may improve once the underlying medical condition that caused it is managed and treated.\n\n【44】The various myeloproliferative disorders are treated with the following:\n\n【45】*   **Chemotherapy-** The medications used for this treatment modality usually destroy the extra blood cells present in the body.\n\n【46】*   **Radiation Therapy-** High-energy X-rays are used in this treatment to kill the extra blood cells in the body.\n\n【47】*   **Surgery-** The doctor may surgically remove the spleen if it is enlarged. This surgical operation is known as splenectomy.\n\n【48】*   **Stem Cell Transplantation-** In this procedure, the stem cells are replaced in the bone marrow so that the bone marrow can synthesize healthy new blood cells.\n\n【49】Certain diseases like ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis are generally treated with drugs that help lower inflammation by suppressing the immune system.\n\n【50】People suffering from certain food and drug allergies should avoid triggers such as milk, dairy, peanuts, pollen, dust, pet dander, etc. The patient can be given allergy shots to desensitize them to certain types of allergens, like weeds (plants present in the wrong place), mold (fungal growth), dust, and insect stings. Bacterial infections are usually treated with antibiotics.\n\n【51】What Are the Complications of Basophilia?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【52】Basophilia does not cause complications on its own, but the underlying medical conditions can cause these complications, including:\n\n【53】*   Enlarged spleen.\n\n【54】*   Severe infections.\n\n【55】*   Pain.\n\n【56】*   Defective blood clotting.\n\n【57】*   Severe bleeding.\n\n【58】*   Increased susceptibility to cancers.\n\n【59】**Conclusion**\n\n【60】Basophils are a type of white blood cells that are produced in the bone marrow. A normal range varies from zero to three basophils in every microliter of blood. A higher-than-normal basophil level is called basophilia. It can be a sign of chronic infection in the body or suggest some serious blood disorder or cancer. The doctor may identify the condition by doing certain blood tests.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>*   Basophilia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535365/\n*   Basophilia in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia  \n    https://imagebank.hematology.org/image/63560/basophilia-in-chronic-myelogenous-leukemia\n*   Basophilia: An overview.  \n    https://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/basophilia-an-overview.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8b04aae1-ea2f-46d5-970e-1a07dfd6a259", "title": "Fussy Baby - An Overview", "text": "【0】Fussy Baby - An Overview\nWhy Do Babies Cry?\n------------------\n\n【1】A baby’s first cry is the most incredible joy in any parent’s life. Medically, it shows that the lungs of the baby are healthy. However, as the weeks go by, the same cry becomes a source of frustration and anxiety for parents who do not know how to soothe their babies. It is normal for an infant to cry for at least two to three hours daily for the first six weeks. The first three weeks are the hardest. During this time, they are either peaceful or fussy.\n\n【2】It is an inevitable truth that the baby cries a lot. It can be overwhelming if a parent cannot identify why the baby is crying. While crying is normal for newborns, first-time parents always seem a little lost about what to do. However, the baby mimics the mood or emotions of the parents. That is why the very first step towards soothing a baby is calming down by oneself as a parent. A new parent is often sleep-deprived in earlier days and is still getting used to this new responsibility in life. It is essential to know the reason why the baby is crying. Very often, one of the things explained below makes a baby fussy. Such as:\n\n【3】*   **The Baby Might Be Hungry**: It does not just specify to children; adults too get cranky while hungry. Moreover, the researchers suggest that if the baby is hungry and crying, it often has a “neh” sound. It is because the baby is searching for milk and his tongue reflexively hits the crown of the mouth that produces the sound.\n\n【4】*   **The Baby Might Be Tired**: Sometimes, due to various reasons, it is difficult for a little one to fall asleep. This can make them fussy the whole day. Parents should sing a lullaby or swaddle them to ease the process of sleeping.\n\n【5】*   **The Baby Might Need to Be Burped:** Usually, if a baby starts crying right after feeding, it means that he needs to burp. Burping the baby is usually required after feeding, but often parents need to burp them after hiccups or if they have sucked up on something that involves swallowing air.\n\n【6】*   **The Baby Might Be Overstimulated:** Overstimulation happens when the baby experiences sudden noise, sensations, or an activity. This can make them cry.\n\n【7】*   **The Diaper Might Be Dirty or Wet**: Some babies carry dirty diapers for hours and will not show them on their faces. Whereas others start crying the minute their diaper gets wet. Parents should often use a sniff test approach or a diaper with an indicator to check the wetness.\n\n【8】*   **The Baby Might Be Too Hot or Cold:** Sometimes, a baby may feel uncomfortable due to temperature changes. Often, too hot a temperature can also give them rashes. And too cold temperature disturbs their health.\n\n【9】*   **The Baby Might Be In Pain or Is Sick**: Sometimes, the baby may cry because of some health issue. As they cannot communicate, crying is the best sign they can give. Moreover, excessive crying could be the reason for colic. Parents should consult their pediatrician if the crying is excessive.\n\n【10】What Can Help a Fussy Baby?\n---------------------------\n\n【11】There are many ways through which parents can comfort their fussy baby. However, not all these will work for every baby. Parents should calmly try each one of the options and see which works for their baby and which does not.\n\n【12】*   Mothers should avoid overfeeding their babies because more than the required food can make them uncomfortable. Each feeding should have at least two to 2.5 hours of a gap in between.\n\n【13】*   If a baby is fussy after feeding, the mother should avoid caffeine products and change their diet. Mothers should also avoid spicy or gassy food while breastfeeding, as some researchers claim that these affect the baby's health.\n\n【14】*   While taking a nap, the baby's room should be quiet and without noise and light. This can give them comfortable sleep without disturbance. Also, babies tend to be less fussy if they sleep soundlessly.\n\n【15】*   Try gently stroking the infant’s belly.\n\n【16】*   Give the baby a warm bath.\n\n【17】*   Cuddle a baby in a kangaroo mother care position. It is a great technique for premature babies. A mother can have skin-to-skin contact with the baby across her bare chest. This technique has a wonderful effect on soothing babies.\n\n【18】*   Try white noise that has a soothing effect, especially on babies.\n\n【19】Furthermore, there are five “S” techniques for fussy babies. These are:\n\n【20】*   **Swaddling**: Babies often experience a reflex where they feel like they are falling, and their limbs flail so that they can wake themselves up. Snug wrap baby in a large thin, and soft blanket. It creates a womb-like feeling for a baby.\n\n【21】*   **Side or Stomach position**: Hold the baby in one’s arms and place her body on the left side to help digestion or support the stomach. Gently rub their back until they fall asleep.\n\n【22】*   **Shush:** Along with shhh and humming sounds, try to stroke the baby’s head from the front of the forehead to the back of the forehead gently.\n\n【23】*   **Swinging:** Calming motions remind babies how they felt in the womb. So, swinging can certainly calm them down. Moreover, parents can try walking while swinging.\n\n【24】*   **Sucking**: Use a pacifier. Sucking movement comforts the babies.\n\n【25】What Are the Things to Remember for Parents?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【26】As parents, it is normal to get overwhelmed and frustrated sometimes. There are a few things that every parent should keep in mind, such as:\n\n【27】*   If a baby is less than a month old, he or she cannot be spoiled.\n\n【28】*   If a baby constantly cries, it does not mean he or she is rejecting the parent.\n\n【29】*   Fussiness decreases with increasing age.\n\n【30】When to Call the Health Care Provider?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【31】Very often, crying stops when the baby is comforted. However, there are certain situations where parents should immediately seek medical attention, such as:\n\n【32】*   If a baby is crying continuously for more than three hours.\n\n【33】*   If a baby is not feeding well or has diarrhea or vomiting.\n\n【34】*   If a cry sounds different, like they are in pain.\n\n【35】*   If the baby’s body temperature increases.\n\n【36】*   If a baby can be soothed and constantly fussy.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:**\n\n【38】If a baby is constantly crying or fussy, it can also affect the parents' health. So, it is very important to know the cause of the fuss before trying to manage it. Every technique and option is different, and so is every baby. Parents should only follow the options suitable and comforting to their baby.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   What to Do When Babies Cry  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/babies-cry.html\n*   How to Calm a Fussy Baby: Tips for Parents & Caregivers  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Calming-A-Fussy-Baby.aspx\n*   Fussy or irritable child  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003214.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains directions for cell functioning and the characteristics that make the individual unique.\n\n【2】Individuals receive half of the genes from each biological parent and may inherit a gene from one mutated parent or both parents. Sometimes these changes do occur due to DNA mutations. Some genetic mutations occur at birth, while some develop over time.\n\n【3】Mutations can be of three types:\n\n【4】1.  **Chromosomal:** This mutation occurs on the structures holding the DNA. The individuals with these conditions have missing or duplicated chromosomal material.\n\n【5】2.  **Complex (Multifactorial):** These disorders occur due to a combination of gene mutations and other factors, which includes diet, certain medications, tobacco, chemical exposure, or alcohol use.\n\n【6】3.  **Single-gene (Monogenic):** Group of conditions that occur from a single gene mutation.\n\n【7】What Is Abidi Syndrome?\n-----------------------\n\n【8】Abidi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by observable physical abnormalities, including short stature, sloping forehead, small head circumference, and underdevelopment of the testes. This syndrome could be inherited through generations. The condition is more common in males than females. It affects males between 16 to 50 years of age. A particular presentation of genetic abnormality is X-linked mental retardation which is five to ten percent of all cases of intellectual disability.\n\n【9】What Causes Abidi Syndrome?\n---------------------------\n\n【10】Abidi syndrome is X-linked mental retardation caused by primary mutations in the Xq24-q25 genetic region; the exact cause of these genetic mutations and abnormality is unknown. Other possible causes are linked to the progression and development of Abidi X-linked mental retardation. Other possible causes related to the condition are conductive hearing loss, disorders in the external auditory canal, otitis externa (inflammation of the external ear), atresia of the external auditory canal (congenital malformation of the external auditory canal), hemotympanum (blood in middle ear cavity), middle ear disorders, and perilymph fistula (abnormal communication due to leak in perilymph fluid), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (hypoxia-related brain damage), cochlear malformations (congenital anomalies of the ear).\n\n【11】What Are the Clinical Features of the Abidi Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The physical features associated with Abidi syndrome X-linked mental retardation do not appear at birth. They progress during the prepubertal period. During this time, it is evidently noticed that the stature, head circumference, and forehead cease to develop also with testicular developments. Prior to the features of Abidi syndrome, other cognitive features appear with memory, problem-solving, comprehension, and attention.\n\n【13】The other primary clinical features associated with Abidi X- linked mental retardation:\n\n【14】*   Short stature.\n\n【15】*   Sloping head circumference.\n\n【16】*   Sloping forehead.\n\n【17】*   Testicular abnormalities.\n\n【18】*   Cupped ears (deformity where the top rim of the ear is either folded over tight or wrinkled).\n\n【19】*   Hearing loss.\n\n【20】*   Muscle wasting of the lower legs.\n\n【21】*   Kyphosis (increased back and front curve of the spine is kyphosis)\n\n【22】*   Joint hyperextensibility (a condition in which individuals joint have an extremely large unusual range of movement).\n\n【23】*   Decreased attention span.\n\n【24】*   Cognitive impairment, along with IQ falling between 12 to 62.\n\n【25】*   Growth and development factors generally collaborated with Abidi X-linked mental retardation.\n\n【26】**How Does Abidi Syndrome Affect Gastrointestinal Tract?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】In all the cohorts of patients with X-Linked disorder, it has been recorded that up to 35 percent had concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations, and around ten percent had a diagnosis of irritable bowel disease or enteritis. Most commonly, the mutations were missense, associated with a less severe XLA phenotype. The severity of the symptoms was wide-ranging, and management strategies were diverse and experimental.\n\n【28】**What Is the Recurrence Risk of Abidi Syndrome?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Molecular genetic diagnosis and accurate genetic advice have to be provided to the individual, but still, rarely the cases arise when the family presents in a clinic and recurrences risk. Recurrence risks for isolated mental retardation were 8.4 percent if the firstborn child is isolated mental retardation as compared with hearing loss of 4.7 to 5.7 percent. Vision impairment of 5.3 to 6.9 percent, cerebral palsy of 2.9 to 3.6 percent. If the firstborn child has mental retardation, the recurrence risk for mild and severe mental retardation can range from 7.1 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.\n\n【30】How Is the Diagnosis Made for Abidi Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Clinical features themselves reveal the unique characteristics of the syndrome along with the visual clinical features. Some tests are done to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n【32】*   **Overall Mental Health:** Overall mental health tests include analysis of physiological, emotional, and social well-being. Depends on the choices, how one feels and how one handles stress.\n\n【33】*   **Home Testing:** Also known as direct- to consumer genetic testing. Customers directly send DNA samples directly to the company and often receive results online.\n\n【34】*   **Home Emotional Stress Tests:** It is a psychological test.\n\n【35】*   **Routine Blood Test:** A routine blood test is done for analysis of abnormal values.\n\n【36】*   **Gene Mapping:** Process of determining the location of genes on chromosomes. Sequencing a genome and using a computer program to analyze the sequence to identify the location of genes.\n\n【37】*   **CT-Scan (Computed Tomography):** A combination of X-rays and computer technology is used in this diagnostic procedure to produce images of the body tissues.\n\n【38】*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Highly detailed images are produced using a strong magnetic field and high-frequency radio waves. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually very safe as X-rays are not used.\n\n【39】*   **Radiographic X-ray:** Quick, painless procedure that produces images of the structures of the body- especially bones.\n\n【40】What Is the Treatment for Abidi X-Linked Mental Retardation Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Abidi X-linked mental retardation has no direct treatment. With advanced modern medical technologies, the prevention of the disorder is possible. Efforts for alleviating X-linked diseases have been found. A possible method for prevention is gamete donation, and this would retard the progression of the disorder. Along with it, enough parenteral diagnosis and genetic counseling should be made.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Abidi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by numerous physical abnormalities. Patients with X-linked disease may require very close monitoring with particular attention to gastrointestinal manifestations, including irritable bowel disease and infectious enteritis.

Sigmoidoscopy uses a thin, flexible tube which is inserted into the rectum during flexible sigmoidoscopy. This is attached with a video camera which allows viewing of the rectum, sigmoid colon, and most of the descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure, in which a flexible endoscope is used. A rigid endoscope is used in rigid sigmoidoscopy.\n\n【2】Why Is Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Done?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】**Investigation:** Flexible sigmoidoscopy's done to investigate the causes of intestinal signs and symptoms, including abdominal pain, bleeding in the rectum, change in bowel habits, and other intestinal problems.\n\n【4】**Screening:** Flexible sigmoidoscopy is one option for screening colon cancer. Suppose the patient is at average risk for colon cancer, which means the patient's age is 50 or older and has no other risk factors other than age. In that case, the doctor suggests a flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure every five years to screen for colon cancer.\n\n【5】Sigmoidoscopy may be preferred over colonoscopy because the preparation and the procedure take less time than colonoscopy, and anesthesia is not required. There is a lower risk of colon or rectal wall perforation with sigmoidoscopy than with colonoscopy.\n\n【6】What Are the Risks of Flexible Sigmoidoscopy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【7】A flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure possesses some risks.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>Lower abdominal pain and spotting with a positive pregnancy test.

Only clear liquids are advised - plain water, tea, and coffee without milk or cream and carbonated beverages. Avoid red-colored liquids as they may confuse with blood during the procedure. The patient is advised not to eat or drink anything after midnight.\n\n【21】*   **Laxative**: The doctor recommends a laxative either in pill or liquid form. A laxative is taken the night before the procedure.\n\n【22】*   **Enema:** Over-the-counter enema kit is given a few hours before the procedure to empty the colon. The doctor advises taking two enemas.\n\n【23】*   **Medications:** Inform the doctor about the medicines you are taking a week before the procedure, such as medications for diabetes, iron supplements, allergy to medicines, and blood thinners like Aspirin, Warfarin, and Clopidogrel. Inform the medical conditions such as pregnancy, heart problems, and lung issues.\n\n【24】What Happens During Flexible Sigmoidoscopy?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【25】During the procedure, the patient wears a gown and is asked to lie on the left side of the table with knees bent towards the abdomen. The doctor then inserts a thin, flexible sigmoidoscope into the rectum.\n\n【26】The sigmoidoscope contains light and a tube. The doctor inflates air into the tube, which expands the colon, allowing a better view of the colon. When the scope is moved in the intestine, the patient may have abdominal cramping or an urge to have. Mild cramping during the procedure is relieved by taking several slow deaths.\n\n【27】The sigmoidoscope contains a tiny camera in the end which helps to view the inside of the colon. The doctor can insert instruments into the tube through which tissue samples are taken. The sigmoidoscope is slowly removed from the colon after the procedure. The procedure typically takes about 15 minutes. Anesthesia and pain medications are not necessary. The doctor recommends a colonoscopy to view the entire colon length if a polyp is found.\n\n【28】What Happens After the Procedure?\n---------------------------------\n\n【29】After the procedure, the patient feels mild abdominal cramping. Walking after the procedure may relieve discomfort. A small amount of blood is seen in bowel movements after the procedure, which is normal. The patient can drink and eat normally.\n\n【30】What Is the Result of Flexible Sigmoidoscopy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The doctor reviews the results of the procedure and discusses the results with the patient.\n\n【32】The result can be positive or negative.\n\n【33】**Negative Result:** The result of a flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure is negative if the doctor does not find any abnormalities in the colon. Suppose the patient is at average risk for colon cancer, which means the patient's age is 50 or older, and there are no risk factors other than age. In that case, the doctor suggests a flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure after five years.\n\n【34】**Positive Result:** The result of a flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure is positive if the doctor finds any polyps or abnormalities in the colon. Based on the findings, a colonoscopy is recommended to examine the abnormalities thoroughly and to view the entire length of the colon.\n\n【35】What Is the Difference Between Sigmoidoscopy and Colonoscopy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】A colonoscopy is another test used to view changes or abnormalities in the colon. Colonoscopy is a procedure performed to detect the presence of colorectal cancers. A colonoscopy uses a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera at the end, to view the entire colon. It is the longest of all scopes reaching the whole colon length, whereas the flexible sigmoidoscope can view the lower part of the colon.\n\n【37】How Is It Different From Rigid Sigmoidoscopy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Rigid sigmoidoscopy, also known as proctoscopy, is used to detect rectum and anus abnormalities. Proctoscope are made up of a rigid tube, whereas a flexible sigmoidoscope comprises a thin, flexible tube.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe and effective procedure to view the problems of the rectum and lower part of the colon. The procedure is simple and tolerable.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Flexible Sigmoidoscopy  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diagnostic-tests/flexible-sigmoidoscopy\n*   ASGE - Understanding Flexible Sigmoidoscopy  \n    https://www.asge.org/home/for-patients/patient-information/understanding-flexible-sigmoidoscopy</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8e290494-03bb-44b2-9c06-66c1510286f2", "title": "Anxiety Chest Pain", "text": "【0】Introduction:\n-------------\n\n【1】Anxiety is becoming extremely prevalent in today's time. More and more people are getting affected by anxiety as a result of deteriorating mental health, stressful lifestyle and work culture, and unhealthy food habits. It is estimated that almost 275 million people are affected by anxiety disorders globally. This is equal to around 2 % of the total world population. Moreover, about 62 % of these 275 million affected people are women. Therefore, it is safe to say that women are more affected by anxiety disorders as compared to men. This is probably the world’s biggest mental health issue. In addition, chest pain occurring due to anxiety is the most common and complicated symptom of anxiety, which is often confused with a heart attack. However, anxiety and chest pain are potentially less harmful.\n\n【2】What Is Anxiety?\n----------------\n\n【3】Anxiety can be defined as an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and a feeling of dread over anticipated events. Anxiety can also be the body’s natural reaction to a threat (immediate or future). Feeling anxious once in a while for certain things can be considered a normal reaction of concern and worry; however, if this feeling of concern and worry is experienced frequently along with some alarming signs and symptoms, then this condition is called anxiety. Anxiety can be triggered by common situations like being stuck in traffic, taking a test or interview, speaking in public, etc. Anxiety is often accompanied by nervousness, somatization of anxiety, and rumination (focused attention on symptoms of one’s distress).\n\n【4】There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety, social anxiety, separation anxiety, panic disorder, and phobia-related disorders (anxiety due to fear of something specific like height, flying, etc). Certain risk factors may increase the chances of someone developing anxiety; these include; shyness or feeling distressed in new situations during childhood, having someone in the family suffering from anxiety, exposure to stressful life, certain drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and certain physical health conditions like arrhythmia and thyroid problems.\n\n【5】Often there are several other mental disorders associated with anxiety that can exist as comorbidity (presence of two or more medical conditions in one patient), these include; depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and personality disorder. Reports have suggested that almost 19.1 % of adults in the United States have anxiety and approximately 31 % of all adults experience anxiety at some point in time. The condition is more prevalent in females.\n\n【6】Can Anxiety Cause Chest Pain?\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】Yes, people suffering from anxiety have reported pain in their chest during an anxiety attack. In fact, one of the most common symptoms and complications of anxiety is chest pain. This chest pain is frequently described as a sharp and stabbing sensation that starts unexpectedly and suddenly when the person is feeling anxious.\n\n【8】What Does Anxiety Chest Pain Feel Like?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Anxiety\\-induced chest pain can be different from person to person, and this makes it difficult to understand the condition better. Some people experience anxiety-induced chest pain gradually, while others may experience it suddenly. Anyhow, the common symptoms of chest pain during an anxiety attack are:\n\n【10】*   Chest pain may feel like a sharp, shooting, or stabbing pain.\n\n【11】*   Persistent aching.\n\n【12】*   The pain can be dull.\n\n【13】*   Tightness of the chest.\n\n【14】*   Tension and stress in the chest.\n\n【15】*   Unusual muscle twitch or spasm in the chest.\n\n【16】*   Numbness in certain areas of the chest.\n\n【17】*   Burning sensation in the chest.\n\n【18】Apart from these exclusive symptoms related to chest pain, the patient may experience the general symptoms of anxiety, which include:\n\n【19】*   Dizziness.\n\n【20】*   Fainting.\n\n【21】*   Nausea.\n\n【22】*   Feeling short of breath.\n\n【23】*   Trembling and shaking.\n\n【24】*   Unusual changes in body temperature like chills and hot flashes.\n\n【25】*   Sweating in hands and feet.\n\n【26】*   Heart palpitations.\n\n【27】*   Feeling helpless.\n\n【28】Why Does Anxiety Cause Chest Pain?\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】Anxiety is the body’s natural response to anticipated stress; when our body is under stress, it enters the typical “fight or flight” state, which helps the body fight against or flees from potentially harmful situations. The person can become aggressive or upset, depending upon the situation, and the body may tighten up or become tense. The body reacts in several ways during this fight or flight response. These include increased blood pressure, tachycardia (increased heart rate), tachypnea (increased breathing rate), and secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline hormones. The adrenaline and noradrenaline hormones trigger a sudden rise in heart rate and blood pressure, which, in turn, causes profuse sweating, difficulty in breathing, and pain in the chest. The sudden elevation in the adrenaline levels causes the arteries in the heart to narrow; this condition is referred to as stress cardiomyopathy (this condition is very similar to the symptoms of heart attack).\n\n【30】Apart from this, anxiety chest pain can also occur as a result of the following:\n\n【31】*   **Increased Heart Rate:** This causes palpitation and pounding of the heart and coronary artery spasm.\n\n【32】*   **Hyperventilation:** Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath can increase the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.\n\n【33】*   **Muscle Tension**: Tightness in the muscles of the chest can also manifest as main in the chest.\n\n【34】*   **Combined:** Sometimes more than one of these physiological changes can act together to cause anxiety-induced chest pain.\n\n【35】How Long Does Anxiety Chest Pain Last?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【36】Anxiety chest pain can last for up to ten minutes; however, other symptoms related to anxiety, like nausea, dizziness, and sweating, may last for a few hours.\n\n【37】How to Stop Anxiety Chest Pain?\n-------------------------------\n\n【38】Anxiety chest pain can be stopped only by tackling the anxiety. Certain practices and techniques may be helpful in coping with anxiety; these include:\n\n【39】*   **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Practicing deep breathing from the diaphragm can control anxiety by slowing down the heart rate and breathing rate.\n\n【40】*   **Relaxation Exercises**: Several relaxation exercises like meditation, writing a journal, visualizing, etc. can be very helpful in reducing anxiety by calming the brain.\n\n【41】*   **Exercise**: Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help reduce general anxiety. Exercising regularly reduces muscle tension, increases heart rate variability, and increases the secretion of serotonin and other anxiety-reducing neurochemicals.\n\n【42】*   **Getting Enough Sleep**: Maintaining a healthy sleep cycle and getting enough sleep can help reduce anxiety by calming the brain down. The brain requires a certain amount of undisturbed sleep to function properly; this also ensures keeping a check on anxiety, depression, and other forms of mental disorders.\n\n【43】*   **Limiting Alcohol, Smoking, Caffeine, Etc.**: Excessive alcohol, smoking, and caffeine intake can trigger anxiety.\n\n【44】*   **Using Smartphone Applications**: Using a relaxation application developed especially for tackling anxiety can also be helpful in many situations. These applications often teach stress reduction techniques and exercises.\n\n【45】What Is the Difference Between Anxiety Chest Pain and Heart Attack?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Anxiety-induced chest pain can be easily confused with a heart attack and vice versa because of similar symptoms. Both the conditions have similar symptoms like chest pain, sweating, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, increased blood pressure, etc. Therefore, in case of chest pain, one must immediately contact a doctor or call the emergency helpline because the reason could be a severe cardiac issue, and prompt treatment can save someone’s life.\n\n【47】Can Anxiety Chest Pain Cause Heart Attack?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【48】No, an anxiety-induced chest pain or anxiety attack cannot cause a heart attack because a heart attack occurs due to the presence of coronary heart disease (like a blockage in the coronary artery). However, stress and anxiety can play a role in developing coronary artery disease. In addition, certain researchers suggest that people with anxiety disorders have increased chances of developing heart diseases due to low heart rate variability (physiologic variation in the time interval between two heartbeats). A high heart rate variability indicates that a person’s heart rate shifts efficiently throughout the day while doing different physical activities. At the same time, a low heart rate variability indicates the inability of the heart to switch heart rate according to different physical activities.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Although anxiety chest pain is not a life-threatening condition, it can cause some serious discomfort to the patient. Anxiety should be taken and treated seriously because it can adversely affect a person’s quality of life and mental health. If the anxiety attacks are frequent, then seeing a therapist or seeking cognitive behavioral therapy is highly recommended. The therapist or doctor will be able to teach coping techniques and mechanisms to tackle the condition.\n\n【51】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【52】* * *\n\n【53】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Anxiety Chest Pain Like?**\n\n【54】The chest pain during anxiety is sharp, stabbing pain that starts suddenly; it does not have any trigger like exercise but can be initiated when the person is anxious or has stress.

{"seq_id": "2a9583e2-5fca-48e2-a5e5-e2e4ef2ec122", "title": "Hyperoxaluria - Types, Symptoms, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Hyperoxaluria - Types, Symptoms, and Treatment\nWhat Is Hyperoxaluria?\n----------------------\n\n【1】Hyperoxaluria is a rare condition characterized by excess oxalate production, excreted as a urine waste product. This leads to abnormally high levels of oxalate in the urine. During the time of its excretion, oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate. It is the main constituent of calcium oxalate stones in the bladder and the kidney. Deposits of calcium oxalate are harmful to the kidney and other organs. They can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease, injury to other organs, and kidney damage. In addition, kidney function impairment occurs due to calcium oxalate substances in the kidneys. As a result, oxalate levels rise in the blood and get deposited in various tissues throughout the body, causing systemic oxalosis. The deposition generally occurs in the bones and walls of blood vessels. Oxalosis of bones can cause fractures.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Hyperoxaluria?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are two types of hyperoxaluria - primary and secondary.\n\n【4】**1\\. Primary Hyperoxaluria -** It is a rare condition characterized by overproduction of oxalate as the enzyme production by the liver is low or the enzymes do not work properly. It is also associated with recurrent renal infections and bladder stones. The condition results in end-stage kidney disease, renal failure, and kidney impairment. It is a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidney from performing normal functions like filtering fluids and waste products in the body. Three types of primary hyperoxaluria differ in genetic cause and severity. The three types include:\n\n【5】*   **Type 1 -** The appearance of kidney stones occurs anytime from childhood to early adulthood, and end-stage renal disease can develop at any age of life.\n*   **Type 2 -** Primary hyperoxaluria with the appearance of kidney stones that occur anytime from childhood to adulthood, but the end-stage renal disease can develop at later stages in life.\n*   **Type 3 -** The appearance of kidney stones occurs in early childhood. A few cases of this type have been known to describe additional symptoms.\n\n【6】**2\\. Secondary Hyperoxaluria -** A condition with excess oxalate absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and then excretion in the urine is secondary hyperoxaluria. The reason behind increased absorption can be due to consuming foods containing high levels of oxalate or suffering from medical conditions that can cause the gastrointestinal tract to absorb more oxalate. The medical conditions include inflammatory bowel disease, gastric bypass, and Crohn's disease.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Hyperoxaluria?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【8】*   **Kidney Stones -** Symptoms generally develop from infancy to later adulthood. The initial symptom of hyperoxaluria is kidney stones.\n\n【9】*   **Hematuria -** It is the presence of blood in urine and generally occurs with hyperoxaluria.\n\n【10】*   **Kidney Failure -** In some patients, the initial symptoms are mild to moderate and do not cause much discomfort. The diagnosis is made after kidney failure, which can then be considered the first symptom.\n\n【11】*   **Flank Pain -** Pain in the lower back or side of the body, which is dull and can be moderate to severe.\n\n【12】*   **Problems With Urination -** Pain while urinating or a condition where the patient cannot urinate is related to hyperoxaluria. Urine with a bad odor and a cloudy appearance can be seen.\n\n【13】Other symptoms, like nausea and vomiting with pain, fevers, and chills, can be present.\n\n【14】How Is Hyperoxaluria Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【15】Diagnosis starts with a physical examination, medical history, diet history, and routine lab tests. These tests include:\n\n【16】**1\\. Urine Tests -** Urine analysis measures the level of oxalate and other specific enzymes. It is checked for the presence of crystals. It also determines the presence of blood in the urine.\n\n【17】**2\\. Blood Tests -** Blood analysis measures the amount of oxalate in blood.\n\n【18】**3\\. Imaging Tests -** X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract are done to rule out the presence of kidney stones or calcium oxalate stones. If kidney stones or calcium oxalate stones are found, they are removed surgically or passed without surgery.\n\n【19】**4\\. Other Tests -** Tests to determine the presence of oxalate deposits in other organs and tissues include:\n\n【20】*   Kidney and bone marrow biopsy to check for oxalate deposits in the bones.\n\n【21】*   An echocardiogram is done to look for oxalate deposits in the heart's tissues.\n\n【22】*   Eye tests to rule out oxalate deposits in the retina and eye.\n\n【23】*   A computed tomography scan is done to detect the presence of calcium or oxalate in the bowel wall, arteries, and muscle.\n\n【24】*   In the case of primary hyperoxaluria, genetic screening must be done to determine the presence of any genetic mutations.\n\n【25】How to Treat Hyperoxaluria?\n---------------------------\n\n【26】The treatment modality depends on absolute lowering mechanisms. The treatment plan includes the following:\n\n【27】*   **Medications -** In the case of primary hyperoxaluria, drugs include vitamin B-6 to reduce oxalate levels. Thiazide diuretics are also used for a specific subtype of primary hyperoxaluria. Further treatment with either primary or secondary hyperoxaluria includes oral doses of potassium citrate. Also, the combination of orthophosphate and magnesium can be taken to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate crystals.\n\n【28】*   **Dietary Changes -** Increase in daily water intake, about 2.5 to 3 liters per day, will help the kidneys flush out oxalate and prevent buildup in the body. Limiting salt intake, decreasing sugar intake, limiting the animal protein intake, and limiting foods high in oxalate levels such as plums, beets, chocolate, strawberries, tofu, almonds, french fries, nuts, potato chips, and spinach can impair the health of the kidney.\n\n【29】*   **To Treat Kidney Stone -** If calcium oxalate stones are present in the kidney or urinary bladder, then an excessive amount of water can be recommended to pass it on its own. If that does not happen, procedures like shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be performed.\n\n【30】*   **To Treat Kidney Failure -** In severe cases of hyperoxaluria, kidneys can stop working. In such cases, dialysis or kidney transplantation can be needed.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Hyperoxaluria is a rare condition associated with an increased level of oxalate in the body. It can be either due to the overproduction of the substance, more absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, or less excretion by the kidneys. The symptoms can be associated with kidney stone formation, hematuria, or kidney failure. The treatment depends upon the factors that can decrease the oxalate in the blood. In case of severe symptoms and kidney failure, dialysis and kidney transplantation may be required.\n\n【33】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【34】* * *\n\n【35】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Hyperoxaluria a Kidney Disease?**\n\n【36】Hyperoxaluria is a rare disorder marked by overproduction of oxalate as the liver enzyme production is low or the enzymes do not function properly.

The condition that hampers the kidney functioning normally like filtering fluids and waste products from the body.\n\n【37】#### **2.**删除换行**What Foods Have High Oxalates?**\n\n【38】Foodstuffs that contain a high amount of oxalate include spinach, rice bran, buckwheat, rhubarb, almonds, and miso. Also, other foods containing oxalate include plums, beets, chocolate, strawberries, tofu, almonds, french fries, nuts, and potato chips. Animal protein also contains oxalate.\n\n【39】#### **3.**删除换行**What Foods Should Be Avoided With Oxalates?**\n\n【40】Dietary changes should be made to prevent oxaluria. The water intake should be increased to about 2.5 to 3 liters daily. This will help the kidneys to remove oxalate from the body and prevent its buildup in the body. Decreasing sugar intake, limiting salt intake, limiting animal protein intake, and limiting foods high in oxalate levels such as chocolate, strawberries, plums, beets, tofu, almonds, potato chips, french fries, spinach, and nuts can deteriorate kidney health.\n\n【41】#### **4.**删除换行**How Does Vitamin C Cause Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【42】Vitamin C is a precursor of oxalate and produces hyperoxaluria. It also increases oxalate absorption and increases hyperoxaluria. In malabsorption, calcium chelates with fatty acids, causing enteric hyperoxaluria.\n\n【43】#### **5.**删除换行**How Do I Know if I Have Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【44】Hyperoxaluria can be diagnosed by urine tests, blood tests, imaging tests, and kidney and bone marrow biopsies. The urine and blood tests measure the amount of oxalate in the urine and the blood, respectively. X-rays, computed tomography scans, and ultrasounds of the urinary tract and the kidneys are to check for the presence of kidney stones or calcium oxalate stones.\n\n【45】#### **6.**删除换行**Which Enzyme Is Deficient in Primary Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【46】Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 results due to the deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT). The AGT enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. In the absence of AGT, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate, which forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in the kidney and other organs. As a result, patients with PH1 are at risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, or end-stage renal disease.\n\n【47】#### **7.**删除换行**How Common Is Primary Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【48】Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare genetic disorder that is present by birth. In primary hyperoxaluria, the liver doesn't produce an adequate amount of enzyme that prevents the overproduction of oxalate, or the enzyme doesn't work properly. As a result, excess oxalate is removed from the body through the kidneys in urine.\n\n【49】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 a Rare Disease?**\n\n【50】Yes, primary hyperoxaluria is a rare disease with overproduction of oxalate as the enzyme production by the liver to reduce oxalate is low, or the enzymes do not work efficiently. There are three types of primary hyperoxaluria based on genetic cause and severity.  Type 1 hyperoxaluria and end-stage renal disease can develop at any age.\n\n【51】#### **9.**删除换行**How Do You Stop Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【52】Hyperoxaluria can be stopped by early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Diagnosing hyperoxaluria involves urine tests, blood tests, and imaging tests such as CT scan, kidney and bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, and genetic screening. The treatment to stop oxaluria includes medications, dietary changes, treatment of kidney stones, and treatment of kidney failure.\n\n【53】#### **10.**删除换行**Is There a Cure for Primary Hyperoxaluria?**\n\n【54】   \nThere is no treatment for primary hyperoxaluria. The treatment modality is to protect the kidneys from developing kidney stones and calcium oxalate from forming. The treatment also includes the prevention and deposition of oxalate in body tissues.\n\n【55】#### **11.**删除换行**How Is Primary Hyperoxaluria Treated?**\n\n【56】The treatment modality depends on oxalate-lowering mechanisms. The treatment plan includes the following:  \n\\- Medications - In the case of primary hyperoxaluria, drugs like thiazide diuretics to treat a specific subtype of primary hyperoxaluria and vitamin B-6 to reduce oxalate levels are used.   \n\\- Dietary Changes - Daily water intake should be increased to 2.5 to 3 liters daily. This helps the kidneys to flush out oxalate from the body and prevent its accumulation in the body. Kidney health should be maintained by decreasing sugar intake and limiting salt intake.  \nFurther treatment includes treating kidney stones and kidney failure if present.\n\n【57】#### **12.**删除换行**Is Oxalate in Urine Normal?**\n\n【58】The normal level of oxalate excretion in urine is < 50 milligrams daily. A level higher than the normal urine oxalate levels indicates the risk of developing kidney stones. Stone formation generally occurs at levels higher than 25 milligrams per day, which is normal.\n\n【59】#### **13.**删除换行**How High Oxalate in Urine is Treated?**\n\n【60】Certain medications and dietary changes can treat high oxalate in urine. Drink 1.5 to 3 liters of water per day. Avoid eating food containing high amounts of oxalates. These foodstuffs include spinach, beet, potato chips, animal protein, and strawberries. Limit intake of salt.\n\n【61】#### **14.**删除换行**Should a Person Worry About Oxalate?**\n\n【62】Urine oxalate levels that are normal do not necessarily mean a risk. However, higher oxalate levels indicate the risk of developing kidney stones, end-stage renal disease, and hyperoxaluria. Therefore, a slight change in oxalate levels should be observed for any changes in the future.\n\n【63】#### **15.**删除换行**How Is Oxalate From Kidneys Removed?**\n\n【64】Drinking enough water helps the kidneys flush and decreases the oxalate from the body. Oxalate in the form of calcium oxalate stones is removed by various procedures such as shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.\n\n【65】#### **16.**删除换行**How To Reduce Oxalate Quickly?**\n\n【66】Oxalate levels can be decreased by increasing the calcium-containing foodstuffs. High oxalate-containing foodstuffs should be replaced by yogurt, milk, and cheese. Certain vegetables can also provide a good amount of calcium.\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>*   Primary hyperoxaluria  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/primary-hyperoxaluria/\n*   Primary and Secondary Hyperoxaluria  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419133/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is clinically related and considered a subtype of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE). HPP leads to a functional alteration in spectrin. Spectrin is the main cytoskeletal protein of the RBC cell membrane. This condition presents itself as severe hemolytic anemia with thermal instability of the red blood cells. Patients with this condition require blood transfusion rich in packed red blood cells. Patients with chronic hemolytic disease may require Folate supplementation.\n\n【2】Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is one of the rare causes of severe hemolytic anemia. It is commonly observed in African people, but studies have shown its incidence in European and Arab people also. No gender predominance has been reported. It is usually diagnosed during infancy or early childhood when the affected individual experiences severe hemolytic anemia. They can present with classic HE later in life.\n\n【3】How Is It Caused?\n-----------------\n\n【4】As mentioned earlier, Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is a subtype of hereditary elliptocytosis. This red blood cell membrane disorder is caused by mutations in the genes that encode α-spectrin (SPTA1), β-spectrin (SPTB), or protein 4.1R (EPB41). Another cause for the major category of this condition (HE) is monoallelic, that is, heterozygous mutations and autosomal dominant inheritance. However, HPP has an autosomal recessive type of inheritance commonly caused by biallelic, homozygous, or compound heterozygous type mutations.\n\n【5】What Are The Signs And Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】This condition is manifested most commonly during infancy when the child presents with transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia. When the family history is assessed, nonhemolytic hereditary elliptocytosis in a parent or sibling can be recorded. There are chances that the other parent can have an earlier undiagnosed spectrin deficiency.\n\n【7】When a physical examination is done, the physician may notice signs of anemia. Studies have reported prolonged neonatal jaundice. Various other signs can be observed, such as extramedullary hematopoiesis, like frontal bossing (forehead prominence) and splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen). Children affected with this condition may also show growth retardation. Gallbladder disease can complicate chronic hemolytic disease in these patients.\n\n【8】In newborns and infants with neonatal poikilocytosis, severe hemolytic anemia is typically cured after the first year of life. If there is severe hemolytic anemia and jaundice, transfusions and phototherapy can be provided. This resolution of symptoms after a year helps the physician differentiate between neonatal poikilocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. Other conditions that mimic HPP are hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary spherocytosis, neonatal poikilocytosis, and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.\n\n【9】How Can It Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------\n\n【10】The physician will ask questions regarding the signs and symptoms, family history, and medical history. Then, a physical examination is done to examine for signs. A peripheral blood smear can be done to diagnose HPP. This smear helps in identifying abnormal red blood cell structures. The blood smear also shows elliptocytes, microcytic red cells (small-sized RBCs), polychromasia, differently shaped cells with fragmentation, poikilocytes, pyknocytes, and microspherocytes.\n\n【11】The International Council for Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) has mentioned certain guidelines to help diagnose non-immune hereditary red cell membrane disorders, including hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). The guidelines mention that regular reviewing of the patient's family history and medical history, blood count assessment, reticulocyte count, and red cell structure can help in the diagnosis.\n\n【12】**Ektacytometry**\n\n【13】Osmotic gradient ektacytometry has been used as the reference technique for diagnosing RBC membrane disorders. Various other tests include the evaluation of the ratio of spectrin to band 3. This helps identify the spectrin level, which helps differentiate homozygous hemolytic elliptocytosis.\n\n【14】The imaging studies that can be used are ultrasound of the biliary tract. It may reveal gallstones, mainly in those patients who have been diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis. A nuclear scan can be used to check the presence of any disease in the gallbladder disease if ultrasonography is non-diagnostic.\n\n【15】How Can It Be Treated?\n----------------------\n\n【16】Transfusion of blood rich in packed red blood cells is necessary for patients with severe hemolytic anemia with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. Patients with chronic hemolytic disease may require Folate supplementation also. Also, supportive measures like oxygen, intravenous fluids, and blood count monitoring can be provided in patients with acute symptoms. Patients can be given medical care or surgical care as the following depending on individual needs:\n\n【17】**Medical Care**\n\n【18】No exact medications are used in treating patients with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. The medications are provided for symptomatic relief or to manage complications based on individual needs. Folic acid is commonly utilized to prevent folic acid deficiency. Folic acid deficiency can occur as a result of increased erythropoiesis. Patients who have developed extreme iron overload from transfusion of red blood cells may require iron chelation therapy.\n\n【19】**Surgical Care**\n\n【20】The primary site for the sequestration of red cells is the spleen. It also plays a role in developing severe anemia in patients with HPP. Patients with severe hemolytic anemia refractory to or complicated due to chronic blood transfusion may need splenectomy. Studies have shown that splenectomy helps improve the severity of anemia and gallstones.\n\n【21】How Is The Prognosis?\n---------------------\n\n【22】The prognosis is based on the number of transfusions required to maintain an adequate hemoglobin count in a growing child. Also, the ability to prevent any serious complications after splenectomy Most of the complications are associated with severe anemia with multiple resultant transfusions and the occurrence of iron toxicity in most of the main organs in the body.\n\n【23】Complications that are mostly associated with chronic hemolysis are the following:\n\n【24】*   Gallstones.\n\n【25】*   Aplastic crisis.\n\n【26】*   Hemolytic crisis.\n\n【27】Patients who have undergone splenectomy are more prone to develop infections caused due to encapsulated organisms. However, these infections rarely occur in those patients who have been immunized against Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and meningococcus.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is a disorder of red blood cells that causes anemia-related complications.

It can be associated with several geriatric syndromes, including frailty, sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength), functional decline, failure to thrive, frequent falls, incontinence, and inability to ambulate. Weakness may develop suddenly or gradually and can affect all the muscles of the body or only one part of the body. Symptoms depend on which muscles are affected. Abnormalities in sensation, like tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, and sometimes numbness, often accompany weakness. As people age, muscle tissue and muscle strength also decrease. These changes often occur partly because older people become less active with time and also because the hormone production that stimulates muscle development also decreases.\n\n【2】What Are the Features of Old Age Associated With Body Weakness?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The following symptoms are associated with body weakness in old age-\n\n【4】*   Decrease in muscle mass.\n\n【5】*   Increase in muscle fat.\n\n【6】*   Decreased appetite.\n\n【7】*   Poor nutrition.\n\n【8】*   Low physical activity.\n\n【9】*   Incontinence.\n\n【10】*   Recurrent falls.\n\n【11】*   Low cholesterol levels.\n\n【12】*   Slow gait speed.\n\n【13】*   Poor endurance.\n\n【14】*   Increased risk of infection.\n\n【15】*   Weak grip strength.\n\n【16】*   Change in cognition.\n\n【17】*   Weight loss.\n\n【18】*   Comorbidities.\n\n【19】What Are the Causes of Body Weakness in Old Age?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The cause of body weakness in old age are described below-\n\n【21】1.  **Failure to Thrive -** Adult failure to thrive is defined as weight loss greater than five percent of baseline, decreased appetite, poor nutrition, and low cholesterol levels. It is often associated with increased infection rates, diminished cell-mediated immunity, hip fractures, decubitus ulcers, and increased surgical mortality rate. Failure to thrive is found in thirty-five percent of community-dwelling older adults, twenty to forty percent of nursing home residents, and fifty to sixty percent of hospitalized veterans. In patients with failure to thrive, malnutrition, impaired function, cognitive impairment, and depression are all predictive of adverse events. Many of these features are also associated with frailty and functional decline.\n\n【22】2.  **Sarcopenia -** Sarcopenia is defined as an age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function caused by inflammation, chronic diseases, disuse, altered endocrine function, insulin resistance, and nutritional deficiencies. The initial symptoms of sarcopenia are often associated with a decline in strength, function, and health status with self-reported mobility-related difficulty, history of recurrent falls, unintentional weight loss of greater than five percent, post-hospitalization, and chronic medical conditions. The prevalence is approximately twelve percent for patients 60 to 70 years of age and thirty percent for those over 80 years.\n\n【23】3.  **Geriatric Syndrome -** Geriatric syndromes are terms used to capture clinical conditions in older persons that do not fit discrete disease categories. These include falls, delirium, frailty, dizziness, syncope, pressure ulcers, urinary incontinence, and functional decline. These syndromes are preventable, multifactorial, and associated with morbidity and poor outcomes. These syndromes have several shared risk factors, including baseline cognitive impairment, functional impairment, impaired mobility, and older age.\n\n【24】4.  **Falls** \\- Falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury and the 6th highest cause of death among the elderly. Falls occur in thirty percent of adults over 65 years and forty percent over 80 years and lead to functional decline, hospitalization, institutionalization, and increased health care costs. Falls are commonly associated with severe injury, and even those whose injuries allow them to return home are at high risk for functional decline.\n\n【25】5.  **Frailty -** Frailty is defined as the shrinking or unintentional weight loss with weak grip strength and poor endurance and energy as self-reported exhaustion. Risk factors for frailty include congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), silent strokes, and subclinical atherosclerotic disease.\n\n【26】How Body Weakness Is Evaluated by Testing?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【27】First, a thorough physical examination and history of current and past medical conditions will be performed by a doctor. If the weakness does not subside by maintaining lifestyle remedies, a doctor may perform certain tests to determine the cause of weakness, which include-\n\n【28】*   Pulmonary function tests can be performed to evaluate the strength of the respiratory muscles. The results of this test can help doctors estimate the risk of sudden and severe malfunction of the lungs.\n\n【29】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan to find any spinal cord, nerve, or brain disorder.\n\n【30】*   Blood tests to determine any vitamin deficiencies or blood-related disorders.\n\n【31】How to Prevent Body Weakness in Older People?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The first step in the management of body weakness of older patients is to identify the underlying cause and treat it.\n\n【33】*   A well-maintained diet should include proper nutrients, fibers, and essential fats that can help strengthen the body.\n\n【34】*   It is a common misconception that an older person should not perform exercises, but on the contrary, doing lightweight exercises can help maintain physical strength and enable the person to perform their daily activities efficiently. A regular walk, jogging, and even doing daily household chores can contribute to needed physical activity.\n\n【35】*   Older people are often associated with comorbidities and the main cause of body weakness. Hence treating them with medical assistance is necessary.\n\n【36】*   Vitamin supplements or other dietary supplements can be taken to help strengthen the body but only as prescribed by a doctor.\n\n【37】*   Proper bed rest is important, as well as maintaining the sleep cycle.\n\n【38】*   An older person can seek physical therapy to treat their body weakness.\n\n【39】*   One of the major causes of body weakness in older people is the medications that they take for their comorbidities. Older people take more medicines and are also susceptible to the side effects of those medicines. Hence, early prevention of diseases and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can prevent people from using several medications.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Compared with younger people, older people present with less muscle tissue and strength at the initiation of the illness and lose the muscle tissue more rapidly during the illness. Body weakness is a chief complaint among the older population and requires an extensive evaluation to treat the cause. When evaluating any older patient, one must always consider their functional status and goals of care and also focus on conditions that do not tend to cause weakness but can interfere with coordination, balance, vision, and mobility or that can make movement painful as older patients can mistakenly describe the effects of such conditions as a weakness. A proper diet and exercise are the key factors in managing body weakness in old age, which can be caused due to several factors.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Fatigue in Older Adults  \n    https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/fatigue-older-adults\n*   Ageing - muscles bones and joints  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/ageing-muscles-bones-and-joints\n*   Weakness and Fatigue  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Citrobacter species are the third most common organism causing urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients. It consists of eleven different species, and the most common ones affecting humans are C. koseri, C. feundii, C. amalonaticus, C. youngae, and C. braakii. The majority of infection is due to C. koseri and C. freundii. Because of mutational changes, they have high resistance to many antibiotics. These organisms first settle in the oral cavity, respiratory tract, or gastrointestinal tract and later spread to various sites and cause central nervous system (CNS) infection and bacteremia (blood-containing live bacteria). Outbreaks of this diseases are mostly due to gastrointestinal and healthcare workers hand carriage.\n\n【2】What Is Citrobacter Infection?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Citrobacter species are from the family of Enterobacteriaceae, which are facultatively anaerobic (organisms that can survive with or without oxygen), gram-negative bacilli, and motile by utilizing peritrichous flagella. They are commonly found in water, food, soil, and the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans. When these organisms increase in number in the body, they cause Citrobacter infections, including urinary tract infections, bacteremia, Intra-abdominal sepsis, joint infection, wound infection, bloodstream infections, brain abscesses, pneumonia, and other neonatal infections such as meningitis, and neonatal sepsis.\n\n【4】How Does Citrobacter Infection Spread?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】It spreads through direct contact with hospital members, mother-to-child, or environmental sources. Most of the patients who acquired Citrobacter infection were elderly hospitalized males who were subjected to urethral catheterization (a procedure to drain the urine), genitourinary instrumentation, or had obstructive uropathy (a condition where urine cannot drain from the urinary tract) due to loss of bactericidal activity of prostatic secretions, and prostate enlargement.\n\n【6】What Are the Clinical Manifestations of Citrobacter Infection?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The clinical manifestations of citrobacter infection are:\n\n【8】*   In neonates, it can cause brain sepsis and meningitis (inflammation of coverings of the brain); it can be severe and associated with necrotizing encephalitis. Fever, lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, irritability, bulging fontanelle, seizures, and jaundice are common presenting features.\n\n【9】*   Intra-abdominal infection through the urinary tract, hepatobiliary tract, or gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【10】*   Bacteremia (presence of viable bacteria in the bloodstream).\n\n【11】*   Urinary tract infection (infection of any part of the urinary system, which is kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra), which can cause a frequent need to urinate, dysuria (painful urination), pyuria (pus in urine), hematuria (blood in urine) and flank (side) pain in patients with urinary tract infection.\n\n【12】*   Surgical site infection.\n\n【13】*   Wound infection with purulent healing.\n\n【14】*   Respiratory infections like lung abscess bronchitis, and pneumonia (infection of the lungs that causes inflammation of lung tissues and have symptoms such as fever, cough, and sputum).\n\n【15】*   Asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in urine but no signs of infection) in pregnant women, neonates, and elderly diabetic patients.\n\n【16】What Are the Methods to Diagnose Citrobacter Infection?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The methods include the following:\n\n【18】*   Blood Cultures Evaluation: The white blood cell count may show leukocytosis or leukopenia.\n\n【19】*   CSF Fluid Evaluation: It usually shows elevated protein levels, polymorphonuclear cell elevation, and depressed glucose levels; gram-negative rods may be seen on the smear. It is done in most types of neonatal bacterial meningitis.\n\n【20】*   Urine culture in case of urinary tract infection.\n\n【21】*   Cytology, which involves examining cells infected by Citrobacter.\n\n【22】*   Gram staining to check the type of bacteria.\n\n【23】*   A computed tomography (CT) scan in case of brain abscess.\n\n【24】How Is Citrobacter Infection Treated?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【25】After obtaining specific strains from patients, therapeutic agents should be given based on in-vitro susceptibility results. Different species of Citrobacter have different antimicrobial susceptibility. For example, C. freundii is more resistant to antimicrobials than C. koseri, including Ampicillin and Carbenicillin, and newer agents, such as Piperacillin, Monobactam, and third-generation Cephalosporins.\n\n【26】Therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections include:\n\n【27】*   Carbapenems such as Ertapenem, Imipenem, and Meropenem.\n\n【28】*   Fluoroquinolones such as Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【29】*   Aminoglycosides such as Gentamicin, Netilmicin, and Amikacin.\n\n【30】*   Fourth-generation Cephems, such as Cefepime and Cefpirome.\n\n【31】Therapeutic agents for C. koseri infections, along with the agents mentioned above, include:\n\n【32】*   Third-generation Cephalosporins and Monobactams like Aztreonam, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin plus Tazobactam are considered first-line drugs for treating C. koseri infections.\n\n【33】*   New oral cephems (Ceftibuten, Cefpodoxime proxetil, Cefixime cefprozil, and Cefetamet pivoxil).\n\n【34】*   In the case of C. koseri meningitis or brain abscess, surgical aspiration and drainage of the abscess should be done, and Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole is used for the treatment. After the treatment, cerebrospinal fluid is monitored until it is sterile using the lumbar puncture technique. In addition, a computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed to monitor any brain abscesses during therapy.\n\n【35】Treatment should be continued until the symptoms resolve, such as negative blood and urine culture, resolving of cough, fever, and sputum in case of pneumonia, no purulent discharge in the wound, and positive wound healing.\n\n【36】How Is Citrobacter Infection Treated for Specific Diseases?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Treatment for specific diseases includes:\n\n【38】*   **Citrobacter Bacteremia**: Citobacter bacteremia is commonly seen in elderly patients associated with comorbidities like intra-abdominal diseases and malignancies, and the leading primary focus is hepatobiliary tract (gallbladder, liver, and bile ducts). A beta-lactam agent and an aminoglycoside are used. The antimicrobial agents should be given until signs and symptoms of infection disappear, such as a negative blood culture and the resolution of fever.\n\n【39】*   **Citrobacter Meningitis**: Third-generation cephalosporin, along with an aminoglycoside, is the treatment of choice. The dosage should be high enough, for example, Cefotaxime 300 milligrams per 2.2 pounds per day, to enter the central nervous system. Antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 21 days should be given to avoid recurrence, and therapy for more than six weeks should be given in case a brain abscess develops after the sterilization of cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Citrobacter infection is a rare and third most common organism causing urinary tract infection and is highly resistant to many antibiotics. These organisms spread through the hands of hospital staff members, environmental sources, or carriers of family members. Infection control measures should be taken to prevent Citrobacter infection, such as washing hands after every procedure, maintaining good hygiene, and maintaining a sterile environment. Treatment should be given until the symptoms resolve, and constant monitoring should be done.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Citrobacter species  \n    http://www.antimicrobe.org/b93.asp\n*   Citrobacter infections in a general hospital: characteristics and outcomes  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18682995/\n*   Antibiotic resistance in Citrobacter spp. isolated from urinary tract infection  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835999/\n*   Clinical Characteristics and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Trends in Citrobacter Bacteremia: An 11-Year Single-Center Experience  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446011/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These diseases are characterized by the formation of cysts in the renal tissues. Acquired cystic kidney disease develops as a result of end-stage renal disease or kidney failure. It is generally seen in people on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【2】The disease is characterized by the development of numerous cystic fluid-filled sacs that do not have a hereditary history. Cysts can be mostly bilateral. When the cyst ruptures, some amount of blood is lost in the urine, causing hematuria. It can affect both children and adults with kidney failure and on dialysis. Kidney failure causes the development of cysts in the kidneys, and the risk of developing cysts increases with the number of years a person is on dialysis. Sometimes the cysts are harmless and require no treatment, whereas in some cases, there may be associated fever and pain.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   The pathology behind cystic development is currently unknown. According to some theories, tubular epithelial hyperplasia from the accumulation of growth factors like the epidermal growth factor can play a role. The acquired cystic kidney disease is characterized by hyperplastic renal cysts. The formation of these cysts is considered to be a source of dialysis-associated renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【5】*   End-stage renal disease resulting in kidney failure, which triggers the development of cysts, can be caused by several triggers, such as diabetes, lupus, heart problems, and urinary tract infections.\n\n【6】*   The chances of acquired cystic kidney disease increase with the length of time the person is on dialysis. However, dialysis does not cause the condition. The disease progression is seen as a consequence of unnaturally increasing the function of the kidneys.\n\n【7】*   Acquired cystic kidney disease can occur in conjunction with any of the following -\n\n【8】1.  Glomerulonephritis (injury to the small filters in the kidneys).\n\n【9】2.  Tubulointerstitial nephritis (inflammation of the spaces between the kidney tubules).\n\n【10】3.  Diabetes mellitus (kidney disease can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus).\n\n【11】4.  Nephrosclerosis (hardening of the blood vessels in the kidney).\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Acquired cystic kidney disease is generally asymptomatic and does not require treatment. But, in some cases, the cysts are associated with pain, fever, and complications that require treatment. The symptoms include -\n\n【14】*   **Hematuria** \\- Loss of blood in the urine due to the rupture of cysts.\n\n【15】*   **Uremia -** Increase the level of urea in the blood due to kidney impairment.\n\n【16】*   **Flank Pain -** Pain in the side of the body is generally associated with the development of cysts.\n\n【17】*   **Fever -** The rupture of the cyst can cause the patient to feel pain and develop a fever.\n\n【18】*   **Reduced Appetite -** Reduced appetite can be due to renal insufficiency.\n\n【19】*   **Anemia -** A decrease in the number of red blood cells can cause anemia.\n\n【20】*   **Weight Loss -** Weight loss occurs due to reduced appetite.\n\n【21】What Are the Complications Associated With Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】1.  **Hemorrhage Into the Cyst -** The cyst develops in the renal cortex and is present bilaterally. When the cyst bursts, it leads to loss of blood which then appears in the urine.\n\n【23】2.  **Development of Renal Carcinoma -** The risk of developing renal carcinoma increases with the length of time a person experiences end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis. The frequency of occurrence is about 7% of the total cases.\n\n【24】How Is Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   **Blood Tests -** To assess normal kidney function.\n\n【26】*   **Urine Tests -** To detect the presence of blood or protein in the urine.\n\n【27】*   **Kidney Ultrasound -** Ultrasound is a safe and non-invasive form of imaging that can provide structural images of the organ. Ultrasonic examination of the kidneys reveals the size of the kidneys as normal or smaller in comparison. For the condition to be classified as acquired cystic kidney disease, the least number of kidney cysts should be five. They generally appear 0.5 cm in diameter. On examination of the renal tissues, the cysts are most commonly found in the renal cortex. The renal cortex is the outer section of the kidney consisting of cortical tissues that contain nephrons. Nephrons are the filtering units of the Kidneys.\n\n【28】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan -** A CT scan provides more details than an ultrasound. It helps in differentiating the presence of renal tumors or cysts.\n\n【29】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** Like CT scans, MRIs help to identify cysts and tumors.\n\n【30】How Is Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease Treated?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】1.  **To Treat Infections -** The development of cysts can cause infection in the body. Antibiotic therapy is prescribed in order to treat the infection.\n\n【32】2.  **To Treat Large Cysts -** Large cysts can be treated without the need for surgery. The physician uses a long needle to reach a certain area and drain the cyst of its liquid. If a kidney cyst ruptures and causes bleeding in the body, surgery needs to be carried out to stop the flow.\n\n【33】3.  **To Treat Cancerous Growth -** Surgery needs to be done in order to remove the cancerous growth developing in the kidneys. Acquired cystic kidney disease has more chances of developing into renal cancer the longer a patient is undergoing dialysis.\n\n【34】4.  **Kidney Transplant -** Renal transplant is the best method to avoid dialysis. The chances of the development of cysts in the kidneys increase with the length of time the patient is on dialysis. In order to avoid dialysis, a kidney transplant needs to be done. The treatment does not involve the removal of the original kidneys but placing the donated kidney in a lower position than normal. However, the cysts that had developed managed to shrink and disappear after a successful transplant procedure.\n\n【35】**Conclusion :**\n\n【36】Acquired cystic kidney disease develops in the later stages of chronic kidney disease and is commonly associated with the initiation of dialysis treatment to filter the blood. Unlike polycystic kidney disease, where the patient feels uncomfortable due to slowly increasing kidneys, an individual with acquired cystic kidney disease is unaware of the cyst developing inside them. A successful kidney transplant procedure performs the functions of a normal kidney. The transplanted kidney is placed in a new position, and the original kidneys remain inside the body. The cyst in the kidneys tends to shrink and disappear after a successful kidney transplant.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Acquired cystic kidney disease: occurrence, prevalence, and renal cancers  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2374506/\n*   Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/acquired-cystic-kidney-disease</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Moreover, there are other abnormalities, such as an extra fold of skin on the limbs along with the short ribs and misproportion of the head and facial features.\n\n【2】This genetic skeletal abnormality is usually divided into two different types.\n\n【3】1.  **Type 1**\\- Shows symptoms like curved thigh bones and a flat spinal cord.\n\n【4】2.  **Type 2**\\- Shows symptoms such as straight thigh bones with the front and both sides of the skull extended abnormally, making it look abnormally large and odd-shaped.\n\n【5】As the disorder is very rare and only recorded in one in 50,000 cases, the prognosis of the syndrome is very poor, as most of the infants born with this condition die shortly after birth.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Thanatophoric Dysplasia?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The condition is primarily caused by a genetic mutation in infants. The gene responsible for the abnormality is essential for regulating the protein, which in turn is important for brain and bone development. The abnormality or mutation in the gene causes the overactivation of the gene, which leads to deformity and disturbance related to bone development. The over-activation of the genes is called a “gain-of-function” mutation.\n\n【8】The disorder is also known to be autosomal dominant, which means the gene is located on any chromosome except the sex chromosomes. The dominant genes are the ones that have only one copy of the mutated gene for an infant to have the disease.\n\n【9】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thanatophoric Dysplasia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】This genetic mutation affects multiple systems and causes the following symptoms:\n\n【11】*   **Dermatological or Skin:**\n\n【12】    *   **Acanthosis Nigricans:** Acanthosis nigricans is a comparatively rare symptom associated with the syndrome, where the part of the neck shows hyperpigmented plaque formation.\n\n【13】*   **Facial:**\n\n【14】    *   **Depressed Nasal Bridge:** It is the classic sign of the disorder where the child has a flat nose.\n\n【15】    *   **Flat Face:** It is one of the very distinctive and frequent symptoms associated with this disorder, in which the absence of concavity or convexity of the face gives it a flat appearance.\n\n【16】    *   **Decreased Midface Size:** The condition shows an underdeveloped face with increased concavity of the face, decreased nasolabial angle, or vertical shortening of the infraorbital and perihilar regions.\n\n【17】*   **Musculoskeletal:**\n\n【18】    *   **Abnormal Metaphysis:** Metaphysis is the area where the epiphysis attaches to the diaphysis. This disorder shows the involvement of one or more metaphyses with the abnormality.\n\n【19】    *   **Macrocephaly:** The children with macrocephaly condition show an abnormally large occipitofrontal (head) circumference.\n\n【20】    *   **Low Muscle Tone:** The abnormally low muscle tone is also known as hypotonia. The muscles in the body have some partial passive movements, even in a state of relaxation. This gives resistance to the passive stretching of the muscles. In the condition of hypotonia, the muscles of the body lose their resistance to passive stretching.\n\n【21】    *   **Cloverleaf Skull:** Children with the disorder occasionally show this symptom. The symptoms have multiple fused sutures (joints) of the skull bones during the developmental phase causing the trilobar (appearance of having three lobes) skull shape.\n\n【22】    *   **Altered Sacroiliac Joint:** The sacroiliac joint is the attachment between the spine and the hip bone. The disorder represents the abnormality of the bone.\n\n【23】    *   **Kyphosis:** Kyphosis is the condition that shows the increased front-to-back curve of the upper spine.\n\n【24】    *   **Hyperflexible Joints:** It is a condition caused by increased flexibility and mobility of muscles and ligaments of the body.\n\n【25】    *   **Hip Dysplasia:** The disorder is associated with abnormally overgrown congenital cell formation seen in the hip area.\n\n【26】*   **Growth and Development:**\n\n【27】    *   **Very Short Limbs:** Children with this condition show abnormally short limbs.\n\n【28】    *   **Narrow Chest:** The physical examination of the newborn shows reduced distance from the sternal notch to the tip of the shoulder. An abnormally narrow chest is another classic sign of the disorder.\n\n【29】    *   **Underdeveloped Lungs:** This is the most frequent condition associated with the syndrome. It is also known as pulmonary hypoplasia, where the development of the lung is inhibited by the condition.\n\n【30】    *   **Deafness:** Children with thanatophoric dysplasia are often seen with this disability due to decreased magnitude of sensory perception of sound.\n\n【31】    *   **Brachydactyly:** It is the condition where the digits appear distinctively short.\n\n【32】    *   **Bulging Eyes:** With this syndrome, the eyes seem to be abnormally protruded in appearance.\n\n【33】    *   **Prenatal Growth Deficiency:** The mutation of the genes hinder the embryonic development of the fetus that shows abnormal signs and symptoms of the disease or syndrome.\n\n【34】    *   **Kidney Abnormalities:** It is a rare condition associated with the syndrome. However, the abnormality of the kidneys can create a new set of complications in children.\n\n【35】*   **Cardiovascular:**\n\n【36】    *   **Respiratory Insufficiency:** The structural abnormality of the heart and the vessels leads to cardiovascular malformation in children that creates respiratory insufficiency.\n\n【37】*   **Neurological or Brain:**\n\n【38】    *   **Hydrocephalus:** Hydrocephalus is the complication associated with the disorder, where there is over-accumulation of the fluid seen in the ventricles of the brain. Although it is the occasional symptom seen in children, the condition can cause many complications related to it. For instance, the condition can cause an extra buildup of pressure inside the brain, causing damage to brain activity.\n\n【39】How to Diagnose Thanatophoric Dysplasia?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【40】There are several ways to diagnose the condition, such as:\n\n【41】*   **Prenatal Ultrasonography:** Usually, if the mother is regularly going with ultrasonography during the second and third trimester, most of the fatal conditions related to the fetus can be revealed. Sometimes, some of the disorders are slightly difficult to diagnose because of their prevalence. Ultrasonography can diagnose the symptoms of the disorder, such as macrocephaly, cloverleaf-shaped skull, ossification of the spine and skull, and abnormally narrow chest cavity.\n\n【42】*   **Postnatal Examination:** As thanatophoric dysplasia represents many easily recognizable symptoms, the postnatal physical examination can be very useful in diagnosing the condition.\n\n【43】*   **Radiographs:** The radiographs show very distinctive abnormalities associated with the syndrome. For instance, the syndrome shows an abnormally narrow thorax, and the ribs appear wide and cupped. The lumbar spine appears flat with vertebral bodies. Above all, the most distinctive feature the radiograph shows is the oddly short phalanges (finger bones), metacarpals (tubular bones between wrist and forelimb), and metatarsals (forefoot bones).\n\n【44】How to Treat Thanatophoric Dysplasia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【45】Due to its severity and involvement in the bony structure of infants, there is no particular cure for this condition. However, the symptoms and signs can be managed with regular follow-up visits. To commence with, pediatricians usually do not suggest vaginal birth in the prenatally diagnosed condition. Also, the very frequent fatal complication newborns are born with is respiratory insufficiency.\n\n【46】Owing to this life-threatening condition, newborns do not live for long. Newborns with the same complication immediately require respiratory support. Additionally, pediatricians can recommend drug therapy, such as antiepileptic drugs, and surgical treatment, such as the placement of shunts to drain excess fluid from the brain.\n\n【47】In the end, due to multi-organ involvement and the severity and progress of the disease, the pediatrician regularly recommends the parents come for follow-up visits.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】Thanatophoric dysplasia is a congenital disorder that is very difficult to manage emotionally for parents and physically for newborns. As the syndrome has a very poor prognosis, the condition requires a great deal of constant medical care. As thanatophoric dysplasia represents myriad and multifaceted fatal symptoms, pediatricians usually suggest terminating the pregnancy if it is diagnosed earlier. On the other hand, in newborns, clinical procedures, diet management, and physical and occupational therapy can help to manage the symptoms.\n\n【50】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【51】* * *\n\n【52】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the LifeSpan of Babies With Thanatophoric Dysplasia?**\n\n【53】Thanatophoric dysplasia is a fatal condition that affects the life expectancy of infants. Infants with this condition usually have a short life span and face death due to respiratory failure. The lifespan of this condition is up to 4 to 5 years.\n\n【54】#### **2.**删除换行**What Makes Thanatophoric Dysplasia Life-Threatening?**\n\n【55】Thanatophoric dysplasia is associated with ventilation-related abnormalities that lead to respiratory system failure. This condition makes it difficult for infants to breathe and survive. Moreover, few infants with this condition might live 4 to 5 years longer but they still have health-related complications during that life span.\n\n【56】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Thanatophoric Dysplasia Curable?**\n\n【57】Thanatophoric dysplasia does not have any cure or possible treatment for it. However, some of the symptoms or complications related to this condition can be managed. For instance, respiratory support may help infants to survive a little longer.\n\n【58】#### **4.**删除换行**Are There Any Neurological Complications Associated WithThanatophoric Dysplasia?**\n\n【59】Thanatophoric dysplasia is a condition that often shows an association with neurological complications. This association is majorly the side effect of bony abnormalities this condition causes. Due to this, conditions such as hydrocephalus ( fluid buildup in the brain), seizures, or suboccipital decompression are seen.\n\n【60】#### **5.**删除换行**Can You Inherit Thanatophoric Dwarfism?**\n\n【61】Yes, Thanatophoric Dwarfism is the result of autosomally dominant genetic mutation. Which means that the condition can run in the family. However, the child should have one copy of the mutated gene from the parents, which means that there is half the chance that a child will inherit this condition.\n\n【62】#### **6.**删除换行**Are There Any Tests Available for Thanatophoric Dysplasia?**\n\n【63】There are many approaches to diagnosing Thanatophoric dysplasia. For instance, genetic testing approaches such as targeted analysis, multi-gene, single-gene testing, or in-utero ultrasound are used as prenatal diagnostic methods for this condition. On the other hand, Radiographic imaging, Computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to examine any complications after birth.\n\n【64】#### **7.**删除换行**Is Skeletal Thanatophoric Dysplasia Manageable in Babies?**\n\n【65】Thanatophoric dysplasia is not a curable condition and there are very thin chances that the baby will survive. However, the condition can be managed by managing the complications associated with it. For instance, respiratory support can help patients with respiratory failure.\n\n【66】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Thanatophoric Dysplasia Caused by Achondroplasia?**\n\n【67】Yes, Thanatophoric dysplasia is either caused by hypochondroplasia or achondroplasia. Which is caused by FGFR3 genetic mutation. However, it is very unusual for the patient to have fatal effects if the condition is caused by achondroplasia.\n\n【68】#### **9.**删除换行**Which Gene Is Responsible for Thanatophoric Dysplasia?**\n\n【69】To have Thanatophoric dysplasia, the infant should have an FGFR3 genetic mutation. This gene plays an essential role in making a protein. This protein is responsible for brain and body tissue maintenance.\n\n【70】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Signs and Symptoms Associated With Skeletal Dysplasia in Babies?**\n\n【71】Babies with skeletal dysplasia have a myriad of symptoms. For instance, short stature, cleft palate, hydrocephalus, and brittle bones. Moreover, they also have the unusual appearance of arms, legs, or trunks.\n\n【72】#### **11.**删除换行**Can You Inherit Thanatophoric Dysplasia?**\n\n【73】Thanatophoric dysplasia is an autosomal dominant genetic mutation. Which means it can be inherited.

{"seq_id": "2d5e7e78-aad6-41d4-ac25-058b9128c8b6", "title": "Perianal Abscesses - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention", "text": "【0】Perianal Abscesses - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】An abscess is the localized collection of infected fluid. A perianal abscess is a condition in which the collection of pus develops near the anus. Anorectal abscesses are subdivided according to their location, and perianal abscesses represent the common type constituting 60 % of the cases. It is a painful condition and can cause discomfort to patients. The terms \"anal abscess\" and \"rectal abscess\" also describe this condition. Anal abscesses are caused by the infection of the anal glands. It can occur over 40 years of age, and adult males are more likely to be affected. The condition can affect infants and toddlers who are still in diapers. They can also cause systemic infection if left untreated.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of a Perianal Abscess?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The following reasons can cause a perianal abscess:\n\n【4】*   An infected anal fissure, tear in the anal canal.\n\n【5】*   Blockage of anal glands.\n\n【6】*   Sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【7】The disease-causing microorganisms include both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. For example, Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from perianal abscesses in patients without diabetes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was the dominant organism found in diabetic patients.\n\n【8】What Are the Risk Factors of Perianal Abscess?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The following factors can increase the risk of perianal abscesses:\n\n【10】*   Inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.\n\n【11】*   Diabetes.\n\n【12】*   Pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n【13】*   Smoking.\n\n【14】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【15】*   Recent chemotherapy.\n\n【16】*   Constipation.\n\n【17】*   Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n【18】*   Use of medications such as Prednisone.\n\n【19】*   Being the recipient partner in anal sex.\n\n【20】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Anal Abscess?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The perianal abscess often appears as painful boil-like swelling near the anus. It is red and warm to the touch. The perianal abscess can occur superficially or deep. Pain in the perianal area is the most common finding.\n\n【22】Superficial anal abscesses are associated with:\n\n【23】*   Constant throbbing pain, which gets worse when sitting down.\n\n【24】*   Swelling, redness, tenderness, and skin irritation around the anus.\n\n【25】*   Pus discharge.\n\n【26】*   Rectal bleeding.\n\n【27】*   Difficulty in urination.\n\n【28】*   Constipation or pain during bowel movements.\n\n【29】*   The infant may be fussy and irritable.\n\n【30】Deep anal abscesses are less common and may be less visible. Deeper anal abscesses are associated with:\n\n【31】*   Fever.\n\n【32】*   Chills.\n\n【33】*   Malaise.\n\n【34】How Can We Diagnose Anal Abscesses?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】Physical examination, including a digital rectal exam, is the primary method to diagnose anal abscesses. A Laboratory blood test usually reveals an elevated white blood cell count. Anoscope is used to look into the anal canal and rectum. Colonoscopy is used in patients with Crohn's disease. A flexible tube with a light is used to examine the large intestine and colon.\n\n【36】Some additional tests are done to screen for the following diseases:\n\n【37】*   Sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【38】*   Inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【39】*   Rectal cancer.\n\n【40】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, and ultrasound are sometimes needed.\n\n【41】What Is the Treatment of Perianal Abscesses?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Surgical incision and drainage of the perianal abscesses are the most common treatment and should be done before the abscess rupture. Surgical drainage has a higher success rate. The abscess sometimes can drain pus on its own and heal without the need for any other treatment. Do not pop or try to drain out the abscess on your own.\n\n【43】A superficial anal abscess is drained using a local anesthetic (1 % Lidocaine) in a doctor's office. Before the local anesthetic injection, Ethylene chloride spray is used to numb the area. Deeper anal abscesses require hospitalization and general anesthesia. Drained abscesses are usually left open and do not require stitches.\n\n【44】Medications are given for pain relief. After the surgical drainage, antibiotics are prescribed for patients with diabetes and immunocompromised patients. Antibiotics are not necessary for healthy adult patients. Patients are advised to use a sitz bath (soak the affected area in warm water) three to four times daily.\n\n【45】Avoid heavy lifting or exercise one week after surgery. It takes about two to three weeks to heal completely. Stool softeners are recommended to reduce the discomfort of bowel movements. Fiber supplements are given to avoid constipation. Some patients are advised to use a gauze pad to prevent the drainage from spoiling the clothes. Appropriate treatment should be done for the associated disorders like diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【46】Complications after the surgery include:\n\n【47】*   Infection.\n\n【48】*   Anal fissure.\n\n【49】*   Scarring.\n\n【50】*   A recurrent abscess.\n\n【51】*   **Anal Fistula:** In one-third of the patients, an anal fistula is found either during or after abscess drainage. An anal fistula is a tunnel that forms from the anal canal to the skin near the anus. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons says that about 50 % of people with abscesses may develop anal fistula, which requires surgery.\n\n【52】An untreated anal abscess can spread to other body parts such as the groin and rectal lumen.\n\n【53】Regular follow-ups should be done until complete healing since the abscesses can recur.\n\n【54】How Are Perianal Abscesses Prevented?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【55】*   Take measures to protect from sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【56】*   Get treated for conditions like Crohn's disease.\n\n【57】*   Maintain good hygiene in the anal area.\n\n【58】*   Clean the anal area and change the diaper frequently in infants and toddlers. In adults, use condoms during anal intercourse. These measures can prevent anal abscesses.\n\n【59】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of a Perianal Abscess?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】The differential diagnosis for a perianal abscess includes:\n\n【61】*   **Hemorrhoids -** Also known as piles (swollen veins in the anus and rectum).\n\n【62】*   **Anal Trauma -** Injury to the tissues of the anus.\n\n【63】*   **Anal Fissure -** Small tear in the lining of the anus.\n\n【64】*   **Anal Fistula -** It is an abnormal connection from the anal canal to the skin near the anus.\n\n【65】*   **Buttocks Abscess -** Boil on buttocks.\n\n【66】*   **Cellulitis -** Serious bacterial skin infection.\n\n【67】*   **Crohn's Disease -** It is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the lining of the digestive tract.\n\n【68】*   **Ulcerative Colitis -** It is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract.\n\n【69】*   Malignancy.\n\n【70】*   Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n【71】**Conclusion:**\n\n【72】With proper treatment, patients with anal abscesses respond well. Infants and toddlers have a quick recovery. Complications occur when the treatment is delayed, but even then, it is treatable. Understanding the risk factors and treating them at the earliest can prevent anal abscesses.\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>*   Abscess and Fistula Expanded Information  \n    https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/abscess-and-fistula-expanded-information\n*   Anorectal Abscess  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anorectal-abscess\n*   Perianal Abscess  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459167/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Aphrodisiacs and Conception\nAphrodisiacs:\n-------------\n\n【1】These are substances used to increase the sexual drive or the sexual ability of the individual. They are mainly desired by males. There is a constant search for aphrodisiacs. Over the centuries, human beings have used extracts of trees, roots, flowers, insects, animal parts, Spanish flies, strychnine, alcohol, and drugs for this purpose. However, according to scientific research, there is no effective aphrodisiac available.\n\n【2】Foreplay:\n---------\n\n【3】The best aphrodisiac can be caring and sharing with partner and foreplay. Foreplay usually should precede intercourse. This stimulates sensitive body parts and makes the partners get into the excitement stage. In addition, it also helps in enhancing vaginal lubrication in women.\n\n【4】The sensitive body areas are different for different individuals. Therefore, the partners have to explore each other to find out the sensitive areas that will lead to sexual excitement. These areas could be the ear lobes, neck, lips, inside skin of the upper arms or thighs, toes, fingertips, soles of the feet, breasts, and genitals. These sensitive areas are called erogenous zones. These areas can be stimulated by stroking, squeezing, tickling, licking, etc.\n\n【5】The partners must communicate and express to each other, such as what is pleasurable to them and what is not. A woman usually takes a longer time to get aroused than a man, so foreplay should take this into consideration. Once both the partners have agreed to have a sexual relationship, then it is the responsibility of each partner to satisfy the needs of the other.

Hence, the period during which the egg and the sperm can unite is limited to about 2 days in a month, around the time of ovulation. It may differ in some women.\n\n【14】*   However, sperms are produced in millions each day, facilitating fertilization since only one sperm is required to fuse with the egg cell. The fusion of the ovum by the sperm is called conception. It normally takes place in the outer part of the fallopian tube.\n\n【15】*   Conception occurs as a result of sexual intercourse. During vaginal intercourse, the erect male penis enters the vagina of the female. Sperms are ejaculated near the cervix of the uterus. The sperms swim from the uterus into the fallopian tube and to the ovum.\n\n【16】*   The head of the sperm enters the ovum and its tail is dropped off. The nuclei of the male and the female cells then fuse to form the zygote. This is called fertilization and leads to conception.\n\n【17】Role of Foreplay in Conception:\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】Lubrication plays an important role in conception, which creates an appropriate atmosphere for the sperm to swim into the uterus through the vagina. It can be obtained by either natural or artificial means. In terms of natural lubrication, lubricating fluid is synthesized by the vaginal glands and the vaginal walls. On the other hand, artificial lubrication is obtained by the use of artificial lubricants, which is not generally advisable while trying to conceive as it can have components that can destroy the sperm or decrease the function of sperm.\n\n【19】The vagina can produce natural lubrication substances to keep itself moist. Two pea-sized glands present on either side of the vaginal walls called the Bartholin’s glands, along with the cervix help in producing the lubricating fluid. These glands produce an increased amount of lubricating fluids when sexually aroused by foreplay.\n\n【20】While trying to conceive, most couples have sexual intercourse with a schedule that might decrease the sexual arousal leading to a dry vagina, which, in turn, poses problems for conception. Also, the stress of not conceiving makes it even more difficult to attain sexual pleasure. This has resulted in decreased intimacy between them leading to failure of conception. Therefore, to increase intimacy and sexual arousal talk with your partner and engage in foreplay as much as you can before having intercourse.\n\n【21】Foreplay helps in increasing the lubrication of the vagina and helps in conception. Having a moist vagina is needed for women, as it does not only makes you feel good but also increases the chance of conception. Better lubrication is essential because it makes the vagina moist, thereby aids in the survival and transport of sperm through the vagina and cervix to reach the uterus. Once the sperm reaches the uterus, depending on the time of the menstrual cycle, the egg will be available for fertilization.\n\n【22】Tips For Foreplay:\n------------------\n\n【23】*   During foreplay if you feel hurt or if it does not produce sexual pleasure, do feel free to convey it to your partner. Any problems with maintaining erection or pain in the vagina during sexual intercourse are a problem of concern and should be medically evaluated.\n\n【24】*   Do not hesitate or feel ashamed to ask your partner to stimulate the erogenous zones.\n\n【25】*   Do not give up while trying for an orgasm, if it takes time. This is especially the case in many women. Stay stimulated with the flow and this will result in an orgasm. Having a negative thought might hamper sexual arousal.\n\n【26】### Conclusion:\n\n【27】The directions for making a new baby are contained in the zygote. So, both partners contribute to the characteristics of the baby. Conception is the physical and physiological process of a sperm fusing with an ovum. Society requires a child to have a father and a mother, not just that they contribute a sperm and an egg cell, but so that they can nurture a child after it is born.\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   Want to Get Pregnant?  \n    https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1767832/afterplay-is-a-must-dont-eat-before-sex-and-make-sure-she-orgasms-7-tips-to-help-you-conceive/\n*   Conception: How It Works  \n    https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception-how-it-works</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
